            <li>I love the Vanicream product line.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I discovered this soap and that Amazon stocks it, because I used to have to special-order it from the pharmacy at a brick and mortar pharmacy.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>It is a healthy soap that I would recommend for anyone trying to use products that are better for us.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s in most soaps and liquid cleansers.</li>
            <li>I figured that if it can be used for infants with eczema and be that gentle and effective, it can do nothing but good for the rest of us.</li>
            <li>I have dermographism and many allergies.  </li>
            <li>My allergist recommend this for my skin issues and it is the best next to Dove.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so I still use and love Dove for body washing.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast arrival.</li>
            <li>I have used some incredibly high priced soaps and this stuff does my skin very nicely.  </li>
            <li>This soap is wonderful for fighting the dry skin itch in winter.  </li>
            <li>This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin, along with VaniCream cream.  </li>
            <li>It worked so great that we switched completely and have been using this bar since then.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product line works great for me and I would recommend it to anyone else who has sensitive skin issues.</li>

            <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This soap is great for those with sensitive skin, and I use it on my face as well.</li>
            <li>Soap works great for my family&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My wife has allergies to perfume smells, and most of the soaps that are available at the retail level have a lot of fragerance to them.</li>
            <li>I love that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>These Vanicream bars are great if you have sensitive skin or if fragrances and chemicals are irritable to your skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Vanicream because it&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find Lowilla anymore, I asked a dermatologist to recommend a replacement after I couldn&#x27;t find anything just right on my own.</li>
            <li>For aftercare From tattoos  doesn&#x27;t irritate skin works extremely well very happy with it</li>
            <li>Other soaps make me itch, this one is perfect for allergy patients.</li>
            <li>I use it full body and let it sit about 5 minutes to exfoliate the top layer of my skin in case the itching is being caused by an irritant that has been deposited on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Loved the Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner, but I still had these incredibly itchy, red patches on my face.</li>
            <li>The soap is fine and I have no problem with it, but the marketing says a \\&quot;a pack of 3\\&quot;, which is just not the case all.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my dermotologist because it leaves no residue or odor and cleans just fine.</li>
            <li>AND WORKS FINE .</li>
            <li>I had almost given up on finding a perfect cleanser, until this little gem came to my rescue.</li>
            <li>This soap is irritant free.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to us by my son&#x27;s allergist and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>i also am using vanicream light lotion and cream.  </li>
            <li>Eczema.[[ASIN:B0001EKWPI Vanicream Cleansing Bar, Fragrance Free, 3.9 Ounce Bars (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li>Bought fragrance free-</li>
            <li>Great facial moisturizing bar.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice soap - very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Filled with hydrocortisone.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This is good soap for anyone with sensitive skin, which I have battled all my life.  </li>
            <li>Good product for allergy sensitive people.</li>
            <li>This bar soap is nice and moisturizing, lathers very well, and rinses cleanly without any residue.</li>
            <li>I then use the an anti-fungal soap called PediFix FungaSoap Liquid - it has a strong smell that might turn some off, but I use it in case I am having a mild yeast or bacterial type of reaction in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Even though it costs two to three times more as most bars from the drug store, it&#x27;s very soft and leaves you squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vanicream was originally recommended to use by our son&#x27;s pediatrician for his eczema.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for a long time until I noticed a rash all over my body.  </li>
            <li>And everything is kid friendly, another perk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use the lite lotion for a super fine veil of moisture wherever I need it.</li>
            <li>This line was recommended by my dermatologist after having problems with Cetaphil and many other excellent sensitive skin products.</li>
            <li>It is especially good for those who wash their face twice a day and have sensitive  facial skin.</li>
            <li>I could use it to wash my hair instead of shampoo as it rinses out cleanly with no residue.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin or eczema</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate or clog pores and skin is clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean and not like it has a film like some soaps do.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product especially for those with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too drying but leaves you feeling really clean-</li>
            <li>my sensitive, acne-prone facial skin in the best shape ever.  </li>
            <li>I got this at my dermatologist recommendation and it keeps my skin clean and moisturized as they said it would.</li>
            <li>you just feel wonderfully clean.....</li>
            <li>He says that he still feels clean without the fragrance smell.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and it is able to rid my body of the scents of the stronger cleansers...</li>
            <li>I love this bar, my kids have very sentitive skin</li>
            <li>You can believe all of the praise for this &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Prefer the cleansing lotion, but not always economical or available.  </li>
            <li>Received the full sized bar today and just washed with it.  </li>
            <li>The full sized bar has a rancid scent that the sample bar did not have.  </li>
            <li>No bad smell.</li>
            <li>Other products from this line are great as well.</li>
            <li>The first night she slept fine without scratching or waking.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so mild</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Melts&#x27; quickly like ivory soap.</li>
            <li>A mild cleansing bar.</li>
            <li>So mild..</li>
            <li>Between the soap and the cream/lotion, my skin has improved tremendously--</li>
            <li>love how soft and comfortable my skin feels and fer cleansing.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this as equal to or even better than Cetaphil, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend ,quick shipping,easy to order</li>
            <li>First of all, this soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This bar soap DOES have an odor to it, so it may not be suitable for folks who are extremely sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li>In fact the entire Vanicream line and its companion Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner are excellent for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The price was/is reasonable for a specialty soap, and, of course, Amazon did its usual wonderful job of stocking and shipping the item.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face (allergies/excema) and I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li>Went back to using the trader joes oatmeal soap and I love it!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!!</li>
            <li>A little bit of adult acne cream along with this soap and moisturizer and I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look so great ever!</li>
            <li>And in between, I use this soap and maybe the oil to keep my skin calm.  </li>
            <li>And in between, I use this soap and maybe the oil to keep my skin calm.  </li>
            <li>This soap is fragrance free and lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>This soap is $3.99 in Walgreen,I just started using it and it makes my face feel so fresh</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you have mixed and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The transaction went flawlessly, completely complementing my satisfaction with the product - a great total package.    </li>
            <li>I love these bars of soap for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying these unscented bars so far.</li>
            <li>The money is well worth the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth the price and would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>Never have to worry because of my sensitive skin and eczema with this product, love it~~</li>
            <li>happy with the product, wanted to try something new for dry skin</li>
            <li>It is a mild soap meant for gentle skin, but I think it has a mild scent - it does not smell perfumy at all, though.  </li>
            <li>She gave me a sample of Vanicream (the cleansing bar), and it was just right.</li>
            <li>It has just the right balance of cleansing power and moisture.</li>
            <li>I have been searching forever for some TRUE FREE AND CLEAR soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin that dries out easily.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, my allergist recommended it and I am glad I broke down and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Great bar soap for sensitive and dry skin!</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice large size that will last for months.  </li>
            <li>I have an allergy to additives in most common Soap and this Soap is free of all that stuff and still provides a rich clean experience in the shower.</li>
            <li>When I asked my dermitologist about my dry skin condition, he asked me what kind of soap I used.  </li>
            <li>I get migraines triggered by perfume and not only is this soap fragrance free, but it is free of masking fragrances as well (the \\&quot;Pharmaceutical Specialties\\&quot; brand is known for that).  </li>
            <li>The cream lathers easily and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>Lathers beautifully, but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>soap is super gentle without being drying.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, and mostly clear after using this product!</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on skin with no dyes or perfumes.</li>
            <li>Washing with this soap gives my body that same clean really clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and my face really feels clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap a couple of weeks ago, because my face was getting pretty irritated after I washed it.</li>
            <li>We also use the Free and Clear Shampoo made by Pharmaceutical Specialties.</li>
            <li>I have a fragrance and surfactant contact allergy and Vanicream is the only safe products on the market for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I did this the first time around, but then did a search on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately one of their affiliates, the DermStore, offers it priced competively and delivered to your door.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fancy this much!</li>
            <li>these episodes is direct sun light...</li>
            <li>what sets my skin off, but I have a pretty decent arsenal of \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; stuff to quickly start dealing with the situation.  </li>
            <li>what sets my skin off, but I have a pretty decent arsenal of \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; stuff to quickly start dealing with the situation.  </li>
            <li>Great lather, long lasting, no scent, no visible improvement with my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>I love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers and I always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li>I first started using this product when my husband had surgery at the Mayo Hospital in Phoenix.  </li>
            <li>is the ONLY thing I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;irritate</li>
            <li>This is the only soap we have been able to use on our daughter without her getting a rash.</li>
            <li>It prevents my face from becoming too dry but gets it clean.</li>
            <li>This really helped my son&#x27;s acne!</li>
            <li>Without this exact type of soap our skin dries out like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s exactly what he was hoping to find.</li>
            <li>These bars are truly fragrance free, as well, so if you are sensitive to scents, you don&#x27;t need to worry with this product.</li>
            <li>THE ONLY THING MAKE SURE TO KEEP IT ON A SOAP GRILL IN THE DISH</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth with almost no breakouts.</li>
            <li>Acceptable substitute for my favorite bar soap - French Chef&#x27;s Soap, which isn&#x27;t imported to the US anymore.</li>
            <li>My skiing overall seems to be more moist.</li>
            <li>I was buying the Zum and similiar soaps with essential oils, but I like this even better.</li>
            <li>The suds are very gentle on my skin but they are powerful enough to remove dirt and oils easily.</li>
            <li>Previously I used Cetaphil facial cleanser (which was very good</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and provides the right amount of lubrication for shaving.  </li>
            <li>After my first use, I was surprised how clean I felt - even at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>With my now sensitive skin, I feel clean</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li>but was getting more and more dry each day while swimming daily in a chlorinated pool)-</li>
            <li>I was getting red blotches on my cheeks,so I wanted to try something more gentle.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle that I often use it on my face, which is the most hypersensitive part of my entire body.</li>
            <li>but at the same time can clean your face very very well!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and I also use a high quality calendula oil, cream or lotion after bath or before towel drying to moisturize and calm my skin.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and I also use a high quality calendula oil, cream or lotion after bath or before towel drying to moisturize and calm my skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it clean make-up off the face, you can rinse the make-up stains out of the wash cloth!  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times it happened, my routine would also include a soak in RID, in case the itching was being caused by some unseen parasite, but it did absolutely nothing to stop the itching</li>

            <li>Not awesome at removing all of my eye makeup, but the lather is great and I always feel clean, never squeaky, after I use</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep it stored in a dry place.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it and works well to remove makeup (even eye makeup without being super drying).</li>
            <li>Got super sensitive skin?  </li>
            <li>It was touted by my doctor as the new standard in skincare for people like me :)    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell, however, since I now use it on more areas of skin because it does help my dry skin condition.  </li>
            <li>I have used Vanicream cleansing bar on my very dry, sensitive skin now for about 6 months, and the improvement in the texture and sensitivity is amazing.</li>
            <li>I just love this soap, to bad it doesn&#x27;t come as a body wash, I&#x27;d love it even more.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, it even removes eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and calms my back acne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap also last me a couple months.</li>
            <li>She has always been more careful about skin care.  </li>
            <li>and it lathers up very well.</li>
            <li>The oil alone will help the itching stop temporarily; but whatever is causing the itching does not go away until I go through the whole routine two or three times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Glyderm Gentle Cleanser  </li>
            <li>The oil alone will help the itching stop temporarily; but whatever is causing the itching does not go away until I go through the whole routine two or three times.  </li>
            <li>Glyderm Gentle Cleanser  </li>
            <li>This product, which I&#x27;ve used for 3 months leaves my skin clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>But oh how I miss fragrance and the feel of \\&quot;real soap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and this soap is gentle and non-drying on my skin.</li>
            <li>Our son is almost 2 now and is eczema free since we starting using Vanicream!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works very well for kids with any rashes.</li>
            <li>I really like using this cleansing bar.</li>
            <li>This bar of soap sits very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>I do not suffer from eczema, but I now use this soap for everything (body, face, and hands) because it&#x27;s so gentle on the skin and</li>
            <li>It cleans really well too.</li>
            <li>He said this soap really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup yet is not irritating, moisturizes but is not pore clogging.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, but really works.  </li>
            <li>I really should figure out which but haven&#x27;t really needed to use them.</li>
            <li>A reasonable price for 3 bars.</li>
            <li>BUT, this soap  and the Vanicream Moisturizing Cream he recommended really work.  </li>
            <li>so probably won&#x27;t be purchasing again since I just don&#x27;t see much difference between the two products.</li>
            <li>I have been using the cleansing bar, the light lotion during the day and the regular lotion at night for just over a month, maybe six weeks.</li>
            <li>Skin was very itchy before switching to this cleansing bar.</li>
            <li>skin is very prone to redness and this soap helps to keep that under control.</li>
            <li>thanks to my dermatologist for the recommendation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonable priced too.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>or we run out fast.</li>
            <li>None of the prescription creams seemed to have much of an effect.</li>
            <li>Have issues with sensitive skin on my eyelids and solved with Free &amp; Clear products (shampoo and their Vanicream soap)</li>
            <li>paid the ultimate price (i.e. it is now more sensitive and irritated than ever).</li>
            <li>A couple of months ago, I started getting eczema-like patches on my face near my hairline(!!!)</li>
            <li>Very pure and recommended for sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>will be buying more of this brand in their other products.</li>
            <li>Even though my skin is much better now, I still prefer Vanicream bar and moisturizing lotion to other products.</li>
            <li>Not only that but after using it my skin feels clean.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use it for my face, so a bar lasts a long time if I keep it from sitting in water.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you get a good deal on Amazon, but this soap is not a good deal.</li>
            <li>Have been using this particular brand of soap for some time now.</li>
            <li>What on earth is in this particular bar that wasn&#x27;t in my physician&#x27;s sample???  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone that suffers&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
            <li>We both think this product deserves high praise.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Also the soap contains no parades to which my skin is highly allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was highly recommended by my allergist.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the soap, lite lotion, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to so easily find a soap that does not contain MI (methylisothiazonolone)a chemical to which many people are violently allergic.  </li>
            <li>Most soaps bother me due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i love this soap, leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean without drying it out or irritating it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful cream bar for bad skin.</li>
            <li>I had used Lowilla to clean my face since I was a teenager because I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Vanicream is very for sensitive skin and lathes like normal soap.</li>
            <li>I have an inflammatory type of rosacea and had tried all of the products that are advertised as gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing soap I use on my 2 year old with eczema.</li>
            <li>This cleaning bar is gentle on my sensitive skin and helps me ward off dermititis.  </li>
            <li>I normally apply all day.  </li>
            <li>This has pretty much completely eradicated my son&#x27;s eczema and my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I found out that they had changed the ingredients, and one of the new ingredients they added is something I&#x27;m highly allergic to (Glyceryl Monothioglycolate).  </li>
            <li>My kids and I have super sensitive skin and even Aveeno was starting to break us out.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I will ever purchase for those in my family with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It breaks down easily.</li>
            <li>So much better than ordinary Dial soap, and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Well ya live</li>
            <li>Fragrance is the new Gluten.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product, recommended to me by my dermatologist who gets how crazy my skin is and is very knowledgeable of all new stuff out there.</li>
            <li>it cleans well, is mild and seems to last pretty long.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin and this soap works well for him.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm for cleansing my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin I highly recommend you try the Vanicream cleansing bar.</li>
            <li>I have been using Vanicream Cleansing Bar for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My Dr got me on to this for my skin which is very sensitive......</li>
            <li>This is my go-to soap for bathing, as I have very, very, VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The labels are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>They leave your skin feeling so soft!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and want to be clean and feel clean and help your skin to be less dry, this soap is for you.</li>
            <li>one issue is that I have Allergic Contact Dermatitis and this was one of very few bar soaps I was able to use, as instructed by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Not sure this is any better than sensitive skin DOVE soap formula I&#x27;ve been using for over 30 years.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely allergic to pretty much everything (including cocao -</li>
            <li>Vanicream is a great all natural soap, a little expensive, but worth it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use three different products - Glyderm gentle cleanser (a face cleanser with glycolic acid meant for sensitive skin) -</li>
            <li>If you need a soap that is gentle enough for sensitive skin this one has worked well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>cannot believe how SOFT my skin is after using this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now (actually the whole family uses it).  </li>
            <li>Of the cleansers meant for sensitive skin, it is the one that I prefer in terms of scent and how my skin feels afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DUTHYsers meant for sensitive skin, it is the one that I prefer in terms of scent and how my skin feels afterward.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got incredibly sensitive skin, and everything makes me break out.</li>
            <li>It does seem to work for me as far as controlling itch and reactions.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this and so far it seems to help.</li>
            <li>Our son got Eczema when he was about 3 months old.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended I use it because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Son has sensitive skin and prone to flare ups.  </li>
            <li>We have used it since the dermatologist recommended it when she was 3 months old.</li>
            <li>Surprised me how well it moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and have fought acne always.  </li>
            <li>It seems that I have developed an allergic reaction to either salicylate or benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and prone to rashes</li>
            <li>unscented, creamy and rinses off completely.</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne prone skin that has been haunting me for nearly a decade.</li>
            <li>and I often go without makeup with no feeling of insecurities because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li>baking soda + corn starch in bath water, Johnson &amp; Johnson all natural, etc.</li>
            <li>, I completely changed to Vanicream and never regretted it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It has no fragrance as it is meant for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I was young we camped in the Adirondack Mts.</li>
            <li>It cleanses well, leaving my skin soft and not irritated.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Only brand I can really use.</li>
            <li>But her skin is not as sensitive as mine.</li>
            <li>This soap was recommended by my dermatologists as I have sensitive skin and am prone to contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li>grreat for people who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with sensitive, allergic skin and rosacea for years, and had given up on washing my face altogether</li>
            <li>Whether you have sensitive skin or not, these bars are the way to go.</li>
            <li>This dopa is all I use for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Suds up and no fragrances or issues with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use this along with the Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream with Pump once a day, and witch hazel twice a day as a natural toner/blemish control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and don&#x27;t have acne, but do have dry skin most of the year round and Vanicream cleanses without stripping or making my skin feel drier.</li>
            <li>The bar lasts a very long time and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>it also leaves my skin feeling clean, but neither tight or slippery.  </li>
            <li>Just plain clean and soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>There is not any particular redness or rash, with the exception of where I have scratched and the only thing that seems to cause an immediate reaction during one</li>
            <li>Very easy on the skin and does not leave a film behind.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with non-soap cleansing bars, which I purchased for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>The fragrance free Vanicream doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, but another bar I tried was equally gentle and had even less odor, so it won by a small margin.  </li>
            <li>The item itself works great, however, it has a very weird odor.  </li>
            <li>I have changed my laundry soap, and gone to gentler cleansers and been careful around cleaning products, but I have not ever figured out exactly what it is that sets my skin into what I guess is a type of flair-up.  </li>
            <li>Works very well with my very dry, sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has really helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I really like using this to wash my face with this bar since it doesnt leave me with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing for extremely dry itchy eczema.</li>
            <li>I only wish that I had found it when I was a very embarassed teen!</li>
            <li>, I never saw symptoms of such, but by the time you itch that long for no apparent reason; you really are ready to try anything to just make it</li>

            <li>Vanicream is not as hard milled as the popular soap brands ... probably doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>and I surmised that my itching is not due to any type of body lice or pest.  </li>
            <li>and I surmised that my itching is not due to any type of body lice or pest.  </li>
            <li>that it is slick and suds like soap, rinses cleanly, isn&#x27;t overly drying.</li>
            <li>He is still getting used to the fact that it has no fragrance in it because that usually triggers for him a clean feeling when he can smell the scent of the soap on him.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the only products that helps clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream is the only soap that has touched this face for years, it was recommended by my dermatologist to use as a part of a skin care regimen to help clear up my acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s only 2 months old and we&#x27;re using all these chemicals on her?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am 32 years old and have had eczema my entire life.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I can use for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tried Cetaphil (regular and eczema lines), Eucerin, Cerave, Aquaphor, Dove sensitive and unscented, 100% organic baby oil,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap that does not dry out my skin and keeps my complexion clear.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the bars disappear VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>For the past 20+ years, I&#x27;ve had a slew of dermatologists diagnose my mildly rashy, itchy skin as one thing or another.</li>
            <li>A little expensive, but these are great for people with skin allergies.</li>
            <li>At last I&#x27;ve found a cleansing bar that is non-irritating for older, dry skin with Rosacea.</li>
            <li>I get no eczema with Vanicream and my skin does not dry out.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>The soap is hard, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, although what you can smell is not unpleasant, but get it wet</li>
            <li>Since he started using this his scalp has changed from very rough and dull to shiny and very smooth.</li>
            <li>A little more expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s rich and creamy, 1 bar will last for at least 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I get slightly better results using the bar directly onto my skin, but it&#x27;s difficult to do one&#x27;s back without a close friend or spouse!  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and live in the SW, causing my skin to be even drier.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended Vanicream lotion and soap as my main products as a skin &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; due to allergic reactions I was having to just about all health and beauty products.  </li>
            <li>but I find it lasts much longer than a typical bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Now, the full sized bars can be ordered through Walgreens (at least my local Walgreens doesn&#x27;t carry it routinely).  </li>
            <li>Same answer as above for their sunscreen: pure, less ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Especially since I have extremely sensitive dry skin.  </li>

            <li> I love the Vanicream product line.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered this soap and that Amazon stocks it, because I used to have to special-order it from the pharmacy at a brick and mortar pharmacy.</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s in most soaps and liquid cleansers.</li>
            <li> I figured that if it can be used for infants with eczema and be that gentle and effective, it can do nothing but good for the rest of us.</li>
            <li> I have dermographism and many allergies.  </li>
            <li> My allergist recommend this for my skin issues and it is the best next to Dove.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> so I still use and love Dove for body washing.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast arrival.</li>
            <li> I have used some incredibly high priced soaps and this stuff does my skin very nicely.  </li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for fighting the dry skin itch in winter.  </li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin, along with VaniCream cream.  </li>
            <li> It worked so great that we switched completely and have been using this bar since then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people with sensitive skin</li>

            <li> Soap works great for my family&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My wife has allergies to perfume smells, and most of the soaps that are available at the retail level have a lot of fragerance to them.</li>
            <li> I love that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> These Vanicream bars are great if you have sensitive skin or if fragrances and chemicals are irritable to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I love Vanicream because it&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find Lowilla anymore, I asked a dermatologist to recommend a replacement after I couldn&#x27;t find anything just right on my own.</li>
            <li> For aftercare From tattoos  doesn&#x27;t irritate skin works extremely well very happy with it</li>
            <li> Other soaps make me itch, this one is perfect for allergy patients.</li>
            <li> I use it full body and let it sit about 5 minutes to exfoliate the top layer of my skin in case the itching is being caused by an irritant that has been deposited on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Loved the Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner, but I still had these incredibly itchy, red patches on my face.</li>
            <li> The soap is fine and I have no problem with it, but the marketing says a \\&quot;a pack of 3\\&quot;, which is just not the case all.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermotologist because it leaves no residue or odor and cleans just fine.</li>
            <li> AND WORKS FINE .</li>
            <li> I had almost given up on finding a perfect cleanser, until this little gem came to my rescue.</li>
            <li> This soap is irritant free.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended to us by my son&#x27;s allergist and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> i also am using vanicream light lotion and cream.  </li>
            <li> Eczema.[[ASIN:B0001EKWPI Vanicream Cleansing Bar, Fragrance Free, 3.9 Ounce Bars (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> Bought fragrance free-</li>
            <li> Great facial moisturizing bar.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice soap - very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Filled with hydrocortisone.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is good soap for anyone with sensitive skin, which I have battled all my life.  </li>
            <li> Good product for allergy sensitive people.</li>
            <li> This bar soap is nice and moisturizing, lathers very well, and rinses cleanly without any residue.</li>
            <li> I then use the an anti-fungal soap called PediFix FungaSoap Liquid - it has a strong smell that might turn some off, but I use it in case I am having a mild yeast or bacterial type of reaction in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Even though it costs two to three times more as most bars from the drug store, it&#x27;s very soft and leaves you squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vanicream was originally recommended to use by our son&#x27;s pediatrician for his eczema.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for a long time until I noticed a rash all over my body.  </li>
            <li> And everything is kid friendly, another perk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use the lite lotion for a super fine veil of moisture wherever I need it.</li>
            <li> This line was recommended by my dermatologist after having problems with Cetaphil and many other excellent sensitive skin products.</li>
            <li> It is especially good for those who wash their face twice a day and have sensitive  facial skin.</li>
            <li> I could use it to wash my hair instead of shampoo as it rinses out cleanly with no residue.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin or eczema</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate or clog pores and skin is clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> Skin feels clean and not like it has a film like some soaps do.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product especially for those with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too drying but leaves you feeling really clean-</li>
            <li> my sensitive, acne-prone facial skin in the best shape ever.  </li>
            <li> I got this at my dermatologist recommendation and it keeps my skin clean and moisturized as they said it would.</li>
            <li> you just feel wonderfully clean.....</li>
            <li> He says that he still feels clean without the fragrance smell.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and it is able to rid my body of the scents of the stronger cleansers...</li>
            <li> I love this bar, my kids have very sentitive skin</li>
            <li> You can believe all of the praise for this &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Prefer the cleansing lotion, but not always economical or available.  </li>
            <li> Received the full sized bar today and just washed with it.  </li>
            <li> The full sized bar has a rancid scent that the sample bar did not have.  </li>
            <li> No bad smell.</li>
            <li> Other products from this line are great as well.</li>
            <li> The first night she slept fine without scratching or waking.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so mild</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Melts&#x27; quickly like ivory soap.</li>
            <li> A mild cleansing bar.</li>
            <li> So mild..</li>
            <li> Between the soap and the cream/lotion, my skin has improved tremendously--</li>
            <li> love how soft and comfortable my skin feels and fer cleansing.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this as equal to or even better than Cetaphil, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend ,quick shipping,easy to order</li>
            <li> First of all, this soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This bar soap DOES have an odor to it, so it may not be suitable for folks who are extremely sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li> In fact the entire Vanicream line and its companion Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner are excellent for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The price was/is reasonable for a specialty soap, and, of course, Amazon did its usual wonderful job of stocking and shipping the item.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face (allergies/excema) and I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> Went back to using the trader joes oatmeal soap and I love it!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!</li>
            <li> A little bit of adult acne cream along with this soap and moisturizer and I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look so great ever!</li>
            <li> And in between, I use this soap and maybe the oil to keep my skin calm.  </li>
            <li> And in between, I use this soap and maybe the oil to keep my skin calm.  </li>
            <li> This soap is fragrance free and lathers very well.  </li>
            <li> This soap is $3.99 in Walgreen,I just started using it and it makes my face feel so fresh</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have mixed and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The transaction went flawlessly, completely complementing my satisfaction with the product - a great total package.    </li>
            <li> I love these bars of soap for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying these unscented bars so far.</li>
            <li> The money is well worth the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worth the price and would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Never have to worry because of my sensitive skin and eczema with this product, love it~~</li>
            <li> happy with the product, wanted to try something new for dry skin</li>
            <li> It is a mild soap meant for gentle skin, but I think it has a mild scent - it does not smell perfumy at all, though.  </li>
            <li> She gave me a sample of Vanicream (the cleansing bar), and it was just right.</li>
            <li> It has just the right balance of cleansing power and moisture.</li>
            <li> I have been searching forever for some TRUE FREE AND CLEAR soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin that dries out easily.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, my allergist recommended it and I am glad I broke down and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Great bar soap for sensitive and dry skin!</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice large size that will last for months.  </li>
            <li> I have an allergy to additives in most common Soap and this Soap is free of all that stuff and still provides a rich clean experience in the shower.</li>
            <li> When I asked my dermitologist about my dry skin condition, he asked me what kind of soap I used.  </li>
            <li> I get migraines triggered by perfume and not only is this soap fragrance free, but it is free of masking fragrances as well (the \\&quot;Pharmaceutical Specialties\\&quot; brand is known for that).  </li>
            <li> The cream lathers easily and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> Lathers beautifully, but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> soap is super gentle without being drying.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, and mostly clear after using this product!</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on skin with no dyes or perfumes.</li>
            <li> Washing with this soap gives my body that same clean really clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and my face really feels clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap a couple of weeks ago, because my face was getting pretty irritated after I washed it.</li>
            <li> We also use the Free and Clear Shampoo made by Pharmaceutical Specialties.</li>
            <li> I have a fragrance and surfactant contact allergy and Vanicream is the only safe products on the market for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did this the first time around, but then did a search on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately one of their affiliates, the DermStore, offers it priced competively and delivered to your door.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fancy this much!</li>
            <li> these episodes is direct sun light...</li>
            <li> what sets my skin off, but I have a pretty decent arsenal of \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; stuff to quickly start dealing with the situation.  </li>
            <li> what sets my skin off, but I have a pretty decent arsenal of \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; stuff to quickly start dealing with the situation.  </li>
            <li> Great lather, long lasting, no scent, no visible improvement with my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers and I always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I first started using this product when my husband had surgery at the Mayo Hospital in Phoenix.  </li>
            <li> is the ONLY thing I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;irritate</li>
            <li> This is the only soap we have been able to use on our daughter without her getting a rash.</li>
            <li> It prevents my face from becoming too dry but gets it clean.</li>
            <li> This really helped my son&#x27;s acne!</li>
            <li> Without this exact type of soap our skin dries out like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s exactly what he was hoping to find.</li>
            <li> These bars are truly fragrance free, as well, so if you are sensitive to scents, you don&#x27;t need to worry with this product.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY THING MAKE SURE TO KEEP IT ON A SOAP GRILL IN THE DISH</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth with almost no breakouts.</li>
            <li> Acceptable substitute for my favorite bar soap - French Chef&#x27;s Soap, which isn&#x27;t imported to the US anymore.</li>
            <li> My skiing overall seems to be more moist.</li>
            <li> I was buying the Zum and similiar soaps with essential oils, but I like this even better.</li>
            <li> The suds are very gentle on my skin but they are powerful enough to remove dirt and oils easily.</li>
            <li> Previously I used Cetaphil facial cleanser (which was very good</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and provides the right amount of lubrication for shaving.  </li>
            <li> After my first use, I was surprised how clean I felt - even at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> With my now sensitive skin, I feel clean</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> but was getting more and more dry each day while swimming daily in a chlorinated pool)-</li>
            <li> I was getting red blotches on my cheeks,so I wanted to try something more gentle.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle that I often use it on my face, which is the most hypersensitive part of my entire body.</li>
            <li> but at the same time can clean your face very very well!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and I also use a high quality calendula oil, cream or lotion after bath or before towel drying to moisturize and calm my skin.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and I also use a high quality calendula oil, cream or lotion after bath or before towel drying to moisturize and calm my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it clean make-up off the face, you can rinse the make-up stains out of the wash cloth!  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times it happened, my routine would also include a soak in RID, in case the itching was being caused by some unseen parasite, but it did absolutely nothing to stop the itching</li>

            <li> Not awesome at removing all of my eye makeup, but the lather is great and I always feel clean, never squeaky, after I use</li>
            <li> Be sure to keep it stored in a dry place.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it and works well to remove makeup (even eye makeup without being super drying).</li>
            <li> Got super sensitive skin?  </li>
            <li> It was touted by my doctor as the new standard in skincare for people like me :)    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell, however, since I now use it on more areas of skin because it does help my dry skin condition.  </li>
            <li> I have used Vanicream cleansing bar on my very dry, sensitive skin now for about 6 months, and the improvement in the texture and sensitivity is amazing.</li>
            <li> I just love this soap, to bad it doesn&#x27;t come as a body wash, I&#x27;d love it even more.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, it even removes eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and calms my back acne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap also last me a couple months.</li>
            <li> She has always been more careful about skin care.  </li>
            <li> and it lathers up very well.</li>
            <li> The oil alone will help the itching stop temporarily; but whatever is causing the itching does not go away until I go through the whole routine two or three times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Glyderm Gentle Cleanser  </li>
            <li> The oil alone will help the itching stop temporarily; but whatever is causing the itching does not go away until I go through the whole routine two or three times.  </li>
            <li> Glyderm Gentle Cleanser  </li>
            <li> This product, which I&#x27;ve used for 3 months leaves my skin clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> But oh how I miss fragrance and the feel of \\&quot;real soap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and this soap is gentle and non-drying on my skin.</li>
            <li> Our son is almost 2 now and is eczema free since we starting using Vanicream!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works very well for kids with any rashes.</li>
            <li> I really like using this cleansing bar.</li>
            <li> This bar of soap sits very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> I do not suffer from eczema, but I now use this soap for everything (body, face, and hands) because it&#x27;s so gentle on the skin and</li>
            <li> It cleans really well too.</li>
            <li> He said this soap really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup yet is not irritating, moisturizes but is not pore clogging.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, but really works.  </li>
            <li> I really should figure out which but haven&#x27;t really needed to use them.</li>
            <li> A reasonable price for 3 bars.</li>
            <li> BUT, this soap  and the Vanicream Moisturizing Cream he recommended really work.  </li>
            <li> so probably won&#x27;t be purchasing again since I just don&#x27;t see much difference between the two products.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cleansing bar, the light lotion during the day and the regular lotion at night for just over a month, maybe six weeks.</li>
            <li> Skin was very itchy before switching to this cleansing bar.</li>
            <li> skin is very prone to redness and this soap helps to keep that under control.</li>
            <li> thanks to my dermatologist for the recommendation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonable priced too.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> or we run out fast.</li>
            <li> None of the prescription creams seemed to have much of an effect.</li>
            <li> Have issues with sensitive skin on my eyelids and solved with Free &amp; Clear products (shampoo and their Vanicream soap)</li>
            <li> paid the ultimate price (i.e. it is now more sensitive and irritated than ever).</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago, I started getting eczema-like patches on my face near my hairline(!!!)</li>
            <li> Very pure and recommended for sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> will be buying more of this brand in their other products.</li>
            <li> Even though my skin is much better now, I still prefer Vanicream bar and moisturizing lotion to other products.</li>
            <li> Not only that but after using it my skin feels clean.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use it for my face, so a bar lasts a long time if I keep it from sitting in water.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get a good deal on Amazon, but this soap is not a good deal.</li>
            <li> Have been using this particular brand of soap for some time now.</li>
            <li> What on earth is in this particular bar that wasn&#x27;t in my physician&#x27;s sample???  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone that suffers&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
            <li> We both think this product deserves high praise.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Also the soap contains no parades to which my skin is highly allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by my allergist.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the soap, lite lotion, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to so easily find a soap that does not contain MI (methylisothiazonolone)a chemical to which many people are violently allergic.  </li>
            <li> Most soaps bother me due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i love this soap, leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean without drying it out or irritating it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream bar for bad skin.</li>
            <li> I had used Lowilla to clean my face since I was a teenager because I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is very for sensitive skin and lathes like normal soap.</li>
            <li> I have an inflammatory type of rosacea and had tried all of the products that are advertised as gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing soap I use on my 2 year old with eczema.</li>
            <li> This cleaning bar is gentle on my sensitive skin and helps me ward off dermititis.  </li>
            <li> I normally apply all day.  </li>
            <li> This has pretty much completely eradicated my son&#x27;s eczema and my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I found out that they had changed the ingredients, and one of the new ingredients they added is something I&#x27;m highly allergic to (Glyceryl Monothioglycolate).  </li>
            <li> My kids and I have super sensitive skin and even Aveeno was starting to break us out.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I will ever purchase for those in my family with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It breaks down easily.</li>
            <li> So much better than ordinary Dial soap, and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Well ya live</li>
            <li> Fragrance is the new Gluten.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product, recommended to me by my dermatologist who gets how crazy my skin is and is very knowledgeable of all new stuff out there.</li>
            <li> it cleans well, is mild and seems to last pretty long.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and this soap works well for him.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm for cleansing my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin I highly recommend you try the Vanicream cleansing bar.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream Cleansing Bar for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My Dr got me on to this for my skin which is very sensitive......</li>
            <li> This is my go-to soap for bathing, as I have very, very, VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The labels are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> They leave your skin feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and want to be clean and feel clean and help your skin to be less dry, this soap is for you.</li>
            <li> one issue is that I have Allergic Contact Dermatitis and this was one of very few bar soaps I was able to use, as instructed by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Not sure this is any better than sensitive skin DOVE soap formula I&#x27;ve been using for over 30 years.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely allergic to pretty much everything (including cocao -</li>
            <li> Vanicream is a great all natural soap, a little expensive, but worth it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use three different products - Glyderm gentle cleanser (a face cleanser with glycolic acid meant for sensitive skin) -</li>
            <li> If you need a soap that is gentle enough for sensitive skin this one has worked well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> cannot believe how SOFT my skin is after using this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now (actually the whole family uses it).  </li>
            <li> Of the cleansers meant for sensitive skin, it is the one that I prefer in terms of scent and how my skin feels afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DUTHYsers meant for sensitive skin, it is the one that I prefer in terms of scent and how my skin feels afterward.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got incredibly sensitive skin, and everything makes me break out.</li>
            <li> It does seem to work for me as far as controlling itch and reactions.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and so far it seems to help.</li>
            <li> Our son got Eczema when he was about 3 months old.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I use it because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Son has sensitive skin and prone to flare ups.  </li>
            <li> We have used it since the dermatologist recommended it when she was 3 months old.</li>

            <li> baking soda + corn starch in bath water, Johnson &amp; Johnson all natural, etc.</li>
            <li> , I completely changed to Vanicream and never regretted it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It has no fragrance as it is meant for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I was young we camped in the Adirondack Mts.</li>
            <li> It cleanses well, leaving my skin soft and not irritated.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Only brand I can really use.</li>
            <li> But her skin is not as sensitive as mine.</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended by my dermatologists as I have sensitive skin and am prone to contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li> grreat for people who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with sensitive, allergic skin and rosacea for years, and had given up on washing my face altogether</li>
            <li> Whether you have sensitive skin or not, these bars are the way to go.</li>
            <li> This dopa is all I use for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Suds up and no fragrances or issues with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream with Pump once a day, and witch hazel twice a day as a natural toner/blemish control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and don&#x27;t have acne, but do have dry skin most of the year round and Vanicream cleanses without stripping or making my skin feel drier.</li>
            <li> The bar lasts a very long time and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> it also leaves my skin feeling clean, but neither tight or slippery.  </li>
            <li> Just plain clean and soft on your skin.</li>
            <li> There is not any particular redness or rash, with the exception of where I have scratched and the only thing that seems to cause an immediate reaction during one</li>
            <li> Very easy on the skin and does not leave a film behind.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with non-soap cleansing bars, which I purchased for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> The fragrance free Vanicream doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, but another bar I tried was equally gentle and had even less odor, so it won by a small margin.  </li>
            <li> The item itself works great, however, it has a very weird odor.  </li>
            <li> I have changed my laundry soap, and gone to gentler cleansers and been careful around cleaning products, but I have not ever figured out exactly what it is that sets my skin into what I guess is a type of flair-up.  </li>
            <li> Works very well with my very dry, sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has really helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like using this to wash my face with this bar since it doesnt leave me with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for extremely dry itchy eczema.</li>
            <li> I only wish that I had found it when I was a very embarassed teen!</li>
            <li> , I never saw symptoms of such, but by the time you itch that long for no apparent reason; you really are ready to try anything to just make it</li>
            <li> , I never saw symptoms of such, but by the time you itch that long for no apparent reason; you really are ready to try anything to just make it stop.    </li>
            <li> Vanicream is not as hard milled as the popular soap brands ... probably doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> and I surmised that my itching is not due to any type of body lice or pest.  </li>
            <li> and I surmised that my itching is not due to any type of body lice or pest.  </li>
            <li> that it is slick and suds like soap, rinses cleanly, isn&#x27;t overly drying.</li>
            <li> He is still getting used to the fact that it has no fragrance in it because that usually triggers for him a clean feeling when he can smell the scent of the soap on him.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the only products that helps clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream is the only soap that has touched this face for years, it was recommended by my dermatologist to use as a part of a skin care regimen to help clear up my acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s only 2 months old and we&#x27;re using all these chemicals on her?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and have had eczema my entire life.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can use for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried Cetaphil (regular and eczema lines), Eucerin, Cerave, Aquaphor, Dove sensitive and unscented, 100% organic baby oil,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that does not dry out my skin and keeps my complexion clear.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bars disappear VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> For the past 20+ years, I&#x27;ve had a slew of dermatologists diagnose my mildly rashy, itchy skin as one thing or another.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but these are great for people with skin allergies.</li>
            <li> At last I&#x27;ve found a cleansing bar that is non-irritating for older, dry skin with Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I get no eczema with Vanicream and my skin does not dry out.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> The soap is hard, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, although what you can smell is not unpleasant, but get it wet</li>
            <li> Since he started using this his scalp has changed from very rough and dull to shiny and very smooth.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s rich and creamy, 1 bar will last for at least 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I get slightly better results using the bar directly onto my skin, but it&#x27;s difficult to do one&#x27;s back without a close friend or spouse!  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and live in the SW, causing my skin to be even drier.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Vanicream lotion and soap as my main products as a skin &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; due to allergic reactions I was having to just about all health and beauty products.  </li>
            <li> but I find it lasts much longer than a typical bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Now, the full sized bars can be ordered through Walgreens (at least my local Walgreens doesn&#x27;t carry it routinely).  </li>
            <li> Same answer as above for their sunscreen: pure, less ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Especially since I have extremely sensitive dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Her hands clear up as the regular soaps gave her some issues due to parabins, her Dr recomened this as a treatment for her allergetic reaction to parabins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any discernible difference between this and dove sensitive other than the astronomical price.</li>
            <li> Super gentle, crazy creamy and no fragrance or extra junk</li>
            <li> I have suffered with eczema for basically my entire life, and after 27 years I finally found a soap that does not irritate my skin or dry it out.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting bar for home.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still need to use lotion, but it&#x27;s not as harsh as normal soaps.</li>
            <li> I use them in the winter only when my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY BAR MY FAMILY MEMBER CAN USE FOR SEVERE EZCEMA  DRY , IRRITATED, AND ITCHY  </li>
            <li> The tiny bar had no scent at all, was relatively gentle, and didn&#x27;t seem to give my delicate skin issues.  </li>
            <li> It cleans and lathers similar to Dove, but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry afterward.  </li>
            <li> My face has always been fairly clear, but this eliminated the little acne that</li>
            <li> Hard soap, doesn&#x27;t just melt away so fast.  </li>
            <li> I got this bar after an itching spell had lasted too long...</li>
            <li> and I noticed that his skin is not as rough or have red patches anymore.</li>
            <li> works well, lasts long time</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have spent thousands of dollars buying various products that were supposedly designed for people like me.</li>
            <li> and then I will get a small rash that only last a short time.  </li>
            <li> If I couldn&#x27;t find the other, I&#x27;d definitely use the Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> And I swear you will never want to go back to other soaps again.  </li>
            <li> I recommend keeping it dry when not in use.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make your face too dry after using it.  </li>
            <li> She suggested I use Vanicream lotion and immediately the dry patches went away.  </li>
            <li> Store in a dry space as the bar may &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too dry</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin too dry</li>
            <li> This was recommended for my extremely dry skin by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Cleanses thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry.  </li>
            <li> I think it does dry my skin somewhat but that may be unavoidable -</li>
            <li> My wife used to have horribly dry hands to the point that they&#x27;d crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well, does not leave a dry film like some soaps.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and has no scent to irritate.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my daughter since she also has dry skin.  </li>
            <li> got this soap by dermatologist recommendation for my dry skin, but not acne control.</li>
            <li> I have rather sensitive skin, eczema, allergies, and a few other issues.</li>
            <li> I will continue using these and have basically given up all other products, with the exception of the occasional spot treatment for a rough breakout.</li>
            <li> I only need to use a little bit and they go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Typically I have to alternate skin products every six months or so for them to maintain efficacy; not the case with Vanicream.</li>
            <li> She has very pale, sensitive skin, and some eczema.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this soap leaves my skin feeling great...non-drying.</li>
            <li> this has been about the only bar soap we have found to use on my little girl with eczema.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get it in your eyes, it stings.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I have gone through this now a few times and have finally figured out a routine that seems to stop the flair-up...</li>
            <li> Actually, not much of a smell at all.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no connection with the company.</li>
            <li> i have uber sensitive skin that dries out or reacts to preservative and other common ingredients.</li>
            <li> Only a very slight odor that fades within seconds</li>
            <li> Using this soap help prevent the dryness I got from the other soap I am not allergic to.  </li>
            <li> I use all other vanicream products as well</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I&#x27;m still experimenting.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Have had problems with other soaps, due to the ingredients and not to mention the perfumes.</li>
            <li> my husband and I using NOTHING other than this soap on our skin for three years</li>
            <li> My husband uses it because he&#x27;s allergic to all other soaps.  </li>
            <li> We use this soap with him every other night, although we bath him every night.</li>
            <li> No more splitting open and bleeding.</li>
            <li> The bars last a long time (approximately a month) and have eliminated the dry, ashy skin that no amount of moisturizer seemed to erase.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this smells a little strange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in my local stores</li>
            <li> My dark spots are fading and my acne has cleared up.</li>
            <li> This product line was created by 2 former pharmacists from the mayo clinic and has thus far been among the least irritating line of products I have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put it in a soap dish that retains water because it breaks down sooner than you want.</li>
            <li> We prefer to purchase the 3-pack here rather than hunt it down in Walgreen, where it might be in stock, or it might not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin began smoother and less aggravated in less than a week.</li>
            <li> This cleansing bar is not-drying and my winter skin is feeling a lot less &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; since I started using these.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a slight oily odor, which didn&#x27;t bother me considering results.</li>
            <li> The bar itself has a slight odor to it which I do not find objectionable, but it leaves no scent on my skin.</li>
            <li> Previously I was a Cerave user until I went to the dermatologist for a sore on my jaw.</li>
            <li> Although bar soaps are typically drying, that is not the case with Vanicream.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that the few ingredients were enough to do anything for my skin but the cleansing bar has really helped me a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are extremely thick moisturizing and don&#x27;t dry out my skin like Dial Gold does.</li>
            <li> it makes me feel a little like</li>
            <li> No more dry feeling out the shower!!!</li>
            <li> Her skin was tough with patches that were red.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive or you don&#x27;t want the exposure to all the bad stuff in regular soap, this soap is for you.  </li>
            <li> , my husband, who had been looking for a soap he would really like, tried this one and is crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> No scent or harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I let it sit a few minutes and then rinse.  </li>
            <li> I received a package from Amazon with three boxes, and one of them was just missing the soap.</li>
            <li> One of the others smelled like a toxic waste dump</li>
            <li> It can be used for body and face and doesn&#x27;t make you feel dried out.</li>
            <li> but I use Vanicream everyday in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and bod and look forward to it everyday.</li>
            <li> I do not use antibacterial soap on a regular basis, because I have an awful time with yeast infections if I do, so my normal cleansers would not necessarily catch a bacterial skin issue.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no strong fragrance to compete with my lotion or perfume.</li>
            <li> We live in So Cal and my baby suffers from eczema (and allergies &amp; asthma, inherited from my hubby&#x27;s side).</li>
            <li> I received a few small sample bars of this from my dermatologist, and he has had no more complaints.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from eczema very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Vanicream has other products, too, but this is the only one I need desperately.</li>
            <li> Upon opening and trying the first bar (from my pack of 3), I noticed an awful smell, similar to fecal matter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my package was old or defective, but it was terribly disappointing.  </li>
            <li> When I mentioned a well known mass marketed brand, he rolled his eyes and handed me a small sample bar of Vanicream.      </li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Missing the soap!</li>
            <li> No more itchy skin from soap perfumes and residue.</li>
            <li> it can be used for shaving too because it has the same thickness of the foam as the expensive products on the market, i do recommend to try this by the guys....</li>
            <li> Use this everyday without issues!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, I have been using Vanicream Cleansing Bars for the past two years and will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> No more burning.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soo much more expensive!!!!</li>
            <li> I use it every day on my body, and I can even use it on my face, though I usually use the Vanicream Liquid Cleanser as a face wash.</li>
            <li> Made an unbelievable difference on my skin after showering with this soap.  </li>
            <li> I had used an expensive shaving cream for several years.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the soap does not sud or foam and is extremely difficult to transfer from bar to bath cloth.  </li>
            <li> A hard soap that lathers and lasts well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in drugstores - this is the easiest way to purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible allergic reactions to fragrance, so fragrance free is a must for me.</li>
            <li> Used to use Dove Beauty Bar for face washing, but as my skin has felt drier/tighter after washing lately I switched to this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least twice the price--</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell!  </li>
            <li> I immediately tried washing my hands with a different soap to remove the terrible scent it left.  </li>
            <li> Its very similar to Dove when it comes to moisturizing but without all the bad junk they put in body soaps.</li>
            <li> Even oatmeal soap was irritating for me, but this stuff suds well, no perfumes, and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> This also doesn&#x27;t leave that dry feeling film that is annoying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything is going to cure it, alas!  </li>
            <li> The wrong soaps cause me to have an allergic reaction that makes the skin around my eyes swell and become covered with an itchy rash.</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Vanicream and I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> It has a faint smell of the ingredients, because it has no masking fragrance.</li>
            <li> The faint smell goes away when you rinse the suds off.</li>
            <li> And, you don&#x27;t have to worry about any of the terrible chemicals that are in other products.</li>
            <li> Ordered product for niece who suffers from psoriasis along with the cream.</li>
            <li> They have eczema really bad &amp;</li>
            <li> Those products (including Cerave and Cetaphil) burned my skin on contact--very painful.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Smells so horribly bad!  </li>
            <li> I hated giving them up,</li>
            <li> My eczema was horrific and is now under control.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible eczema outbreak in my arm pits.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product for anyone with allergies or if you just want s creamy lather!</li>
            <li> This soap is irritant free.  Works well and does not have any type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap a couple of weeks ago, because my face was getting pretty irritated after I washed it. I was getting red blotches on my cheeks,so I wanted to try something more gentle. I found this soap and thought I would give it a try. I really like it, it even removes eye makeup. Just be careful not to get it in your eyes, it stings.</li>
            <li> Gentle. I recommend keeping it dry when not in use. Don&#x27;t put it in a soap dish that retains water because it breaks down sooner than you want. I have very sensitive skin on my face (allergies/excema) and I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> Vanicream has changed my life and boosted my self esteem. My skin began smoother and less aggravated in less than a week. My dark spots are fading and my acne has cleared up.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand. I use it mostly on my body but from now and then I use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. It makes my skin so smooth and calms my back acne.  Is truly odor free!</li>
            <li> It is okay.  Easier on the skin than some.  I have fouind another brand that is better for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Only soap my husband can use with his skin issues.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This soap is $3.99 in Walgreen,I just started using it and it makes my face feel so fresh</li>
            <li> It does not irritate the skin, nor does it leave an oily build-up. It is especially good for those who wash their face twice a day and have sensitive  facial skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this particular brand of soap for some time now. Will not switch back to any thing else</li>
            <li> This cleansing bar is not-drying and my winter skin is feeling a lot less &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; since I started using these.</li>
            <li> A hard soap that lathers and lasts well.</li>
            <li> I had used Lowilla to clean my face since I was a teenager because I have dry skin. When I couldn&#x27;t find Lowilla anymore, I asked a dermatologist to recommend a replacement after I couldn&#x27;t find anything just right on my own. She gave me a sample of Vanicream (the cleansing bar), and it was just right. Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t burn my nostrils!</li>
            <li> Nothing to comment. As expected.</li>
            <li> I struggle with eczema and read many reviews about the Vanicream product line, so I decided to give them a try.  I have found that I love their moisturizing skin cream, but I did NOT like the cleansing bars I received. Upon opening and trying the first bar (from my pack of 3), I noticed an awful smell, similar to fecal matter.  I immediately tried washing my hands with a different soap to remove the terrible scent it left.  Fortunately I hadn&#x27;t smeared it all over my body yet!  I threw that bar away, figuring it was defective, and opening the 2nd bar.  Same smell.  Bar 3?  Same thing. Ugh.  I don&#x27;t know if my package was old or defective, but it was terribly disappointing.  I will stick with my Cetaphil soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap if you have allergies. It&#x27;s cheap also last me a couple months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many soaps for sensitive skin and find this product to be the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  After my first use, I was surprised how clean I felt - even at the end of the day.  I also love the feel of my skin after I use it.  I have very dry skin and live in the SW, causing my skin to be even drier.  After cleaning with this soap, I didn&#x27;t have to apply the layers of lotion I normally apply all day.  I was pleasantly surprised.  There is no fragrance, so if you need aroma therapy soap, this isn&#x27;t for you.  If you have sensitive skin and want to be clean and feel clean and help your skin to be less dry, this soap is for you.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and this soap works well for him.</li>
            <li> This is the only bar soap we have found that my son can use. We have tried almost every type of soap on the market, and he immediately complains that they are all &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34;. I received a few small sample bars of this from my dermatologist, and he has had no more complaints. His eczema still flares up from time to time, but it seems to be easier to manage. We also use the Free and Clear Shampoo made by Pharmaceutical Specialties.</li>
            <li> Great! Be sure to keep it stored in a dry place.</li>
            <li> Good quality, dense soap.  Good for my eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  My kids and I have super sensitive skin and even Aveeno was starting to break us out.  This was recommended to us by my son&#x27;s allergist and it&#x27;s fantastic.  No scent or harsh chemicals and it can be used daily without drying out the skin or leaving any residue.  This has pretty much completely eradicated my son&#x27;s eczema and my adult acne.  Great great product.  Wish it existed when I was younger!</li>
            <li> This is the only bar soap my entire family can use. Vanicream was originally recommended to use by our son&#x27;s pediatrician for his eczema.  My husband&#x27;s dermatologist also recommended it to him.  The entire family now uses Vanicream soap.  We prefer to purchase the 3-pack here rather than hunt it down in Walgreen, where it might be in stock, or it might not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use Cetaphil for your face, this is a great bar soap alternative.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!! cannot believe how SOFT my skin is after using this.  convinced me to look into getting their sunscreen as well.  we also have bought their lotion repeatedly, keeps our son&#x27;s excema away.  miracle stuff :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have mixed and sensitive skin.  This doesn&#x27;t make your face too dry after using it.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> this has been about the only bar soap we have found to use on my little girl with eczema.  Very easy on the skin and does not leave a film behind.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to so many fragrances and chemicals I can&#x27;t begin to count.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now (actually the whole family uses it).  Only a very slight odor that fades within seconds and it&#x27;s so mild I could use it to wash my hair instead of shampoo as it rinses out cleanly with no residue.</li>
            <li> Have issues with sensitive skin on my eyelids and solved with Free &amp; Clear products (shampoo and their Vanicream soap)</li>
            <li> happy with the product, wanted to try something new for dry skin</li>
            <li> First of all, this soap is fantastic. It was recommended by my dermatologist and I was happy to find it on Amazon. However, I received only 2 bars of soap rather than 2- 3 packs of soap as the description of product led me to believe. I think the advertising is deceptive.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that does not dry out my skin and keeps my complexion clear. Very happy...</li>
            <li> Luv Vanicrean Cleansing Bars!  I have a fragrance and surfactant contact allergy and Vanicream is the only safe products on the market for my skin.  It lathers great and has a rich creamy feel.</li>
            <li> When I asked my dermitologist about my dry skin condition, he asked me what kind of soap I used.  When I mentioned a well known mass marketed brand, he rolled his eyes and handed me a small sample bar of Vanicream.      Now, the full sized bars can be ordered through Walgreens (at least my local Walgreens doesn&#x27;t carry it routinely).  I did this the first time around, but then did a search on Amazon.  Fortunately one of their affiliates, the DermStore, offers it priced competively and delivered to your door.  The transaction went flawlessly, completely complementing my satisfaction with the product - a great total package.    Vanicream is not as hard milled as the popular soap brands ... probably doesn&#x27;t last as long.  I can&#x27;t really tell, however, since I now use it on more areas of skin because it does help my dry skin condition.  Also, my wife now uses it, too.  She has always been more careful about skin care.  Additionally, she and I both appreciate that it&#x27;s scent-free, and doesn&#x27;t aggravate our allergies.</li>
            <li> I get migraines triggered by perfume and not only is this soap fragrance free, but it is free of masking fragrances as well (the \\&quot;Pharmaceutical Specialties\\&quot; brand is known for that).  I absolutely love this soap!  It has a nice creamy, luxurious lather -- just wonderul to feel on your skin &amp; it cleans the skin nicely!    I also use their shampoo &amp; conditioner and they are terrific as well!</li>
            <li> When my daughter was a newborn she didn&#x27;t have the regular baby rash we read about in books. The pediatrician had us using cortizone creams, Head and shoulders and gave her prescription topicals with alchol in them. I thought \\&quot;there has to be another way? She&#x27;s only 2 months old and we&#x27;re using all these chemicals on her?\\&quot; We took her to an allergist and found out she had severe eczema. Her skin was tough with patches that were red. Some patches were crusting and oozing. With the Doctor&#x27;s advice we started to use this soap on her during her bath and coated her skin with the Vanicream pump lotion after her bath. The first night she slept fine without scratching or waking. Within 2 days (honest to goodness) her skin dramatically improved! Her skin softened to the \\&quot;baby soft\\&quot; skin she should have had. The oozing patches that kept reoccuring for 2 months (even the prescriptions couldn&#x27;t get rid of), healed and never came back! Unbelievable.I cannot believe this product. It should be called wondercream!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and a little goes a long way.  I like it very much. &amp;#34;Melts&#x27; quickly like ivory soap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fancy this much!</li>
            <li> I started to get red rashes and went to my derm.  She suggested I use Vanicream lotion and immediately the dry patches went away.  So, I also purchased the hand cream, shampoo and conditioner and this cleansing bar.  I recommend the body cream, this cleansing bar (soap), but not the hand cream, shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It feels good and has no smell.</li>
            <li> the best soap for anyone with skin allergies or sensitivities</li>
            <li> Great cleansing bar that is gentle on the skin. Store in a dry space as the bar may &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great soap!  No fragrances or dyes and it lathers up very well.</li>
            <li> I got this bar after an itching spell had lasted too long... I still do not know what sets my skin off, but every so often I go a good couple of weeks just being itchy - everywhere!  I have changed my laundry soap, and gone to gentler cleansers and been careful around cleaning products, but I have not ever figured out exactly what it is that sets my skin into what I guess is a type of flair-up.  There is not any particular redness or rash, with the exception of where I have scratched and the only thing that seems to cause an immediate reaction during one these episodes is direct sun light... it makes me feel a little like my skin is on fire and then I will get a small rash that only last a short time.  I have gone through this now a few times and have finally figured out a routine that seems to stop the flair-up... I use three different products - Glyderm gentle cleanser (a face cleanser with glycolic acid meant for sensitive skin) - I use it full body and let it sit about 5 minutes to exfoliate the top layer of my skin in case the itching is being caused by an irritant that has been deposited on my skin.  I then use the an anti-fungal soap called PediFix FungaSoap Liquid - it has a strong smell that might turn some off, but I use it in case I am having a mild yeast or bacterial type of reaction in my skin.  I let it sit a few minutes and then rinse.  I do not use antibacterial soap on a regular basis, because I have an awful time with yeast infections if I do, so my normal cleansers would not necessarily catch a bacterial skin issue.  And then last, I use the Vanicream soap.  It is gentle and it is able to rid my body of the scents of the stronger cleansers... it also leaves my skin feeling clean, but neither tight or slippery.  It is a mild soap meant for gentle skin, but I think it has a mild scent - it does not smell perfumy at all, though.  I might repeat the above process a couple of times, but then I continue my daily showers with the Vanicream.  Of the cleansers meant for sensitive skin, it is the one that I prefer in terms of scent and how my skin feels afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I also use a high quality calendula oil, cream or lotion after bath or before towel drying to moisturize and calm my skin.  The oil alone will help the itching stop temporarily; but whatever is causing the itching does not go away until I go through the whole routine two or three times.  I still have no clue what sets my skin off, but I have a pretty decent arsenal of \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; stuff to quickly start dealing with the situation.  And in between, I use this soap and maybe the oil to keep my skin calm.  The first couple of times it happened, my routine would also include a soak in RID, in case the itching was being caused by some unseen parasite, but it did absolutely nothing to stop the itching and I surmised that my itching is not due to any type of body lice or pest.  Mind you, I never saw symptoms of such, but by the time you itch that long for no apparent reason; you really are ready to try anything to just make it stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glyderm Gentle Cleanser  http://www.amazon.com/Gly-Derm-GlyDerm-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B0041EATDO/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1299267590&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&lt;br /&gt;PediFix FungaSoapLiquid with Tea Tree oil, 6 oz  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DUTHYsers meant for sensitive skin, it is the one that I prefer in terms of scent and how my skin feels afterward.

            <li> I snagged a sample of this cleanser as a workshop parting gift. I fell in love with it after one use. Typically I have to alternate skin products every six months or so for them to maintain efficacy; not the case with Vanicream. This soap works wonders for my complexion.  I can use it several times a day without worrying about my skin drying out. It works and its inexpensive. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of my local stores...thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to so easily find a soap that does not contain MI (methylisothiazonolone)a chemical to which many people are violently allergic.  The price was/is reasonable for a specialty soap, and, of course, Amazon did its usual wonderful job of stocking and shipping the item.  My only complaint is that the soap does not sud or foam and is extremely difficult to transfer from bar to bath cloth.  I get slightly better results using the bar directly onto my skin, but it&#x27;s difficult to do one&#x27;s back without a close friend or spouse!  I probably won&#x27;t order this soap again unless I cannot find another soap also without MI.</li>
            <li> I use this soap because of skin allergies.  It works well for me and I recommend to others having similar allergies.</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and have had eczema my entire life. I have tried all types of products on my skin and they all irritate it. This product, which I&#x27;ve used for 3 months leaves my skin clean but not dry. I use it for my face and the redness has gone away. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is the best cleanser i have ever used. foams great. cleans great. leaves skin feeling great. stocked up asap.</li>
            <li> A mild cleansing bar. I use it only on the face, with a moisturizing cream afterwards. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cleanser. Previously I used Cetaphil facial cleanser (which was very good and I still like). This product line was created by 2 former pharmacists from the mayo clinic and has thus far been among the least irritating line of products I have ever used on my face. It was touted by my doctor as the new standard in skincare for people like me :)    (I&#x27;m unable to use the skincare products of most brands including: Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clinique, BareMinerals, Sheseido, Estee Lauder, etc.)    I have rather sensitive skin, eczema, allergies, and a few other issues. This cleanser doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all. I have been using it for a month now - like that it is slick and suds like soap, rinses cleanly, isn&#x27;t overly drying.</li>
            <li> excellent product!  good for your skin.  it&#x27;s not too dry but at the same time can clean your face very very well!  this is the 2nd one i have got.  the 1st one lasted for almost a year.  super good value!  i also am using vanicream light lotion and cream.  really love vanicream!</li>
            <li> I just love this soap, to bad it doesn&#x27;t come as a body wash, I&#x27;d love it even more.  With my now sensitive skin, I feel clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got incredibly sensitive skin, and everything makes me break out. This is one of the only products that helps clear up my skin.  I received a package from Amazon with three boxes, and one of them was just missing the soap. Missing the soap! Strangest thing. Contacted them to see if they&#x27;ll give me a refund.</li>
            <li> The soap is fine and I have no problem with it, but the marketing says a \\&quot;a pack of 3\\&quot;, which is just not the case all.  I ordered 4 packages of three thinking I would recieve 12 bars. That did not happen I recieved 4 bars even, and so I paid nearly double the price for the same soap I can order at the local drug store. Well ya live and you learn. Sometimes you get a good deal on Amazon, but this soap is not a good deal.</li>
            <li> But oh how I miss fragrance and the feel of \\&quot;real soap\\&quot;.  It does seem to work for me as far as controlling itch and reactions.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and so far it seems to help.</li>
            <li> Great lather, long lasting, no scent, no visible improvement with my son&#x27;s eczema. I can&#x27;t tell any discernible difference between this and dove sensitive other than the astronomical price. We are going back to Dove</li>
            <li> I love these bars of soap for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin but I&#x27;ve also been using it on my face and I love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream bar for bad skin. I&#x27;m older and don&#x27;t have acne, but do have dry skin most of the year round and Vanicream cleanses without stripping or making my skin feel drier. I love it!</li>
            <li> i have uber sensitive skin that dries out or reacts to preservative and other common ingredients. i cant even use dove or cetaphil bar soaps b/c i get rashes. this is a great product, recommended to me by my dermatologist who gets how crazy my skin is and is very knowledgeable of all new stuff out there. i love this soap, leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean without drying it out or irritating it.</li>
            <li> If you need a soap that is gentle enough for sensitive skin this one has worked well. It can be used daily.</li>
            <li> Smells so horribly bad!  I tried to use it but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell!  Went back to using the trader joes oatmeal soap and I love it!</li>
            <li> The soaps are great.  I only need to use a little bit and they go a long way.  Would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this cleansing bar.  The suds are very gentle on my skin but they are powerful enough to remove dirt and oils easily.</li>
            <li> Using this soap help prevent the dryness I got from the other soap I am not allergic to.  I get no eczema with Vanicream and my skin does not dry out.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Great for folks with allergies.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this soap is gentle and non-drying on my skin. It also makes a great lather, so it&#x27;s very easy to lather up and get out of the shower quickly. So much better than ordinary Dial soap, and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can use for my sensitive skin. My eczema was horrific and is now under control. I use their entire line of products including shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Our son got Eczema when he was about 3 months old. The Dr. recommended this instead of the regular baby soap bars out there. It worked so great that we switched completely and have been using this bar since then. Our son is almost 2 now and is eczema free since we starting using Vanicream!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging and ontime delivery by Amazon!!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I use it because of my sensitive skin. Love it.  However I do have to moisturize after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works very well for kids with any rashes.Very good soap without any chemicals. Helped a lot to my daughter</li>
            <li> Great soap no allergic reaction for my  sensitive skin, very happy</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser. It is very soothing and my face really feels clean. I use all other vanicream products as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying these unscented bars so far. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be pore clogging, lathers well, cleans well and rinses well. No itching after.</li>
            <li> Great soap! No more itchy skin from soap perfumes and residue. Rinses real clean.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is very for sensitive skin and lathes like normal soap.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin too dry</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin or eczema</li>
            <li> it is a very good soap for sensitive skin...it can be used for shaving too because it has the same thickness of the foam as the expensive products on the market, i do recommend to try this by the guys....i am a lady, but i tested it for the foaming property and it is really great...</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this soap for almost two years now and loves it.  He will ask me to reorder weeks before he is out.  I would recommend it to anyone with skin that reacts to perfumes, dyes, etc.</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist if there was a brand of soap that was the mildest and she told me about this brand. I am grateful Amazon has it. I have found it to be great--no itching, burning, drying.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with non-soap cleansing bars, which I purchased for very dry skin. I tried a couple of others along with the Vanicream.  One of the others smelled like a toxic waste dump and I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again even though it was the gentlest of all.  The fragrance free Vanicream doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, but another bar I tried was equally gentle and had even less odor, so it won by a small margin.  If I couldn&#x27;t find the other, I&#x27;d definitely use the Vanicream.  On the other hand, I&#x27;m still experimenting.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It&#x27;s great for people with sensitive skin but anyone can use it.  I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers and I always come back to this one.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate or clog pores and skin is clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> This soap is fragrance free and lathers very well.  I am very satisfied with it. I have skin allergies so I gave it a try.  Skin feels clean and not like it has a film like some soaps do.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I will ever purchase for those in my family with super sensitive skin. It is pricey but doesn&#x27;t irritate skin in any way. The money is well worth the results.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product when my husband had surgery at the Mayo Hospital in Phoenix.  It was sold in the gift shop.  I was impressed over the mildness.  Not only does it clean make-up off the face, you can rinse the make-up stains out of the wash cloth!  I agree with one reviewer, don&#x27;t leave the soap in a soap dish with standing water.  It breaks down easily.</li>
            <li> I really like using this cleansing bar. I have chemical sensitivities and perfumes bother me a great deal. This also doesn&#x27;t leave that dry feeling film that is annoying.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been searching forever for some TRUE FREE AND CLEAR soap.&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY thing I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;irritate my skin. Would highly recommend to anyone that suffers&lt;br /&gt;from Chronic Eczema.[[ASIN:B0001EKWPI Vanicream Cleansing Bar, Fragrance Free, 3.9 Ounce Bars (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> I like this soap.  Even though it costs two to three times more as most bars from the drug store, it&#x27;s very soft and leaves you squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one issue is that I have Allergic Contact Dermatitis and this was one of very few bar soaps I was able to use, as instructed by my dermatologist.  It worked great for a long time until I noticed a rash all over my body.  I found out that they had changed the ingredients, and one of the new ingredients they added is something I&#x27;m highly allergic to (Glyceryl Monothioglycolate).  I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to anyone who buys this for allergy purposes, make sure you keep checking the ingredients in case they decide to change things again.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great soap.</li>
            <li> This bar of soap sits very well on my skin. My acne has improved, but i also believe it is because i changed my diet and also the aloe vera i place on my skin at night, washing it off during my morning shower.</li>
            <li> Gentle. No bad smell. Actually, not much of a smell at all. Great for eczema. You&#x27;ll still need to use lotion, but it&#x27;s not as harsh as normal soaps. I even use it on my face.  Update:  My family and I love this soap. Some of us struggle with severe eczema and this is the best soap we have tried (and believe me, we&#x27;ve tried many).  I do not suffer from eczema, but I now use this soap for everything (body, face, and hands) because it&#x27;s so gentle on the skin and there&#x27;s no strong fragrance to compete with my lotion or perfume. It cleans really well too.</li>
            <li> Same answer as above for their sunscreen: pure, less ingredients.  It&#x27;s better for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more of this brand in their other products.</li>
            <li> Great soap was prescribed by my doctor. They were prescribed by my doctor and were cheaper than from them or the drug store.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Vanicream lotion and soap as my main products as a skin &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; due to allergic reactions I was having to just about all health and beauty products.  This product line works great for me and I would recommend it to anyone else who has sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has very dry skin.  This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased it for him.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying it again since he loves it.</li>
            <li> Only soap my kids use.  They have eczema really bad &amp; this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin like a lot of the others.</li>
            <li> I have terrible allergic reactions to fragrance, so fragrance free is a must for me. This soap feels great on the skin and is not expensive. I even use it to wash my bras, since I can&#x27;t use scented laundry detergent either. My only complaint is that this smells a little strange.</li>
            <li> Son has sensitive skin and prone to flare ups.  He reminded me to order more and I noticed that his skin is not as rough or have red patches anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been having allergic reactions to different creams and soaps and my dermatologist recommended this product  It is amazing.  The cream lathers easily and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product especially for those with sensitive skin or allergies. It&#x27;s the only thing I can use for my eczema</li>
            <li> Her hands clear up as the regular soaps gave her some issues due to parabins, her Dr recomened this as a treatment for her allergetic reaction to parabins.</li>
            <li> While I still put on some body cream after shower, this soap has banished my itchy winter skin. Lathers beautifully, but doesn&#x27;t last too long. Leaves you feeling clean but not dried out. Bought fragrance free- but there&#x27;s a slight oily odor, which didn&#x27;t bother me considering results.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My son suffers from eczema very sensitive skin this product works great it helps keep the skin moisturize it doesn&#x27;t irritate very happy with this product I also use this myself.  For aftercare From tattoos  doesn&#x27;t irritate skin works extremely well very happy with it</li>
            <li> My wife loves this soap.</li>
            <li> The item itself works great, however, it has a very weird odor.  Can&#x27;t stand it so I threw them away.  This is no reflection on anyone selling these items, I just can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li> Best soap on the market for people who have allergies I have used several others but this is the best soap for my skin.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm for cleansing my very sensitive skin. Recommended by my doctor, I buy it buy the case.</li>
            <li> Great soap and a great price for people with skin issues.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap we have been able to use on our daughter without her getting a rash. We have used it since the dermatologist recommended it when she was 3 months old. She has very pale, sensitive skin, and some eczema.</li>
            <li> Fianlly found what I was looking for-just wish that the price was more affordable!!</li>
            <li> This bar soap is just what we needed for our son who has infant eczema. With no dyes or perfumes it&#x27;s perfect for his skin</li>
            <li> Love it.  Can&#x27;t do without it.  Will use forever.</li>
            <li> Ordered product for niece who suffers from psoriasis along with the cream. The products worked simultaneously together, and cleared her skin up within hours.</li>
            <li> So mild.. Milder than baby soap.. Best for me for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This product has provided great relief for my hand eczema.  I&#x27;ve had hand eczema for about 50 years and this is the only product that cleared my hands.  I use this in with Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion with soothing oat essence.  Don&#x27;t substitude...the oat essence is what makes the lotion work.  The two combined (Vanicream &amp; lotion) are a miracle.</li>
            <li> Great facial moisturizing bar.  Surprised me how well it moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to my husband by his dermatologist. He has very sensitive skin that dries out easily. He said this soap really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Best body soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Period. Its very similar to Dove when it comes to moisturizing but without all the bad junk they put in body soaps. Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li> Have had problems with other soaps, due to the ingredients and not to mention the perfumes. Use this everyday without issues!</li>
            <li> This was recommended for my extremely dry skin by my dermatologist.  It seems to help, but it&#x27;s not a cure.  I don&#x27;t think anything is going to cure it, alas!  It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a film on my skin or on the shower walls, which is definitely a plus!  The bar itself has a slight odor to it which I do not find objectionable, but it leaves no scent on my skin.</li>
            <li> Best cleansing bar I&#x27;ve used.  Cleanses thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry.  Worth the price and would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price. Most soaps bother me due to my sensitive skin. This is truly non-allergenic and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> My husbands doctor advised him to buy and use on his balding precancerous scalp. Since he started using this his scalp has changed from very rough and dull to shiny and very smooth. We both think this product deserves high praise. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I think it does dry my skin somewhat but that may be unavoidable - it cleans well, is mild and seems to last pretty long.</li>
            <li> At last I&#x27;ve found a cleansing bar that is non-irritating for older, dry skin with Rosacea. The bar is not drying, yet does a superb job cleansing. It removes makeup yet is not irritating, moisturizes but is not pore clogging. A perfect bar for even severe Rosacea sufferers. In fact the entire Vanicream line and its companion Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner are excellent for extremely sensitive skin. This line was recommended by my dermatologist after having problems with Cetaphil and many other excellent sensitive skin products. I have absolutely no connection with the company. I&#x27;m just a grateful customer.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap.  It is gentle, but really works.  And I swear you will never want to go back to other soaps again.  You can actually feel the difference.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Non drying soap that produces a good, foamy lather. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it and works well to remove makeup (even eye makeup without being super drying). I use it on both face &amp; body.</li>
            <li> Never have to worry because of my sensitive skin and eczema with this product, love it~~</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and have fought acne always.  A couple of months ago, I started getting eczema-like patches on my face near my hairline(!!!) and systematically moved to fragrance-free shampoo and conditioner since I was already using fragrance-free facial products. Loved the Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner, but I still had these incredibly itchy, red patches on my face. So, I tried Vanicream soap and moisturizer, fully expecting to replace the eczema patches with acne. Acne seemed more livable. My skin is smooth, and mostly clear after using this product! It seems that I have developed an allergic reaction to either salicylate or benzoyl peroxide. I really should figure out which but haven&#x27;t really needed to use them. A little bit of adult acne cream along with this soap and moisturizer and I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look so great ever! Thank you Vanicream. I only wish that I had found it when I was a very embarassed teen!</li>
            <li> Finally after years of products I found the one</li>
            <li> The wrong soaps cause me to have an allergic reaction that makes the skin around my eyes swell and become covered with an itchy rash. My dermatologist recommended this soap, and I&#x27;ve used it for about a year with no problems. It prevents my face from becoming too dry but gets it clean. I primarily use it for my face, so a bar lasts a long time if I keep it from sitting in water.</li>
            <li> Good product. It can be used for body and face and doesn&#x27;t make you feel dried out. I have severe eczema and it does feel good on the skin.</li>
            <li> The best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin is sensitive and prone to rashes but I use Vanicream everyday in the shower. It&#x27;s creamy, rinses clean, has no fragrance and makes a great lather. It is expensive but I find it lasts much longer than a typical bar of soap.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but these are great for people with skin allergies. I use them in the winter only when my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> Great for the person with too many allergies!!  Good price!</li>
            <li> I had used dial white bar soap and the liquid soap for several years and became allergic to it.  All of a sudden my soap and body lotion decided they did not like me.  This soap is doing a great job and is very gentle</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for fighting the dry skin itch in winter.  Leaves skin softer.  Has a nice feel while bathing, also.  It was properly packaged and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again on Amazon when I run out. unscented, creamy and rinses off completely. A reasonable price for 3 bars.</li>
            <li> Vanacream is an excellent soap. I have an allergy to additives in most common Soap and this Soap is free of all that stuff and still provides a rich clean experience in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and this soap helps.  It&#x27;s hard to find in drugstores - this is the easiest way to purchase.  Highly recommended.  Vanicream has other products, too, but this is the only one I need desperately.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for people with eczema. It has works wonders on our daughter&#x27;s skin. Other products from this line are great as well.</li>
            <li> I love the Vanicream product line.  It&#x27;s all I use.  Other soaps make me itch, this one is perfect for allergy patients.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on skin with no dyes or perfumes.</li>
            <li> This really helped my son&#x27;s acne!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered this soap and that Amazon stocks it, because I used to have to special-order it from the pharmacy at a brick and mortar pharmacy. This soap is great for those with sensitive skin, and I use it on my face as well. It&#x27;s not too drying but leaves you feeling really clean- perfect combination.</li>
            <li> Very good for people with exema and my kids use it too. It has no perfumes. Without this exact type of soap our skin dries out like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> My allergist recommended this Vanicream Cleansing Bar.  I had severe itching from all the wonderfully scented soaps and body lotions I was using--filled with flower, seed, fruit, nut, herb oils (you name it).  I hated giving them up, BUT, this soap  and the Vanicream Moisturizing Cream he recommended really work.  The itching has stopped.  The soap is hard, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, although what you can smell is not unpleasant, but get it wet and it lathers richly and beautifully.  My skin feels great.  I use it as a facial cleanser as well.  Between the soap and the cream/lotion, my skin has improved tremendously--my sensitive, acne-prone facial skin in the best shape ever.  Not only that, my husband, who had been looking for a soap he would really like, tried this one and is crazy about it.  He says it&#x27;s exactly what he was hoping to find.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, I have been using Vanicream Cleansing Bars for the past two years and will not use anything else. The bars last a long time (approximately a month) and have eliminated the dry, ashy skin that no amount of moisturizer seemed to erase. These bars are truly fragrance free, as well, so if you are sensitive to scents, you don&#x27;t need to worry with this product.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible eczema outbreak in my arm pits.  Every soap I tried burned when I used it.  I finally ordered some of this and I love it.  No more burning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out anymore, but this soap is not creamy. It will take some getting used to. Thank you</li>
            <li> very nice soap, nice smell (fragrance free, but no annoying smell from the ingredients, as sometimes happens) and leaves skin feeling clean and smoothe</li>
            <li> Great soap for my husband with contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I really like using this to wash my face with this bar since it doesnt leave me with dry skin. its very moisturizing and doesnt have any heavy fragrance. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermotologist because it leaves no residue or odor and cleans just fine. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found on a great product.</li>
            <li> No more dry feeling out the shower!!! Love it! Wash my face too and it&#x27;s all good! Smells like reg soap to me.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for extremely dry itchy eczema. This product was recommended by my dermatologist. I liked the fact that it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li> works well, lasts long time</li>
            <li> Not sure this is any better than sensitive skin DOVE soap formula I&#x27;ve been using for over 30 years.  More expensive than DOVE so probably won&#x27;t be purchasing again since I just don&#x27;t see much difference between the two products.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY BAR MY FAMILY MEMBER CAN USE FOR SEVERE EZCEMA  DRY , IRRITATED, AND ITCHY  SKIN&lt;br /&gt;GENTLE AND WORKS FINE . THE ONLY THING MAKE SURE TO KEEP IT ON A SOAP GRILL IN THE DISH OTHERWISE IT  GETS MOOSHY VERY EASILY</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, my allergist recommended it and I am glad I broke down and ordered it.  I use it on face and body!</li>
            <li> It works well.  Great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for my son who has allergy. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I discovered Vanicream when I had some plastic surgery done on my face.  I then decided to try the soap...my husband and I using NOTHING other than this soap on our skin for three years now it makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> My husband uses it because he&#x27;s allergic to all other soaps.  He no longer itches like he use to.</li>
            <li> I love this bar, my kids have very sentitive skin and we&#x27;ve been using it for years!!!  It&#x27;s the only thing that works.  I hope amazon will consider adding it to the subscription program, everytime I run out I end up going to walgreens to buy it and it&#x27;s soo much more expensive!!!!</li>
            <li> This has been my life saver. I have oily, acne prone skin that has been haunting me for nearly a decade. I have tried many many products, including over the counter,  prescription, and homemade. My husband has befriended an allergist immunologist who recommended that I give up all of that and stick solely with Vanicream products. I have been using the cleansing bar, the light lotion during the day and the regular lotion at night for just over a month, maybe six weeks. My skin is soft and smooth with almost no breakouts. My husband has commented how much better skin is and I often go without makeup with no feeling of insecurities because of my sensitive skin. And everything is kid friendly, another perk.&lt;br /&gt;I use the bar on my face in the sink and also on my body in the shower. It&#x27;s a great cleanser. Not awesome at removing all of my eye makeup, but the lather is great and I always feel clean, never squeaky, after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend these products. I will continue using these and have basically given up all other products, with the exception of the occasional spot treatment for a rough breakout. I am shocked that the few ingredients were enough to do anything for my skin but the cleansing bar has really helped me a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you give this a try. Vanicream is seriously my favorite beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is the new Gluten.  I am sensitive to fragrance.  This product has no fragrance. ... &#x27;enough said.</li>
            <li> We live in So Cal and my baby suffers from eczema (and allergies &amp; asthma, inherited from my hubby&#x27;s side). I tried Cetaphil (regular and eczema lines), Eucerin, Cerave, Aquaphor, Dove sensitive and unscented, 100% organic baby oil, baking soda + corn starch in bath water, Johnson &amp; Johnson all natural, etc. Only Vanicream continues to work well, after the honeymoon period. This, follows by Vanicream moisturizing skin cream + vaseline (Aquaphor won&#x27;t lock in all the moisture in his skin) after bath, and his skin is now so beautiful when he doesn&#x27;t have allergy reaction. Thank you Vanicream!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Skin was very itchy before switching to this cleansing bar. Love all of the VaniCream products.</li>
            <li> Good lather. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best/gentlest cleansing product for my face I have ever used. I have an inflammatory type of rosacea and had tried all of the products that are advertised as gentle for sensitive skin. Those products (including Cerave and Cetaphil) burned my skin on contact--very painful. My dermatologist recommended Vanicream and I was skeptical. It only took using Vanicream one time to change my mind. For me, it is soothing and it also cleanses away makeup. I am so happy that I found it. Even though my skin is much better now, I still prefer Vanicream bar and moisturizing lotion to other products.</li>
            <li> The best soap I have tried for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best deal when purchasing these soap bars. If you&#x27;re reading this, it&#x27;s probably because a dermatologist recommended it. My wife used to have horribly dry hands to the point that they&#x27;d crack and bleed. Since using this soap for her hands, the issue has went away.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap - very moisturizing. And I very much prefer soaps without scents, so this is a perfect hand soap for me.</li>
            <li> Simple, creamy, non-irritating, works well. It has a faint smell of the ingredients, because it has no masking fragrance. If you are allergic to fragrances, this is what you want. The faint smell goes away when you rinse the suds off.</li>
            <li> I have used Vanicream cleansing bar on my very dry, sensitive skin now for about 6 months, and the improvement in the texture and sensitivity is amazing. Previously I was a Cerave user until I went to the dermatologist for a sore on my jaw. She gave me a sample of the Vanicream cream with spa of 50. I tried it later and I was so impressed with that product, I completely changed to Vanicream and never regretted it.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is super gentle without being drying.  It comes in a nice large size that will last for months.  It has no fragrance as it is meant for sensitive skin types.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very prone to redness and this soap helps to keep that under control. Also the soap contains no parades to which my skin is highly allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft and comfortable my skin feels and fer cleansing. I sometimes cleanse 30 a day and using this soap does not bother my skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin I highly recommend you try the Vanicream cleansing bar. You will notice an improvement like I did.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the cream in the jar for night and the lotion for day. I use a hyaluronic serum for maximum moisture retention.</li>
            <li> My toddler has had eczema for over a year. We finally went to a pediatric detmatologist who recommended this soap, along with the lotion. We use this soap with him every other night, although we bath him every night. It is a nice soap and it has helped his skin a lot, in conjunction with the lotion and use if some steriod creams I hope we can stop using soon.</li>
            <li> Great bar soap for sensitive and dry skin! My dermatologist recommended this as equal to or even better than Cetaphil, and I love it. I use it every day on my body, and I can even use it on my face, though I usually use the Vanicream Liquid Cleanser as a face wash. This bar soap is nice and moisturizing, lathers very well, and rinses cleanly without any residue. I will continue to use it and have even hooked my boyfriend too. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This bar soap DOES have an odor to it, so it may not be suitable for folks who are extremely sensitive to odors. Not drying to the skin. Acceptable substitute for my favorite bar soap - French Chef&#x27;s Soap, which isn&#x27;t imported to the US anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this as a face cleanser, 2 or 3 times a day for my oily skin. It does not dry my skin. It&#x27;s hard to find in my local stores so I get it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Got super sensitive skin?  Have to wear gloves to touch any soaps and detergents?? This is the soap for you!  Even oatmeal soap was irritating for me, but this stuff suds well, no perfumes, and no irritation.  All the Vani-  products I have tried are great!</li>
            <li> As sensitive as my skin is this stuff has been wonderful.  I have used some incredibly high priced soaps and this stuff does my skin very nicely.  *sigh*  drinks it in and says thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the soap of choice from our daughters allergist, the calmest on the market. Obviously no smell. We use it as soap and shampoo on both of our kids and no eczema flare ups!</li>
            <li> LOve this soap! Highly recommend for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is good soap for anyone with sensitive skin, which I have battled all my life.  My only reservation with this product is that is it not hard-milled.  If your soap dish does not drain, this will get soft in the dish and a lot of it will not really be useable.  Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> No Fragrance no harm. I see good change in my screen</li>
            <li> Soap works great for my family&#x27;s sensitive skin.  The verdict is still out on whether it&#x27;ll help our winter ezcema</li>
            <li> This is a good cleansing bar.  Non-drying</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing soap I use on my 2 year old with eczema. Has become part of his skin regimen and is doing us well.</li>
            <li> Soap does work perfectly for eczema related skin conditions. However, I don&#x27;t like how white and filmy the water becomes.</li>
            <li> Very good soap, glad I tried it.  Hard soap, doesn&#x27;t just melt away so fast.  Lasts a long time. I will shop for it again.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using body wash or body gels again. I use this soap with the aquis exfoliating mitt or cloth. When I was young we camped in the Adirondack Mts. My mother had us was in the Pristine Lake. I hadn&#x27;t experienced a clean feeling like that in over 20 years. Washing with this soap gives my body that same clean really clean and fresh feeling. It is energizing and soothing at the same time. I have also stopped using Neutrogena cleanser on my face and am using the vanicream. The wrinkle reducing and hydrating products that i have used for years seem to be working better. My skiing overall seems to be more moist. Treat yourself and get this soap</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin, along with VaniCream cream.  A little more expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> My son has exzema and the allergist recommended this for him. It is gentle and effective. Even great for his head</li>
            <li> This cleaning bar is gentle on my sensitive skin and helps me ward off dermititis.  thanks to my dermatologist for the recommendation</li>
            <li> My wife has allergies to perfume smells, and most of the soaps that are available at the retail level have a lot of fragerance to them. This product does a wonderful job of cleaning without all the extra smells.</li>
            <li> I got this at my dermatologist recommendation and it keeps my skin clean and moisturized as they said it would. Amazon had a great price over many others.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is awesome for sensitive and acne prone skin. Since I&#x27;ve started using this product the texture of my skin has improved and I now suffer very few breakouts, it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive or you don&#x27;t want the exposure to all the bad stuff in regular soap, this soap is for you.  I was buying the Zum and similiar soaps with essential oils, but I like this even better. Just plain clean and soft on your skin. It&#x27;s reasonable priced too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream Cleansing Bar for my very sensitive skin. It is wonderful. It cleanses well, leaving my skin soft and not irritated. The bar lasts a very long time and the price is very reasonable. I love that it is fragrance free. I would recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My Dr got me on to this for my skin which is very sensitive......you just feel wonderfully clean.....great great cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am extremely allergic to pretty much everything (including cocao - I need my epi-pen if I even touch chocolate), and these bars are perfect. They are extremely thick moisturizing and don&#x27;t dry out my skin like Dial Gold does. I&#x27;m in love. I NEVER set up auto-ship but I did for these because I don&#x27;t like to run out. This was highly recommended by my allergist.</li>
            <li> Good product for allergy sensitive people.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I have very dry skin and this soap leaves my skin feeling great...non-drying.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is the best. Which they sunscreen for the face. Only brand I can really use.</li>
            <li> Made me itch more....did not like it. Gave it to my daughter and she does like it. But her skin is not as sensitive as mine.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with eczema for basically my entire life, and after 27 years I finally found a soap that does not irritate my skin or dry it out.  These Vanicream bars are great if you have sensitive skin or if fragrances and chemicals are irritable to your skin.  It is moisturizing enough that I don&#x27;t necessarily need to use lotion immediately after showering, even though I still use the Vanicream Lite Lotion after each shower.  I will probably use this soap for years to come.  (And the price online is cheaper than any I have seen in stores.)</li>
            <li> Vanicream is the only soap that has touched this face for years, it was recommended by my dermatologist to use as a part of a skin care regimen to help clear up my acne breakouts. I love Vanicream because it&#x27;s fragrance free, it&#x27;s rich and creamy, 1 bar will last for at least 2 weeks and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well, does not leave a dry film like some soaps.  It is a healthy soap that I would recommend for anyone trying to use products that are better for us.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who has skin allergies.  It was actually recommended by a doctor who also has skin allergies.  My husband says that It lathers well, and he likes it.  He is still getting used to the fact that it has no fragrance in it because that usually triggers for him a clean feeling when he can smell the scent of the soap on him.  This has no fragrance.  He says that he still feels clean without the fragrance smell.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is a great all natural soap, a little expensive, but worth it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You can believe all of the praise for this &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s true. Super gentle, crazy creamy and no fragrance or extra junk that&#x27;s in most soaps and liquid cleansers. I use it on my face and bod and look forward to it everyday. Great feeling, clean rinsing. Recommended by my dermatologist. I figured that if it can be used for infants with eczema and be that gentle and effective, it can do nothing but good for the rest of us. Amazing product. I also use the lite lotion for a super fine veil of moisture wherever I need it.</li>
            <li> I have dermographism and many allergies.  My allergist recommend this for my skin issues and it is the best next to Dove.  It has nothing in it to make you break out and is incredibly gentile on the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it has moisturizer in it but the results of your skin feeling clean and smooth are incredible.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy soap . Very pure and recommended for sensitive skin . Would recommend ,quick shipping,easy to order</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended by my dermatologists as I have sensitive skin and am prone to contact dermatitis. Seems to work as I&#x27;ve had no problems since I started using it (and now my husband uses it, too). My only complaint is that the bars disappear VERY quickly. So I have to stock a bunch or we run out fast.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face when I take my shower in the morning.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and has no scent to irritate.</li>
            <li> I have been to three different dermatologists about a rash I have had for over two years, with no help. The cleansing bar and shampoo has done the trick. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;JG Ky.</li>
            <li> Made an unbelievable difference on my skin after showering with this soap.  I plan to always use Vanicream soap going forward.</li>
            <li> I love no chemical product!! grreat for people who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to soap for bathing, as I have very, very, VERY sensitive skin. Over the years, I have spent thousands of dollars buying various products that were supposedly designed for people like me. I was a human guinea pig and my skin paid the ultimate price (i.e. it is now more sensitive and irritated than ever). I had almost given up on finding a perfect cleanser, until this little gem came to my rescue. Although bar soaps are typically drying, that is not the case with Vanicream. It has just the right balance of cleansing power and moisture. It is so gentle that I often use it on my face, which is the most hypersensitive part of my entire body. I adore this soap and hope that Amazon will continue to offer the bars through its S&amp;S program.</li>
            <li> Prefer the cleansing lotion, but not always economical or available.  These are a great stand by alternative</li>
            <li> I have solved my eczema problems by using Vanicream cleansing bar and Aveeno for eczema.  No more splitting open and bleeding.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  I got a sample of this from my dermatologist and used it for two weeks without issue.  The tiny bar had no scent at all, was relatively gentle, and didn&#x27;t seem to give my delicate skin issues.  Received the full sized bar today and just washed with it.  1) The full sized bar has a rancid scent that the sample bar did not have.  2) My skin is on fire.  FIRE.  Please, someone, bring a fire hose.  Filled with hydrocortisone.  Save me.  I&#x27;ve struggled with sensitive, allergic skin and rosacea for years, and had given up on washing my face altogether (hadn&#x27;t washed it since October- 6 months ago- but was getting more and more dry each day while swimming daily in a chlorinated pool)- I&#x27;m so disappointed that the full size of this cleansing bar is approximately as comfortable as sticking my face in a fire ant nest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m horridly blotchy, obscenely itchy, and my eyes are tearing in discomfort.  What on earth is in this particular bar that wasn&#x27;t in my physician&#x27;s sample???  The labels are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I had used an expensive shaving cream for several years.  Then I discovered this cleansing bar.  It is very moisturizing and provides the right amount of lubrication for shaving.  It fits perfectly in my shaving mug and it lathers perfectly with my shaving brush.  I still use a pre-shave lubricant, but I&#x27;ll never go back to the twenty dollar jar of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I love using this soap!  Especially since I have extremely sensitive dry skin.  Not only that but after using it my skin feels clean.  I don&#x27;t feel any grime or film.  I use it on my face as well.  I also use it on my daughter since she also has dry skin.  She likes it as well..</li>
            <li> Whether you have sensitive skin or not, these bars are the way to go. They leave your skin feeling so soft! And, you don&#x27;t have to worry about any of the terrible chemicals that are in other products. Highly recommend the soap, lite lotion, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For the past 20+ years, I&#x27;ve had a slew of dermatologists diagnose my mildly rashy, itchy skin as one thing or another. None of the prescription creams seemed to have much of an effect. Neither did switching to dye-free, fragrance-free versions of well-known soaps. However, my skin has greatly improved since I switched to the Vanicream cleansing bar and moisturizing skin cream.</li>
            <li> This dopa is all I use for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Long lasting bar for home. Suds up and no fragrances or issues with my sensitive skin. Been using this for 3years now. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used Vanicream  products for years.</li>
            <li> This is great for your face.</li>
            <li> Good soap for skin allergies</li>
            <li> Fantasic moisturinzing soap at a wonderful price!</li>
            <li> Used to use Dove Beauty Bar for face washing, but as my skin has felt drier/tighter after washing lately I switched to this.  It cleans and lathers similar to Dove, but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry afterward.  It&#x27;s at least twice the price--so I still use and love Dove for body washing.</li>
            <li> Works very well with my very dry, sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this soap by dermatologist recommendation for my dry skin, but not acne control. My face has always been fairly clear, but this eliminated the little acne that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this once or twice a day for about one month. I use this along with the Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream with Pump once a day, and witch hazel twice a day as a natural toner/blemish control.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast arrival.</li>
