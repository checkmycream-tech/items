            <li>Great recommend.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no miracle worker, but my pores have shrank and for the most part I don&#x27;t break out unmanageably.</li>
            <li>Works OK.....</li>
            <li>I love this product that&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.</li>
            <li>Their lip balm, I love.</li>
            <li>Love my neutrogena.</li>
            <li>and I think my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product and was happy to see a so-called \\&quot;natural line.\\</li>
            <li>smells so good, yet is not irritating to skin</li>
            <li>This pore scrub is just as good as other high end products but a great price!</li>
            <li>I switched to this Neutrogena for over a month now and it works fantastic, smell nice, feel clean and looks clean.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance to me was light and pleasant; though I do agree that if you&#x27;re going for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; that you shouldn&#x27;t add fragrance; some people are allergic to that, or sensitive.</li>
            <li>It prevents major breakouts, smells really nice, and my face feels nice and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Paraben and phthalate free</li>
            <li>It is gentle product that brightens the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin feeling amazing without the dryness after being used compared to most facial salicylic acid containing washes.</li>
            <li>It washes off cleanly without over-drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and gentle.</li>
            <li>My face is very acne prone, but when using this product twice a day my skin looks better then it has ever looked.</li>
            <li>I love that Neutrogena Naturals went natural!!!</li>
            <li>Love the new Naturals line from Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>i find it to be just a mild cleanser</li>
            <li>For years, I used Aveeno&#x27;s facial scrub, and that was good too, but with more natural ingredients, I prefer this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten lots of things for my husband to use to clean his face, but this is the only thing that he&#x27;s ever LIKED using.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t this defeat the purpose of creating more natural products?</li>
            <li>then the store, so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I rarely break out but whenever I use this product, I break out within a day.</li>
            <li>face wash isn&#x27;t really a \\&quot;scrub,\\&quot; and I&#x27;m glad for that really.</li>
            <li>As I got older, I realized taking care of my skin was more than chemicals, and started leaning towards more natural face washes (which unfortunately are on the pricier side), but they seem to work the best on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleared my blemishes super fast, my face is clear, I love it,</li>
            <li>Yes it states the DERIVATIVES of the chemicals, but it does not say that the chemicals are extracted form these plants exactly.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for</li>
            <li>When I goto rinse it off, first comes off the little beads, and then with a couple more rinses comes off the face wash, and I feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates well, without being overly grainy and harsh like some kinds, so it&#x27;s great for daily use.</li>
            <li>Gentle yet cleansing.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon is also much cheaper</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone, it has been since I started the 6th grade and it hasn&#x27;t gone away since; I&#x27;m almost 21.</li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t too rough yet still feels like my face gets cleaned.</li>
            <li>I will say that maybe it&#x27;s something in my particular eye chemistry that made this happen...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a heavy fragrance and there&#x27;s just enough of an exfoliater in it to make him feel like he&#x27;s getting his face clean without it being peeled off or getting caught in stubble.</li>
            <li>The laughable part is that it&#x27;s supposed to be &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  No scent at all would be ideal but 1/10 of the current smell would seem the norm for a scented product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as if someone in the factory accidentally dumped a whole vat of fragrance in.</li>
            <li>some blackhead reduction at first, now I can&#x27;t really tell a difference after using for several months. .... ...</li>
            <li>NN Lip Balm smells, tastes, and feels pretty much the same, and at $3, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally break out - my cheeks, side of my jaw.</li>
            <li>At the same time, I am scrubbing my face with it and afterwards my face is like a baby&#x27;s, soft and smooth and it does not dry the face out.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t be natural and have this toxic chemically smell radiating from your product!</li>
            <li>honestly have seen a big difference, I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but I believe it would be the caster and jojoba</li>
            <li>Yeah, no harsh chemical sulfates, etc.</li>
            <li>old)</li>
            <li>This scrub is not harsh.</li>
            <li>I appreciate its all natural ingredients but for some reason they loaded it with fragrance,i guess without it,the smell would be off putting,(anyone allergic to fragrance</li>
            <li>I love the tiny beads that help scrub your face and remove any dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>This product (Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore Scrub) dried out our skin and caused more problems than we had prior to it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I really like this, because it barely has a fragrance, barely detectable.</li>
            <li>I have always had large pores but most other products were too harsh or had contents I did not like.</li>
            <li>I do not love the smell, which is a little too strong and sweet for my taste, but again, given the natural ingredients, I prefer this over others.</li>
            <li>Make sure you moisturize afterwards to avoid that tight, dry feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be considering other products to see if I can find that \\&quot;miracle worker\\&quot; so many other Amazon reviewers have found, but in a pinch I&#x27;d pick this up again.</li>
            <li>I typically use gentle scrubs and cleansers for my face,but this one oddly is to gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a liar; just a ~21 year old female trying to get clear skin after 10+ years of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, any kind of harsh products or germs to the face will cause me to have a small breakout.</li>
            <li>I used to use harsh face washes like Proactiv and Clean &amp; Clear, things with long chemical names I couldn&#x27;t pronounce, because I thought those would kill the acne.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and use this scrub daily without problems.  </li>
            <li>and this gets rid of that, not harsh, and is used daily</li>
            <li>Also, because the label on the back is black and not green, that means that the product is all chemicals, there is nothing natural in it.</li>

            <li> I was using Neutrogena Pore Refining daily cleanser (blue color pump) and 1/3 of the bottle I developed too harsh on my skin with blister that won’t heal for several months.  </li>
            <li> If you have average skin, not prone to major breakouts that just needs daily maintenance, I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There are a few little beads to help exfoliate, and they aren&#x27;t hard or coarse like most scrubs, and there&#x27;s only a few here and there.</li>
            <li> The other one I use is their Purifying Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> did not help my acne and is extremely dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for dry skin people</li>
            <li> I have dry skin with acne</li>
            <li> Somehow the little scrubbing beads were getting in my eyes and getting stuck under my upper eye lid.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I never went back to Neutrogena, until a few days ago when my aunt bought this face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not every face wash is for everyone, so I&#x27;m not promising this will work for you; you have to know your skin.</li>
            <li> The night cream is not as thick and heavy as a lot of night creams can be, so that may be good or bad depending on preference.</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn’t do damaged like the other bottle.</li>
            <li> She was frustrated with her acne and tried another product which made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I got huge, painful zits in places</li>
            <li> The bumps have gone down a ton, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use a few other Neutrogena Naturals products: their night cream and lip balm.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ended up at the eye doctor several times before I realized the culprit was my facial scrub.  </li>
            <li> my face was half the redness</li>
            <li> When I was in middle school, I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s orange colored oil free acne wash, and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> The scrub helps me feel that my pores are getting cleaned without being harsh.</li>
            <li> It was from that Neutrogena was way too harsh on my face even though I reduced to wash my face 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> We will see after few months.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather up, but it does the job without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is bad enough to have an artificial fragrance in a natural product, and it is way worse that the fragrance is super sense-assaulting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too thick for my preference and a little greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually use this before the scrub.</li>
            <li> I then follow it with a generous amount of Olay&#x27;s hydrating \\&quot;beauty fluid\\&quot; moisturizer, and that&#x27;s usually it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for over a year and have had very few breakouts since I started using it.</li>
            <li> not just keep my acne from getting worse like every other thing I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is so strong and horrible of a smell.</li>
            <li> know, this sounds fake, and I don&#x27;t blame you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scrubbing is very thin</li>
            <li> I used to use Origins Cover Your Mouth, which I can no longer find, and at something like $14 or $16, it just was crazy expensive.</li>
            <li> Come on - if you are going to come out with a naturals line, ditch the artificial fragrance!!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s horrible for removing makeup, after using this, i wipe my face with a toner and their is loads of makeup still on my face, i wont repurchase this one.</li>

            <li> The scrub helps me feel that my pores are getting cleaned without being harsh. I have been using this soap for over a year and have had very few breakouts since I started using it. Gentle yet cleansing.</li>
            <li> I like this product because I can use it on a daily basis unlike the Apricot Scrub by Burt&#x27;s Bees.  But I do not think that this product is as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as they say.  Yes it states the DERIVATIVES of the chemicals, but it does not say that the chemicals are extracted form these plants exactly.  Also, because the label on the back is black and not green, that means that the product is all chemicals, there is nothing natural in it.</li>
            <li> Love the new Naturals line from Neutrogena! This pore scrub is just as good as other high end products but a great price!</li>
            <li> Yeah, no harsh chemical sulfates, etc. etc., but boy is this product FRAGRANCE-LOADED.  Ick.  Doesn&#x27;t this defeat the purpose of creating more natural products?</li>
            <li> smells so good, yet is not irritating to skin</li>
            <li> Nice smell, skin feels really smooth after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of things for my husband to use to clean his face, but this is the only thing that he&#x27;s ever LIKED using. There&#x27;s not a heavy fragrance and there&#x27;s just enough of an exfoliater in it to make him feel like he&#x27;s getting his face clean without it being peeled off or getting caught in stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months, and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. My face is very acne prone, but when using this product twice a day my skin looks better then it has ever looked. I love the tiny beads that help scrub your face and remove any dead skin cells. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite product I have used yet and would recommend it to anybody. The price on amazon is also much cheaper then the store, so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was using Neutrogena Pore Refining daily cleanser (blue color pump) and 1/3 of the bottle I developed too harsh on my skin with blister that won’t heal for several months.  I thought it was skin cancer so I went to see Dermatologist.  It was from that Neutrogena was way too harsh on my face even though I reduced to wash my face 3 times a week.  I never have problem with my skin before (47 yrs. old) I switched to this Neutrogena for over a month now and it works fantastic, smell nice, feel clean and looks clean.  We will see after few months.  I hope it doesn’t do damaged like the other bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. It prevents major breakouts, smells really nice, and my face feels nice and clean afterwards. Make sure you moisturize afterwards to avoid that tight, dry feeling. After two months of near-daily use, I&#x27;m about to run out. If you have average skin, not prone to major breakouts that just needs daily maintenance, I&#x27;d recommend this product. It&#x27;s no miracle worker, but my pores have shrank and for the most part I don&#x27;t break out unmanageably. I&#x27;ll be considering other products to see if I can find that \\&quot;miracle worker\\&quot; so many other Amazon reviewers have found, but in a pinch I&#x27;d pick this up again.</li>
            <li> Works OK.....some blackhead reduction at first, now I can&#x27;t really tell a difference after using for several months. .... ...</li>
            <li> I rarely break out but whenever I use this product, I break out within a day. My girlfriend gave this to me after she used it for several months. She was frustrated with her acne and tried another product which made a huge difference. This product (Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore Scrub) dried out our skin and caused more problems than we had prior to it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub several times.  Unfortunately I ended up at the eye doctor several times before I realized the culprit was my facial scrub.  Somehow the little scrubbing beads were getting in my eyes and getting stuck under my upper eye lid.  I had to get my eyes flushed several times.  I wasn&#x27;t rubbing my eye area with the scrub but somehow it was still getting in and stuck in my eyes.  I stopped using it and haven&#x27;t had an issue since.  I will say that maybe it&#x27;s something in my particular eye chemistry that made this happen... I don&#x27;t know that anyone else has experienced this.</li>
            <li> Chemical free!!! Yippie!!!! It&#x27;s a great exfoliant! I love that Neutrogena Naturals went natural!!! It&#x27;s Paraben and phthalate free and it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for and I hope that this line of product continues.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin feeling amazing without the dryness after being used compared to most facial salicylic acid containing washes. Great recommend. Product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have always had large pores but most other products were too harsh or had contents I did not like. This is a natural product I can feel good about, it does not have a strong odor, it performs wonderfully - the texture and appearance of my skin has never been better and I&#x27;m 56! Love, love, love this product! I&#x27;m now using the entire Neutrogena Naturals line.</li>
            <li> i love this face wash doesnt break me out or burn my eyes and works PREMIER!</li>
            <li> My issue was the length of delivery (two weeks)&lt;br /&gt;Scrubbing is very thin</li>
            <li> Great product!  Used it the night I received and the next morning! Feels great love the gentleness, smell!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at waltmart and found it here for a cheaper price. I love this product that&#x27;s all I have to say. It cleared my blemishes super fast, my face is clear, I love it,</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. For years, I used Aveeno&#x27;s facial scrub, and that was good too, but with more natural ingredients, I prefer this one. It exfoliates well, without being overly grainy and harsh like some kinds, so it&#x27;s great for daily use. It leaves my face feeling silky afterwards. I also use a few other Neutrogena Naturals products: their night cream and lip balm. The night cream is not as thick and heavy as a lot of night creams can be, so that may be good or bad depending on preference. I do not love the smell, which is a little too strong and sweet for my taste, but again, given the natural ingredients, I prefer this over others. Their lip balm, I love. I used to use Origins Cover Your Mouth, which I can no longer find, and at something like $14 or $16, it just was crazy expensive. NN Lip Balm smells, tastes, and feels pretty much the same, and at $3, it&#x27;s a no-brainer. The other one I use is their Purifying Facial Cleanser. I really like this, because it barely has a fragrance, barely detectable. It washes off cleanly without over-drying. I usually use this before the scrub.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliant! This scrub is not harsh. It is gentle product that brightens the skin nicely. I purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I actually had to write to the company to let them know how overpowering the fragrance is in this product.  The laughable part is that it&#x27;s supposed to be &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  No scent at all would be ideal but 1/10 of the current smell would seem the norm for a scented product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as if someone in the factory accidentally dumped a whole vat of fragrance in.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, any kind of harsh products or germs to the face will cause me to have a small breakout. I typically use gentle scrubs and cleansers for my face,but this one oddly is to gentle. I appreciate its all natural ingredients but for some reason they loaded it with fragrance,i guess without it,the smell would be off putting,(anyone allergic to fragrance,probably should avoid)nonetheless i find it to be just a mild cleanser, it&#x27;s horrible for removing makeup, after using this, i wipe my face with a toner and their is loads of makeup still on my face, i wont repurchase this one.</li>
            <li> Love my neutrogena. This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena! Come on - if you are going to come out with a naturals line, ditch the artificial fragrance!! I literally had to stop breathing in when using this product it is so strong and horrible of a smell. It is bad enough to have an artificial fragrance in a natural product, and it is way worse that the fragrance is super sense-assaulting. According to the EWG (environmental working group) an organization that does independent studies on the safety of products, fragrance is an 8 out of 10 toxic-wise, when it is advised to stick to products that are 3 or below. I wanted to like this product and was happy to see a so-called \\&quot;natural line.\\&quot; Ditch the fragrance neutrogena! You can&#x27;t be natural and have this toxic chemically smell radiating from your product!</li>
            <li> did not help my acne and is extremely dry I don&#x27;t recommend it for dry skin people</li>
            <li> My skin is very acne prone, it has been since I started the 6th grade and it hasn&#x27;t gone away since; I&#x27;m almost 21. I have tried every product there was. When I was in middle school, I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s orange colored oil free acne wash, and it was horrible. I never went back to Neutrogena, until a few days ago when my aunt bought this face scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked on the ingredients, and saw it included caster oil and jojoba oil, which is supposed to be great for acne prone skin. I was thinking about doing an oil wash, where you use oil to get rid of acne, but seemed suspicious about it. I decided to try this since I couldn&#x27;t find any stand alone caster or jojoba oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally the NEXT DAY my face was half the redness it was the day before. Three days later, my acne is still visible, but it&#x27;s not blotchy, red, and embarrassing like before. The bumps have gone down a ton, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, this sounds fake, and I don&#x27;t blame you. I&#x27;m not a liar; just a ~21 year old female trying to get clear skin after 10+ years of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every face wash is for everyone, so I&#x27;m not promising this will work for you; you have to know your skin. I used to use harsh face washes like Proactiv and Clean &amp; Clear, things with long chemical names I couldn&#x27;t pronounce, because I thought those would kill the acne. They didn&#x27;t. As I got older, I realized taking care of my skin was more than chemicals, and started leaning towards more natural face washes (which unfortunately are on the pricier side), but they seem to work the best on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash isn&#x27;t really a \\&quot;scrub,\\&quot; and I&#x27;m glad for that really. There are a few little beads to help exfoliate, and they aren&#x27;t hard or coarse like most scrubs, and there&#x27;s only a few here and there. It&#x27;s very light and gentle. The fragrance to me was light and pleasant; though I do agree that if you&#x27;re going for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; that you shouldn&#x27;t add fragrance; some people are allergic to that, or sensitive. When I goto rinse it off, first comes off the little beads, and then with a couple more rinses comes off the face wash, and I feel clean afterwards. I then follow it with a generous amount of Olay&#x27;s hydrating \\&quot;beauty fluid\\&quot; moisturizer, and that&#x27;s usually it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly have seen a big difference, I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but I believe it would be the caster and jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I can continue to use this, and I hope it continues to improve my skin, not just keep my acne from getting worse like every other thing I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with your gut, it won&#x27;t hurt to try this.</li>
            <li> Been using this product once to twice a day for about 2 weeks. I have dry skin with acne and I think my skin looks better. I love that it isn&#x27;t too rough yet still feels like my face gets cleaned. Price is comparable to stores and I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too thick for my preference and a little greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I even speculated whether it was breaking me out.&lt;br /&gt;Hm...pass.</li>
            <li> Its very light. Doesn&#x27;t lather up, but it does the job without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I got huge, painful zits in places I don&#x27;t normally break out - my cheeks, side of my jaw.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and use this scrub daily without problems.  Have seen an improvement in overall skin texture and pores.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore Scrub is the best. I use it every day and I use it to take my make-up off (even though it&#x27;s not for that) and it works like a charm. At the same time, I am scrubbing my face with it and afterwards my face is like a baby&#x27;s, soft and smooth and it does not dry the face out. I just love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh and rejuvenated! I have oily skin and this gets rid of that, not harsh, and is used daily</li>
