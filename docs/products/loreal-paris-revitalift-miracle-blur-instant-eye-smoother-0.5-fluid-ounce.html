            <li>This product is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Have used Miracle Blur face lotion and think it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I have used many products &amp; there just isn&#x27;t one that works unless we go under the knife!!</li>
            <li>Make up goes on so nice!</li>
            <li>It may work for others and good on you.</li>
            <li>and I love it !</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Some eye creams I&#x27;ve tried have that greasy feel that kind of lingers.</li>
            <li>This product does the job for about an hour, in that it really kind of blurs the area.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good eye cream!</li>
            <li>Works fair but wears off quickly</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li>Lets face it ladies we&#x27;re all looking for a miracle, right, but there isn&#x27;t one!!  </li>
            <li>Easy to care in your purse if needed</li>
            <li>It looks smoother and decreases fine lines.</li>
            <li>I started using it and didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Not sparkly fortunately.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I needed a full size one to try it out.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite one so far.</li>
            <li>As good as expected.</li>
            <li>Not even worth trying to return it.</li>
            <li>and I saw a positive change!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sasatisfied,  especially considering the price, and will buy more.</li>
            <li>I am an almost 70-year old woman, who has just developed bags under her eyes - big surprise and great dismay.</li>
            <li>I love this product I saw instant results.</li>
            <li>No idea if it works - like so many products for your skin, you&#x27;ll never really know if you&#x27;re hallucinating</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of it</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, It really help to blur my fines lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This one actually absorbs quickly, but gives you that hydrating plump feel.</li>
            <li>but I highly doubt it.</li>
            <li>I use the whole line of Miracle Blur all over my face, but this one is formulated for your sensitive under eye area.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of thick</li>
            <li>I would recommend the entire line to any woman who is just starting to show creases, to smooth them almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product even for older women it works very well enough to get through your daytime affairs.  </li>
            <li>After 1-2 hours the effect has worn off and the bags are clearly visible again.</li>
            <li>It is soothing and practically erases lines completely.  </li>
            <li>it irritates my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Super soft cream for the delicate under eye area.</li>
            <li>Shows up as white if it is not carefully massaged in .</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used Miracle Blur face lotion and think it&#x27;s great but this practically did nothing for me and also has a sort of greasy feel to it after putting it on.</li>
            <li> No. not impressed. See no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This appears to work for a short time, but has no permanent effects.</li>
            <li> Works well but it&#x27;s kind of thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about a year and it&#x27;s my favorite one so far. I&#x27;ve tried a few different ones. What I like about this one is the feel of the actual cream. Some eye creams I&#x27;ve tried have that greasy feel that kind of lingers. This one actually absorbs quickly, but gives you that hydrating plump feel.</li>
            <li> I have substantial under-eye circles, and bought a trial size of this at the drugstore.  One eye actually looks worse than the other, so I used the product on that eye for a week, and was surprised to notice that it actually looked better thethan the other.  So I started using it on the deep creases between my eyes, and around my lips, and saw improvement also.  The wrinkles are still there, but much less noticeable.  I&#x27;m sasatisfied,  especially considering the price, and will buy more.</li>
            <li> I use the whole line of Miracle Blur all over my face, but this one is formulated for your sensitive under eye area. It is soothing and practically erases lines completely.  I would recommend the entire line to any woman who is just starting to show creases, to smooth them almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I&#x27;ve tried many expensive brands, but only with Miracle Blur I&#x27;ve seen results in my dark circles problems</li>
            <li> Lets face it ladies we&#x27;re all looking for a miracle, right, but there isn&#x27;t one!!  I do not see any difference at all w/this product.  I do not recommend spending the money. I have used many products &amp; there just isn&#x27;t one that works unless we go under the knife!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this as a small sample and I felt like I needed a full size one to try it out. It seems like its working and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Super soft cream for the delicate under eye area. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days but I&#x27;ve already noticed less puffiness!</li>
            <li> I had tried the Miracle Blur for your face and wanted to give this a try.  I started using it and didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the fine lines under my eyes.  It is moisturizing under my eye but probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t work on the deeper wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t hold up all day (8 hours.)  Don&#x27;t expect miracles with this product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product even for older women it works very well enough to get through your daytime affairs.  Easy to care in your purse if needed</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that this did not work for me - I was using it for under eye bags! A very slight difference- but I did use it around the lines around my mouth- and I saw a positive change! I do buy a product for my under eye bags on Amazon and I will stick with that since it does work but much more expensive!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a miracle...</li>
            <li> No idea if it works - like so many products for your skin, you&#x27;ll never really know if you&#x27;re hallucinating or if it is making a difference. I judge by ow it feels going on and this feels great - cold tip makes you feel like it&#x27;s doing something, but it&#x27;s probably just cold that feels god as it rolls on. I use because of that, no idea if it&#x27;s making time roll backwards...but I highly doubt it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since last year and I love it !</li>
            <li> Shows up as white if it is not carefully massaged in .</li>
            <li> I am an almost 70-year old woman, who has just developed bags under her eyes - big surprise and great dismay. This product does the job for about an hour, in that it really kind of blurs the area. After 1-2 hours the effect has worn off and the bags are clearly visible again. I will have to keep on searching.</li>
            <li> As good as expected. Thanx.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good eye cream! I really like the texture of it, it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  I do notice a difference under my eyes. It looks smoother and decreases fine lines.</li>
            <li> Not a fan! I have been using L&#x27;oreal products \\&quot;designed\\&quot; for men for quite some time. I figured why not give this a try, especially at such a low cost. I see no improvement with my skin under the eyes. Quite the opposite. My eyes are puffy and swollen and it looks like I have not slept in days! I am not the only one who has noticed the puffiness under my eyes. Granted, it could just be my skin or a reaction I am having with the product. It may work for others and good on you. Either way it is now in the trash! Not even worth trying to return it.</li>
            <li> This product contains toxic ingredients, among them: Vinyl Dimethicone, PEG 9, PEG/PPG, Hydrolized Soy Protein (GMO), Bismuth Oxychloride, and ALUMINUM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Ingredients List:&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone, Water, Glycerin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Alcohol Denat., Butylene Glycol, Lauryl PEG 9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Boron Nitride, Mica, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), PEG/PPG 18/18 Dimethicone, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Bismuth Oxychloride (CI 77163), Silica Silylate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Magnesium Sulfate, Caffeine, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Retinyl Palmitate, Sodium Hydroxide, Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Farnesol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, N Hydroxysuccinimide, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Chrysin, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide 7</li>
            <li> Works fair but wears off quickly</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, It really help to blur my fines lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> it irritates my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Love it!  Make up goes on so nice!</li>
            <li> Not sparkly fortunately.</li>
            <li> I love this product I saw instant results. I never want to be without it. Its not greasy which I have found in some other eye creams.  I&#x27;m not sure if I should be wearing it at night but I have been.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write except it did not do anything. Rather disappointing after reading about its &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; ability to smooth lines.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Truly helps with my dark circles and leaves such a soft silky feeling on skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work all that well, despite claims.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this actually works as well as it does. My problem has always been dark circles and bags under my eyes. A swipe of this product and they&#x27;re practically invisible. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about a week now and have  definitely noticed a difference around my eyes.  Will continue to use.</li>
    </ol>
