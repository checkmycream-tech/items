            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!!! I am not satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> Best anti-perspirant, EVER!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all Amazon use to carry a brand drisol that work rally well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Driclor consistently for about 2 yrs. and it works the best.  This is coming from someone who&#x27;s used and tested Certain Dri, Klima, Drysol, and Sweat Block in the past 10 yrs with only some luck. Driclor works but be careful who you buy from, as some of these sellers have sold me defective products.  (refer to list below).  Just apply Driclor at night for 2-3 consecutive nights after washing/drying underams, rest for 2-3 days, then redo the 2-3 nights application.  Do this for about 3 weeks then gradually taper to applying 1-2 nights per wk and adjust accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;Sellers who have sold me defective Driclor bottle:&lt;br /&gt;- HealthLand&lt;br /&gt;- NWhealthcare&lt;br /&gt;Sellers whom I&#x27;ve had better luck with:&lt;br /&gt;- DirectKart&lt;br /&gt;- ebay user: direct-pharmacy</li>
            <li> The bottle I have received was little bit leaked and had no manufacture or expiry date or any other dates on it. I have contacted the seller and received an answer that expiry period is 12 months after opening. I assume this very unprofessional and irresponsible - how come this product is on the market without manufacturing/expiry dates on any other suggestions on the bottle about it and what practice on the earth is dictating expiry date by email after &amp;#34;opening&amp;#34;, for a bottle that is not even sealed and even leaking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted manufacturer GSK, hope they will have the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, several months ago, I bought this product in a local pharmacy store, it came with both dates and it worked.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a gift but she like it and other another which I haven&#x27;t received yet</li>
            <li> I have stress-induced excessive underarm sweating. I&#x27;ve tried lots of products, including Certain Dri, and nothing has worked like this. Follow the directions and stick with it for a two weeks and then you can use much less frequently.  It&#x27;s really a wonderful product that has changed my daily experience! For those suffering, I&#x27;ve also had great success from acupuncture...I think the joint approach will change your life!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best stuff ever - follow the directions and it works wonders. If all other &amp;#34;prescription strength&amp;#34; products have failed you - try this; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very good product that actually works.  Was a little skeptical when buying but the product has proven to work very well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Works just great (don&#x27;t apply if just shaved!). I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 4 years, and it saved me many times. Shipping was very quick. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Gave me a chemical burn under both arms. Be very careful to dry area. You should trim your under arm hair a day prior to using. Not to be used if you sweat at night.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> This product works well.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Burns a little but well worth it.</li>
            <li> working perfectly . love it !</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly. It does burn a bit like people have said, but nothing too unbearable. The first day I used it there were noticeable results. I am very pleased with this product and will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Helps a lot</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF DOES WORK, BUT, THE ONLY THING YOU CANNOT PUT IT ON AFTER GETTING OUT OF THE SHOWER, WHEN YOUR PORES ARE OPEN, BECAUSE IT WILL CAUSE BURNING.  I PUT IT ON THE NEXT DAY, BECAUSE, I DID NOT HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE.  I KEPT IT ON FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, THEN WASH IT OFF AND I  MADE SURE MY UNDERARMS WERE COMPLETELY DRY, BEFORE ADDING MY DEODORANT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD ANY SWEAT UNDER MY ARMS SINCE I USE IT, AND I AM A PERSON THAT SWEATS A WHOLE LOT, BEFORE USING THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, YES IT DOES WORK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIANE</li>
