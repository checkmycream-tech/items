            <li>Girlfriend loves this color looks very nice too</li>
            <li>And best of all, it has zero fragrance, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>very nice bright color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too bright like lavender</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied.</li>

            <li>I love purple lipsticks!</li>
            <li>I honestly love them!</li>
            <li>Nice violet color</li>
            <li>nice color, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color, super opaque, and surprisingly wearable.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly you don&#x27;t need to put on a lot of coats the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it though because it still looks nice</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this color for fall/winter..</li>
            <li>MY favorite lip color after the million that i have</li>
            <li>I love NYX</li>
            <li>it is more like a lavender color, not at all as the image.</li>
            <li>but Shaaanxo on you tube convinced me I would love it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain, I was glad to get it in time for an occasion</li>
            <li>so I love this color for that.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Lovely Purple lipstick.</li>
            <li>I was immediately in love with the quality of this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I like to blot it after putting it on because it seems even more matte that way.</li>
            <li>Not the color I ordered, but the lipstick itself is okay.</li>
            <li>Its more lavender than anything close to a &amp;#34;royal purple&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a light pinkish purple ...</li>
            <li>If you love wearing bold sexy lips</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear it everyday myself, but for those looking for a good purple color this is great.</li>
            <li>I loved highly recommended</li>
            <li>The formula applied evenly &amp; smoothly, &amp; was opaque.</li>
            <li>but slides on smoothly...</li>
            <li>The color is great with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>The lip color is actually a bit lighter and brighter than in the picture, but it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It is a pretty, matte finish, and it actually goes on purple and stays on for a good amount of time!</li>
            <li>The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li>and I put it on twice in a full  day.</li>
            <li>Way lighter, no a Bad color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really alot more wearable than you&#x27;d think, &amp; it&#x27;s the type of shade that looks great on it&#x27;s own, or mixed with other colors as well.</li>
            <li>does not really look good for my complexion, I am use to reds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a cute rich color.</li>
            <li>and she was right.</li>
            <li>will never purchase this particular lipstick again, but with that said I have ordered NYX products before and they have been fantastic, but with this one you will not get what you&#x27;re expecting to get from the look of the picture.</li>
            <li>and it was a dream and very easy to apply and almost the same price as this one</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful but the quality sucks.</li>
            <li>This is not a violet color, it&#x27;s more of a light pink.</li>
            <li>Next will be a great red from nyx.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and the product met my expectations.</li>
            <li>It ship very fast</li>
            <li>Great, creamy, long lasting lipstick.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The color looks nothing like royal purple, it is very pastel.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s totally fragrance free</li>
            <li>I was looking for a deep purple and this is just pastel light purple</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really use liner or primers so maybe that would help.</li>
            <li>Really like the color in the pic ...</li>
            <li>It was almost perfect, ypu just have to wear foundation as a base, for it to look more purple (the color blends in with the natural color of your lips)</li>
            <li>I was looking for a deep rich &amp;#34;royal purple&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The main picture for this product is very misleading.</li>
            <li>This is NOT as dark as shown in the picture, didn&#x27;t like the texture, and am sending it back and going with a gorgeous color I saw from Melt.....</li>
            <li>Also is not that easy to apply it not much creamy.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY suggest this product, you will NOT regret purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Was super excited to get this lipstick as I wear funky colors and have been looking for a deep dark purple.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t a big deal and still looks pretty (like a lip stain).</li>
            <li>I returned so many lipsticks back to Nordstroms for not lasting long and being streaky on my lips.</li>
            <li>Fades to hot pink though.</li>
            <li>but is Not dark at All</li>
            <li>Take the color that is shown and mix it 50/50 with pure white and that would be what the color actually is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances, to the point where I can&#x27;t really wear NYX round case lipsticks at all because of the scent.</li>
            <li>First time I used it the stick broke in half.</li>
            <li>This one is very pastel, I layer a dark berry underneath to remedy it.</li>
            <li>The color was a little lighter that I expected, but it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>

            <li> Would probably use it mixed with a dark red to make a &amp;#34;wine&amp;#34; shade (I hope it works.</li>
            <li> Better than my expensive brands I buy from Nordstroms!</li>
            <li> Way lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> REALLY DO NOT NEED NO STARS.</li>
            <li> a bit brighter than expected.</li>
            <li> The color of this lipstick is absolutely NOT the color shown in this picture.</li>
            <li> It does start to turn reddish, and then pink as it wears away</li>
            <li> If ur a plain jane its definitely not.  </li>
            <li> I have used other NYX products with no issue I just don&#x27;t like this shade and the texture on the lips.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely creamy and goes with a day or night time look</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait to get it in other colors too!</li>
            <li> This lip color slightly reminds me of MAC&#x27;s heroine except it&#x27;s a litfle lighter.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> The color online is misleading to say the least.</li>
            <li> JUST A DOWN THUMB!!!</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and paid a ridiculous price for it from amazon.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> IT IS ALSO NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a darker color since pale colors make me look sick.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Sadly didn&#x27;t get that</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Definitely a must have. Absolutely love this color for fall/winter..</li>
            <li> Way lighter than expected. This is not a violet color, it&#x27;s more of a light pink.</li>
            <li> It is a pastel... the picture is very different from the swatch. I opened it up and returned it.</li>
            <li> Was super excited to get this lipstick as I wear funky colors and have been looking for a deep dark purple. This is NOT as dark as shown in the picture, didn&#x27;t like the texture, and am sending it back and going with a gorgeous color I saw from Melt.....sorry</li>
            <li> The color looks nothing like royal purple, it is very pastel. The main picture for this product is very misleading. I will be returning the item.</li>
            <li> This item is not the color that was displayed online.</li>
            <li> This lipstick should have cost a dollar!!!! IT LOOKS OR FEELS NOTHING LIKE THE ILLUSTRATION. NEVER WILL BUY THIS BRAND AGAIN. BUT SO HAPPENED WHEN I ORDERED THIS COLOR I ORDERED THE ORANGE ONE. IT IS ALSO NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!! REALLY DO NOT NEED NO STARS. JUST A DOWN THUMB!!!</li>
            <li> The lip color is actually a bit lighter and brighter than in the picture, but it is AMAZING! MY favorite lip color after the million that i have</li>
            <li> LOVE this! It&#x27;s really alot more wearable than you&#x27;d think, &amp; it&#x27;s the type of shade that looks great on it&#x27;s own, or mixed with other colors as well. The formula applied evenly &amp; smoothly, &amp; was opaque. And best of all, it has zero fragrance, which is very important to me. I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances, to the point where I can&#x27;t really wear NYX round case lipsticks at all because of the scent. This is similar to the matte lipsticks in that it&#x27;s totally fragrance free, I can&#x27;t wait to get it in other colors too!</li>
            <li> It was almost perfect, ypu just have to wear foundation as a base, for it to look more purple (the color blends in with the natural color of your lips)</li>
            <li> Great shade, arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Nice violet color I love NYX</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not dha same color as the picture but i like it</li>
            <li> Color is deceiving. it&#x27;s actually lavender. but slides on smoothly...that&#x27;s why I did not return it.</li>
            <li> Not the same color as it looks. Even though it says it is a Royal Purple and has the same code on the tube as on the order it is more like a lavender color, not at all as the image. I was looking for a darker color since pale colors make me look sick. Would probably use it mixed with a dark red to make a &amp;#34;wine&amp;#34; shade (I hope it works. Also is not that easy to apply it not much creamy. I bought a Rimmel London red from the Kate Long Lasting line and it was a dream and very easy to apply and almost the same price as this one :/ I have used other NYX products with no issue I just don&#x27;t like this shade and the texture on the lips.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! It is a pretty, matte finish, and it actually goes on purple and stays on for a good amount of time!</li>
            <li> Great, creamy, long lasting lipstick. For an inexpensive product it is quality. Better than my expensive brands I buy from Nordstroms! I returned so many lipsticks back to Nordstroms for not lasting long and being streaky on my lips. This product is creamy and I put it on twice in a full  day. Never thought I would buy this brand but Shaaanxo on you tube convinced me I would love it and she was right. The color is great with yellow undertones. I get compliments when I wear this. Next will be a great red from nyx. But one thing, you can get this product for $6 on nyx site. They have been all out of it for a while and I needed it so I went ahead and paid a ridiculous price for it from amazon. I can&#x27;t complain, I was glad to get it in time for an occasion I needed it for. It went beautifully with my dress. It is a must buy if you have the guts to wear purple over the age of 40.  I&#x27;m 62 and I rocked it.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, super opaque, and surprisingly wearable.</li>
            <li> I loved highly recommended</li>
            <li> For what I need, this is perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it everyday myself, but for those looking for a good purple color this is great. I&#x27;m using it when we go to the Halloween party at Disney World (Cheshire Cat) so I love this color for that.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this color looks very nice too</li>
            <li> This lip color slightly reminds me of MAC&#x27;s heroine except it&#x27;s a litfle lighter. It&#x27;s such a cute rich color. The price is great and I can count on NYX to meet my expectations</li>
            <li> nice color, nice packaging.</li>
            <li> Not the color it says it is. I was looking for a deep purple and this is just pastel light purple</li>
            <li> very nice bright color. a bit brighter than expected.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick. Glides on smoothly you don&#x27;t need to put on a lot of coats the color is gorgeous. Beautiful standout lips for any skin tone</li>
            <li> I love purple lipsticks! This one is very pastel, I layer a dark berry underneath to remedy it.</li>
            <li> Lovely Purple lipstick. Statement lip color. Fades to hot pink though.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted. The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li> Way lighter, no a Bad color but is Not dark at All</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same purple as in the picture it&#x27;s too bright like lavender</li>
            <li> The color that&#x27;s I received is not the color on this photo...I was looking for a deep rich &amp;#34;royal purple&amp;#34; like shown in the picture but it&#x27;s more of a light pinkish purple ...I&#x27;m glad I got it though because it still looks nice and it&#x27;s extremely creamy and goes with a day or night time look</li>
            <li> I was immediately in love with the quality of this lipstick. I got it in a sufficient amount of time and in perfect condition. I was very satisfied. Everything I was expecting. I HIGHLY suggest this product, you will NOT regret purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The color of this lipstick is absolutely NOT the color shown in this picture. Take the color that is shown and mix it 50/50 with pure white and that would be what the color actually is. Its so pastel purple it&#x27;s cartoonish, will never purchase this particular lipstick again, but with that said I have ordered NYX products before and they have been fantastic, but with this one you will not get what you&#x27;re expecting to get from the look of the picture.</li>
            <li> I honestly love them! I also order the blue velvet from here and I also loved it! It ship very fast it only took like 3 days to get here. I&#x27;m one happy camper with these lipsticks(:</li>
            <li> This  color is nothing like on the picture</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick. The color was a little lighter that I expected, but it&#x27;s very pretty. I like to blot it after putting it on because it seems even more matte that way. I wish the lipstick stayed on longer but I don&#x27;t really use liner or primers so maybe that would help. It does start to turn reddish, and then pink as it wears away but it isn&#x27;t a big deal and still looks pretty (like a lip stain).</li>
            <li> Not the color I ordered, but the lipstick itself is okay.</li>
            <li> does not really look good for my complexion, I am use to reds.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful but the quality sucks. First time I used it the stick broke in half.</li>
            <li> Color is totally different what shown in the pic... Really like the color in the pic ... Sadly didn&#x27;t get that</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and the product met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The color online is misleading to say the least. I ordered this thinking it was deep purple. It is not. Its more lavender than anything close to a &amp;#34;royal purple&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The best purple shade ever!!! So in love with this color!!! The perfect purple. Seriously! If you love wearing bold sexy lips this is the color for you. If ur a plain jane its definitely not.  The prettiest purple ive ever had on my lips. My husband loves ths on me!!</li>
