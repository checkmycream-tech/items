            <li>It truly provides an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>and It was the best choice ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all types of razors trying to find the best one for me and the Schick Hydro 3 is the one!</li>
            <li>I then decided to try all types of razors on my search to the best shave for me.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>So, yeah, I am very happy with this order.</li>
            <li>Love that this came with a travel case!!!</li>
            <li>this one is very good for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still happy with my Mach 3 and until something beats it I\\&quot;ll be using it.</li>
            <li>Schick seem quite proud of their hydro-goo.  </li>
            <li>But then I realized that I did not get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t nick myself, it&#x27;s a great close shave.</li>
            <li>It Just didn&#x27;t have a good feel</li>
            <li>Well its good,</li>
            <li>Good product, good price.</li>
            <li>It is well superior to Gillette&#x27;s Mach3 and Sensor.</li>
            <li>good news is that it is compatible with Hydro 3 replacement blades if you can find em.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>and I noticed the Hydro 3 was saying it was good.    </li>
            <li>I wanted something cheaper but just as good to replace</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and it was in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I use a men&#x27;s razor now and get an awesome, silky smooth shave.</li>
            <li>i am very pleased with this item, i bought it for my nephew because he tried mine</li>
            <li>Fusion Proglide gets great reviews and many say the shave experience is even better that Schick!</li>
            <li>works great, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I thought \\&quot;This is amazing</li>
            <li>and he liked it</li>
            <li>but that was my own fault.  </li>
            <li>This razor is the best safety razor to-date for men with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>By far the best razor I have used, period.    </li>
            <li>The most amazing shave I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not as good as a DE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a very smooth shave</li>
            <li>the shave is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The Hydro 3 adds one more blade and shaves very smoothly, virtually no nicks after about three years of use.</li>
            <li>If you have a thicker beard the 5-blade may work better.  </li>
            <li>this is way better than the fusion and the mach 3.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro 3 blade razor is better than the 5 blade.</li>
            <li>I did not agree more razors made a better shave</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t got more that 4 days of shaving out of one blade.</li>
            <li>but I love it...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say better</li>
            <li>then the mach 3.The blades can pivot better, shave closer, and there is a LOT on the lubricant strip.</li>
            <li>Their shaving systems are without a doubt well designed and have earned them the top position in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That requires me to think more of \\&quot;pressing\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;dragging\\&quot; the blade.  </li>
            <li>They seldom offer better performance, but many people *feel* like their bolt-on modification</li>
            <li>Been shaving many years.  </li>
            <li>i just want a razor, so i am certainly satisfied with that.</li>
            <li>He tried the 2 blade one, but says this 3 blade one is better because it doesn&#x27;t irritate, and leaves a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>and I am GLAD</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor and I would totally recommend it over the pro glide.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to this from the Mach 3 and it is hands-down a much better shave.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I thought I would share about my input on the Schick Hydro 3.    </li>
            <li>I love it to death.  </li>
            <li>Just love it</li>
            <li>Hydro3 is more than labeled: better than Mach3.</li>
            <li>I had to stop and touch my face where I shaved just to make sure</li>
            <li>Try this razor, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m selling all my vintage razors now:)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have used this razor the &amp;#34;Schick Hydro 3 Blade Razor&amp;#34;, haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any store for months now.</li>
            <li>i love all schick razors.  </li>
            <li>After  months long searches, I found that the Hydr3 is the best product of all those many products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>good grip, easy to replace the blades, great product overall.</li>
            <li>Deal was true good to be true.</li>
            <li>My research found that the best price for replacement blades is here on Amazon as long as they continue to offer free shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Retraining complete, I must say I&#x27;m getting great shaves.  </li>
            <li>is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used the gilette razors as well and always found schick to be much more comfortable and a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve also tried the 5 blade version of this razor, and the 5 blade is definitely much more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>do pretty well with a DE, but honestly I find the Hydro 3 more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever liked a razor so well that I wanted to tell people.  </li>
            <li>As someone who&#x27;s used the Mach 3 for around 10 years, I can safely say that the Hydro 3 is a worthy competitor.</li>
            <li>It really added a nice comfortable glide which my fusion just can&#x27;t match.  </li>
            <li>An a huge shock.  </li>
            <li>the Shick Hydro 3 blade razor, you don&#x27;t have to worry about how to position the shaver and get a smooth shave all the time.</li>
            <li>yes for  smooth clean shaves the  answer</li>
            <li>This razor was light and flexible and really conforms to your skin to make sure you don&#x27;t get any cuts.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t anything special</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor hoping it would be better than my very reliable Mach 3 turbo.</li>
            <li>It shaves OK, and I really like the lubricating reservoir it employs.  </li>
            <li>is true for Gillette.</li>
            <li>Has the appearance of shaving through a face full of snot.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad razor</li>
            <li>Sometimes I get lucky once in a while and don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>these are very high dollar razors so to gt them for this little money as an add on was great and amazon should do this more</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive facial skin and after trying many, many, many razors, I have settles on the Hydro line.</li>
            <li>it offers a very smooth</li>
            <li>I was little skeptic but it works great.</li>
            <li>they always  were far better than gillet .</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve primarily used traditional double-edged razors (\\&quot;DE\\&quot;) for many years.  </li>
            <li>And most other razors haven&#x27;t done much better.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a 5 blade one he tried but you always have to have the right angle to get all blades on your face.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>So basically its like getting lotion put on your face right after shaving.  </li>
            <li>They are somewhat right, but I was given the tip</li>
            <li>Razor does very good job of cutting smoothly and gives a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>All in all the Schick Hydro is a fantastic new razor, focused on the comfortability of your skin...</li>
            <li>Very comfortable handle &amp; sufficient lubricant to last a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>, I can get an exceptionally comfortable shave (more so than with any other razor I&#x27;ve used), and also quite a close shave.  </li>
            <li>lubricating strip is great for first shave and then withers away to nothing [better off w/o the thing altogether,] stand does not retain razor very well [useless in a travel bag because razor falls right off]  </li>
            <li>I always had a bit of irritation from the M3, thanks to my sensitive skin and the H3 certainly feels a bit better in that department.</li>
            <li>From my first shave and on I could tell my Fusion would be collecting dust.  </li>
            <li>He raved about the shaving experience and results and the ability to re-use sometimes more than one week of shaving daily.</li>
            <li>So the research began and while I can say for the most part I have been a Gillette man, was open to trying something else.</li>
            <li>For now I&#x27;m totally pleased with Schick and foresee the next upgrade addressing shaving the moustache area.</li>
            <li>I started out with a no name brand razor when I first started shaving.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and it has been a great shave and a really close shave as well.</li>
            <li>I consider my beard to be light and my skin to be sensitive.  </li>
            <li>First off it claimed to have another blade in the package but didn&#x27;t .  </li>
            <li>I first tried the 5 blade, Quattro, and the Shick throwaways.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>When I first put it to my face</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;lubricating strip\\&quot; is at the top of the razor so it lubricates after the actual shaving is done.  </li>
            <li>(I just changed my blade for the first time in 3 weeks, shaving about 3 times a week).</li>
            <li>pretty soon I will replace it.    </li>
            <li>I have been using the same cartridge for more than 2 months and cannot tell any difference from the day one.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s cheap, and effective, but clogs easily.&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t owned long enough to see if it&#x27;s worth it, but I&#x27;ll try to update in a month, or if it runs out sooner.</li>
            <li>in all, though, a really great shaver that cuts through my super-tough, thick beard without chopping up my face.  </li>
            <li>I got my Schick Hydro 3 this morning and used it for the first time</li>
            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t pay for next day shipping.</li>
            <li>made a positive difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 years old and have tried nearly every shaving product on the planet with the only exception being Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide which I hear is exceptional as well.</li>
            <li>It has been going strong the same cartridge,</li>
            <li>This is because the bar that holds the lubricating strip is twice as large as the lubrication strip on the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>aside from it&#x27;s bulk (it resembles a large rectangular Lego block)</li>
            <li>I love the hydro 3, much closer comfortable shave than the competition and the blades last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I used mornally could last most a little more than a month.</li>
            <li>Very Close shave.</li>
            <li>It felt like I was shaving a freshly very close shaved face.</li>
            <li>I look forward to shaving but so far this has been fun.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t just twist my wrist and scrape the blades straight up my neck to my chin, for example.</li>
            <li>I changed to the 5-blade cartridges (which can be used with this handle) and much prefer their performance as well as having a trimmer.</li>
            <li>but only if you can get the refills cheap.</li>
            <li>Schick absolutely has a winner here</li>
            <li>The real problem is the lubrication strip.  </li>
            <li>The lubrication system feels like you&#x27;re shaving on clouds and it lasts much longer than the Mach 3</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The lubrication strip really seems to work.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this razor.</li>
            <li>And fast.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the goo from the rubber strip much either.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily get under my nose and down the different angels of my neck.  </li>
            <li>had some extra blades but had lost the original razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tying it largely in protest to the high price of Gillette blade pricing.  </li>
            <li>The main selling point is that the refills are a lot cheaper and more than adequate for the job, for me at least.</li>
            <li>Still not bad for shaving one&#x27;s entire head.</li>
            <li>Whatever you do get off the fence and experience a new level in shaving!</li>
            <li>The hydro 3 will last 4-5 shaves but requires more pressure on the blades to cut close enough.</li>
            <li>a 3 blade razor is here that has a decent life-span for each blade-set.  </li>
            <li>In particular, the area immediately below my nostrils was unshaven.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended; try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor .</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this over the gillette products.  </li>
            <li>It can be done but it takes a little more time/patients.</li>
            <li>Like the three blade version a little better than the five blade razor design.</li>
            <li>For one the blades are super sharp and I nicked myself on the first shave.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, i am Asian with little facial hair and the quality pretty good.</li>
            <li>But once the reservoir was wet, it let out a fantastic gliding gel.  </li>
            <li>something many of us have been missing.</li>
            <li>One of the most things I disliked about the razor was the handle.</li>
            <li>I have only nicked myself once and that was mostly my fault for being in a hurry and doing a dry shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are sharp, but they just didn&#x27;t give me that smooth feeling that we all want.</li>
            <li>New gel reservoir works</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this new razor because the mach 3 blades shave well.</li>
            <li>The mach 3 shaves my entire skull only twice and requires light pressure while shaving to avoid cuts.</li>
            <li>The razor I used mostly over the past 15+ years off and on has been Sensor3.</li>
            <li>,] blades last significantly longer, construction is solid, does not cut skin, no irritation to skin</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This new razor is fantastic and the blades are LESS than the Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say how long the blades will last, but I enjoy the close shave and look forward to using this product for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Then on top of it the lubricating gel that&#x27;s normally in raisers slowly comes out each time you use</li>
            <li>a solid cut on my chin is certainly a possibility.    </li>
            <li>What I love about this razor is the fact even if I accidentally press the blade too hard it will not cut into my skin.  </li>
            <li>The experience turned me off completely and I went to electric razors.</li>
            <li>There for I warn each of you stay far away from this product .</li>
            <li>He only wants this one.  </li>
            <li>It felt like I was shaving with an old razor or like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>burn: first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>but I guess we old geezers must learn to adjust.</li>
            <li>Needless to say this isn&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li>The new Schick Hydro gives a fantastic close shave with very little skin aggravation.  </li>
            <li>I mean to tell you baby-butt smooth!</li>
            <li>After you get the razor wet, the gel strips gets really slimey and your legs feel slick and kind of gross.</li>
            <li>First I should mention different men have different skin.  </li>
            <li>this particular razor comes with an extra blade and a plastic cover for the razor while traveling.  </li>
            <li>The first pass left my face with a closer shave than a third pass with a D/E razor.</li>
            <li>Recently a friend highly recommended Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li>so long I really can&#x27;t compare the two.</li>
            <li>While it feels a bit bulky and awkward in the hand (probably b/c I&#x27;ve been using Mach3 for years), it does give me a nice clean shave without having to go over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li>Recently got one of these new hydro razors .</li>
            <li>Because I can buy cartridges for the hydro 3 at half the price I figured it would be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>It is dispensed on the trailing edge of the drag, so it can only be effective on the second pass... which really isn&#x27;t necessary with these sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not using it any longer and went back to my old razor.</li>
            <li>(More than three blades is a completely unnecessary.)</li>
            <li>After the first pass there were some stubble spots due to my technique and face shape and all that needed was a little hot water and some quick touch-up swipes as the gel reservoirs kept the skin slick for the blades to just glide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never had a better shave from any other razor I&#x27;ve used over the past 43 years of shaving, not one.  </li>
            <li>This Hydro (and apparently many other newer razors) has something like a 20-degree angle; the head&#x27;s so flat that I can&#x27;t get the usual leverage</li>
            <li>but none the less I ventured into that arena many many times and was disappointed.</li>
            <li>Both the Hydro 3 and 5 seems to work very well; however, the Hydro 3 is a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether it is the gel (which is dispensed very liberally) or the blade design (which has little protection bars that reduce the blades&#x27; impact on the skin), but the total effect is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Well its good,</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> It is well superior to Gillette&#x27;s Mach3 and Sensor.</li>
            <li> good news is that it is compatible with Hydro 3 replacement blades if you can find em.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> and I noticed the Hydro 3 was saying it was good.    </li>
            <li> I wanted something cheaper but just as good to replace</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and it was in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I use a men&#x27;s razor now and get an awesome, silky smooth shave.</li>
            <li> i am very pleased with this item, i bought it for my nephew because he tried mine</li>
            <li> Fusion Proglide gets great reviews and many say the shave experience is even better that Schick!</li>
            <li> works great, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I thought \\&quot;This is amazing</li>
            <li> and he liked it</li>
            <li> but that was my own fault.  </li>
            <li> This razor is the best safety razor to-date for men with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> By far the best razor I have used, period.    </li>
            <li> The most amazing shave I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not as good as a DE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a very smooth shave</li>
            <li> the shave is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The Hydro 3 adds one more blade and shaves very smoothly, virtually no nicks after about three years of use.</li>
            <li> If you have a thicker beard the 5-blade may work better.  </li>
            <li> this is way better than the fusion and the mach 3.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro 3 blade razor is better than the 5 blade.</li>
            <li> I did not agree more razors made a better shave</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t got more that 4 days of shaving out of one blade.</li>
            <li> but I love it...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say better</li>
            <li> then the mach 3.The blades can pivot better, shave closer, and there is a LOT on the lubricant strip.</li>
            <li> Their shaving systems are without a doubt well designed and have earned them the top position in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That requires me to think more of \\&quot;pressing\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;dragging\\&quot; the blade.  </li>
            <li> They seldom offer better performance, but many people *feel* like their bolt-on modification</li>
            <li> Been shaving many years.  </li>
            <li> i just want a razor, so i am certainly satisfied with that.</li>
            <li> He tried the 2 blade one, but says this 3 blade one is better because it doesn&#x27;t irritate, and leaves a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> and I am GLAD</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor and I would totally recommend it over the pro glide.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this from the Mach 3 and it is hands-down a much better shave.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I thought I would share about my input on the Schick Hydro 3.    </li>
            <li> I love it to death.  </li>
            <li> Just love it</li>
            <li> Hydro3 is more than labeled: better than Mach3.</li>
            <li> I had to stop and touch my face where I shaved just to make sure</li>
            <li> Try this razor, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m selling all my vintage razors now:)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor the &amp;#34;Schick Hydro 3 Blade Razor&amp;#34;, haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any store for months now.</li>
            <li> i love all schick razors.  </li>
            <li> After  months long searches, I found that the Hydr3 is the best product of all those many products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> good grip, easy to replace the blades, great product overall.</li>
            <li> Deal was true good to be true.</li>
            <li> My research found that the best price for replacement blades is here on Amazon as long as they continue to offer free shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Retraining complete, I must say I&#x27;m getting great shaves.  </li>
            <li> is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used the gilette razors as well and always found schick to be much more comfortable and a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve also tried the 5 blade version of this razor, and the 5 blade is definitely much more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> do pretty well with a DE, but honestly I find the Hydro 3 more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever liked a razor so well that I wanted to tell people.  </li>
            <li> As someone who&#x27;s used the Mach 3 for around 10 years, I can safely say that the Hydro 3 is a worthy competitor.</li>
            <li> It really added a nice comfortable glide which my fusion just can&#x27;t match.  </li>
            <li> An a huge shock.  </li>
            <li> the Shick Hydro 3 blade razor, you don&#x27;t have to worry about how to position the shaver and get a smooth shave all the time.</li>
            <li> yes for  smooth clean shaves the  answer</li>
            <li> This razor was light and flexible and really conforms to your skin to make sure you don&#x27;t get any cuts.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t anything special</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor hoping it would be better than my very reliable Mach 3 turbo.</li>
            <li> It shaves OK, and I really like the lubricating reservoir it employs.  </li>
            <li> is true for Gillette.</li>
            <li> Has the appearance of shaving through a face full of snot.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad razor</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get lucky once in a while and don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> these are very high dollar razors so to gt them for this little money as an add on was great and amazon should do this more</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive facial skin and after trying many, many, many razors, I have settles on the Hydro line.</li>
            <li> it offers a very smooth</li>
            <li> I was little skeptic but it works great.</li>
            <li> they always  were far better than gillet .</li>
            <li> Worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve primarily used traditional double-edged razors (\\&quot;DE\\&quot;) for many years.  </li>
            <li> And most other razors haven&#x27;t done much better.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a 5 blade one he tried but you always have to have the right angle to get all blades on your face.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> So basically its like getting lotion put on your face right after shaving.  </li>
            <li> They are somewhat right, but I was given the tip</li>
            <li> Razor does very good job of cutting smoothly and gives a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> All in all the Schick Hydro is a fantastic new razor, focused on the comfortability of your skin...</li>
            <li> Very comfortable handle &amp; sufficient lubricant to last a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> , I can get an exceptionally comfortable shave (more so than with any other razor I&#x27;ve used), and also quite a close shave.  </li>
            <li> lubricating strip is great for first shave and then withers away to nothing [better off w/o the thing altogether,] stand does not retain razor very well [useless in a travel bag because razor falls right off]  </li>
            <li> I always had a bit of irritation from the M3, thanks to my sensitive skin and the H3 certainly feels a bit better in that department.</li>
            <li> From my first shave and on I could tell my Fusion would be collecting dust.  </li>
            <li> He raved about the shaving experience and results and the ability to re-use sometimes more than one week of shaving daily.</li>
            <li> So the research began and while I can say for the most part I have been a Gillette man, was open to trying something else.</li>
            <li> For now I&#x27;m totally pleased with Schick and foresee the next upgrade addressing shaving the moustache area.</li>
            <li> I started out with a no name brand razor when I first started shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and it has been a great shave and a really close shave as well.</li>
            <li> I consider my beard to be light and my skin to be sensitive.  </li>
            <li> First off it claimed to have another blade in the package but didn&#x27;t .  </li>
            <li> I first tried the 5 blade, Quattro, and the Shick throwaways.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> When I first put it to my face</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;lubricating strip\\&quot; is at the top of the razor so it lubricates after the actual shaving is done.  </li>
            <li> (I just changed my blade for the first time in 3 weeks, shaving about 3 times a week).</li>
            <li> pretty soon I will replace it.    </li>
            <li> I have been using the same cartridge for more than 2 months and cannot tell any difference from the day one.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s cheap, and effective, but clogs easily.&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t owned long enough to see if it&#x27;s worth it, but I&#x27;ll try to update in a month, or if it runs out sooner.</li>
            <li> in all, though, a really great shaver that cuts through my super-tough, thick beard without chopping up my face.  </li>
            <li> I got my Schick Hydro 3 this morning and used it for the first time</li>
            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t pay for next day shipping.</li>
            <li> made a positive difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old and have tried nearly every shaving product on the planet with the only exception being Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide which I hear is exceptional as well.</li>
            <li> It has been going strong the same cartridge,</li>
            <li> This is because the bar that holds the lubricating strip is twice as large as the lubrication strip on the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> aside from it&#x27;s bulk (it resembles a large rectangular Lego block)</li>
            <li> I love the hydro 3, much closer comfortable shave than the competition and the blades last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I used mornally could last most a little more than a month.</li>
            <li> Very Close shave.</li>
            <li> It felt like I was shaving a freshly very close shaved face.</li>
            <li> I look forward to shaving but so far this has been fun.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t just twist my wrist and scrape the blades straight up my neck to my chin, for example.</li>
            <li> I changed to the 5-blade cartridges (which can be used with this handle) and much prefer their performance as well as having a trimmer.</li>
            <li> but only if you can get the refills cheap.</li>
            <li> Schick absolutely has a winner here</li>
            <li> The real problem is the lubrication strip.  </li>
            <li> The lubrication system feels like you&#x27;re shaving on clouds and it lasts much longer than the Mach 3</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The lubrication strip really seems to work.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this razor.</li>
            <li> And fast.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the goo from the rubber strip much either.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily get under my nose and down the different angels of my neck.  </li>
            <li> had some extra blades but had lost the original razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tying it largely in protest to the high price of Gillette blade pricing.  </li>
            <li> The main selling point is that the refills are a lot cheaper and more than adequate for the job, for me at least.</li>
            <li> Still not bad for shaving one&#x27;s entire head.</li>
            <li> Whatever you do get off the fence and experience a new level in shaving!</li>
            <li> The hydro 3 will last 4-5 shaves but requires more pressure on the blades to cut close enough.</li>
            <li> a 3 blade razor is here that has a decent life-span for each blade-set.  </li>
            <li> In particular, the area immediately below my nostrils was unshaven.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended; try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor .</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this over the gillette products.  </li>
            <li> It can be done but it takes a little more time/patients.</li>
            <li> Like the three blade version a little better than the five blade razor design.</li>
            <li> For one the blades are super sharp and I nicked myself on the first shave.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, i am Asian with little facial hair and the quality pretty good.</li>
            <li> But once the reservoir was wet, it let out a fantastic gliding gel.  </li>
            <li> something many of us have been missing.</li>
            <li> One of the most things I disliked about the razor was the handle.</li>
            <li> I have only nicked myself once and that was mostly my fault for being in a hurry and doing a dry shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are sharp, but they just didn&#x27;t give me that smooth feeling that we all want.</li>
            <li> New gel reservoir works</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this new razor because the mach 3 blades shave well.</li>
            <li> The mach 3 shaves my entire skull only twice and requires light pressure while shaving to avoid cuts.</li>
            <li> The razor I used mostly over the past 15+ years off and on has been Sensor3.</li>
            <li> ,] blades last significantly longer, construction is solid, does not cut skin, no irritation to skin</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This new razor is fantastic and the blades are LESS than the Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say how long the blades will last, but I enjoy the close shave and look forward to using this product for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Then on top of it the lubricating gel that&#x27;s normally in raisers slowly comes out each time you use</li>
            <li> a solid cut on my chin is certainly a possibility.    </li>
            <li> What I love about this razor is the fact even if I accidentally press the blade too hard it will not cut into my skin.  </li>
            <li> The experience turned me off completely and I went to electric razors.</li>
            <li> There for I warn each of you stay far away from this product .</li>
            <li> He only wants this one.  </li>
            <li> It felt like I was shaving with an old razor or like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> burn: first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> but I guess we old geezers must learn to adjust.</li>
            <li> Needless to say this isn&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li> The new Schick Hydro gives a fantastic close shave with very little skin aggravation.  </li>
            <li> I mean to tell you baby-butt smooth!</li>
            <li> After you get the razor wet, the gel strips gets really slimey and your legs feel slick and kind of gross.</li>
            <li> First I should mention different men have different skin.  </li>
            <li> this particular razor comes with an extra blade and a plastic cover for the razor while traveling.  </li>
            <li> The first pass left my face with a closer shave than a third pass with a D/E razor.</li>
            <li> Recently a friend highly recommended Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> so long I really can&#x27;t compare the two.</li>
            <li> While it feels a bit bulky and awkward in the hand (probably b/c I&#x27;ve been using Mach3 for years), it does give me a nice clean shave without having to go over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li> Recently got one of these new hydro razors .</li>
            <li> Because I can buy cartridges for the hydro 3 at half the price I figured it would be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> It is dispensed on the trailing edge of the drag, so it can only be effective on the second pass... which really isn&#x27;t necessary with these sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not using it any longer and went back to my old razor.</li>
            <li> (More than three blades is a completely unnecessary.)</li>
            <li> After the first pass there were some stubble spots due to my technique and face shape and all that needed was a little hot water and some quick touch-up swipes as the gel reservoirs kept the skin slick for the blades to just glide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never had a better shave from any other razor I&#x27;ve used over the past 43 years of shaving, not one.  </li>
            <li> This Hydro (and apparently many other newer razors) has something like a 20-degree angle; the head&#x27;s so flat that I can&#x27;t get the usual leverage</li>
            <li> but none the less I ventured into that arena many many times and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Both the Hydro 3 and 5 seems to work very well; however, the Hydro 3 is a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it is the gel (which is dispensed very liberally) or the blade design (which has little protection bars that reduce the blades&#x27; impact on the skin), but the total effect is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently went back to basic single blade German built razors (and</li>
            <li> I strongly suspect those areas would be difficult with any razor from any time period ever, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> My problem with this razor is that the shaving head is too close to the handle and lies too flat against it.</li>
            <li> This lack of stubble seems to persist about as long as with a Gillette blade, indicating that the cut is achieved below the skin line to the same degree as the Gillette blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long the slime bar will last.  </li>
            <li> I see how some people are complaining the cartridges don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I tried this to replace an aging Gillette Excel Sensor razor that I have been using for 15 plus years - blades were getting harder to find and more expensive.</li>
            <li> For a long time I was using the Gillette Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To get a shave like this with my D/E the shaving cream on my razor would be pink tinged with blood during the third pass-over</li>
            <li> I ended up picking it off the razor head because it felt like a big wet booger.</li>
            <li> However, compared to even the most expensive DE blades, the Hydro cartridges (at c. $2 each) are quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while the Hydro just excels on wide-open, flat surfaces (like cheeks and neck), it has a harder time in tight spots like cleft chins, mouth corners, etc.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I look forward to using the blade AFTER the goo has run dry.  </li>
            <li> Worse than a disposable razor used by the whole entire basketball team to shave their heads.  </li>
            <li> Well, the razor clogs up with hair after nearly every stroke and would likely have issues with thick stubble/hair.</li>
            <li> The only facial hair I grow is not a whole lot except a kinda patchy mustache and my chin and a little patchy stuff on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> The only challenge or down side is shaving moustache area.</li>
            <li> You can work around this of course, by forcing your lower lip down further.    </li>
            <li> All and All I would say this is a fantastic razor and the replacement blades are not super expensive.</li>
            <li> This viscous mucous-like substance does not really seem to enhance the shave.  </li>
            <li> I have to really be careful or</li>
            <li> Do not really like the vertical position of the handle,</li>
            <li> With the long lasting blades costing about $0.17 cents per shave, the cost is comparable to less expensive D/E razor blades and the razor handle feels solid, has some weight to it, so I think it will last.  </li>
            <li> The next day I shaved and the results and shaving experience were unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Other sites have cheaper prices BUT the shipping charge added and you&#x27;ll find yourself here making your purchase.  </li>
            <li> he informed me the product was so faulty that I could file a law suit against Schick due to it being a manufacture mistake and caused pain.  </li>
            <li> I tried it as a possible alternative to the Hydro 5, but it had all the disadvantages of that design (big, bulky, difficult to get into angled spots) and none of the advantages (hydro bar that pivots out of the way, smoother effect of extra blades).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> I have the \\&quot;worst-case\\&quot; scenario for shaving: (1) extremely thick beard, (2) extremely heavy beard, and (3) very, very sensitive and easily aggravated</li>
            <li> If it was bad, I&#x27;d only have to shave with it once right?</li>
            <li> This and the relatively large shaving head of the Hydro results in a difficult shave that isn&#x27;t as close as it should be.</li>
            <li> As of late I&#x27;ve suffered from all of these while using my Fusion for the last 2 1/2 years.  </li>
            <li> Yeah not worth it.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, try this if you&#x27;re fed up with the ever increasing prices of Gillette and have either sensitive skin or a thin line of stubble.</li>
            <li> Gillette have engineered an off axis system that uses the forward motion of the blade to pull the trailing edge down toward the skin.  </li>
            <li> Fusion probably gives a slightly closer shave.    </li>
            <li> I prefer the 3 blade model as I have a thinner beard (so less blades &#x3D; less aggravation).  </li>
            <li> It also requires a little less pressure on the razor as I shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a week and half now, shaved everyday, almost never razor burn.  </li>
            <li> hydro 3 delivers a close shave, though it takes a little adjustment in style.  </li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t cut myself or wasted time shaving.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin and a tendancey to develop ingrown hairs along my neck line I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> like I got a closer shave, but after I dried off, my legs weren&#x27;t that</li>
            <li> Less than 24 hours!</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of little stubble gets caught in the blade, and with it&#x27;s design, it&#x27;s difficult to remove the stubble aside from vigorously hitting it against the wall while spraying the back of it with water (hence the name</li>
            <li> kit)and while the shave was a very close cut , it nicked me badly -</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just the shipment we received or if the product is really that bad.</li>
            <li> But with the Schick hydro.. these problems are a thing of the past.    </li>
            <li> I had always used Gillette products but was never satisfied with the shave.</li>
            <li> and I usually get two weeks out of blade.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it does no better on my jawline and Adam&#x27;s Apple than did the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> usually my face gets quite irritated when I shave.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable combination of comformtable and durable razor.</li>
            <li> This was by far the worst shave I&#x27;ve ever had with a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive than other multi-blade razors</li>
            <li> I can hardly feel the razor on my face and</li>
            <li> Hard to argue with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has issues if I use it to shave off my thick goatee.</li>

            <li> i am very pleased with this item, i bought it for my nephew because he tried mine and he liked it so i bought one just for him.</li>
            <li> works great, smooth shave.  had some extra blades but had lost the original razor.  this one is very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Pros: Very Close shave. Low skin aggravation. New gel reservoir works well.  Skin guards on the blades do help prevent razor burn and cuts.    Cons: I wish the 3 blade had the nifty trimmer.  If you have a thicker beard the 5-blade may work better.  Fusion probably gives a slightly closer shave.    First I should mention different men have different skin.  I have ultra-sensitive skin, a thinner beard, skin prone to razor burn, aggravation and redness.  As of late I&#x27;ve suffered from all of these while using my Fusion for the last 2 1/2 years.  And most other razors haven&#x27;t done much better.  But with the Schick hydro.. these problems are a thing of the past.    The new Schick Hydro gives a fantastic close shave with very little skin aggravation.  I prefer the 3 blade model as I have a thinner beard (so less blades &#x3D; less aggravation).  This razor is the best safety razor to-date for men with sensitive skin.  From my first shave and on I could tell my Fusion would be collecting dust.  I lather with a badger brush and shaving soap... and didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d notice the gel reservoir.  But once the reservoir was wet, it let out a fantastic gliding gel.  It really added a nice comfortable glide which my fusion just can&#x27;t match.  I was concerned about the size and shape of the head (it looks and almost feels like a a brick).  But once I had it against my face I had no problems.  I was able to easily get under my nose and down the different angels of my neck.  I will admit the shave doesn&#x27;t feel quite as close as the Fusion... but with the Schick Hydro... the skin aggravation is so low you can dare to go against the grain if you need that extra close shave for a night out.  All in all the Schick Hydro is a fantastic new razor, focused on the comfortability of your skin... something many of us have been missing.</li>
            <li> this is way better than the fusion and the mach 3.  The Hydro 3 blade razor is better than the 5 blade. It truly provides an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old and have tried nearly every shaving product on the planet with the only exception being Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide which I hear is exceptional as well. Just a liitle history. Recently went back to basic single blade German built razors (and kit)and while the shave was a very close cut , it nicked me badly - I just couldn&#x27;t crossover after 3months of trying. The razor I used mostly over the past 15+ years off and on has been Sensor3. While the shaving experience met my expectations it always kept me wondering. I did not agree more razors made a better shave but none the less I ventured into that arena many many times and was disappointed. Recently a friend highly recommended Fusion Proglide. He raved about the shaving experience and results and the ability to re-use sometimes more than one week of shaving daily. So the research began and while I can say for the most part I have been a Gillette man, was open to trying something else. While picking up a prescription at the drug store with my son, without any knowledge he said try Schick over Gillette and so I did. The next day I shaved and the results and shaving experience were unbelievable. It felt like I wasn&#x27;t shaving. No feeling of hair pull. It felt like I was shaving a freshly very close shaved face. In addition to shaving my face and neck I shave my head as well. The only challenge or down side is shaving moustache area. It can be done but it takes a little more time/patients. I think Schick should (or will) have put something in place to address this like the Fusion has according to my friend. It&#x27;s \\&quot;never\\&quot; I look forward to shaving but so far this has been fun. The quality of my hair is thick/coarse/curly so I haven&#x27;t got more that 4 days of shaving out of one blade. Still not bad for shaving one&#x27;s entire head. My research found that the best price for replacement blades is here on Amazon as long as they continue to offer free shipping. Other sites have cheaper prices BUT the shipping charge added and you&#x27;ll find yourself here making your purchase.  Fusion Proglide gets great reviews and many say the shave experience is even better that Schick! Maybe one day I will try and write a review. For now I&#x27;m totally pleased with Schick and foresee the next upgrade addressing shaving the moustache area. Whatever you do get off the fence and experience a new level in shaving!</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor hoping it would be better than my very reliable Mach 3 turbo. It falls way short of the Mach 3 in a lot of ways.  For one the blades are super sharp and I nicked myself on the first shave.  I got the 3 blade model. One of the most things I disliked about the razor was the handle. It Just didn&#x27;t have a good feel and it&#x27;s not angled like the Mach 3.  I did like the gel and it does keep coming out with every stroke. This razor does not handle the angles well especially around the neck area.  I&#x27;m still happy with my Mach 3 and until something beats it I\\&quot;ll be using it. I would recommend this razor for a woman&#x27;s legs.  Don&#x27;t believe the hype on this one.</li>
            <li> My problem with this razor is that the shaving head is too close to the handle and lies too flat against it. I&#x27;m used to a head that sticks out, away from the handle, at around a 45-degree angle. This Hydro (and apparently many other newer razors) has something like a 20-degree angle; the head&#x27;s so flat that I can&#x27;t get the usual leverage I can with, say, a Gillette Custom Plus 3. I can&#x27;t just twist my wrist and scrape the blades straight up my neck to my chin, for example. With the Hydro, I have to *pull* all the way up. This and the relatively large shaving head of the Hydro results in a difficult shave that isn&#x27;t as close as it should be. I used it twice and that will be all.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this new razor because the mach 3 blades shave well. Because I can buy cartridges for the hydro 3 at half the price I figured it would be worth a shot. The mach 3 shaves my entire skull only twice and requires light pressure while shaving to avoid cuts. The hydro 3 will last 4-5 shaves but requires more pressure on the blades to cut close enough. What I love about this razor is the fact even if I accidentally press the blade too hard it will not cut into my skin.  Pros: ½ the price as mach 3 [on ebay,] blades last significantly longer, construction is solid, does not cut skin, no irritation to skin [I shave every morning]  Cons: lubricating strip is great for first shave and then withers away to nothing [better off w/o the thing altogether,] stand does not retain razor very well [useless in a travel bag because razor falls right off]  It may not work for everyone but I love it...</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for the simple reason that the blades are cheaper then the mach 3 blades. If it was bad, I&#x27;d only have to shave with it once right? Well its good, and I&#x27;d say better then the mach 3.The blades can pivot better, shave closer, and there is a LOT on the lubricant strip.Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> I started out with a no name brand razor when I first started shaving. The experience turned me off completely and I went to electric razors. I have not touched a regular razor for 12 years and I wouldn&#x27;t have tried out a regular razor but my electric was dying and I needed a replacement stat. I picked up the Schick Hydro 3 by random chance and It was the best choice ever. I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and it has been a great shave and a really close shave as well. I have only nicked myself once and that was mostly my fault for being in a hurry and doing a dry shave. All and All I would say this is a fantastic razor and the replacement blades are not super expensive.</li>
            <li> This system is a contender.  I&#x27;m tying it largely in protest to the high price of Gillette blade pricing.  Their shaving systems are without a doubt well designed and have earned them the top position in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hydro 3 delivers a close shave, though it takes a little adjustment in style.  Gillette have engineered an off axis system that uses the forward motion of the blade to pull the trailing edge down toward the skin.  This system puts the fulcrum at the centerline of the blade.  That requires me to think more of \\&quot;pressing\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;dragging\\&quot; the blade.  It changes my behavior on the jawline and at the corers of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retraining complete, I must say I&#x27;m getting great shaves.  Not a bit of beard at the surface when I run my hand over my skin after the shave.  This lack of stubble seems to persist about as long as with a Gillette blade, indicating that the cut is achieved below the skin line to the same degree as the Gillette blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos Schick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the qualifier that deprived this of a 5 star rating -- the goo.  Schick seem quite proud of their hydro-goo.  This viscous mucous-like substance does not really seem to enhance the shave.  In fact, I look forward to using the blade AFTER the goo has run dry.  It is dispensed on the trailing edge of the drag, so it can only be effective on the second pass... which really isn&#x27;t necessary with these sharp blades.  I&#x27;m afraid this is a gimmick meant to offer a subjective difference in a fiercely competitive market.  It reminds me of louder after-market (post manifold) exhausts for cars.  They seldom offer better performance, but many people *feel* like their bolt-on modification made a positive difference.</li>
            <li> After  months long searches, I found that the Hydr3 is the best product of all those many products that I have tried. It is well superior to Gillette&#x27;s Mach3 and Sensor. It gives a very smooth shave</li>
            <li> I switched to this razor from the Mach 3.  It shaves OK, and I really like the lubricating reservoir it employs.  But it lacks a trimmer and sometimes requires multiple passes over stubborn areas to shave closely.  I changed to the 5-blade cartridges (which can be used with this handle) and much prefer their performance as well as having a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Been shaving many years.  This is the first time I ever liked a razor so well that I wanted to tell people.  I consider my beard to be light and my skin to be sensitive.  This razor just glides with such smoothness, I have yet to nick myself after a week.  I use a gel shave cream.  Can&#x27;t say how long the blades will last, but I enjoy the close shave and look forward to using this product for quite some time.</li>
            <li> i like about this razor is, this smooths your sikn while shaving with a gum like liquid.  the price is lot lower, when you compare this with the shop price.  but the blades comes with this razor doesn&#x27;t work longer than i had earlier. i just want a razor, so i am certainly satisfied with that.</li>
            <li> Yes  it. Does  last  longer  then  mach  3  razor  blades .  mach 3  needs to do some serious improvement on their blades. yes for  smooth clean shaves the  answer is Shick  hydro 3. blades and razor handle on the market  Guys !</li>
            <li> Used it for about a week now and i haven&#x27;t cut myself or wasted time shaving. What can I say, i am Asian with little facial hair and the quality pretty good. I haven&#x27;t used a Mach3 for so long I really can&#x27;t compare the two. The main selling point is that the refills are a lot cheaper and more than adequate for the job, for me at least.</li>
            <li> Recently got one of these new hydro razors . I&#x27;ve been a long time customer of Schick products and must say I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the hydro and very mad. .  First off it claimed to have another blade in the package but didn&#x27;t .  Then the second and biggest issue is it has a flaw in one of the blades on it where there&#x27;s a piece of metal that sticks up like a weld berry or something from when the metal was cut. Which gave me a couple of nasty cuts because I didn&#x27;t think to look at the blade.  Then on top of it the lubricating gel that&#x27;s normally in raisers slowly comes out each time you use it fell off prior to my even using it.  Needless to say this isn&#x27;t good at all. An a huge shock.  I&#x27;ve been using Schick products faithfully since I was a teenager (im 28 now) as to me they always  were far better than gillet . Now I&#x27;ll likely be changing company&#x27;s..  My girlfriends father is a lawyer and it&#x27;s so bad when I discussed it with him  he informed me the product was so faulty that I could file a law suit against Schick due to it being a manufacture mistake and caused pain.  There for I warn each of you stay far away from this product .</li>
            <li> I like this razor. Less expensive than other multi-blade razors and I do feel the difference of having 3 vs 2 or 1 blade. Worth it but only if you can get the refills cheap.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver.  He only wants this one.  He tried the 2 blade one, but says this 3 blade one is better because it doesn&#x27;t irritate, and leaves a smoother shave.  There&#x27;s also a 5 blade one he tried but you always have to have the right angle to get all blades on your face.&lt;br /&gt;With the Shick Hydro 3 blade razor, you don&#x27;t have to worry about how to position the shaver and get a smooth shave all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of razors trying to find the best one for me and the Schick Hydro 3 is the one! I had always used Gillette products but was never satisfied with the shave. I then decided to try all types of razors on my search to the best shave for me. That is when I stumbled upon Schick products. I first tried the 5 blade, Quattro, and the Shick throwaways. Then I tried the Hydro 3 Blade Razor and the rest is history.</li>
            <li> I tried it as a possible alternative to the Hydro 5, but it had all the disadvantages of that design (big, bulky, difficult to get into angled spots) and none of the advantages (hydro bar that pivots out of the way, smoother effect of extra blades).&lt;br /&gt;Also, they seem to be discontinued now, difficult to find replacement blades.</li>
            <li> this item is for a guy whom has a thisck hair on their facial area ( or wherever you prefer to shave ) but for me it is tooooo tilty</li>
            <li> I love the hydro 3, much closer comfortable shave than the competition and the blades last a long time.  this particular razor comes with an extra blade and a plastic cover for the razor while traveling.  wasn&#x27;t even expecting that!</li>
            <li> This new razor is fantastic and the blades are LESS than the Mach 3 blades. Schick absolutely has a winner here and I am GLAD a 3 blade razor is here that has a decent life-span for each blade-set.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> When I first put it to my face I thought \\&quot;This is amazing, I will never use another razor ever.\\&quot;  But then I realized that I did not get a great shave.  In particular, the area immediately below my nostrils was unshaven.  This is because the bar that holds the lubricating strip is twice as large as the lubrication strip on the Fusion.  You can work around this of course, by forcing your lower lip down further.    The real problem is the lubrication strip.  I only lasts about a week and I usually get two weeks out of blade.  It wears from the outside in, so you end up with a lump of lubrication in the middle of the bar.  That has to impede an even shave.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor. I can hardly feel the razor on my face and the shave is very comfortable. By far the best razor I have used, period.    Having said that, I purchased the Gillette pro glide prior to getting the Shick hydro, and I have to say that the pro glide is a pathetic razor. For me it does everyting that is opposite of its so called glide features. I had the most horribly uncomfortable shaves when I used the pro glide. It felt as if was pulling each hair out of my face, and my skin was severly irritated.     This is an excellent razor and I would totally recommend it over the pro glide.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and hate shaving.  I tried this and the Pro Glide.  This was by far the worst shave I&#x27;ve ever had with a new razor.  It felt like I was shaving with an old razor or like sandpaper.  The \\&quot;lubricating strip\\&quot; is at the top of the razor so it lubricates after the actual shaving is done.  So basically its like getting lotion put on your face right after shaving.  Yeah not worth it.</li>
            <li> The 2 included blades were inferior.&lt;br /&gt;Nicked and gave me razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that it is compatible with Hydro 3 replacement blades if you can find em.&lt;br /&gt;All razor companies are crooks if you haven&#x27;t figured that out by now.&lt;br /&gt;Which explains why Hydro 3 is not compatible with Hydro 4 which is not compatible with Hydro (infinity).&lt;br /&gt;Same is true for Gillette. All of em are crooks.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a barber&#x27;s razor blade and sharper.&lt;br /&gt;Dump the crooked razor companies.</li>
            <li> Like the three blade version a little better than the five blade razor design.</li>
            <li> I just jumped out of the shower after shaving with the Hydro 3 and I have to say it is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I upgraded to this from the Mach 3 and it is hands-down a much better shave. The lubrication system feels like you&#x27;re shaving on clouds and it lasts much longer than the Mach 3 (I just changed my blade for the first time in 3 weeks, shaving about 3 times a week). Didn&#x27;t have any nicks, cuts or razor burn: first time in a long time. Highly recommended; try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I thought I would share about my input on the Schick Hydro 3.    I love it to death.  For a long time I was using the Gillette Mach 3.  This razor tended to cause my hair to be tugged and cut my skin and cause razor burn.  I was looking for an alternative and I noticed the Hydro 3 was saying it was good.    I ended it buying it on a whim and never looked back.  I have been using it a week and half now, shaved everyday, almost never razor burn.  I did cut myself once but that was my own fault.  I see how some people are complaining the cartridges don&#x27;t last very long.  They are somewhat right, but I was given the tip that if you blow on the razor after you use it, that will help keep the water from dissolving the conditioner on it.  It has been going strong the same cartridge, pretty soon I will replace it.    Definitely worth a try if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As someone who&#x27;s used the Mach 3 for around 10 years, I can safely say that the Hydro 3 is a worthy competitor. I always had a bit of irritation from the M3, thanks to my sensitive skin and the H3 certainly feels a bit better in that department. The lubrication strip really seems to work. It also produces a closer shave and lasts longer... Oh, and it&#x27;s 30% cheaper too. So why did I only give it 4 stars?    Well, the razor clogs up with hair after nearly every stroke and would likely have issues with thick stubble/hair. It also requires a little less pressure on the razor as I shave. Plus, it does no better on my jawline and Adam&#x27;s Apple than did the Mach 3. I strongly suspect those areas would be difficult with any razor from any time period ever, so it&#x27;s not a big deal. It also has issues if I use it to shave off my thick goatee. I have to really be careful or a solid cut on my chin is certainly a possibility.    To sum it up, try this if you&#x27;re fed up with the ever increasing prices of Gillette and have either sensitive skin or a thin line of stubble.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used. usually my face gets quite irritated when I shave. Not using this baby.Just love it</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive facial skin and after trying many, many, many razors, I have settles on the Hydro line. Both the Hydro 3 and 5 seems to work very well; however, the Hydro 3 is a little cheaper. I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> Hydro3 is more than labeled: better than Mach3. Mach3 gave me confortable shave but Hydro3 is more comfortable. One glide and hair is gone and my face doesn&#x27;t even feel anything. I have been using the same cartridge for more than 2 months and cannot tell any difference from the day one. Mach3 I used mornally could last most a little more than a month. Unbelievable combination of comformtable and durable razor. Thumb up to Schick!</li>
            <li> aside from it&#x27;s bulk (it resembles a large rectangular Lego block) it offers a very smooth cut.&lt;br /&gt;however I noticed a lot of little stubble gets caught in the blade, and with it&#x27;s design, it&#x27;s difficult to remove the stubble aside from vigorously hitting it against the wall while spraying the back of it with water (hence the name hydro?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr: it&#x27;s cheap, and effective, but clogs easily.&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t owned long enough to see if it&#x27;s worth it, but I&#x27;ll try to update in a month, or if it runs out sooner.</li>
            <li> I tried this to replace an aging Gillette Excel Sensor razor that I have been using for 15 plus years - blades were getting harder to find and more expensive. The Hydro 3 adds one more blade and shaves very smoothly, virtually no nicks after about three years of use. Very comfortable handle &amp; sufficient lubricant to last a couple of weeks. Sideburns are the only area where it is a bit lacking. I would highly recommend this razor . (More than three blades is a completely unnecessary.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this razor. I&#x27;m a woman and use it to shave my legs and under my arms about once a week. I wanted something cheaper but just as good to replace the Mach3-- I was getting tired of spending a small fortune on replacement blades. While it feels a bit bulky and awkward in the hand (probably b/c I&#x27;ve been using Mach3 for years), it does give me a nice clean shave without having to go over the same area multiple times. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve primarily used traditional double-edged razors (\\&quot;DE\\&quot;) for many years.  I have the \\&quot;worst-case\\&quot; scenario for shaving: (1) extremely thick beard, (2) extremely heavy beard, and (3) very, very sensitive and easily aggravated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do pretty well with a DE, but honestly I find the Hydro 3 more comfortable.  I don&#x27;t know whether it is the gel (which is dispensed very liberally) or the blade design (which has little protection bars that reduce the blades&#x27; impact on the skin), but the total effect is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Hydro 3, I can get an exceptionally comfortable shave (more so than with any other razor I&#x27;ve used), and also quite a close shave.  And fast.  Hard to argue with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only non-positive factors for me are (1) price, and (2) performance in the \\&quot;nooks and crannies.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is actually favorable compared to Gillette cartridges, so that&#x27;s a plus. However, compared to even the most expensive DE blades, the Hydro cartridges (at c. $2 each) are quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while the Hydro just excels on wide-open, flat surfaces (like cheeks and neck), it has a harder time in tight spots like cleft chins, mouth corners, etc.  Not bad, but not as good as a DE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, a really great shaver that cuts through my super-tough, thick beard without chopping up my face.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Hydro 3 for quite some time. I always seem to nick myself every shave. Sometimes I get lucky once in a while and don&#x27;t. The blades are sharp. The biggest thing I hate about it is that I can&#x27;t get the hair just under my nose that well. I end up using my electric razor for that. The only facial hair I grow is not a whole lot except a kinda patchy mustache and my chin and a little patchy stuff on the rest of my face. Because of this problem..I will give it 3 stars. I am not a fan of the goo from the rubber strip much either. When I don&#x27;t nick myself, it&#x27;s a great close shave.</li>
            <li> this was a wounderful add on item. these are very high dollar razors so to gt them for this little money as an add on was great and amazon should do this more</li>
            <li> I got my Schick Hydro 3 this morning and used it for the first time and I&#x27;m sold! I have never had a better shave from any other razor I&#x27;ve used over the past 43 years of shaving, not one.  Since I have sensitive skin and a tendancey to develop ingrown hairs along my neck line I was skeptical.  With the long lasting blades costing about $0.17 cents per shave, the cost is comparable to less expensive D/E razor blades and the razor handle feels solid, has some weight to it, so I think it will last.  As to the shave: Miraculous.  I couldn&#x27;t even feel the razor against my face! I had to stop and touch my face where I shaved just to make sure and I was shocked. The first pass left my face with a closer shave than a third pass with a D/E razor. Just to experiment I shaved one side of my face against the grain...same experience.  I couldn&#x27;t feel the razor against my skin against the grain but it shaved! I mean to tell you baby-butt smooth! One pass! After the first pass there were some stubble spots due to my technique and face shape and all that needed was a little hot water and some quick touch-up swipes as the gel reservoirs kept the skin slick for the blades to just glide.&lt;br /&gt;To get a shave like this with my D/E the shaving cream on my razor would be pink tinged with blood during the third pass-over and I&#x27;d have a sore face for about two days. Not with the Hydro. No discomfort in any way. The most amazing shave I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;m sold, never changing and hope Schick doesn&#x27;t discontinue this one. It&#x27;s that good! Try this razor, you&#x27;ll be glad you did. (I&#x27;m selling all my vintage razors now:)</li>
            <li> Razor does very good job of cutting smoothly and gives a close, comfortable shave.  Don&#x27;t know how long the slime bar will last.  Has the appearance of shaving through a face full of snot.  Do not really like the vertical position of the handle, but I guess we old geezers must learn to adjust.</li>
            <li> Wow! I just ordered this razor yesterday and the estimated delivery date is for August 12th-15th....I received it today! Less than 24 hours! How is that even possible? I sure didn&#x27;t pay for next day shipping. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. I have used this razor the &amp;#34;Schick Hydro 3 Blade Razor&amp;#34;, haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any store for months now. So, yeah, I am very happy with this order. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Deal was true good to be true. It was on sale so I decided to get one for hubby.  DH absolutely hated it.  Worse than a disposable razor used by the whole entire basketball team to shave their heads.  Not sure if it was just the shipment we received or if the product is really that bad.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and it was in good condition.  I was little skeptic but it works great. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This razor was light and flexible and really conforms to your skin to make sure you don&#x27;t get any cuts. I like the flexible head and the comfort of this razor but overall it did not perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp, but they just didn&#x27;t give me that smooth feeling that we all want. I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave with this and I think it was because of the gel strip on the razor head. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but in my opinion it just gets in the way. After you get the razor wet, the gel strips gets really slimey and your legs feel slick and kind of gross. I ended up picking it off the razor head because it felt like a big wet booger. After it was off I felt like I got a closer shave, but after I dried off, my legs weren&#x27;t that smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think all women&#x27;s razors just underperform. I use a men&#x27;s razor now and get an awesome, silky smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor but it wasn&#x27;t anything special, I&#x27;m not using it any longer and went back to my old razor.</li>
            <li> Love that this came with a travel case!!!</li>
            <li> i love all schick razors.  i&#x27;ve used the gilette razors as well and always found schick to be much more comfortable and a closer shave.  the blades also last longer and are easier on the skin.  i would highly recommend this over the gillette products.  i&#x27;ve also tried the 5 blade version of this razor, and the 5 blade is definitely much more comfortable to use.  good grip, easy to replace the blades, great product overall.</li>
