            <li>These sponges are amazing.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazing, I&#x27;ve never used the Beauty Blender</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing..... this package comes with four sponges.</li>
            <li>Great for smooth make up application</li>
            <li>Blends out my foundation for an even smoother look and its just amazing.</li>
            <li>I give it three stars because it does apply makeup amazingly well however, it harbors bacteria</li>
            <li>To each his or her own I suppose.</li>
            <li>You have to put it under water, I use warm for a minute and let it soak it up and ring it out.</li>
            <li>They did apply my foundation quite nicely, which is why I gave them two stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, you cannot beat this deal.</li>
            <li>They do not soak up your foundation, instead they effortlessly blend it on your skin giving you a nice, even look.  </li>
            <li>the product was really nice</li>
            <li>there was no problem with anything overall PERFECT and GREAT</li>
            <li>They puff up quite nice in water.</li>
            <li>I liked how these worked with the creams in the palette.</li>
            <li>They also came packaged really nicely.</li>
            <li>The package was so nice.</li>
            <li>The girl loves it, nice and on time.</li>
            <li>nice quality sponges</li>
            <li>Another thing i liked is that it doesn&#x27;t soak up a lot of product.</li>
            <li>Puts make up on nicely.  </li>
            <li>&gt; \\&quot;This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.\\&quot;</li>

            <li>The colors are bright, they are easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more , works just as good as the name brand</li>
            <li>Super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>AND THE ONES FROM BUNDLE MONSTER ARE SOFTER AND EXPAND MORE AND BLEND BETTER!</li>
            <li>I thought that I was doing everything right until I got this blender sponge!!!</li>
            <li>They are soft and supple and the best part is they fit right into my product perfectly!</li>
            <li>it works very good, you just have to wash it first or submerse it in the water and squeeze the water out then use it, the water keeps the liquid foundation or concealer from sucking into the sponge:)</li>
            <li>These blenders are better than the popular beauty blenders</li>
            <li>This is a fun product, the colors are happy colors and you can take one color for blush, another for foundation, etc.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and good.</li>
            <li>They make her makeup look completely natural and flawless.</li>
            <li>These are awesome, I wouldn&#x27;t say they are a complete dupe for the beauty blender</li>
            <li>it just leaves a nice and smooth finish to the face!</li>
            <li>These makeup sponges are so soft and apply my foundation wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Blends to look natural for a flawless face !</li>
            <li>Nice set for the price :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li>I liked these better than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>He explains that while &amp;#34;these&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t as squishy as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;, he finds they work just as well and DONT tear easily as do the others!</li>
            <li>Easy to wash!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many sponges and have to say that this is the best so far!  </li>
            <li>Great product and really helps your foundation go on smoother with better coverage!</li>
            <li>I love the application it gives me, and it feels great on my skin, plus it comes with fun colors</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to absorb too much of my foundation and allowed for beautiful stipling and blending.</li>
            <li>they make foundation apply very smooth.</li>
            <li>The sponges are very good quality in my opinion, I don&#x27;t own the original high end beauty blender</li>
            <li>and this really help me a lot with blending they are perfect, and they shipped really quick</li>
            <li>I think this product works just as like the more well-known brands at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>These work as well as the Beauty Blender at a much better price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to using the shapes of these blenders, you&#x27;ll be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love these they work well.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and sizes.</li>
            <li>I really love it ..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll stick around with these &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love how they feel on my skin.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>i love it&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>Better than ones they sell at beauty stores.</li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s what you promise to get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li>These are ok....</li>
            <li>The four pack was awesome to get and share with another friend (because you get two of the same style).  </li>
            <li>There are some of these on the market for so much more than this 4 pack</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>But, even the sponge wedges you can buy at the drugstore are better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t splurged on an actual Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t say whether or not these compare, but these are AWESOME.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Latex Free, nice colours and shape.</li>
            <li>I love this beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I love makeup blenders.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>, I am glad I did!t</li>
            <li>It seems to do the job :)  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I love the pack and one of them</li>
            <li>Was more like rubber.</li>
            <li>and i really love it</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>, I think maybe the added color, but I don&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
            <li>more durable, lasts longer&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the Bundle Monster sponges are firmer, I am actually ok with that.</li>
            <li>I like the pointy tip on the Bundle Monster sponges better for contouring around my eyes and nose, and once I got used to the firmer density I forgot about it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s better or not.</li>
            <li>I saw these and thought she would love them.</li>
            <li>Love love these, you can rinse/</li>
            <li>and I can say my foundation and concealer have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I Love these sponges and even more because of the price.</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>They work better for powders and liquids than creams.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve with my creme foundation &amp; stippling brush.</li>
            <li>Make sure it&#x27;s damp.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s a four pack, and I get four for a fraction of the cost of the beauty blender, so I won&#x27;t ever have to worry about replacing them anytime soon.</li>
            <li>I am better off using my fingers when applying foundation than this thing.</li>
            <li>These are ok.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely not the best ones I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>it does the job, do not know the difference between the one that cost more</li>
            <li>All I have to say is I love</li>
            <li>I just gave 2 away to people who I know use foundation more often than I do.</li>
            <li>and i am glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see that these are any better than my store bought sponges, they are firmer and easier to find</li>
            <li>I LOVE these make up blenders</li>
            <li>These are ok.  </li>
            <li>she really enjoyed these</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I have found that they work 100X better this way.</li>
            <li>Cute colors :)</li>
            <li>If you have never used a makeup sponge you might like these, but there are definitely better ones on the market.</li>
            <li>(it works better that way) and go.  </li>
            <li>I immediately ordered more of these.</li>
            <li>So simple and flawless.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>works hell of a lot better than beauty blender</li>
            <li>Love the price .</li>
            <li>I love the colors and practical shapes these have.</li>
            <li>and I could not be any more satified with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>If I notice any issues arise, I&#x27;ll make sure to update.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because they are cute and is four for the price of one.</li>
            <li>Plus, now I have 4 :)</li>
            <li>It kind of just roughly smear your makeup and doesn&#x27;t look flawless.</li>
            <li>I love these sponges.  </li>
            <li>The beauty blender foundation puff couldn&#x27;t be better.  </li>
            <li>They could not be better.  </li>
            <li>Also love it</li>
            <li>Would purchase again :-)</li>
            <li>I love these beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>I love to use them damp.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT &amp;</li>
            <li>but I decided to put the foundation on with a different sponge and it came out flawlessly!</li>
            <li>I prefer more airy blenders but these stay in my arsenal.</li>
            <li>I have seen these sponges on another site for a lot more money and the price was for just one sponge.</li>
            <li>Love the variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>And of course, the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li>The official beauty blender is more spongy and squishy - when you press it to your face</li>
            <li>Made it look much better.</li>
            <li>I love these things.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>the fact that they soak up more product that I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>better then the days i dont wear it</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after my favorite beauty gurus on youtube suggested it.</li>
            <li>It doubles in size and is muccchhhh more squishy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the beauty blender for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I will buy again and again :-)</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Make sure you soak them before you use them...</li>
            <li>And you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>Love them so much better than a brush to blend</li>
            <li>I have used both these and an authentic beauty blender makeup sponge, and I prefer these.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re cute too.</li>
            <li>This deal gives you more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>she loves the creamy looking one the most</li>
            <li>and my favorite once</li>
            <li>I bought these after reading the reviews on the beauty blender but thought this product was a way better value because you get 4 sponges.</li>
            <li>Im glad i bought this from amazon.</li>
            <li>These are a lot more &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;, and I feel like I&#x27;m going to do permanent damage to my skin when applying foundation/concealer, and blending my makeup.</li>
            <li>I love these beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>I love these more than the beauty blender brand.</li>
            <li>love my blundle monster blender.</li>
            <li>I wish I can get them in all purple, I just love purple.  </li>
            <li>have found them to be of good, sound quality and work as well as the original Beauty Blender they are imitating.</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with the Beauty Blender product, you know that it is amazing</li>
            <li>They are cheaper than the original beautify sponge, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Soft and good quality!</li>
            <li>They are nice to have if you cannot afford the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li>They are also incredibly easy to clean, and they come in the most adorable colors and packaging!</li>
            <li>It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and blend my foundation and concealer flawlessly without soaking up my makeup.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t exactly like the beauty blender, but they are a good substitute for the price.</li>
            <li>Best bargan I have gotte in a long time.  </li>
            <li>it pretty good</li>
            <li>Application of makeup was fine, nothing great, but what really bothered me was cleaning.</li>
            <li>awesome product, i do wish that they were 4 different shapes but other than that they are perfect, i have used them a lot</li>
            <li>Just save and get an original beauty blender!</li>
            <li>Great at blending foundation/concealer and making look more natural</li>
            <li>Not as squishy as a genuine Beauty Blender, but still fantastic, and makes my foundation look amazing.</li>
            <li>These came so quick and they&#x27;re absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Not by Mike Tyson or anything, but more like being punched by a really strong baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shape is ok and spinges are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am able to blend my makeup easily.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>however, you CANNOT clean these!</li>
            <li>Overall they are fantastic sponges, they blend perfectly, are easy to work with and cleanup is a breeze with them.</li>
            <li>this is a very good buy you get 4 sponges, same or close to a brand name quality.</li>
            <li>Great for quality professional makeup application.</li>
            <li>soft, rolls on, great with foundation.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and how well it blends my foundation unto my face.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t bother with none of these anymore and will continue using my old wedge puffs that have been working great for 30 years for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased a beauty blender from sephora for $20 and loved it so much but didnt want to pay another 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>The blenders are soft, apply make-up flawlessly and is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is great because it absorbs less product - good news if your foundation is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i use maybe line true match liquid foundation!</li>
            <li>They are more compact compared to the original beauty blender sponges, which I think affects application.</li>
            <li>They allow you to apply foundation easily, without lines and it&#x27;s easy to blend foundation and concealer as well.</li>
            <li>easy resolve water 3.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve kept their shape and are easy to wash and use.</li>
            <li>from somewhere that you can easily return if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>The texture isn&#x27;t the best for any makeup application, it sheers out and absorbs makeup far too much.</li>
            <li>I have severe cystic acne on my chin, and these sponges give me great, natural looking coverage using a cheap drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li>This sponges are great for the amount of many expended in them,they are actually really similar to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>but so far so good :)</li>
            <li>But as far as applying makeup better than brushes or the puffy wedges, they do not and are just as good as the drug store types.</li>
            <li>So this was a really good deal that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Any of my foundations are now full coverage for my ( most of my foundations are drug store bought) easy to use.</li>
            <li>I kind of came across them by accident and being an avid Mac makeup brush user</li>
            <li>best way I can describe the Bundle Monster sponge is that it isn&#x27;t really spongy at all - it&#x27;s more like a solid piece of foam.</li>
            <li>A good starter sponge for anyone looking to try out new ways to do makeup.</li>
            <li>Evidently the various puffs make for perfect make-up blending.</li>
            <li>These work fine in a pinch but for beauty why skimp just for price?</li>
            <li>Easily washable and some of them are shaped to enable precise application and blending of liquid or cream formulas in hard-to-reach areas of the face.</li>
            <li>They work for what I use them for fine.</li>
            <li>From what I can gather they work fine.</li>
            <li>i love these makeup blender foundation puff,  not to big, nice size and works well!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much foundation, but when I do, I love to use this sponges!</li>
            <li>, it is sterdy, soft, expands when wet, cleans easily, applies my makeup flawlessly, and and amazing price overall,it also was just like the one in the picture displayed before you purchase them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I think these are great quality and not cheaply made, I would have liked to see instructions on how to use them within the package.</li>
            <li>The different shapes are great and I like the smooth almost velvet texture of the sponges.  </li>
            <li>but I really did not want to spend that kind of money</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They give me an even, smooth look.</li>
            <li>enjoy</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t go to cheap</li>
            <li>Took a while to receive but the product itself just seems too cheap.</li>
            <li>Using these gives a smooth finish and it helps your makeup not cake up.</li>
            <li>Also, i think i use more makeup because some gets absorbed in the sponge.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re easy to to clean too.</li>
            <li>They are much squishier than a beauty blender I think, but I liked that about them.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>and it gives me that smooth, even application.</li>
            <li>I give one to my friend and she liked it so much she got rid of her brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought these blender sponges precisely because I&#x27;ve avoided liquid foundation for years</li>
            <li>I use these everyday and they work excellent.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on smoothly with this.</li>
            <li>Cheap alternative to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>These are such a bargain for 4 really great sponges, and they clean so easily.</li>
            <li>Also, its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I need more coverage for my melasma and mild adult acne, so I squeezed out almost all the water and followed with a good squeeze in a clean towel.</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re latex free, so I can use them on clients who have latex allergies.</li>
            <li>Her face/make-up look smooth</li>
            <li>Why spend $20 on up for one when you can get this fantastic 4 piece set for $10.99.</li>
            <li>then I say to give these a try because they really are amazing.</li>
            <li>They do increase in size when soaked with water, and they are smooth in texture.</li>
            <li>I really wish someone had given an honest review before I bought these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Teardrop sponges are fantastic for around the nose and under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I think it is easy and clean.</li>
            <li>I wash them with antibacterial soap, water and alcohol , to keep them bacteria free.  </li>
            <li>so far so good, I feel like I use a lot of my foundation with these sponges.</li>
            <li>but so far so good with applying my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I love these when applying my liquid foundation its a breeze, especially getting under the eye and the sides are so good..</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a whole set of these and finally i found some at a great price!!</li>
            <li>These work great for application and setting and can be easily cleaned and reused over and over which will save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!!!  </li>
            <li>Then they softens and works very nice from regular use.</li>
            <li>Very worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loved them and they work really well and are very reasonable.</li>
            <li>My new favorite makeup tool!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $20 plus dollars for the Beauty Blender and found great dupes for half the price and more product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the original beauty blender but does the job.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the money to shell out on the original one</li>
            <li>These are nice and soft, and they&#x27;re easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Surely these people were using them with too much force!</li>
            <li>Nothing to be compared to the original beauty blender</li>
            <li>i know these arent the original</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>The colors are fun too!</li>
            <li>It works better if you dab the foundation on your forehead, cheeks, nose and chin first.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>No need to spend a million dollars on original beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>They are a bit heavier and firmer than the original beauty blender, but they still do the job.</li>
            <li>If I had both in front of me, I would pick the original...</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed with them.</li>
            <li>, I would still say, get the original anyway but</li>
            <li>These won&#x27;t give you the feel for the original product.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare them to the original BB because I never purchased it</li>
            <li>Sure enough, when she opened them Christmas morning, she loved them and used them right away.</li>
            <li>Anyone know how to clean them?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a dupe to the Beauty Blender but will expand a lot in water and does make applying foundation fun and easy.</li>
            <li>The puff are cute and soft, but makeup brushes are still the better buy.  </li>
            <li>But the sponge keeps a lot of your makeup, so you will need to clean regularly.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>clean these sponges and reuse</li>
            <li>The stain comes off of course when you clean it.</li>
            <li>I clean them using California Baby organic baby shampoo, and that gets them really clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pain to have to clean all the time</li>
            <li>I have a clean one to put on my makeup.</li>
            <li>I use the pointed end to clean up brow</li>
            <li>I like these sponges, they are easy to use ,the price is right for the quantity and quality-</li>
            <li>The real BB is soft and very easy to use on your face...</li>
            <li>Dont buy the real beauty blender because this are so much better</li>
            <li>They are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>They work well, and of good quality, I would definitely recommend over the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>Good product especially for the price</li>
            <li>At least I know they&#x27;re cleaned at the factory lol!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, it came really fast.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money, definitely improves look of makeup application.</li>
            <li>I know the price makes it tempting to atleast want to give these a try, but these sponges truely suck and I ended up throwing them all away.</li>
            <li>The don&#x27;t seem to soak up the foundation like the regular makeup sponges...which is good.</li>
            <li>I love these so much.</li>
            <li>but these work a bit better and don&#x27;t wear out as fast hope</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li>Good package to experiment with the different shapes.</li>
            <li>The color are too cute that my daughter wants to have them.</li>
            <li>love them, they work really well with cream and liquid foundations / concealers.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to fork out 40 bucks for something similar to this, but this works just as good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this \\&quot;steals\\&quot; much of my foundation, if I feel like I need more coverage I just add another layer.</li>
            <li>good product overall</li>
            <li>For full review, plus video demonstration, please see my beauty/makeup blog:</li>
            <li>Yes, true, they are bigger and in a nice shape, which is great for a facial massage in addition to applying foundation.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my foundation has been better applied with these blender sponges.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it for an extra christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Good for people on a budget who want a similar finish to a Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>Still, not a bad deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and easy to use the sponges get when there moist.  </li>
            <li>I love these makeup sponges, makes everything look very natural, smooth and even.</li>
            <li>I washed mine in warm soapy water and let it dry, and good as new.</li>
            <li>They apply my foundation easily, but upon their first use they seem to absorb quite a bit of my foundation.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash ( unlike the Soho one that came apart on the first wash)</li>
            <li>They are just perfect, they are very small.</li>
            <li>These however, blends smoothly and makes it look so much more natural even with full coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the more expensive blenders so I don&#x27;t know in comparison, but these cheaper blender works great to me!</li>
            <li>I received the item quickly.</li>
            <li>It does feel bulky to me but because of the size it does offer a quick coverage.  </li>
            <li>I love how bouncy they are, I can use them for smudging or for blending, and they come in lots of shapes to allow many different application processes to be done with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>These are soft, easy to use and clean, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for four pieces!  </li>
            <li>I refuse to pay the high price for the beauty blender and love the feel of theses sponges.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure dryiing the sponge on high would ruin</li>
            <li>Lovely sponges and a good value but just a bit stiff for me.</li>
            <li>It DOES get bigger than it&#x27;s original size are soaking and rinsing in warm water.</li>
            <li>They are not identical in application but they are both soft and expand a lot when wet, pick up product and blend it amazingly, texture wise</li>
            <li>Colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>You live and you learn. :)</li>
            <li>Never tried the original Beauty Blender, I just think it is a lot of money for a sponge, but once again it depend on how much you use it, for you to decide if its worth it!</li>
            <li>Very even and easy.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying a &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; sponge (which came with no directions!)</li>
            <li>It sure beats my old triangle sponge!</li>
            <li>First off, the price for these is wonderful because these can easily be more expensive.</li>
            <li>I bought new foundation and the same time and thought it was he foundation that got great reviews</li>
            <li>Love them better than the over priced single beauty blender sponges.</li>
            <li>These little puffs are great for applying foundation.  </li>
            <li>problem is that they seem to pick up way more makeup than I normally use, even when I&#x27;m trying not to, so I went through a period of feeling like I had way too much on, and was using it much more quickly than I normally do.  </li>
            <li>It is recommended to wash them with warm water and gentle soap before first use; and before every use, wet with warm water and gently squeeze the excess water with a clean towel.</li>
            <li>these beauty blenders are really amazing,  my foundation look more natural after applying it with them , I think it gives the same result of +20$  blenders .</li>
            <li>They worked well for me and are such amazing bargain.</li>
            <li>I have used cheap makeup sponges for years and never thought much of it.&lt;br /&gt;I was always switching out my foundation thinking it was not that good.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, definitely comparable to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>make up really goes on smooth</li>
            <li>and it is definitely better than those old triangle sponges.  </li>
            <li>And for the price, they&#x27;re definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>These work great!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but well worth the buy compared to a name brand  bender</li>
            <li>but it honestly does the same thing.</li>
            <li>This product does expand once water has been absorbed into it.</li>
            <li>But I lost one on vacation, so I guess it was nice to have three back ups at home.</li>
            <li>These are the nice bigger size...</li>
            <li>(FYI, I used Bulgarian rosewater to wet my sponge, since it&#x27;s good for your skin anyway.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these are worth the money at all.</li>
            <li>Yes, I own a lot of different brands and types of foundation -</li>
            <li>but these are really cute and soft.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I wish I had just bought these.</li>
            <li>However, I have decided the beauty blender is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>so worth the money ...</li>
            <li>so they seem to be worth the money.</li>
            <li>A beauty blender expands when it is placed under water and that&#x27;s what makes for such a nice non crease application of concealer and foundation</li>
            <li>While these are good &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; texture makeup sponges, those who have used real BB&#x27;s before will notice that the texture is not the same.  </li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re worth the buy.</li>
            <li>worth the price and the wait.</li>
            <li>They are of high quality and easy to rinse out makeup.</li>
            <li>I have never tried the original beauty blender which costs quite a bit more for a package of only one.  </li>
            <li>pointed tip also makes it easier to get right up to your lower lash line when applying concealer - the original beauty blender has more of a rounded tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Tougher than the beauty blender, and will probably last a lot longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do blend it very nicely, but there is wasted product.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim since I had heard so much about the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li>The other one is good for applying your foundation...</li>
            <li>Bought these for my wife and she is a makeup fanatic she likes high quality items and these were perfect</li>
            <li>Why aren&#x27;t you getting this right now?</li>
            <li>but it was refunded right away...</li>
            <li>So it turns out I have not been using the right</li>
            <li>It absorbs the water and glides the foundation right on.</li>
            <li>I bought a backup pack of 4 with free shipping from amazon, and I think I am officially set now for pretty much...... ever.</li>
            <li>With 4 to a pack, you&#x27;ll always have one ready to use while you clean the others.  </li>
            <li>I love that they come in different shapes and also that they are almost exact to the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li>You have to wet and towel dry before using them to get the best results.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how great it is.  </li>
            <li>The stain remains on the sponge the way it does with those cheap wedge-shaped latex sponges that you don&#x27;t normally reuse.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well and are worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all, compared to the high priced &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34;! I would recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li>I prefer a good brush to these -- hands down.</li>
            <li>Yes, these are slightly smaller, you don&#x27;t need a large blender to be effective.</li>
            <li>(this is what BB Cream is meant to do its more skin care then true makeup but great as a base if you still need more coverage).</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because I wanted the Beauty Blender sponge, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high amount of money.</li>
            <li>They leave both my BB cream and creme foundation flawless unlike my stippling brush that left it feeling heavy on my face.</li>
            <li>I love that this is expensive and works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sponges are relatively dense, don&#x27;t seem to fall apart after use, and are easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I really love the pink on, particularly, I have used it to death, I need to buy more of these.</li>
            <li>Price is great compared to some of the more expensive &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; makeup sponges.</li>
            <li>It cuts the time in half of applying your foundation &amp; it gives a gorgeous almost airbrushed finish.</li>
            <li>It blends very well, and it does create a more natural, air-brushed look.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I purchased these instead of getting the more expensive version that you find in beauty stores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they are any more special than the old style puffs you buy at your local drug store for just couple bucks for a full bag of them.</li>
            <li>these are very very comparable they puff up well when adding water and</li>
            <li>I just received them and I like them, very very much.</li>
            <li>REALLY like them, which was surprising for me as I have bought other brands at places like Target</li>
            <li>These sponges are better than my old dry sponge in that they do give a more finished effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works amazing when wet so</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, though.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;just make sure you know how to use it properly</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>so I thought them so fast!  </li>
            <li>I purchased these after hearing all the hype about the beauty blender and thought I&#x27;d try the dupe first.</li>
            <li>Exactly like beauty blenders without the name.</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because cleaning darker foundation out of these takes patience, and I ripped one while trying to do so the first time.</li>
            <li>; that I have now is from Avon and it works pretty well</li>
            <li>First time using a product like this</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product by this seller is absolute gold!</li>
            <li>The best part, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>These sponges are great for thicker foundations that are in a solid stick or cream in a compact and of course bb creams (the real Korean ones, not the American version).</li>
            <li>This causes the sponge to suck in makeup, such as liquid foundation, allowing for a more even application.  </li>
            <li>I regretted so much!</li>
            <li>It is so much better than those triangular white sponges!</li>
            <li>It leave streaks on my face, and absorb so much of my foundation!</li>
            <li>I love the colors and different shapes.  </li>
            <li>I use a foundation brush, although I think this is more of a personal preference.  </li>
            <li>and it was an exact replica of the beauty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a visual person.</li>
            <li>The packaging was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>One sponge can last for many months if you keep up with cleaning it after every use or every week.</li>
            <li>It never soaks up your product so your able to get the maximum potential of the product you are using.</li>
            <li>They arrived yesterday (yay for fast shipping!)</li>
            <li>If using these sponges, I recommend only using for touching up foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash them out to make them last longer.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as mentioned</li>
            <li>She likes using these sponges better than the traditional, disposable sponges.</li>
            <li>I use mine daily and love them.  </li>
            <li>I dampen the sponge first</li>
            <li>These are exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>First order got lost in the mail</li>
            <li>i will highly recommend these!!</li>
            <li>I first heard about these sponges from a blogger</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend these enough to those looking for an a more affordable version of the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>The texture when you first buy the sponges is hard-ish</li>
            <li>but they come pretty close.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>and it makes the application look so natural and smooth.</li>
            <li>It blends out the foundation pretty well</li>
            <li>and I totally understand why the BB is better.</li>
            <li>Great and soft beauty blenders God half the price at sephora</li>
            <li>Other than that this product is AMAZING</li>
            <li>Just not as soft as the original ...</li>
            <li>I will buy these can&#x27;t live without the blender if I can&#x27;t find these just go with a other one but a good one</li>
            <li>they clean very well with some brush cleaner, gets is all like like brand new.</li>
            <li>They were cheap, so for the money, I think it&#x27;s worth it, especially for 4 of them.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the more expensive beauty blender that I have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading about how &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; give you a sheer, airbrushed look with a liquid foundation, so I bought these since they were offered at such a good price.</li>
            <li>after using one of these with foundation I thought i did not like as it settled into my poors and looked terrible on my skin even with using good primer, I was very happy.</li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive blenders and these are just as good.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re super soft and gentle!</li>
            <li>something&#x27;s are better to just go out &amp; buy Instead of waiting a long time,</li>
            <li>I tried to gently stipple my foundation on my face and it really did feel like being punched in the face!</li>
            <li>They are big enough to grasp comfortably and control so you can more evenly apply make-up and cream.  </li>
            <li>Ordinary beauty blenders can go upto $32.00 but this is affordable and good.</li>
            <li>well spend you get a good product for a small amount of money if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li>So, although I can&#x27;t compare the Bundle Monster sponges to the original Beauty Blender, I can say that these sponges definitely get the job done, blending my foundation smoothly and seamlessly.</li>
            <li>but I have purchased the MAC Pro Soonge and these little sponges are 10x better and softer!</li>
            <li>It expands and feels so super soft.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you wet them first in order to get optimal use.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly buy from this seller again.  </li>
            <li>The product certainly fulfills my expectations.</li>
            <li>They are a great alternative to sponge foundation applicators typically sold at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>Foundation application  is flawless and less messy.</li>
            <li>but after the first wash they cleaned great and were soft and subtle.</li>
            <li>the sponges are great for coverage, sheer to heavy, everything looks even</li>
            <li>I use this puff everyday and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>I really have no complaints about the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>Get the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>After 4 gentle squeezes under a running tap, the sponges doubled in size and became softer.</li>
            <li>They work very well blending my foundation.</li>
            <li>Much better than expected.</li>
            <li>And apply foundation very well.</li>
            <li>I will be getting another set very soon.</li>
            <li>but it comes really really close</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t want to put them on my face after smelling that.</li>
            <li>The Bundle Monster is okey but does help much...</li>
            <li>or help much with my cover. ?</li>
            <li>When used correctly, these sponges apply foundation gently and evenly.</li>
            <li>The foundation gets obsorved way to much and it&#x27;s a waist of product</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the real beauty blender, but when I do, I will update this review.</li>
            <li>I should have bought the real thing.</li>
            <li>and so I needed something fast.</li>
            <li>They do need to be washed more often than my beauty blender sponge, but thats not really an issue.</li>
            <li>Make sure you run them under the sink so they&#x27;re completely wet before you apply.</li>
            <li>you too do not want to pay a high price to blend your foundation, please give these a try!</li>
            <li>and they really suck, so</li>
            <li>the shapes doesn&#x27;t really matter when applying around the eye area</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even feel like a real sponge.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to wet it :)</li>
            <li>i realize they arent the real thing</li>
            <li>so they won&#x27;t absorb so much of your product as you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li>These work really well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about makeup but from what she tells me</li>
            <li>What helped me decide on buying these was thanks to a blog post on these blenders at [...].</li>
            <li>The review is simply straight to the point.</li>
            <li>I really like these blender brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Just like the real BB.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare the two</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper sponge that looks like the beauty blender and does a fantastic job, then this is definitely for you.</li>
            <li>Having nothing to compare them to, I must say that the sponge I used didn&#x27;t really swell up the way everyone says &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a real beauty blender, but this sponge gives me the airbrush effect that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>However, some people complain that this process causes the sponges to suck in too much makeup and cause wastage as a result.  </li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>Feels so much nicer on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get it wet and wring it out before use.</li>
            <li>It just feels much softer to me.</li>
            <li>Save your money BUY the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Even once submerged in water, they really do not become much better.</li>
            <li>Splurge on the real deal.</li>
            <li>Gently pat the foundation out and blend.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend saw me getting ready one morning</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend these to anyone considering purchasing them.  </li>
            <li>I bought these because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out the dough for the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a quality in a box.</li>
            <li>And by it&#x27;s shape and size, you can just use one for everything (Putting concealer in your eyes, putting blush, or doing a whole coverage)</li>
            <li>(let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a very known brand too)</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t feel like I was risking too much.</li>
            <li>would recommend these, they&#x27;re very versatile.</li>
            <li>which really seems to help.  </li>
            <li>They come in a pack of 4 at a much cheaper price than just one sold in store.</li>
            <li>but these makeup blenders absolutely sucked</li>
            <li>Makes putting on foundation makeup so much easier.</li>
            <li>Blends very well.</li>
            <li>I read some of the reviews that stated to soak them in water, and I did so, but the texture didn&#x27;t really become softer.  </li>
            <li>I still use them, but don&#x27;t expect  these sponges to be a Beauty Blender or even the Real Techniques formula.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>I bought these before ever owning a Beauty Blender because I couldn&#x27;t justify paying so much for one sponge.</li>
            <li>I have never tried a Beauty Blender because I can&#x27;t justify to myself paying that much for just one sponge.</li>
            <li>They blend makeup very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Bundle Monster sponges in comparison are VERY dense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~Doesn&#x27;t apply quite as much product as the beauty blender&lt;</li>
            <li>These thing worked very well and smoothed out the look of the foundation on my skin.</li>
            <li>You should also do this because the water keeps the sponge from absorbing your foundation.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wet them before using</li>
            <li>but the difference is very minimum.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wet the sponge before using.</li>
            <li>This way I don&#x27;t have to wash just one at the end of the week, I wash them all and the whole week</li>
            <li>Did not know this product existed, but I must say, they worked very well when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>; I paid that much for 1 before</li>
            <li>but they work as well as the real thing</li>
            <li>streaks and no areas with too much makeup or too little.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that these would give a flawless makeup application, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Harder foam than others I&#x27;ve ordered, but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people just go for the original brand if all the sponges are the same texture</li>
            <li>I went out and purchased the BB for comparison and definitely believe this is one knock off that doesn&#x27;t even come close to the original.</li>
            <li>I saw these at a much greater price in other places.  </li>
            <li>and it is simple to clean.</li>
            <li>They have a very, very plasticy feel to them, as opposed to a soft spongey feel.</li>
            <li>Not sure why &amp;#34;Beauty Blenders&amp;#34; became something to be so excited/fussed about because they don&#x27;t do any more special work than the old ones mentioned.</li>
            <li>This would be a nice stocking stuffer or small gift.</li>
            <li>Replace them pretty frequently otherwise they start to smell a bit mildew-y.</li>
            <li>I tried only the purple one and so far it&#x27;s working just fine.</li>
            <li>Not I have to order a new BB and throw these ones away!</li>
            <li>These are high quality, soft, and very durable!</li>
            <li>I think the finish created by both are very close to the same, with the Bundle Monster giving slightly more coverage, whereas the Beauty Blender applied a little bit more sheer.</li>
            <li>I love this 4pc Beauty Blenders its half the price of the BB</li>
            <li>I have an older towel set aside for this, as it will eventually get foundation stains from the sponge.</li>
            <li>There are pros and cons, but overall, I like the finish just as much as the Beauty Blender, and think it&#x27;s worth it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have 3 sponges left, which I&#x27;m sure will last me another 12 mos.</li>
            <li>Decent price for what you get though.</li>
            <li>Even when moistened they left streaks and spotsnin my makeup and absorbed too much product.</li>
            <li>i think it blends my liquid foundation alot better due to the fact that is the sponge isn&#x27;t as soft!</li>
            <li>never tried the classic beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Just because something is cheap in price doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s cheap in quality too-</li>
            <li>I thought they would be cute, but they smelled bad and didn&#x27;t work any better than regular sponges, but did cost more.</li>
            <li>I have seen the Beautyblender sponges go as high as $50 just for one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>you get so many for so little.</li>
            <li>No streaks or caking of foundation with these cute little makeup blenders.  </li>
            <li>These little sponge balls are absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love these little things.</li>
            <li>they are almost identical, and these seemed a little more flimsy than the BB</li>
            <li>love these little makeup sponges, they are off brand</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is to wash them before use as they can be kind of hard coming out of the pack fresh.</li>
            <li>And so far they have worked out really well.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really need four sponges; they all seem to work the same to me, so I stored three to use after I throw the first out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t use these to actually apply either foundation or concealer because I feel that a lot of the product gets absorbed by the blender.</li>
            <li>I have had these for a few months and they are in okay condition still though I may need to replace them soon.</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I use these with theater makeup which can be really thick and it blends it nicely.</li>
            <li>A little trial &amp; error may be needed if you&#x27;ve never used these, but it&#x27;s worth it!!  </li>
            <li>A good value, a little stiff at first</li>
            <li>really cuts down time and keeps my hands clean from foudation.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is very important to wet these sponges first and wring out the excess water.</li>
            <li>but I was concerned about bacteria growing on the sponge since I use organic cosmetics, so I felt safer making sure it was washed &amp; dried completely.</li>
            <li>I find it harder to use than a regular makeup brush, and finish isn&#x27;t that much better.</li>
            <li>I love these little baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>love my little blenders!</li>
            <li>Definitely not as good as the original beauty blender, but worth it since it&#x27;s so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I ended up taking it back because these sponges are very much alike to me.</li>
            <li>(ie: running it under water first to make it expand, cleaning it properly after using it)</li>
            <li>she says that they felt/performed the exact same way!</li>
            <li>These sponges allow for more even distribution and you can get into small areas around eyes and nose with the pointy bits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used the original Beauty Blender, but I can&#x27;t imagine how different it could possibly be to justify the price.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s basically exactly the same as the beauty blender</li>
            <li>My only complain is that after you soak them in water it doesn&#x27;t come back to their original size or form.</li>
            <li>They also do not absorb the cream or make-up and are easily cleaned with a little soap and water.  </li>
            <li>These are very close in quality to the original Beauty Blenders, except they are a tiny bit harder</li>
            <li>However, if you spritz the sponge so that it is lightly dampened rather than sticking it under running water, this will cause a lot less wastage of your liquid makeup.</li>
            <li>The technique for these is to wet them first and get as much water out as you can.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re about the same as using my fingers with great control and way less mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re as good as the more expensive name brand one</li>
            <li>And the Bundle Monster sponges are definitely more durable, as I have been using mine everyday for several weeks and they still look almost new.</li>
            <li>They are super bouncy, double in size when wet, don&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; all the foundation, and apply really evenly.</li>
            <li>i wish it came with clear instructions how to get started because all i see it doing is soaking up all the foundation...</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s not horribly big, it gives a nicer natural look without brush streaks.</li>
            <li>I have only used two of them so far as they are very durable.  </li>
            <li>These blenders far exceed my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a professional makeup artist for 10 years and wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without these in my kit.</li>
            <li>work well when I wet them, only slightly more dense than the beautyblender, so I would definitely repurchase this item</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a gift for a budding young make-up artist.</li>
            <li>The different shapes really help with applying foundation/concealer.</li>
            <li>not as soft, so feels firmer/more pressure on skin</li>
            <li>Still looks airbrushed and soft.</li>
            <li>Affordable price comparable to professional discounted wholesalers.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by how well I like these sponges.</li>
            <li>Lots of chicks rave about them looking so &#x27;natural&#x27;, but when I can see the foundation on your skin from 3 ft.</li>
            <li>I really prefer using my brush and have gone back to that.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old neice wanted this for xmas.</li>
            <li>will be repurchasing these once mine get old and worn out.</li>
            <li>Depending upon how much water you leave in it will affect how sheer your coverage will be.</li>
            <li>Not for actual application, as these sponges don&#x27;t seem to really stick the product into your skin as the beauty blender does, since the beauty blender is so porous.</li>
            <li>, the bb is soft but doesn&#x27;t blend as well as I thought it should.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheaper than the &#x27;Beauty Blender&#x27;, and work just as well, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>The sponges were very affordable, and they will last me a while.</li>
            <li>You will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one of the sponges but found it to be very durable and work well for applying foundation.</li>
            <li>It is a much firmer sponge overall, but it has its pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I still hear his dumb-founded remarks about women with caked makeup and how they need to go natural or lighter on the makeup once he found out I wear makeup.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; this monstrous sponge off of your face because it&#x27;s far too dense and large.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are made from some type of rubbery material, and they smear makeup unevenly, not blend.</li>
            <li>SOFT AND SQUISHY.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING FURTHER PURCHASES WITH YOU.</li>
            <li>and she loves them since they are soft and help her alot to do her make up by the size and the form of the product.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to use, wet them completely, letting them absorb as much water as possible then squeeze it out, use a paper towel to soak up excess water if needed and leave it only slightly damp..</li>
            <li>but once you wet them they transform into a bouncy texture that just makes make up application fun again.</li>
            <li>These make-up sponges have a good shape, but they smelled vaguely musty or moldy.</li>
            <li>I do take care of them by using a mild facial wash and some olive oil, I keep them in a dry area where they are away from contamination or the elements because I like taking care of my beauty</li>
            <li>These are not like the beauty blender, but man do these little sponges do the job right!</li>
            <li>The sponges are so firm that it takes a lot of effort to clean one.  </li>
            <li>Not near as soft as a the real techniques version or the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Much better than your fingers, or those little tiny white triangle sponges that shred after 1 use!  </li>
            <li>These offer everything that it does but at a major discount!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are much too heavy, and soak up way to much water, nearly tripling in size.</li>
            <li>For the people who say this product is too rough, you will need to dampen the sponge first before using it.</li>
            <li>They do suds a lot the first time you get them wet.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wet the sponges just a little, squeeze out excess moisture, and then pat the foundation out until it is evenly distributed on your face.</li>
            <li>The feel kind of hard too, not softer as I expected.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how they compare to the original - that being said they definitely need a few days of use before they soften up completely, which may be why there are some complaints of stiffness.  </li>
            <li>I would also suggest letting them dry fully before use, as when they are wet they soak up more product than when dry.</li>
            <li>when I use it on these it makes the sponges last sooo much longer than your traditional beauty blender.</li>
            <li>The pores aren&#x27;t too big, and it&#x27;s very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>And you get a lot more of those suckers!</li>
            <li>I tried it and immediately brought the other three sponges to a &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; dinner at friend&#x27;s house and handed them out that very night!</li>
            <li>So I recommend using VERY little soap to  clean it.</li>
            <li>I wash mine with soap every other day and let it air dry on a clean soap dish.</li>
            <li>These cost less than half of the beauty blender and performs as well or even better.  </li>
            <li>I love the tear drop ones but the other ones are not the same material or something because when you get them wet they don&#x27;t bounce back or keep their shape.</li>
            <li>These give the skin an airbrushed finish and are very gentle on dark circles.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t mind a firmer sponge, these work really well and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the reviews complaining that these sponges aren&#x27;t squishy or soft enough.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re plenty soft, especially once put under water.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this product, but probably won&#x27;t need to do so for a few months, as these products are supposed to last a really long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the teardrop shaped one so far</li>
            <li>Once you try these beauty blenders you will not go back to the old way of applying makeup.</li>
            <li>They need to be damp (but not wet)</li>
            <li>I still prefer a Stippling Brush for applying creme foundation to get a sheer, natural look.</li>
            <li>The sponge suck up a lot of foundation -- I was ableto do my whole face with 1 squirt initially &amp; still had enough left to go over my undereye area again.</li>
            <li>It does not absorb too much product when wet and blends</li>
            <li>, my only advise is to completely drench the sponge then wring out and use a towel to wring out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They also absorb way too much product, even when wet.</li>
            <li>However, I think I should have spent the money on the real one.</li>
            <li>Next i put on concealer where needed and add my mineral powder which darkens it to my natural color.</li>
            <li>I tried with shampoo but it barely took it out.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>These sponges smell very odd and are really too large for proper makeup application.  </li>
            <li>The right way to use them is soak them under running water for a few seconds while squeezing them, then squeeze the excess water out and dab/</li>
            <li>As the previous reviews state, you should soak it in water first and then squeeze it out</li>
            <li>but I used everything in a matter of 2-3 months because it&#x27;s hard to clean and</li>
            <li>Do take some time to dry but a little wetness actually helps smooth your makeup on.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of annoying to clean, but they do expand when wet and work pretty well at applying liquid foundation when wet.</li>
            <li>so I was pretty disappointed in that product, but this sponge from bundle monster really is amazing</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant because of the negative reviews that said the quality was inferior to the real brand name ones and that they absorb too much product.</li>
            <li>What first attracted me to this one was the price, but it is not worth it if I&#x27;m only getting two uses out of it.</li>
            <li>only issue (not a complaint per se,) is that the sponge was stained after a single use.</li>
            <li>After buying this product, I have to use less foundation because it gives me amazing coverage with less than half of what I had to use.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied with these, I&#x27;m going back to the Beauty Blender pink sponge!</li>
            <li>After finishing my foundation, I dipped my finger into some colorless finishing powder (Stacey Frasca Studio 28 Hi-Def Powder), mixed it with the foundation left on the back of my hand, dabbed the sponge into the mixture &amp; stippled some more to get full-coverage over a few dark spots/freckles I have below my eyes.</li>
            <li>hard cheap funky smell and extremely hard to clean and dry</li>
            <li>A simple small sponge works better and uses less makeup.</li>
            <li>They do apply your make up, but I feel like I have to press the foundation super hard on face to get it to stick.</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money and fuss over an average, meh product.</li>
            <li>a great price!&amp;#34; BUT now Im sad that i wasted my money on these!</li>
            <li>The material is slightly stiffer  than the real sponge</li>
            <li>(From what I&#x27;ve read, &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; get big when you wet them &amp; become very soft.)</li>
            <li>They are WAY to firm /dense and large.</li>
            <li>so none of it really makes it to your face and the little that does show up on your skin is streaky.</li>
            <li>The problem with this little sponge is that it doesnt really blend well and is the purpose of it so....</li>
            <li>These sponges look like the ones from Spehora however, they are heavy and very high density</li>

            <li> I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> These sponges are amazing.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re amazing, I&#x27;ve never used the Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing..... this package comes with four sponges.</li>
            <li> Great for smooth make up application</li>
            <li> Blends out my foundation for an even smoother look and its just amazing.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars because it does apply makeup amazingly well however, it harbors bacteria</li>
            <li> To each his or her own I suppose.</li>
            <li> You have to put it under water, I use warm for a minute and let it soak it up and ring it out.</li>
            <li> They did apply my foundation quite nicely, which is why I gave them two stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, you cannot beat this deal.</li>
            <li> They do not soak up your foundation, instead they effortlessly blend it on your skin giving you a nice, even look.  </li>
            <li> the product was really nice</li>
            <li> there was no problem with anything overall PERFECT and GREAT</li>
            <li> They puff up quite nice in water.</li>
            <li> I liked how these worked with the creams in the palette.</li>
            <li> They also came packaged really nicely.</li>
            <li> The package was so nice.</li>
            <li> The girl loves it, nice and on time.</li>
            <li> nice quality sponges</li>
            <li> Another thing i liked is that it doesn&#x27;t soak up a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Puts make up on nicely.  </li>
            <li> &gt; \\&quot;This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.\\&quot;</li>

            <li> AND THE ONES FROM BUNDLE MONSTER ARE SOFTER AND EXPAND MORE AND BLEND BETTER!</li>
            <li> I thought that I was doing everything right until I got this blender sponge!!!</li>
            <li> They are soft and supple and the best part is they fit right into my product perfectly!</li>
            <li> it works very good, you just have to wash it first or submerse it in the water and squeeze the water out then use it, the water keeps the liquid foundation or concealer from sucking into the sponge:)</li>
            <li> These blenders are better than the popular beauty blenders</li>
            <li> This is a fun product, the colors are happy colors and you can take one color for blush, another for foundation, etc.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and good.</li>
            <li> They make her makeup look completely natural and flawless.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, I wouldn&#x27;t say they are a complete dupe for the beauty blender</li>
            <li> it just leaves a nice and smooth finish to the face!</li>
            <li> These makeup sponges are so soft and apply my foundation wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Blends to look natural for a flawless face !</li>
            <li> Nice set for the price :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> I liked these better than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> He explains that while &amp;#34;these&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t as squishy as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;, he finds they work just as well and DONT tear easily as do the others!</li>
            <li> Easy to wash!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many sponges and have to say that this is the best so far!  </li>
            <li> Great product and really helps your foundation go on smoother with better coverage!</li>
            <li> I love the application it gives me, and it feels great on my skin, plus it comes with fun colors</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to absorb too much of my foundation and allowed for beautiful stipling and blending.</li>
            <li> they make foundation apply very smooth.</li>
            <li> The sponges are very good quality in my opinion, I don&#x27;t own the original high end beauty blender</li>
            <li> and this really help me a lot with blending they are perfect, and they shipped really quick</li>
            <li> I think this product works just as like the more well-known brands at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> These work as well as the Beauty Blender at a much better price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to using the shapes of these blenders, you&#x27;ll be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love these they work well.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and sizes.</li>
            <li> I really love it ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick around with these &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love how they feel on my skin.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> Better than ones they sell at beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s what you promise to get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li> These are ok....</li>
            <li> The four pack was awesome to get and share with another friend (because you get two of the same style).  </li>
            <li> There are some of these on the market for so much more than this 4 pack</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> But, even the sponge wedges you can buy at the drugstore are better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t splurged on an actual Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t say whether or not these compare, but these are AWESOME.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Latex Free, nice colours and shape.</li>
            <li> I love this beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I love makeup blenders.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> , I am glad I did!t</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job :)  </li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I love the pack and one of them</li>
            <li> Was more like rubber.</li>
            <li> and i really love it</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> , I think maybe the added color, but I don&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
            <li> more durable, lasts longer&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the Bundle Monster sponges are firmer, I am actually ok with that.</li>
            <li> I like the pointy tip on the Bundle Monster sponges better for contouring around my eyes and nose, and once I got used to the firmer density I forgot about it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s better or not.</li>
            <li> I saw these and thought she would love them.</li>
            <li> Love love these, you can rinse/</li>
            <li> and I can say my foundation and concealer have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I Love these sponges and even more because of the price.</li>
            <li> what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> They work better for powders and liquids than creams.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve with my creme foundation &amp; stippling brush.</li>
            <li> Make sure it&#x27;s damp.</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s a four pack, and I get four for a fraction of the cost of the beauty blender, so I won&#x27;t ever have to worry about replacing them anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I am better off using my fingers when applying foundation than this thing.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely not the best ones I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> it does the job, do not know the difference between the one that cost more</li>
            <li> All I have to say is I love</li>
            <li> I just gave 2 away to people who I know use foundation more often than I do.</li>
            <li> and i am glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see that these are any better than my store bought sponges, they are firmer and easier to find</li>
            <li> I LOVE these make up blenders</li>
            <li> These are ok.  </li>
            <li> she really enjoyed these</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I have found that they work 100X better this way.</li>
            <li> Cute colors :)</li>
            <li> If you have never used a makeup sponge you might like these, but there are definitely better ones on the market.</li>
            <li> (it works better that way) and go.  </li>
            <li> I immediately ordered more of these.</li>
            <li> So simple and flawless.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> works hell of a lot better than beauty blender</li>
            <li> Love the price .</li>
            <li> I love the colors and practical shapes these have.</li>
            <li> and I could not be any more satified with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> If I notice any issues arise, I&#x27;ll make sure to update.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because they are cute and is four for the price of one.</li>
            <li> Plus, now I have 4 :)</li>
            <li> It kind of just roughly smear your makeup and doesn&#x27;t look flawless.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges.  </li>
            <li> The beauty blender foundation puff couldn&#x27;t be better.  </li>
            <li> They could not be better.  </li>
            <li> Also love it</li>
            <li> Would purchase again :-)</li>
            <li> I love these beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> I love to use them damp.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT &amp;</li>
            <li> but I decided to put the foundation on with a different sponge and it came out flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I prefer more airy blenders but these stay in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> I have seen these sponges on another site for a lot more money and the price was for just one sponge.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> And of course, the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> The official beauty blender is more spongy and squishy - when you press it to your face</li>
            <li> Made it look much better.</li>
            <li> I love these things.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> the fact that they soak up more product that I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> better then the days i dont wear it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my favorite beauty gurus on youtube suggested it.</li>
            <li> It doubles in size and is muccchhhh more squishy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the beauty blender for many years now.  </li>
            <li> I will buy again and again :-)</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Make sure you soak them before you use them...</li>
            <li> And you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> Love them so much better than a brush to blend</li>
            <li> I have used both these and an authentic beauty blender makeup sponge, and I prefer these.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re cute too.</li>
            <li> This deal gives you more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> she loves the creamy looking one the most</li>
            <li> and my favorite once</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the reviews on the beauty blender but thought this product was a way better value because you get 4 sponges.</li>
            <li> Im glad i bought this from amazon.</li>
            <li> These are a lot more &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;, and I feel like I&#x27;m going to do permanent damage to my skin when applying foundation/concealer, and blending my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love these beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> I love these more than the beauty blender brand.</li>
            <li> love my blundle monster blender.</li>
            <li> I wish I can get them in all purple, I just love purple.  </li>
            <li> have found them to be of good, sound quality and work as well as the original Beauty Blender they are imitating.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with the Beauty Blender product, you know that it is amazing</li>
            <li> They are cheaper than the original beautify sponge, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Soft and good quality!</li>
            <li> They are nice to have if you cannot afford the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> They are also incredibly easy to clean, and they come in the most adorable colors and packaging!</li>
            <li> It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and blend my foundation and concealer flawlessly without soaking up my makeup.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t exactly like the beauty blender, but they are a good substitute for the price.</li>
            <li> Best bargan I have gotte in a long time.  </li>
            <li> it pretty good</li>
            <li> Application of makeup was fine, nothing great, but what really bothered me was cleaning.</li>
            <li> awesome product, i do wish that they were 4 different shapes but other than that they are perfect, i have used them a lot</li>
            <li> Just save and get an original beauty blender!</li>
            <li> Great at blending foundation/concealer and making look more natural</li>
            <li> Not as squishy as a genuine Beauty Blender, but still fantastic, and makes my foundation look amazing.</li>
            <li> These came so quick and they&#x27;re absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Not by Mike Tyson or anything, but more like being punched by a really strong baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shape is ok and spinges are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am able to blend my makeup easily.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> however, you CANNOT clean these!</li>
            <li> Overall they are fantastic sponges, they blend perfectly, are easy to work with and cleanup is a breeze with them.</li>
            <li> this is a very good buy you get 4 sponges, same or close to a brand name quality.</li>
            <li> Great for quality professional makeup application.</li>
            <li> soft, rolls on, great with foundation.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and how well it blends my foundation unto my face.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t bother with none of these anymore and will continue using my old wedge puffs that have been working great for 30 years for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased a beauty blender from sephora for $20 and loved it so much but didnt want to pay another 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> The blenders are soft, apply make-up flawlessly and is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is great because it absorbs less product - good news if your foundation is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i use maybe line true match liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> They are more compact compared to the original beauty blender sponges, which I think affects application.</li>
            <li> They allow you to apply foundation easily, without lines and it&#x27;s easy to blend foundation and concealer as well.</li>
            <li> easy resolve water 3.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve kept their shape and are easy to wash and use.</li>
            <li> from somewhere that you can easily return if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The texture isn&#x27;t the best for any makeup application, it sheers out and absorbs makeup far too much.</li>
            <li> I have severe cystic acne on my chin, and these sponges give me great, natural looking coverage using a cheap drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li> This sponges are great for the amount of many expended in them,they are actually really similar to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> but so far so good :)</li>
            <li> But as far as applying makeup better than brushes or the puffy wedges, they do not and are just as good as the drug store types.</li>
            <li> So this was a really good deal that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Any of my foundations are now full coverage for my ( most of my foundations are drug store bought) easy to use.</li>
            <li> I kind of came across them by accident and being an avid Mac makeup brush user</li>
            <li> best way I can describe the Bundle Monster sponge is that it isn&#x27;t really spongy at all - it&#x27;s more like a solid piece of foam.</li>
            <li> A good starter sponge for anyone looking to try out new ways to do makeup.</li>
            <li> Evidently the various puffs make for perfect make-up blending.</li>
            <li> These work fine in a pinch but for beauty why skimp just for price?</li>
            <li> Easily washable and some of them are shaped to enable precise application and blending of liquid or cream formulas in hard-to-reach areas of the face.</li>
            <li> They work for what I use them for fine.</li>
            <li> From what I can gather they work fine.</li>
            <li> i love these makeup blender foundation puff,  not to big, nice size and works well!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much foundation, but when I do, I love to use this sponges!</li>
            <li> , it is sterdy, soft, expands when wet, cleans easily, applies my makeup flawlessly, and and amazing price overall,it also was just like the one in the picture displayed before you purchase them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I think these are great quality and not cheaply made, I would have liked to see instructions on how to use them within the package.</li>
            <li> The different shapes are great and I like the smooth almost velvet texture of the sponges.  </li>
            <li> but I really did not want to spend that kind of money</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They give me an even, smooth look.</li>
            <li> enjoy</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t go to cheap</li>
            <li> Took a while to receive but the product itself just seems too cheap.</li>
            <li> Using these gives a smooth finish and it helps your makeup not cake up.</li>
            <li> Also, i think i use more makeup because some gets absorbed in the sponge.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re easy to to clean too.</li>
            <li> They are much squishier than a beauty blender I think, but I liked that about them.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> and it gives me that smooth, even application.</li>
            <li> I give one to my friend and she liked it so much she got rid of her brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these blender sponges precisely because I&#x27;ve avoided liquid foundation for years</li>
            <li> I use these everyday and they work excellent.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on smoothly with this.</li>
            <li> Cheap alternative to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> These are such a bargain for 4 really great sponges, and they clean so easily.</li>
            <li> Also, its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I need more coverage for my melasma and mild adult acne, so I squeezed out almost all the water and followed with a good squeeze in a clean towel.</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re latex free, so I can use them on clients who have latex allergies.</li>
            <li> Her face/make-up look smooth</li>
            <li> Why spend $20 on up for one when you can get this fantastic 4 piece set for $10.99.</li>
            <li> then I say to give these a try because they really are amazing.</li>
            <li> They do increase in size when soaked with water, and they are smooth in texture.</li>
            <li> I really wish someone had given an honest review before I bought these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Teardrop sponges are fantastic for around the nose and under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I think it is easy and clean.</li>
            <li> I wash them with antibacterial soap, water and alcohol , to keep them bacteria free.  </li>
            <li> so far so good, I feel like I use a lot of my foundation with these sponges.</li>
            <li> but so far so good with applying my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I love these when applying my liquid foundation its a breeze, especially getting under the eye and the sides are so good..</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a whole set of these and finally i found some at a great price!!</li>
            <li> These work great for application and setting and can be easily cleaned and reused over and over which will save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!!!  </li>
            <li> Then they softens and works very nice from regular use.</li>
            <li> Very worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loved them and they work really well and are very reasonable.</li>
            <li> My new favorite makeup tool!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $20 plus dollars for the Beauty Blender and found great dupes for half the price and more product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the original beauty blender but does the job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the money to shell out on the original one</li>
            <li> These are nice and soft, and they&#x27;re easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Surely these people were using them with too much force!</li>
            <li> Nothing to be compared to the original beauty blender</li>
            <li> i know these arent the original</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> The colors are fun too!</li>
            <li> It works better if you dab the foundation on your forehead, cheeks, nose and chin first.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> No need to spend a million dollars on original beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> They are a bit heavier and firmer than the original beauty blender, but they still do the job.</li>
            <li> If I had both in front of me, I would pick the original...</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed with them.</li>
            <li> , I would still say, get the original anyway but</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t give you the feel for the original product.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare them to the original BB because I never purchased it</li>
            <li> Sure enough, when she opened them Christmas morning, she loved them and used them right away.</li>
            <li> Anyone know how to clean them?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dupe to the Beauty Blender but will expand a lot in water and does make applying foundation fun and easy.</li>
            <li> The puff are cute and soft, but makeup brushes are still the better buy.  </li>
            <li> But the sponge keeps a lot of your makeup, so you will need to clean regularly.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> clean these sponges and reuse</li>
            <li> The stain comes off of course when you clean it.</li>
            <li> I clean them using California Baby organic baby shampoo, and that gets them really clean.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pain to have to clean all the time</li>
            <li> I have a clean one to put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> I use the pointed end to clean up brow</li>
            <li> I like these sponges, they are easy to use ,the price is right for the quantity and quality-</li>
            <li> The real BB is soft and very easy to use on your face...</li>
            <li> Dont buy the real beauty blender because this are so much better</li>
            <li> They are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> They work well, and of good quality, I would definitely recommend over the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Good product especially for the price</li>
            <li> At least I know they&#x27;re cleaned at the factory lol!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it came really fast.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, definitely improves look of makeup application.</li>
            <li> I know the price makes it tempting to atleast want to give these a try, but these sponges truely suck and I ended up throwing them all away.</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t seem to soak up the foundation like the regular makeup sponges...which is good.</li>
            <li> I love these so much.</li>
            <li> but these work a bit better and don&#x27;t wear out as fast hope</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
            <li> Good package to experiment with the different shapes.</li>
            <li> The color are too cute that my daughter wants to have them.</li>
            <li> love them, they work really well with cream and liquid foundations / concealers.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to fork out 40 bucks for something similar to this, but this works just as good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this \\&quot;steals\\&quot; much of my foundation, if I feel like I need more coverage I just add another layer.</li>
            <li> good product overall</li>
            <li> For full review, plus video demonstration, please see my beauty/makeup blog:</li>
            <li> Yes, true, they are bigger and in a nice shape, which is great for a facial massage in addition to applying foundation.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my foundation has been better applied with these blender sponges.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it for an extra christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Good for people on a budget who want a similar finish to a Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> Still, not a bad deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and easy to use the sponges get when there moist.  </li>
            <li> I love these makeup sponges, makes everything look very natural, smooth and even.</li>
            <li> I washed mine in warm soapy water and let it dry, and good as new.</li>
            <li> They apply my foundation easily, but upon their first use they seem to absorb quite a bit of my foundation.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash ( unlike the Soho one that came apart on the first wash)</li>
            <li> They are just perfect, they are very small.</li>
            <li> These however, blends smoothly and makes it look so much more natural even with full coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the more expensive blenders so I don&#x27;t know in comparison, but these cheaper blender works great to me!</li>
            <li> I received the item quickly.</li>
            <li> It does feel bulky to me but because of the size it does offer a quick coverage.  </li>
            <li> I love how bouncy they are, I can use them for smudging or for blending, and they come in lots of shapes to allow many different application processes to be done with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> These are soft, easy to use and clean, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for four pieces!  </li>
            <li> I refuse to pay the high price for the beauty blender and love the feel of theses sponges.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure dryiing the sponge on high would ruin</li>
            <li> Lovely sponges and a good value but just a bit stiff for me.</li>
            <li> It DOES get bigger than it&#x27;s original size are soaking and rinsing in warm water.</li>
            <li> They are not identical in application but they are both soft and expand a lot when wet, pick up product and blend it amazingly, texture wise</li>
            <li> Colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> You live and you learn. :)</li>
            <li> Never tried the original Beauty Blender, I just think it is a lot of money for a sponge, but once again it depend on how much you use it, for you to decide if its worth it!</li>
            <li> Very even and easy.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; sponge (which came with no directions!)</li>
            <li> It sure beats my old triangle sponge!</li>
            <li> First off, the price for these is wonderful because these can easily be more expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought new foundation and the same time and thought it was he foundation that got great reviews</li>
            <li> Love them better than the over priced single beauty blender sponges.</li>
            <li> These little puffs are great for applying foundation.  </li>
            <li> problem is that they seem to pick up way more makeup than I normally use, even when I&#x27;m trying not to, so I went through a period of feeling like I had way too much on, and was using it much more quickly than I normally do.  </li>
            <li> It is recommended to wash them with warm water and gentle soap before first use; and before every use, wet with warm water and gently squeeze the excess water with a clean towel.</li>
            <li> these beauty blenders are really amazing,  my foundation look more natural after applying it with them , I think it gives the same result of +20$  blenders .</li>
            <li> They worked well for me and are such amazing bargain.</li>
            <li> I have used cheap makeup sponges for years and never thought much of it.&lt;br /&gt;I was always switching out my foundation thinking it was not that good.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, definitely comparable to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> make up really goes on smooth</li>
            <li> and it is definitely better than those old triangle sponges.  </li>
            <li> And for the price, they&#x27;re definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> These work great!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but well worth the buy compared to a name brand  bender</li>
            <li> but it honestly does the same thing.</li>
            <li> This product does expand once water has been absorbed into it.</li>
            <li> But I lost one on vacation, so I guess it was nice to have three back ups at home.</li>
            <li> These are the nice bigger size...</li>
            <li> (FYI, I used Bulgarian rosewater to wet my sponge, since it&#x27;s good for your skin anyway.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> Yes, I own a lot of different brands and types of foundation -</li>
            <li> but these are really cute and soft.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I wish I had just bought these.</li>
            <li> However, I have decided the beauty blender is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> so worth the money ...</li>
            <li> so they seem to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> A beauty blender expands when it is placed under water and that&#x27;s what makes for such a nice non crease application of concealer and foundation</li>
            <li> While these are good &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; texture makeup sponges, those who have used real BB&#x27;s before will notice that the texture is not the same.  </li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re worth the buy.</li>
            <li> worth the price and the wait.</li>
            <li> They are of high quality and easy to rinse out makeup.</li>
            <li> I have never tried the original beauty blender which costs quite a bit more for a package of only one.  </li>
            <li> pointed tip also makes it easier to get right up to your lower lash line when applying concealer - the original beauty blender has more of a rounded tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Tougher than the beauty blender, and will probably last a lot longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do blend it very nicely, but there is wasted product.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim since I had heard so much about the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> The other one is good for applying your foundation...</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she is a makeup fanatic she likes high quality items and these were perfect</li>
            <li> Why aren&#x27;t you getting this right now?</li>
            <li> but it was refunded right away...</li>
            <li> So it turns out I have not been using the right</li>
            <li> It absorbs the water and glides the foundation right on.</li>
            <li> I bought a backup pack of 4 with free shipping from amazon, and I think I am officially set now for pretty much...... ever.</li>
            <li> With 4 to a pack, you&#x27;ll always have one ready to use while you clean the others.  </li>
            <li> I love that they come in different shapes and also that they are almost exact to the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> You have to wet and towel dry before using them to get the best results.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how great it is.  </li>
            <li> The stain remains on the sponge the way it does with those cheap wedge-shaped latex sponges that you don&#x27;t normally reuse.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well and are worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all, compared to the high priced &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34;! I would recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li> I prefer a good brush to these -- hands down.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are slightly smaller, you don&#x27;t need a large blender to be effective.</li>
            <li> (this is what BB Cream is meant to do its more skin care then true makeup but great as a base if you still need more coverage).</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I wanted the Beauty Blender sponge, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high amount of money.</li>
            <li> They leave both my BB cream and creme foundation flawless unlike my stippling brush that left it feeling heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> I love that this is expensive and works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sponges are relatively dense, don&#x27;t seem to fall apart after use, and are easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I really love the pink on, particularly, I have used it to death, I need to buy more of these.</li>
            <li> Price is great compared to some of the more expensive &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> It cuts the time in half of applying your foundation &amp; it gives a gorgeous almost airbrushed finish.</li>
            <li> It blends very well, and it does create a more natural, air-brushed look.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that I purchased these instead of getting the more expensive version that you find in beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are any more special than the old style puffs you buy at your local drug store for just couple bucks for a full bag of them.</li>
            <li> these are very very comparable they puff up well when adding water and</li>
            <li> I just received them and I like them, very very much.</li>
            <li> REALLY like them, which was surprising for me as I have bought other brands at places like Target</li>
            <li> These sponges are better than my old dry sponge in that they do give a more finished effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works amazing when wet so</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, though.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;just make sure you know how to use it properly</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> so I thought them so fast!  </li>
            <li> I purchased these after hearing all the hype about the beauty blender and thought I&#x27;d try the dupe first.</li>
            <li> Exactly like beauty blenders without the name.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because cleaning darker foundation out of these takes patience, and I ripped one while trying to do so the first time.</li>
            <li> ; that I have now is from Avon and it works pretty well</li>
            <li> First time using a product like this</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product by this seller is absolute gold!</li>
            <li> The best part, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> These sponges are great for thicker foundations that are in a solid stick or cream in a compact and of course bb creams (the real Korean ones, not the American version).</li>
            <li> This causes the sponge to suck in makeup, such as liquid foundation, allowing for a more even application.  </li>
            <li> I regretted so much!</li>
            <li> It is so much better than those triangular white sponges!</li>
            <li> It leave streaks on my face, and absorb so much of my foundation!</li>
            <li> I love the colors and different shapes.  </li>
            <li> I use a foundation brush, although I think this is more of a personal preference.  </li>
            <li> and it was an exact replica of the beauty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a visual person.</li>
            <li> The packaging was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> One sponge can last for many months if you keep up with cleaning it after every use or every week.</li>
            <li> It never soaks up your product so your able to get the maximum potential of the product you are using.</li>
            <li> They arrived yesterday (yay for fast shipping!)</li>
            <li> If using these sponges, I recommend only using for touching up foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash them out to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as mentioned</li>
            <li> She likes using these sponges better than the traditional, disposable sponges.</li>
            <li> I use mine daily and love them.  </li>
            <li> I dampen the sponge first</li>
            <li> These are exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> First order got lost in the mail</li>
            <li> i will highly recommend these!!</li>
            <li> I first heard about these sponges from a blogger</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend these enough to those looking for an a more affordable version of the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> The texture when you first buy the sponges is hard-ish</li>
            <li> but they come pretty close.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> and it makes the application look so natural and smooth.</li>
            <li> It blends out the foundation pretty well</li>
            <li> and I totally understand why the BB is better.</li>
            <li> Great and soft beauty blenders God half the price at sephora</li>
            <li> Other than that this product is AMAZING</li>
            <li> Just not as soft as the original ...</li>
            <li> I will buy these can&#x27;t live without the blender if I can&#x27;t find these just go with a other one but a good one</li>
            <li> they clean very well with some brush cleaner, gets is all like like brand new.</li>
            <li> They were cheap, so for the money, I think it&#x27;s worth it, especially for 4 of them.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive beauty blender that I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about how &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; give you a sheer, airbrushed look with a liquid foundation, so I bought these since they were offered at such a good price.</li>
            <li> after using one of these with foundation I thought i did not like as it settled into my poors and looked terrible on my skin even with using good primer, I was very happy.</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive blenders and these are just as good.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re super soft and gentle!</li>
            <li> something&#x27;s are better to just go out &amp; buy Instead of waiting a long time,</li>
            <li> I tried to gently stipple my foundation on my face and it really did feel like being punched in the face!</li>
            <li> They are big enough to grasp comfortably and control so you can more evenly apply make-up and cream.  </li>
            <li> Ordinary beauty blenders can go upto $32.00 but this is affordable and good.</li>
            <li> well spend you get a good product for a small amount of money if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> So, although I can&#x27;t compare the Bundle Monster sponges to the original Beauty Blender, I can say that these sponges definitely get the job done, blending my foundation smoothly and seamlessly.</li>
            <li> but I have purchased the MAC Pro Soonge and these little sponges are 10x better and softer!</li>
            <li> It expands and feels so super soft.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you wet them first in order to get optimal use.</li>
            <li> and I would certainly buy from this seller again.  </li>
            <li> The product certainly fulfills my expectations.</li>
            <li> They are a great alternative to sponge foundation applicators typically sold at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> Foundation application  is flawless and less messy.</li>
            <li> but after the first wash they cleaned great and were soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> the sponges are great for coverage, sheer to heavy, everything looks even</li>
            <li> I use this puff everyday and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints about the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> Get the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> After 4 gentle squeezes under a running tap, the sponges doubled in size and became softer.</li>
            <li> They work very well blending my foundation.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected.</li>
            <li> And apply foundation very well.</li>
            <li> I will be getting another set very soon.</li>
            <li> but it comes really really close</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t want to put them on my face after smelling that.</li>
            <li> The Bundle Monster is okey but does help much...</li>
            <li> or help much with my cover. ?</li>
            <li> When used correctly, these sponges apply foundation gently and evenly.</li>
            <li> The foundation gets obsorved way to much and it&#x27;s a waist of product</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the real beauty blender, but when I do, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> I should have bought the real thing.</li>
            <li> and so I needed something fast.</li>
            <li> They do need to be washed more often than my beauty blender sponge, but thats not really an issue.</li>
            <li> Make sure you run them under the sink so they&#x27;re completely wet before you apply.</li>
            <li> you too do not want to pay a high price to blend your foundation, please give these a try!</li>
            <li> and they really suck, so</li>
            <li> the shapes doesn&#x27;t really matter when applying around the eye area</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even feel like a real sponge.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to wet it :)</li>
            <li> i realize they arent the real thing</li>
            <li> so they won&#x27;t absorb so much of your product as you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> These work really well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about makeup but from what she tells me</li>
            <li> What helped me decide on buying these was thanks to a blog post on these blenders at [...].</li>
            <li> The review is simply straight to the point.</li>
            <li> I really like these blender brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just like the real BB.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare the two</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper sponge that looks like the beauty blender and does a fantastic job, then this is definitely for you.</li>
            <li> Having nothing to compare them to, I must say that the sponge I used didn&#x27;t really swell up the way everyone says &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a real beauty blender, but this sponge gives me the airbrush effect that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> However, some people complain that this process causes the sponges to suck in too much makeup and cause wastage as a result.  </li>
            <li> really.</li>
            <li> Feels so much nicer on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you get it wet and wring it out before use.</li>
            <li> It just feels much softer to me.</li>
            <li> Save your money BUY the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Even once submerged in water, they really do not become much better.</li>
            <li> Splurge on the real deal.</li>
            <li> Gently pat the foundation out and blend.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend saw me getting ready one morning</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend these to anyone considering purchasing them.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out the dough for the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a quality in a box.</li>
            <li> And by it&#x27;s shape and size, you can just use one for everything (Putting concealer in your eyes, putting blush, or doing a whole coverage)</li>
            <li> (let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a very known brand too)</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t feel like I was risking too much.</li>
            <li> would recommend these, they&#x27;re very versatile.</li>
            <li> which really seems to help.  </li>
            <li> They come in a pack of 4 at a much cheaper price than just one sold in store.</li>
            <li> but these makeup blenders absolutely sucked</li>
            <li> Makes putting on foundation makeup so much easier.</li>
            <li> Blends very well.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews that stated to soak them in water, and I did so, but the texture didn&#x27;t really become softer.  </li>
            <li> I still use them, but don&#x27;t expect  these sponges to be a Beauty Blender or even the Real Techniques formula.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> I bought these before ever owning a Beauty Blender because I couldn&#x27;t justify paying so much for one sponge.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a Beauty Blender because I can&#x27;t justify to myself paying that much for just one sponge.</li>
            <li> They blend makeup very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Bundle Monster sponges in comparison are VERY dense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~Doesn&#x27;t apply quite as much product as the beauty blender&lt;</li>
            <li> These thing worked very well and smoothed out the look of the foundation on my skin.</li>
            <li> You should also do this because the water keeps the sponge from absorbing your foundation.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wet them before using</li>
            <li> but the difference is very minimum.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wet the sponge before using.</li>
            <li> This way I don&#x27;t have to wash just one at the end of the week, I wash them all and the whole week</li>
            <li> Did not know this product existed, but I must say, they worked very well when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> ; I paid that much for 1 before</li>
            <li> but they work as well as the real thing</li>
            <li> streaks and no areas with too much makeup or too little.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that these would give a flawless makeup application, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Harder foam than others I&#x27;ve ordered, but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people just go for the original brand if all the sponges are the same texture</li>
            <li> I went out and purchased the BB for comparison and definitely believe this is one knock off that doesn&#x27;t even come close to the original.</li>
            <li> I saw these at a much greater price in other places.  </li>
            <li> and it is simple to clean.</li>
            <li> They have a very, very plasticy feel to them, as opposed to a soft spongey feel.</li>
            <li> Not sure why &amp;#34;Beauty Blenders&amp;#34; became something to be so excited/fussed about because they don&#x27;t do any more special work than the old ones mentioned.</li>
            <li> This would be a nice stocking stuffer or small gift.</li>
            <li> Replace them pretty frequently otherwise they start to smell a bit mildew-y.</li>
            <li> I tried only the purple one and so far it&#x27;s working just fine.</li>
            <li> Not I have to order a new BB and throw these ones away!</li>
            <li> These are high quality, soft, and very durable!</li>
            <li> I think the finish created by both are very close to the same, with the Bundle Monster giving slightly more coverage, whereas the Beauty Blender applied a little bit more sheer.</li>
            <li> I love this 4pc Beauty Blenders its half the price of the BB</li>
            <li> I have an older towel set aside for this, as it will eventually get foundation stains from the sponge.</li>
            <li> There are pros and cons, but overall, I like the finish just as much as the Beauty Blender, and think it&#x27;s worth it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have 3 sponges left, which I&#x27;m sure will last me another 12 mos.</li>
            <li> Decent price for what you get though.</li>
            <li> Even when moistened they left streaks and spotsnin my makeup and absorbed too much product.</li>
            <li> i think it blends my liquid foundation alot better due to the fact that is the sponge isn&#x27;t as soft!</li>
            <li> never tried the classic beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Just because something is cheap in price doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s cheap in quality too-</li>
            <li> I thought they would be cute, but they smelled bad and didn&#x27;t work any better than regular sponges, but did cost more.</li>
            <li> I have seen the Beautyblender sponges go as high as $50 just for one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> you get so many for so little.</li>
            <li> No streaks or caking of foundation with these cute little makeup blenders.  </li>
            <li> These little sponge balls are absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love these little things.</li>
            <li> they are almost identical, and these seemed a little more flimsy than the BB</li>
            <li> love these little makeup sponges, they are off brand</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to wash them before use as they can be kind of hard coming out of the pack fresh.</li>
            <li> And so far they have worked out really well.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really need four sponges; they all seem to work the same to me, so I stored three to use after I throw the first out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t use these to actually apply either foundation or concealer because I feel that a lot of the product gets absorbed by the blender.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a few months and they are in okay condition still though I may need to replace them soon.</li>
            <li> You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I use these with theater makeup which can be really thick and it blends it nicely.</li>
            <li> A little trial &amp; error may be needed if you&#x27;ve never used these, but it&#x27;s worth it!!  </li>
            <li> A good value, a little stiff at first</li>
            <li> really cuts down time and keeps my hands clean from foudation.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is very important to wet these sponges first and wring out the excess water.</li>
            <li> but I was concerned about bacteria growing on the sponge since I use organic cosmetics, so I felt safer making sure it was washed &amp; dried completely.</li>
            <li> I find it harder to use than a regular makeup brush, and finish isn&#x27;t that much better.</li>
            <li> I love these little baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> love my little blenders!</li>
            <li> Definitely not as good as the original beauty blender, but worth it since it&#x27;s so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I ended up taking it back because these sponges are very much alike to me.</li>
            <li> (ie: running it under water first to make it expand, cleaning it properly after using it)</li>
            <li> she says that they felt/performed the exact same way!</li>
            <li> These sponges allow for more even distribution and you can get into small areas around eyes and nose with the pointy bits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the original Beauty Blender, but I can&#x27;t imagine how different it could possibly be to justify the price.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s basically exactly the same as the beauty blender</li>
            <li> My only complain is that after you soak them in water it doesn&#x27;t come back to their original size or form.</li>
            <li> They also do not absorb the cream or make-up and are easily cleaned with a little soap and water.  </li>
            <li> These are very close in quality to the original Beauty Blenders, except they are a tiny bit harder</li>
            <li> However, if you spritz the sponge so that it is lightly dampened rather than sticking it under running water, this will cause a lot less wastage of your liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> The technique for these is to wet them first and get as much water out as you can.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re about the same as using my fingers with great control and way less mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re as good as the more expensive name brand one</li>
            <li> And the Bundle Monster sponges are definitely more durable, as I have been using mine everyday for several weeks and they still look almost new.</li>
            <li> They are super bouncy, double in size when wet, don&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; all the foundation, and apply really evenly.</li>
            <li> i wish it came with clear instructions how to get started because all i see it doing is soaking up all the foundation...</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s not horribly big, it gives a nicer natural look without brush streaks.</li>
            <li> I have only used two of them so far as they are very durable.  </li>
            <li> These blenders far exceed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional makeup artist for 10 years and wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without these in my kit.</li>
            <li> work well when I wet them, only slightly more dense than the beautyblender, so I would definitely repurchase this item</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for a budding young make-up artist.</li>
            <li> The different shapes really help with applying foundation/concealer.</li>
            <li> not as soft, so feels firmer/more pressure on skin</li>
            <li> Still looks airbrushed and soft.</li>
            <li> Affordable price comparable to professional discounted wholesalers.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by how well I like these sponges.</li>
            <li> Lots of chicks rave about them looking so &#x27;natural&#x27;, but when I can see the foundation on your skin from 3 ft.</li>
            <li> I really prefer using my brush and have gone back to that.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old neice wanted this for xmas.</li>
            <li> will be repurchasing these once mine get old and worn out.</li>
            <li> Depending upon how much water you leave in it will affect how sheer your coverage will be.</li>
            <li> Not for actual application, as these sponges don&#x27;t seem to really stick the product into your skin as the beauty blender does, since the beauty blender is so porous.</li>
            <li> , the bb is soft but doesn&#x27;t blend as well as I thought it should.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than the &#x27;Beauty Blender&#x27;, and work just as well, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> The sponges were very affordable, and they will last me a while.</li>
            <li> You will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of the sponges but found it to be very durable and work well for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> It is a much firmer sponge overall, but it has its pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I still hear his dumb-founded remarks about women with caked makeup and how they need to go natural or lighter on the makeup once he found out I wear makeup.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; this monstrous sponge off of your face because it&#x27;s far too dense and large.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are made from some type of rubbery material, and they smear makeup unevenly, not blend.</li>
            <li> SOFT AND SQUISHY.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING FURTHER PURCHASES WITH YOU.</li>
            <li> and she loves them since they are soft and help her alot to do her make up by the size and the form of the product.</li>
            <li> They are super easy to use, wet them completely, letting them absorb as much water as possible then squeeze it out, use a paper towel to soak up excess water if needed and leave it only slightly damp..</li>
            <li> but once you wet them they transform into a bouncy texture that just makes make up application fun again.</li>
            <li> These make-up sponges have a good shape, but they smelled vaguely musty or moldy.</li>
            <li> I do take care of them by using a mild facial wash and some olive oil, I keep them in a dry area where they are away from contamination or the elements because I like taking care of my beauty</li>
            <li> These are not like the beauty blender, but man do these little sponges do the job right!</li>
            <li> The sponges are so firm that it takes a lot of effort to clean one.  </li>
            <li> Not near as soft as a the real techniques version or the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Much better than your fingers, or those little tiny white triangle sponges that shred after 1 use!  </li>
            <li> These offer everything that it does but at a major discount!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are much too heavy, and soak up way to much water, nearly tripling in size.</li>
            <li> For the people who say this product is too rough, you will need to dampen the sponge first before using it.</li>
            <li> They do suds a lot the first time you get them wet.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wet the sponges just a little, squeeze out excess moisture, and then pat the foundation out until it is evenly distributed on your face.</li>
            <li> The feel kind of hard too, not softer as I expected.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how they compare to the original - that being said they definitely need a few days of use before they soften up completely, which may be why there are some complaints of stiffness.  </li>
            <li> I would also suggest letting them dry fully before use, as when they are wet they soak up more product than when dry.</li>
            <li> when I use it on these it makes the sponges last sooo much longer than your traditional beauty blender.</li>
            <li> The pores aren&#x27;t too big, and it&#x27;s very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> And you get a lot more of those suckers!</li>
            <li> I tried it and immediately brought the other three sponges to a &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; dinner at friend&#x27;s house and handed them out that very night!</li>
            <li> So I recommend using VERY little soap to  clean it.</li>
            <li> I wash mine with soap every other day and let it air dry on a clean soap dish.</li>
            <li> These cost less than half of the beauty blender and performs as well or even better.  </li>
            <li> I love the tear drop ones but the other ones are not the same material or something because when you get them wet they don&#x27;t bounce back or keep their shape.</li>
            <li> These give the skin an airbrushed finish and are very gentle on dark circles.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t mind a firmer sponge, these work really well and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the reviews complaining that these sponges aren&#x27;t squishy or soft enough.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re plenty soft, especially once put under water.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this product, but probably won&#x27;t need to do so for a few months, as these products are supposed to last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the teardrop shaped one so far</li>
            <li> Once you try these beauty blenders you will not go back to the old way of applying makeup.</li>
            <li> They need to be damp (but not wet)</li>
            <li> I still prefer a Stippling Brush for applying creme foundation to get a sheer, natural look.</li>
            <li> The sponge suck up a lot of foundation -- I was ableto do my whole face with 1 squirt initially &amp; still had enough left to go over my undereye area again.</li>
            <li> It does not absorb too much product when wet and blends</li>
            <li> , my only advise is to completely drench the sponge then wring out and use a towel to wring out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They also absorb way too much product, even when wet.</li>
            <li> However, I think I should have spent the money on the real one.</li>
            <li> Next i put on concealer where needed and add my mineral powder which darkens it to my natural color.</li>
            <li> I tried with shampoo but it barely took it out.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> These sponges smell very odd and are really too large for proper makeup application.  </li>
            <li> The right way to use them is soak them under running water for a few seconds while squeezing them, then squeeze the excess water out and dab/</li>
            <li> As the previous reviews state, you should soak it in water first and then squeeze it out</li>
            <li> but I used everything in a matter of 2-3 months because it&#x27;s hard to clean and</li>
            <li> Do take some time to dry but a little wetness actually helps smooth your makeup on.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kind of annoying to clean, but they do expand when wet and work pretty well at applying liquid foundation when wet.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty disappointed in that product, but this sponge from bundle monster really is amazing</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant because of the negative reviews that said the quality was inferior to the real brand name ones and that they absorb too much product.</li>
            <li> What first attracted me to this one was the price, but it is not worth it if I&#x27;m only getting two uses out of it.</li>
            <li> only issue (not a complaint per se,) is that the sponge was stained after a single use.</li>
            <li> After buying this product, I have to use less foundation because it gives me amazing coverage with less than half of what I had to use.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied with these, I&#x27;m going back to the Beauty Blender pink sponge!</li>
            <li> After finishing my foundation, I dipped my finger into some colorless finishing powder (Stacey Frasca Studio 28 Hi-Def Powder), mixed it with the foundation left on the back of my hand, dabbed the sponge into the mixture &amp; stippled some more to get full-coverage over a few dark spots/freckles I have below my eyes.</li>
            <li> hard cheap funky smell and extremely hard to clean and dry</li>
            <li> A simple small sponge works better and uses less makeup.</li>
            <li> They do apply your make up, but I feel like I have to press the foundation super hard on face to get it to stick.</li>
            <li> Huge waste of money and fuss over an average, meh product.</li>
            <li> a great price!&amp;#34; BUT now Im sad that i wasted my money on these!</li>
            <li> The material is slightly stiffer  than the real sponge</li>
            <li> (From what I&#x27;ve read, &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; get big when you wet them &amp; become very soft.)</li>
            <li> They are WAY to firm /dense and large.</li>
            <li> so none of it really makes it to your face and the little that does show up on your skin is streaky.</li>
            <li> The problem with this little sponge is that it doesnt really blend well and is the purpose of it so....</li>
            <li> These sponges look like the ones from Spehora however, they are heavy and very high density</li>
            <li> Very hard... not like the original one</li>
            <li> I use liquid foundation and had a hard time finding the right sponge.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that they are kinda tough to clean.</li>
            <li> These are 10x better than the other bootleg Beauty Blenders I&#x27;ve gotten over the years.</li>
            <li> I use them wet to apply my MUFE HD foundation and dry to apply my Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder, and the result is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy these again after my final sponge gives out, but that should be a while considering these things last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender, and it is expensive considered it does not last that long.</li>
            <li> never used the original beauty blender so i can&#x27;t say in comparison, but i was tired of my foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Way to tough on your skin, spend the extra money and get a true Blender Ball</li>
            <li> The sponges last a long time if you take proper care of them.  </li>
            <li> My hands are small and it&#x27;s difficult to get a good grip on one to squeeze out the water and soap.  </li>
            <li> , i feel like it uses less product and its also very soft and applies everything so evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m squeezing it too much when I&#x27;m cleaning them, but I don&#x27;t think they should fall apart after two uses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not soft enough AND it eats up a lot of foundation.</li>
            <li> Why pay high price for name brand when you can get a no name brand from the same manufacturer that produces the name brand that works just as well if not better for a tenth of the price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure if you want to get the original blender because of the price (which I totally understand, twenty bucks for one sponge sounds excessive)</li>
            <li> so they last a long time!</li>
            <li> the material is the same no need to spend a ton of money on one expensive sponge when you can get 4 that are just at good for way less!!!</li>
            <li> They are not as soft as the beauty blender, or the 2.99 one I had previously purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had a beauty blender but had to throw it away when my daughter threw it in the toilet</li>
            <li> I think you just get used to something after a while, and after using the Bundle Monster sponge for a few weeks I went back and tried my old Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> The texture of the sponge was very dense yet firm when wet, but it did not expand in size.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d definitely give it 1 star because after trying out two of the four sponges, I decided it&#x27;s a complete waste of $10.</li>
            <li> once you wet them they actually expand and double in size .</li>
            <li> so it made my already mild acne problems worse.</li>
            <li> Dip these bad girls in water, squeeze the water out, and pat on your favorite foundation then blend!</li>
            <li> they are not very soft</li>
            <li> My friend spent 20 on a real beauty blender and I spent way less</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t do nothing to your makeup but give a dewy finiah because of the dampness and texture of the sponge, it&#x27;s hard..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard and don&#x27;t blend your foundation out at all, get the real techniques beauty sponge</li>
            <li> I just want to say though that when I got this the white sponge is all wrinkly and the blue one has this little yellow stain on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup fanatic and always ready to try the newest thing.</li>
            <li> Even when it is wet though, I find that I have to go over my make up several times before it blends the way I like it.</li>
            <li> When wet they work/feel similar to a beauty blender</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying this for so long I decided to get a BB when it was on sale</li>
            <li> but I guess I don&#x27;t care considering how long that have lasted me and</li>
            <li> They are well made so it may be a long time before I need to replace them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just wet them and blot out the extra water before adding foundation.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it took me so long to discover these blending puffs.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too thick and don&#x27;t spread your make up like the real ones</li>
            <li> I have some red spots to cover, so I actually like the slightly heavier coverage given by the Bundle Monster sponges.</li>
            <li> The act the same way any other makeup sponge would.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this for other makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the original version because it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> (I know long time coming for a review!)</li>
            <li> (wet of course) you can almost press it flat.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender, on the other hand, has pores and actually feels like a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I prefer to use it dry.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender does feel nicer on the skin even when dry.</li>
            <li> I do use them for applying dry powder.</li>
            <li> I use mine by wetting it then \\&quot;drying it\\&quot; in a dry wash cloth.</li>
            <li> This set is extremely small which causes a problem for those who are actually wanted to use this for professional applicators other than that the fabric</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this bundle, I purchased a single sponge from Amazon that was like 2.99</li>
            <li> every single time.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> You can apply liquid foundation or concealer with these wet or dry, and you can set your under-eye concealer or foundation with the tapered sponges dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them all the time because I like to switch between regular flat circular sponges, kabuki style brushes, and just plain fingers, depending on the type of foundation.</li>
            <li> And it took days for the sponge to dry!</li>
            <li> But this pack comes with 4 (2 of each different shapes) and for half the price?</li>
            <li> These sponges are quite different from your typical makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> Use them every single day!</li>
            <li> I love these little suckers!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s hard to wash the stains out, but overall.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these so badly</li>
            <li> and I have to get my sponge wet before blending in my make up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind them getting stained by the products I use, it&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> I have the pink beauty blender sponge, and I wanted to order another one because mine is getting beat up.</li>
            <li> I personally have never used the name brand (i forget what it is called) but do not feel like I am missing out.</li>
            <li> I wet it, ring it out</li>
            <li> Some people say to use it wet</li>
            <li> i like to get mine wet</li>
            <li> am including these next few words</li>
            <li> do once you wet them.</li>
            <li> but i expected to fall inlove.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, so I do tend to get some extra mileage out of my &amp;#34;beauty accessories&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I got them faster than expected.</li>
            <li> this is not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Just wet</li>
            <li> I wear make up everyday, so probably only two months.</li>
            <li> i tried it wet, wring it it out and then blotting on my foundation</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> You do have to get it wet</li>
            <li> There is almost no give to them when pressed against your face (again, when wet).</li>
            <li> so it is harder to apply the makeup with.</li>
            <li> Only con is they have to be washed quite often because they get stiff if the foundation dries in them.</li>
            <li> My only issue with these blenders is that they are quit stiff and they have to be washed and used a couple times.</li>
            <li> Once you get them wet, they expand and do not go back down!!</li>
            <li> It came out fine, but I suspect you&#x27;re not supposed to dry those bad boys like a pair of socks.</li>
            <li> You can easily clean them with some dish soap, olive oil, and cold water.  </li>
            <li> Definitely rinse them and squish them a lot under cold water first.</li>
            <li> Otherwise they can feel a bit harsh on the skin and not very soft.</li>
            <li> Buy these; you&#x27;ll be happier with yourself financially &amp; mentally!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They came small and once soaked under water got larger!</li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s not the exact thing like the beauty blender that is so expensive for&lt;br /&gt;one sponge</li>
            <li> These are nicer than the other blenders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other users, but mine are falling apart after two uses.  </li>
            <li> (But I will use the sponge &amp; try the same trick with my usual foundation &amp; finishing powder.)  </li>
            <li> The package doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, so you have to rely on either trial and error, or reviews from other users.</li>
            <li> I was not willing to spend over 12 bucks for one beauty blender, so after some research, I decided for this set</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The set that Bundle Monster is offering is identical to the quality of the other sponge I have seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried some other Beauty Blender dupes, but didn&#x27;t get the hype until I tried these.</li>
            <li> The only weird thing is it is very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical of the blending powers of these little things but HOLY COW!</li>
            <li> The pink and blue blenders are sort of hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> They are very small, I barely keep it in my hand.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have never used the Beauty Blender little pink egg things, so I can&#x27;t offer a comparison.  </li>
            <li> I get it a little wet and then apply my foundation...</li>
            <li> I usually use the little white wedges to apply my makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using a Real Techniques beauty blender, so I found the shape of these made blending makeup difficult.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money ..</li>
            <li> &quot; me being an average guy i decided to get her these.</li>
            <li> bought them for the hype theyve been getting, and honestly, not worth it.</li>
            <li> They plump up enormously when squeezed out under water, and apply color so delicately to the face.</li>
            <li> These are FIRM even when wet</li>
            <li> I will mention that you need to get it soaking wet, squeeze out all the excess water, then apply your make-up, something I found out after using it a few times and would have been helpful to know beforehand.</li>
            <li> You can usually find the one single beauty blender for $20.</li>
            <li> less expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For less than $2.50 each, it doesn&#x27;t hurt the wallet when they need to be replaced - based upon your usage amount and how well you care for them.  </li>
            <li> Why pay $20.00 for a Beauty blender when you get 4 beauty blenders for half the price?</li>
            <li> but non the less they get the work done</li>
            <li> These sponges aren&#x27;t terrible, but I find that the BB overall are better sponges.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I thought I&#x27;d found a cheaper version, as it&#x27;s difficult to justify (for me, anyway) paying $10+ for just a single makeup applicator, but these cheap sponges are no deal.</li>
            <li> Like all blenders, they soak up all your foundation so dampen them a little before use.</li>
            <li> I had upgraded from the triangle wedge sponges to a stippling brush, but wanted to see if these little sponges made a difference...</li>
            <li> When you are using sponges/puffs for things it takes a little while to get use to it................</li>
            <li> They seem a little bulky to me.</li>
            <li> The little sponges&lt;br /&gt;are</li>
            <li> I like the little box they come in.</li>
            <li> And my foundation always looks a little blotchy when I use them.  </li>
            <li> And when i rinsed it out, the little product that got on it ALL came out during washing.</li>
            <li> They could be a little softer to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Cant</li>
            <li> I was looking for a make up brush and came across these little foundation blenders.</li>
            <li> and it was really hard and didn&#x27;t expand when u wet it</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> It is a bit firm</li>
            <li> found these to be too bulky and much to firm.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> BUT i get too impatient doing all that dabbing.</li>
            <li> The blenders are so firm even when it&#x27;s damp</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine everyday since receiving it</li>
            <li> I just received this package of sponges a few days ago and have used them a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> density of this sponge means it will absorb and waste product&lt;br</li>
            <li> Four sponges for less than the price of one beauty blender is a bargain!</li>
            <li> It is so stiff after soaking and squeezing in water, IT DOESNT EVEN WORK.</li>
            <li> Maybe they react differently to plain water...?)</li>
            <li> If you like stiff sponges, these may work for you.</li>
            <li> Not worth a cent!!</li>
            <li> The sponges are a little hard</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little hard but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Very hard feel to them even when you wet them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re firm but they don&#x27;t get hard, and they blend well and don&#x27;t soak up makeup.</li>
            <li> and they work just as well if not better than the Beautyblender for the fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the shapes are varied.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, even if you&#x27;re a starter!</li>
            <li> Recommend this not sure.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Got a box of these instead of my usual order of the beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why I&#x27;d need four.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just lazy.</li>
            <li> when I use brushes it usually leaves streaks or gives my face a &amp;#34;Cakes-on&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Not really sure how to use these</li>
            <li> if not more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let their small size scare you ,</li>
            <li> At first i was disappointed because these sponges aren&#x27;t as squishy as the Beauty Blender but after using it</li>
            <li> shes tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The other 2 were tough and felt like I was punching myself in face repeatedly.</li>
            <li> the sponges were harder than i expected, not comparable to the beauty blender from sephora, sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these sponges are all the rage lately?</li>
            <li> The sponges were too hard.  </li>
            <li> it came in a hard box bundle pack.</li>
            <li> they are hard and i can not use them.</li>
            <li> Then you use it and it wont be so hard.</li>
            <li> My review is that the sponge is to hard for the face it could be softer so the foundation or concealer is blender easier an not spotted</li>
            <li> Hard to hold doesn&#x27;t apply well with liquid foundation</li>
            <li> so when the sponge touches the face, you can feel how hard it is.</li>
            <li> I tried something else when these were used up and the sponge was so hard.</li>
            <li> These are HARD.</li>
            <li> These sponges are so hard and dense that using them feels like I&#x27;m punching myself in the face rather than bouncing.</li>
            <li> They feel so hard like a rock on ur face</li>
            <li> they are kinda like hard sponges</li>
            <li> (decided I need to revamp my enitre technique at 40ish) and he suggested these, or at least this style.</li>
            <li> firmness also makes it difficult to really get into awkward areas of the face, like around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worked like the expensive one foamed alittle when i wet it</li>
            <li> I bought these sponges because I really hate paying the ridiculously high price for the official beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to the very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the very expensive sponge called the BeautyBlender, except with this you get 2 different shapes and 4 sponges.</li>
            <li> After trying mine she was upset for having paid a ridiculous amount of money for a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> This 4 pack of the Bundle Monster is much less expensive ...</li>
            <li> is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was looking to purchase another one and my friend recommended these as a less expensive alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are no good</li>
            <li> some of these on Amazon are dinky and no good.</li>
            <li> They are very hard not spongy</li>
            <li> very hard.</li>
            <li> They are very hard even after soaking in water and they absorb all your makeup</li>
            <li> Very hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not as into these little monsters as I&#x27;d hoped too awkward</li>
            <li> It is hard and uncomfortable to apply make up...</li>
            <li> Just because its expensive doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the best/top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> away, that is NOT a good look!</li>
            <li> Defnitely not impressed with this.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> I was unable to get the foundation out of it, despite repeated washings.</li>
            <li> These sponges are just like the expensive brand version.</li>
            <li> it is a fake beauty makeup blender.</li>
            <li> get this if you want to achieve the same look as the beauty blender and don&#x27;t want to spend the outrageous price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> , I was not impressed though.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG.</li>
            <li> I like to put foundation on my face, just randomly tap it on in random places with my hands and then go over it with the sponge to blend.</li>
            <li> Tried them a few times and they are just horrible!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These however, were a disappointment.</li>
            <li> They work just like my EXPENSIVE beauty blender!</li>
            <li> and thought I was mad at him!&lt;br</li>
            <li> their very expensive</li>
            <li> It takes all the fundation, very difficult to put it on the face.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this, cuz i was like, why blow 9 bucks on a piece of foam.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They weren&#x27;t all bad.</li>
            <li> bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> The Bundle Monster sponges aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> The quality is so bad</li>
            <li> Promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> but I hate them.  </li>
            <li> I bought from another seller and they were worthless.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be stupid, just buy this beauty!</li>
            <li> That is outrageous.</li>

            <li> The act the same way any other makeup sponge would.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the reviews complaining that these sponges aren&#x27;t squishy or soft enough. They&#x27;re plenty soft, especially once put under water.</li>
            <li> does its job.. well done.. blends like heaven.. every make up lover needs this in their kit. a must have</li>
            <li> I think this product works just as like the more well-known brands at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> These work as well as the Beauty Blender at a much better price. I like the different shapes in this set, it&#x27;s a good way to find out which one works best for which purpose.</li>
            <li> Love them better than the over priced single beauty blender sponges. Here you get 4 and they work just as well if not better than the Beautyblender for the fraction of the price. Heck, you can purchase 3 packages of these and still come out a head. $ 4 per sponge when you buy a four pack. I have seen the Beautyblender sponges go as high as $50 just for one. That is outrageous. Why pay high price for name brand when you can get a no name brand from the same manufacturer that produces the name brand that works just as well if not better for a tenth of the price. To each his or her own I suppose.</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t do nothing to your makeup but give a dewy finiah because of the dampness and texture of the sponge, it&#x27;s hard..maybe I need to invest in the actual beauty blender instead of buying these crappy things.</li>
            <li> the sponges were harder than i expected, not comparable to the beauty blender from sephora, sorry!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people just go for the original brand if all the sponges are the same texture their very expensive so I decided to buy this four bundle pack because I want my sponges to last and try it out it works very good, you just have to wash it first or submerse it in the water and squeeze the water out then use it, the water keeps the liquid foundation or concealer from sucking into the sponge:)</li>
            <li> I bought because I kept seeing it in youtube videos but didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 on one sponge when I saw this thought it was a great deal!! Worked great and was an easy way to contour my face!</li>
            <li> I love these beauty blenders! they make foundation apply very smooth. Only con is they have to be washed quite often because they get stiff if the foundation dries in them.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says it does and I am happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s not like the original beauty blender but does the job. I would order again.</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints about the quality of the product.  I&#x27;m used to using a Real Techniques beauty blender, so I found the shape of these made blending makeup difficult.  If you&#x27;re used to using the shapes of these blenders, you&#x27;ll be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of sponges I have one of the more expensive ones but I really did not want to spend that kind of money these are very very comparable they puff up well when adding water and the material is the same no need to spend a ton of money on one expensive sponge when you can get 4 that are just at good for way less!!!</li>
            <li> These came so quick and they&#x27;re absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the sponges, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;ve ordered this bundle monster 4pc twice now. Although both times i&#x27;ve ordered it the teardrop sponge would tear when i wash them.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Get the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Great texture and you get so many for so little. Like all blenders, they soak up all your foundation so dampen them a little before use.</li>
            <li> Love them, they work great.</li>
            <li> They are very hard not spongy</li>
            <li> . I use to put my concealer and primer on with my hands and a brush. These are wonderful. Easy to clean. Do take some time to dry but a little wetness actually helps smooth your makeup on. They give me an even, smooth look.</li>
            <li> The sponges are a little hard and I have to get my sponge wet before blending in my make up.  Even when it is wet though, I find that I have to go over my make up several times before it blends the way I like it.</li>
            <li> perfect for foundation application. Love them!</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying my makeup</li>
            <li> love them they work wonderful</li>
            <li> These blenders are better than the popular beauty blenders</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing beauty blenders. While I think these are great quality and not cheaply made, I would have liked to see instructions on how to use them within the package. The colors are bright, they are easy to hold. They apply my foundation easily, but upon their first use they seem to absorb quite a bit of my foundation. They allow you to apply foundation easily, without lines and it&#x27;s easy to blend foundation and concealer as well.</li>
            <li> These are the best monsters ever. The colors aren&#x27;t the best, I&#x27;d rather want darker creatures, but hey, at this price it&#x27;s good. For some reason my wife keeps telling me these aren&#x27;t monster toys but I think she is just jealous.</li>
            <li> Great blenders, just wished I didn&#x27;t use them all already. Anyone know how to clean them?</li>
            <li> Love these they work well.</li>
            <li> Packaged beautifully, I immediately rinsed them out in water. After 4 gentle squeezes under a running tap, the sponges doubled in size and became softer. They aren&#x27;t exactly like the beauty blender, but they are a good substitute for the price. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is they do get stained from foundation after a while, but that doesn&#x27;t impact the performance.</li>
            <li> Great price for the bundle. Works great with my skin.</li>
            <li> Love these ! Great and soft beauty blenders God half the price at sephora</li>
            <li> Awesome, soo good quality and so cheap!!! Dont buy the real beauty blender because this are so much better</li>
            <li> Love the colors and sizes. They work very well blending my foundation. I like uniques products and that is what attracted me to these sponges.</li>
            <li> I use liquid foundation and had a hard time finding the right sponge.  These blenders far exceed my expectations.  They are of high quality and easy to rinse out makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it! It blends my foundation really good !</li>
            <li> I love these little suckers!!! Foundation went on perfectly.</li>
            <li> I really love it ..thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim since I had heard so much about the original beauty blender. I didn&#x27;t have the money to shell out on the original one so I bought this one to try and see. I had upgraded from the triangle wedge sponges to a stippling brush, but wanted to see if these little sponges made a difference... I love them, regardless of them being dupes! They leave both my BB cream and creme foundation flawless unlike my stippling brush that left it feeling heavy on my face. I don&#x27;t mind them getting stained by the products I use, it&#x27;s expected. I thought they&#x27;d soak up product but they don&#x27;t since I let them run under the water and then squeeze and blot with a towel to take out the excess water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick around with these &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Much better than expected. These are FIRM even when wet but they&#x27;re about the same as using my fingers with great control and way less mess. Excellent value, and then package is cute. This would be a nice stocking stuffer or small gift.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as good as the original beauty blender, but worth it since it&#x27;s so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more , works just as good as the name brand</li>
            <li> Way to tough on your skin, spend the extra money and get a true Blender Ball</li>
            <li> I love the application it gives me, and it feels great on my skin, plus it comes with fun colors</li>
            <li> They are just perfect, they are very small. But after washing then they do expand. They work perfectly. And apply foundation very well. I will be getting another set very soon.</li>
            <li> I have the pink beauty blender sponge, and I wanted to order another one because mine is getting beat up. I saw this bundle and thought &amp;#34;What a great price!&amp;#34; BUT now Im sad that i wasted my money on these! They are WAY to firm /dense and large. The real BB is soft and very easy to use on your face... these are not! Not I have to order a new BB and throw these ones away!</li>
            <li> This is a fun product, the colors are happy colors and you can take one color for blush, another for foundation, etc.  Its a good thing and they are washable, that&#x27;s a good thing.  Wrapped well and I would certainly buy from this seller again.  When you are using sponges/puffs for things it takes a little while to get use to it................enjoy</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even tell that this was a knockoff !!! Of course it&#x27;s a tad smaller but the way it makes my foundation get that airbrushed finish is amaze balls lol</li>
            <li> cant compare to the beauty blender but it comes really really close</li>
            <li> These make-up sponges have a good shape, but they smelled vaguely musty or moldy. Really didn&#x27;t want to put them on my face after smelling that.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive hour glasses shaped ones just teardrop</li>
            <li> These sponges are amazing.  I love how they feel on my skin.  They are nice and soft. I personally have never used the name brand (i forget what it is called) but do not feel like I am missing out.</li>
            <li> Great blenders, great price. I purchased a beauty blender from sephora for $20 and loved it so much but didnt want to pay another 20 bucks. I ordered these and they work just as great and I got a set of four. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> The sponges were too hard.  Didn&#x27;t care for them at all.  The colors are pretty, though.</li>
            <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;easy to use</li>
            <li> never used the original beauty blender so i can&#x27;t say in comparison, but i was tired of my foundation brush. the sponges are great for coverage, sheer to heavy, everything looks even and i&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my complexion since using it. since i got four, i gave one to a friend and she loves it, too.&lt;br /&gt;just make sure you know how to use it properly (ie: running it under water first to make it expand, cleaning it properly after using it)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these sponges are all the rage lately? They seem a little bulky to me. But, they do work...</li>
            <li> Better than ones they sell at beauty stores. Cheap and good.</li>
            <li> They work well, and of good quality, I would definitely recommend over the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> great feel and options</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s what you promise to get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li> Love them! Blend my makeup wonderfully. I use them on myself and clients. Just as good as the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> What can I say. I have the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; BeautyBlender and this, to me, works just as well. I&#x27;ve been a professional makeup artist for 10 years and wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without these in my kit.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and would recommend to all my friends. it came in a hard box bundle pack. Very good quality. Ordinary beauty blenders can go upto $32.00 but this is affordable and good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in LOVE with these sponges!!! They&#x27;re amazing, I&#x27;ve never used the Beauty Blender but I don&#x27;t even see the need to now! These work GREAT and they apply flawless make-up on my face! Foundation brushes and wedges can&#x27;t even compare, I would DEFINITELY recommend! Awesome price for 4!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are ok.... Just not as soft as the original ... But not garbage for the price point. Maybe over time they will get softer.</li>
            <li> Very hard... not like the original one</li>
            <li> these are nothing like the Blender Balls.  they are hard and i can not use them. dont waste your money</li>
            <li> The four pack was awesome to get and share with another friend (because you get two of the same style).  It&#x27;s not a dupe to the Beauty Blender but will expand a lot in water and does make applying foundation fun and easy.</li>
            <li> There are some of these on the market for so much more than this 4 pack and it&#x27;s so unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fantastic and blend beautifully!</li>
            <li> Being a frugal fashionista and mom to an ever browning child, I could not bring myself to buy the more expensive version this product. I am very happy with results I get from using this blender. I wet it, ring it out and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> Good product for applying foundation. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. It showed up way before the delivery date. And so far they have worked out really well. I even gave two of them to my friend and she likes them a lot! I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I love these little baby&#x27;s! Use them every single day!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. When I run out I will be placing another order. They work so well and don&#x27;t leave creases on your face.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet, but it looks good. I like the shapes of the puff, hope they will work well</li>
            <li> I bought these and to me something&#x27;s are better to just go out &amp; buy Instead of waiting a long time,</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I just got 4 beauty blenders for the price of 1! I don&#x27;t care how you look at it! They work just like my EXPENSIVE beauty blender! I wish I would purchase another $25 on a sponge - Hell No! Buy these; you&#x27;ll be happier with yourself financially &amp; mentally!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $20+ dollars on one beautyblender.&lt;br /&gt;They work well when I wet them, only slightly more dense than the beautyblender, so I would definitely repurchase this item int he future.</li>
            <li> The Bundle Monster is okey but does help much...it does Blender my Foundation&lt;br /&gt;Well...or help much with my cover. ?</li>
            <li> They are very small, I barely keep it in my hand. It takes all the fundation, very difficult to put it on the face.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of these reviews and I don&#x27;t think people are wetting this product before use. You have to put it under water, I use warm for a minute and let it soak it up and ring it out. Then you use it and it wont be so hard.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for a budding young make-up artist. Evidently the various puffs make for perfect make-up blending.</li>
            <li> Amazing item!!! Great for concealer and foundation, also at a very great price. Totally recommend this for other makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Good product especially for the price</li>
            <li> I use these with theater makeup which can be really thick and it blends it nicely. These are nice and soft, and they&#x27;re easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not as into these little monsters as I&#x27;d hoped too awkward BUT if YOU ARE the quality is defiantly there.</li>
            <li> I will buy these can&#x27;t live without the blender if I can&#x27;t find these just go with a other one but a good one they all are not that great And don&#x27;t go to cheap they are no good</li>
            <li> The brand name beauty blender seems to be on the pricey side, so I was stoked to find a pack of 4 makeup blenders for only $10!  They qualified for Prime shipping so I thought them so fast!  I surfed the internet on how best to use this, and I think personally wetting it under warm water and squeezing out excess water is the best method.  It expands and feels so super soft.  It doesn&#x27;t soak up my foundation, and it blends my liquid foundation evenly.  I will definitely be purchasing more of this product, but probably won&#x27;t need to do so for a few months, as these products are supposed to last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many sponges and have to say that this is the best so far!  I refuse to pay the high price for the beauty blender and love the feel of theses sponges.</li>
            <li> These sponges are a good deal for the price. It is recommended to wash them with warm water and gentle soap before first use; and before every use, wet with warm water and gently squeeze the excess water with a clean towel. I have an older towel set aside for this, as it will eventually get foundation stains from the sponge. Then I put some foundation on my hand and dab it on with the moistened sponge. When used correctly, these sponges apply foundation gently and evenly. I wash mine with soap every other day and let it air dry on a clean soap dish.</li>
            <li> Took a while to receive but the product itself just seems too cheap. The foundation gets obsorved way to much and it&#x27;s a waist of product</li>
            <li> Good quality, I brought this in Amazon for 2 stores. It&#x27;so much different than the 5 dollar one. 1. No smell 2. easy resolve water 3. I broke the 5 dollars one up, inside is different. Good quality. Although it&#x27;s kind of expensive. But. Much better!!!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t complain.I like these sponges, they are easy to use ,the price is right for the quantity and quality- Thanks</li>
            <li> these beauty blenders are really amazing,  my foundation look more natural after applying it with them , I think it gives the same result of +20$  blenders .</li>
            <li> These are a really good price for what you get and, as others mentioned, the sponges are on the firmer side.  The downside is that, even when moistened, they absorb quite a bit of foundation.  They do blend it very nicely, but there is wasted product.</li>
            <li> so far so good, I feel like I use a lot of my foundation with these sponges. I&#x27;ve never tried the real beauty blender, but when I do, I will update this review. They were cheap, so for the money, I think it&#x27;s worth it, especially for 4 of them. Plus, it makes it easier for me to give one to my daughter who likes to pretend she&#x27;s putting on makeup too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the teardrop shaped one so far and it is definitely better than those old triangle sponges.  It is a bit firm but I like it.</li>
            <li> I was trying to be thrifty and avoid spending money on name brand Beauty Blenders. I should have bought the real thing. But, even the sponge wedges you can buy at the drugstore are better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these to be too bulky and much to firm. I&#x27;d heard people describe using these as being like \\&quot;punching yourself in the face\\&quot;. I thought my experience would be different. Surely these people were using them with too much force! Nope. I tried to gently stipple my foundation on my face and it really did feel like being punched in the face! Not by Mike Tyson or anything, but more like being punched by a really strong baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They weren&#x27;t all bad. They did apply my foundation quite nicely, which is why I gave them two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But truly, if you aren&#x27;t hung up on brand names, you can just buy the makeup sponge wedges from the drugstore for a couple dollars and get the same results. And you get a lot more of those suckers!</li>
            <li> I purchased these after hearing all the hype about the beauty blender and thought I&#x27;d try the dupe first. Application of makeup was fine, nothing great, but what really bothered me was cleaning. The makeup wouldn&#x27;t wash out no matter what method I tried and then I could see the material starting to wear when cleaning. Defnitely not impressed with this. I went out and purchased the BB for comparison and definitely believe this is one knock off that doesn&#x27;t even come close to the original.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these makeup sponges! I usually use the little white wedges to apply my makeup so I tried these and what a difference! Using these gives a smooth finish and it helps your makeup not cake up. I washed mine in warm soapy water and let it dry, and good as new. Some people say to use it wet so I tried both ways and I prefer to use it dry. Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I had a beauty blender but had to throw it away when my daughter threw it in the toilet and so I needed something fast. Honestly, you cannot beat this deal. For the people who say this product is too rough, you will need to dampen the sponge first before using it. I would definitely recommend this to someone on a budget.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  A simple small sponge works better and uses less makeup.</li>
            <li> Great price. Love how it makes my foundation application look flawless! I am not sure why the shapes are varied. Maybe there is a reason, maybe not. I use them all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t splurged on an actual Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t say whether or not these compare, but these are AWESOME. They apply foundation/concealer like a charm and leave a beautiful airbrushed finish. And for the price, they&#x27;re definitely worth a shot. Make sure you wet them first in order to get optimal use.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! They&#x27;re hard and don&#x27;t blend your foundation out at all, get the real techniques beauty sponge it&#x27;s cheaper than the beauty blender and works just about the same as it! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, even if you&#x27;re a starter!</li>
            <li> I just received them and I like them, very very much. Good price for what you received.&lt;br /&gt;Latex Free, nice colours and shape. Very pleased with my purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Melissa</li>
            <li> This is the perfect dupe for the beauty blender. And WAY cheaper. They do need to be washed more often than my beauty blender sponge, but thats not really an issue. They hold up well.</li>
            <li> These get the job done. They have a very, very plasticy feel to them, as opposed to a soft spongey feel. They&#x27;re kind of annoying to clean, but they do expand when wet and work pretty well at applying liquid foundation when wet. I&#x27;ll use these until I have to throw them out, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> i have only used one from the box..and it works perfect....i have used it a handful of times and works great each time!</li>
            <li> I love this beauty blender. I&#x27;ve never tried the more expensive blenders so I don&#x27;t know in comparison, but these cheaper blender works great to me! I would but these again!</li>
            <li> The puff are cute and soft, but makeup brushes are still the better buy.  Just could not get into using this, there was no instructions as how to use it nor what shape is for what.  My grandkids like the feel and softness so guess what, they are like toys to them.  Recommend this not sure.</li>
            <li> This is nothing like the beauty blender. It is so stiff after soaking and squeezing in water, IT DOESNT EVEN WORK. Save your money and buy the beauty blender instead.</li>
            <li> The product was good for the price.</li>
            <li> I love makeup blenders.  I think they are about the best thing since sliced bread.  For the price, these are awesome.  I&#x27;ve see virtually no difference in the these versus some of the spendy ones.</li>
            <li> Love them. Works great. Make sure you run them under the sink so they&#x27;re completely wet before you apply. Replace them pretty frequently otherwise they start to smell a bit mildew-y. Can&#x27;t beat this price!! Exactly like beauty blenders without the name.</li>
            <li> If you really want to experience flawless gorgeous make-up, try the original beauty blender. These are dense and do not work like the beauty blender do!  I bought these and a week later I got the beauty blender when it went on sale, I am glad I did!t</li>
            <li> These are perfect and just what I needed! The different shapes really help with applying foundation/concealer. I definitely suggest getting this set as opposed to spending 5 dollars on one makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> Once you try these beauty blenders you will not go back to the old way of applying makeup. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because cleaning darker foundation out of these takes patience, and I ripped one while trying to do so the first time. Other than that this product is AMAZING</li>
            <li> I was going to buy one blender for $9 until I saw this set.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving three away to my sisters because I only needed one.&lt;br /&gt;They came small and once soaked under water got larger! These work great!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well, my daughters were chomping at the bit for a Beauty Blender but I was not going to pay that amount of money for foam to distribute foundation. I researched my local store and on-line and found this pack of blenders.&lt;br /&gt;We have found them to be of good, sound quality and work as well as the original Beauty Blender they are imitating. They do not soak up your foundation, instead they effortlessly blend it on your skin giving you a nice, even look.  Blend along your jaw line to ensure no lines and you have a beautiful look.&lt;br /&gt;If you too do not want to pay a high price to blend your foundation, please give these a try!</li>
            <li> i like the sponges. i havent used the actual Beauty Blend so i cant comment on the difference between the two. I like the way the makeup comes out BUT i get too impatient doing all that dabbing. Also, i think i use more makeup because some gets absorbed in the sponge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the actual Beauty Blender to compare it to so I&#x27;m not sure how great it is.  It seems to do the job :)  I would recommend purchasing it for the cost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these at all. Not near as soft as a the real techniques version or the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> 2nd order they are jacked after about a month of hardcore use as a makeup artist with all the cleaning and sanitation... but well worth the buy compared to a name brand  bender</li>
            <li> Waste of money! My &amp;#34;Beauty blender&amp;#34; that I have now is from Avon and it works pretty well, it&#x27;s just starting to fall apart. So I thought I&#x27;d try these out since you get four. Tried them a few times and they are just horrible! The blenders are so firm even when it&#x27;s damp and it just soaks up your make up. I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I don&#x27;t regret buying. My only issue with these blenders is that they are quit stiff and they have to be washed and used a couple times. Then they softens and works very nice from regular use. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Got a box of these instead of my usual order of the beauty blender.  REALLY like them, which was surprising for me as I have bought other brands at places like Target and they really suck, so I was constantly buying beauty blenders.  This is for sure a great option, and I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Blending never been eariser !!</li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s not the exact thing like the beauty blender that is so expensive for&lt;br /&gt;one sponge but it honestly does the same thing. I love the pack and one of them&lt;br /&gt;everyday! When I go through all of them I will repurchase!</li>
            <li> My review is that the sponge is to hard for the face it could be softer so the foundation or concealer is blender easier an not spotted</li>
            <li> But the sponge keeps a lot of your makeup, so you will need to clean regularly.&lt;br /&gt;but shape is ok and spinges are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love these!!! I love that they come in different shapes and also that they are almost exact to the original beauty blender. My friend spent 20 on a real beauty blender and I spent way less and when she tested out one of mine she says that they felt/performed the exact same way! After trying mine she was upset for having paid a ridiculous amount of money for a makeup sponge. Not four makeup sponges like these but 20 for A makeup sponge! Definitely going to order these again when I run out. Plus I bought a anti bacterial cleansing soap made for cleaning brushes and sponges and it when I use it on these it makes the sponges last sooo much longer than your traditional beauty blender.</li>
            <li> the product was really nice and i got it on time there was no problem with anything overall PERFECT and GREAT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal to me ..the shapes doesn&#x27;t really matter when applying around the eye area but it&#x27;s just alight</li>
            <li> I had to return this item because it was nothing like the beauty blender. It didn&#x27;t even feel like a real sponge. Was more like rubber.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Don&#x27;t forget to wet it :)</li>
            <li> Love these sponges work very good</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive beauty blender that I have.</li>
            <li> First time using a product like this and i really love it, i feel like it uses less product and its also very soft and applies everything so evenly. really great product!</li>
            <li> I love these! Puts my makeup on great! I run it under water squeeze out and start applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> amazing. I love that this is expensive and works great. I soak this beauty blender with water and then squeeze out all the water. This product does expand once water has been absorbed into it. I use it with my cream and liquid foundation/concealer and it gives great result. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these so badly but I hate them.  It is hard and uncomfortable to apply make up... will just use my brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the beauty blender is, but I hear this is a great knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are relatively dense, don&#x27;t seem to fall apart after use, and are easy to use and clean. Excellent value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really need four sponges; they all seem to work the same to me, so I stored three to use after I throw the first out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer noted, these should be thoroughly washed before use - just in case. They do suds a lot the first time you get them wet.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  I regret this purchase.  I thought they would be cute, but they smelled bad and didn&#x27;t work any better than regular sponges, but did cost more.I also broke out when using them, I think maybe the added color, but I don&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
            <li> i like the feel havent tried them but so far so good :)</li>
            <li> Not as great as the beautyblender probably is but it does the trick. A good starter sponge for anyone looking to try out new ways to do makeup.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Beauty Blender and really liked the flawless finish that I got with it, but needed a new one and didn&#x27;t want to spend the $$$ on another one. So I went looking for a dupe. This 4 pack of the Bundle Monster is much less expensive ... 4 for $10 ($2.50 each) instead of $20 for a Beauty Blender. There are pros and cons, but overall, I like the finish just as much as the Beauty Blender, and think it&#x27;s worth it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Creates a nice flawless finish&lt;br /&gt;(2) more durable, lasts longer&lt;br /&gt;(3) less expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;(1) not as soft, so feels firmer/more pressure on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the Bundle Monster sponges are firmer, I am actually ok with that. I like the pointy tip on the Bundle Monster sponges better for contouring around my eyes and nose, and once I got used to the firmer density I forgot about it. I think you just get used to something after a while, and after using the Bundle Monster sponge for a few weeks I went back and tried my old Beauty Blender and it almost felt too squishy/flimsy. I think the finish created by both are very close to the same, with the Bundle Monster giving slightly more coverage, whereas the Beauty Blender applied a little bit more sheer. I have some red spots to cover, so I actually like the slightly heavier coverage given by the Bundle Monster sponges. Still looks airbrushed and soft. And the Bundle Monster sponges are definitely more durable, as I have been using mine everyday for several weeks and they still look almost new. So that&#x27;s good. And the price can&#x27;t be beat. I bought a backup pack of 4 with free shipping from amazon, and I think I am officially set now for pretty much...... ever. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you don&#x27;t mind a firmer sponge, these work really well and will last a long time. Maybe give yourself 2 weeks to get used to the increased firmness, and I think you&#x27;ll like them. I do. And I don&#x27;t foresee myself ever spending $20 on one sponge ever again.You live and you learn. :)</li>
            <li> The little sponges&lt;br /&gt;are great!&lt;br /&gt;My foundation is now perfect on my face&lt;br /&gt;when i spread it with these.&lt;br /&gt;Its really flawless!</li>
            <li> I could have just used one. Not sure why I&#x27;d need four. But I lost one on vacation, so I guess it was nice to have three back ups at home. They are cheaper than the original beautify sponge, so that&#x27;s nice. They apply makeup well. I haven&#x27;t used the original version because it&#x27;s so expensive so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s better or not. These work great though! And they&#x27;re easy to to clean too.</li>
            <li> great price and product</li>
            <li> Great for quality professional makeup application. Affordable price comparable to professional discounted wholesalers.</li>
            <li> The sponges are so firm that it takes a lot of effort to clean one.  My hands are small and it&#x27;s difficult to get a good grip on one to squeeze out the water and soap.  Very unsatisfied with these, I&#x27;m going back to the Beauty Blender pink sponge!</li>
            <li> great sponges. i realize they arent the real thing but they work great! i like to get mine wet alittle and than apply make-up. blends great!</li>
            <li> My sister is currently really big into makeup and hair stuff. I saw these and thought she would love them. Sure enough, when she opened them Christmas morning, she loved them and used them right away. They make her makeup look completely natural and flawless. I will definitely get these for her again!</li>
            <li> Love love these, you can rinse/clean these sponges and reuse</li>
            <li> These are not like the beauty blender, but man do these little sponges do the job right! I really love the pink on, particularly, I have used it to death, I need to buy more of these. And for the price... are you kidding? Why aren&#x27;t you getting this right now?</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by how well I like these sponges. They are much squishier than a beauty blender I think, but I liked that about them. Definitely rinse them and squish them a lot under cold water first. Some suds came out of mine when I rinsed them. At least I know they&#x27;re cleaned at the factory lol! They puff up quite nice in water. The technique for these is to wet them first and get as much water out as you can. They need to be damp (but not wet) so they won&#x27;t absorb so much of your product as you apply it to your face. I used these with the Coastal Scents Camouflage Palette which I purchased at the same time from Amazon. I liked how these worked with the creams in the palette. I used one spinge to apply my foundation too, and it worked well. I think I would buy these again for the price. They also came packaged really nicely. I like the little box they come in. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works so well and the price is so great! I&#x27;ve never owned a beauty blender but I wanted to try this one out and it gives me that smooth, even application. I just don&#x27;t like when it gets stained after using it with foundation. The stain comes off of course when you clean it. I guess I&#x27;m just lazy.</li>
            <li> These are nicer than the other blenders I&#x27;ve tried. They&#x27;re firm but they don&#x27;t get hard, and they blend well and don&#x27;t soak up makeup. These are the nice bigger size...some of these on Amazon are dinky and no good.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges!  I&#x27;ve never used the Beauty Blender so I can&#x27;t say how they compare to the original - that being said they definitely need a few days of use before they soften up completely, which may be why there are some complaints of stiffness.  I&#x27;ve used mine everyday since receiving it and I can say my foundation and concealer have never looked better.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great at perfecting my make-up giving me a airbrush finish.  I thought they would be just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> These work really well&lt;br /&gt;This product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I am including these next few words becasue Amazon requires it. That needs to be changed.</li>
            <li> I Love these sponges and even more because of the price. Makeup comes out flawless no complaints. Super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> blends makeup perfect. when I use brushes it usually leaves streaks or gives my face a &amp;#34;Cakes-on&amp;#34; look. These however, blends smoothly and makes it look so much more natural even with full coverage.</li>
            <li> these are very good quality; am very happy with them so far. they clean very well with some brush cleaner, gets is all like like brand new. would recommend</li>
            <li> I luv luv luv this beauty blender bundle. The blenders are soft, apply make-up flawlessly and is super easy to clean. I give one to my friend and she liked it so much she got rid of her brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product and really helps your foundation go on smoother with better coverage! I&#x27;d buy these for all of my friends and family! I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it .. It&#x27;s not worth the money .. Nothing to be compared to the original beauty blender</li>
            <li> I wanted to get my girlfriend a gift, i always heard her say she wanted \\&quot;A Beauty Blender\\&quot; me being an average guy i decided to get her these. I don&#x27;t know much about makeup but from what she tells me these aren&#x27;t the highest brand, but she simply loves them. What helped me decide on buying these was thanks to a blog post on these blenders at [...]. The review is simply straight to the point.</li>
            <li> I really like these blender brushes. They have several curved edges for different areas for your face (corner of your eyes, around nose area, etc..). I will mention that you need to get it soaking wet, squeeze out all the excess water, then apply your make-up, something I found out after using it a few times and would have been helpful to know beforehand. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are super dense and perfectly for applying foundation and concealer. Definitely comparable to the very expensive ones. Caution, though- I bought from another seller and they were worthless. This product by this seller is absolute gold! I actually bought a pack for a friend, too!</li>
            <li> This performs Just like the ones that cost $20 what more can you ask for? I use them in my kit and will repurchase them for my clients. They work better for powders and liquids than creams.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal!!!</li>
            <li> Not really sure how to use these but so far so good with applying my liquid foundation. Just takes time</li>
            <li> These are just like the one I bought at sephora for 20 bucks a piece. Love them. Will be ordering again whenever I need them.</li>
            <li> I like them. The package was so nice. They came in different shapes.</li>
            <li> No complaints! Just like the real BB. Same size, texture, etc. I&#x27;ve been using one for months and it&#x27;s holding up well with proper maintenance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other users, but mine are falling apart after two uses.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m squeezing it too much when I&#x27;m cleaning them, but I don&#x27;t think they should fall apart after two uses.  So no, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to order them again.  What first attracted me to this one was the price, but it is not worth it if I&#x27;m only getting two uses out of it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it came really fast. The sponges are very good quality in my opinion, I don&#x27;t own the original high end beauty blender so I can&#x27;t really compare the two but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper sponge that looks like the beauty blender and does a fantastic job, then this is definitely for you. I had bought one from Claire&#x27;s a while back and it was really hard and didn&#x27;t expand when u wet it so I was pretty disappointed in that product, but this sponge from bundle monster really is amazing , it is sterdy, soft, expands when wet, cleans easily, applies my makeup flawlessly, and and amazing price overall,it also was just like the one in the picture displayed before you purchase them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very ,very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> My makeup routine has forever changed with these sponges, they make my foundation look flawless. I will definitely buy these again after my final sponge gives out, but that should be a while considering these things last a long time. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; sponge (which came with no directions!) &amp; I may not have used it correctly, but I LOVED the results. I still prefer a Stippling Brush for applying creme foundation to get a sheer, natural look. I bought these blender sponges precisely because I&#x27;ve avoided liquid foundation for years but I&#x27;d finally bought one &amp; wanted to try it out. Lots of chicks rave about them looking so &#x27;natural&#x27;, but when I can see the foundation on your skin from 3 ft. away, that is NOT a good look! I&#x27;ve been reading about how &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; give you a sheer, airbrushed look with a liquid foundation, so I bought these since they were offered at such a good price. ($11.00 for 4 --- the brand name blenders sell for $20 a pop!) Having nothing to compare them to, I must say that the sponge I used didn&#x27;t really swell up the way everyone says &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; do once you wet them. (FYI, I used Bulgarian rosewater to wet my sponge, since it&#x27;s good for your skin anyway. Maybe they react differently to plain water...?) The texture of the sponge was very dense yet firm when wet, but it did not expand in size. (From what I&#x27;ve read, &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; get big when you wet them &amp; become very soft.) I squeezed out the excess liquid, put a drop of foundation (Joelle Organic Liquid Foundation) on the back of my hand, then dabbed the sponge into it &amp; stippled it onto my face. (No swiping, no wiping.) After finishing my foundation, I dipped my finger into some colorless finishing powder (Stacey Frasca Studio 28 Hi-Def Powder), mixed it with the foundation left on the back of my hand, dabbed the sponge into the mixture &amp; stippled some more to get full-coverage over a few dark spots/freckles I have below my eyes. That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve with my creme foundation &amp; stippling brush. (But I will use the sponge &amp; try the same trick with my usual foundation &amp; finishing powder.)  These may be knock-offs, but I&#x27;M LOVIN&#x27; THESE SPONGES, esp. for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue (not a complaint per se,) is that the sponge was stained after a single use. I was unable to get the foundation out of it, despite repeated washings. The sponge suck up a lot of foundation -- I was ableto do my whole face with 1 squirt initially &amp; still had enough left to go over my undereye area again. But I tried washing it out with the Dr. Bronners liquid soap that I use as handsoap -- no luck. I tried dabbing it in isoproprol alcohol &amp; rinsing it off -- still no luck. Finally, I tried washing it with dishwashing soap -- STILL no luck! The stain remains on the sponge the way it does with those cheap wedge-shaped latex sponges that you don&#x27;t normally reuse. And it took days for the sponge to dry! It was still damp 2 days after I washed it, so I finally tossed it in the dryer on med. heat for 10 min. It came out fine, but I suspect you&#x27;re not supposed to dry those bad boys like a pair of socks. (I&#x27;m sure dryiing the sponge on high would ruin it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never share make-up with anyone but I was concerned about bacteria growing on the sponge since I use organic cosmetics, so I felt safer making sure it was washed &amp; dried completely. I still have 3 sponges left, which I&#x27;m sure will last me another 12 mos. if not more. So this was a really good deal that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to fork over $40 for a set of beauty blenders, then you should try these! Soft and good quality!</li>
            <li> Love these sponges, quality is very good! Price is great compared to some of the more expensive &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are worth the money at all. I really prefer using my brush and have gone back to that.</li>
            <li> I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignorance is bliss! I haven&#x27;t tried a real beauty blender, but this sponge gives me the airbrush effect that I was looking for. All you have to do is soak it in water. Make sure it&#x27;s damp. The best part, a little goes a long way! After buying this product, I have to use less foundation because it gives me amazing coverage with less than half of what I had to use. I also love that it&#x27;s a four pack, and I get four for a fraction of the cost of the beauty blender, so I won&#x27;t ever have to worry about replacing them anytime soon.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old neice wanted this for xmas. She loved them and they work really well and are very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I received the item quickly. The blender works great and applies foundation evenly and flawlessly. It feels like a mini facial when you use it. Great product!</li>
            <li> These sponges are just like the expensive brand version. I don&#x27;t use them all the time because I like to switch between regular flat circular sponges, kabuki style brushes, and just plain fingers, depending on the type of foundation. Yes, I own a lot of different brands and types of foundation - I&#x27;m a makeup fanatic and always ready to try the newest thing. These sponges are great for thicker foundations that are in a solid stick or cream in a compact and of course bb creams (the real Korean ones, not the American version). Be sure to wet the sponges just a little, squeeze out excess moisture, and then pat the foundation out until it is evenly distributed on your face. These sponges allow for more even distribution and you can get into small areas around eyes and nose with the pointy bits. For this price, you should try them.</li>
            <li> bought them for the hype theyve been getting, and honestly, not worth it. i wish it came with clear instructions how to get started because all i see it doing is soaking up all the foundation...i know these arent the original but i expected to fall inlove. but these are really cute and soft.</li>
            <li> Hard to hold doesn&#x27;t apply well with liquid foundation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the original Beauty Blender, but I can&#x27;t imagine how different it could possibly be to justify the price.  These sponges are better than my old dry sponge in that they do give a more finished effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that they seem to pick up way more makeup than I normally use, even when I&#x27;m trying not to, so I went through a period of feeling like I had way too much on, and was using it much more quickly than I normally do.  It just requires a process in which you figure out how to best use the item for yourself.  I dig it, though.</li>
            <li> These work great for application and setting and can be easily cleaned and reused over and over which will save you money in the long run. Different shapes and the tips allow you to get into cracks, creases, etc... you need to apply, with ease. Works great when using setting powder as well. I use these everyday and they work excellent.</li>
            <li> I saw these at a much greater price in other places.  When I found these in amazon at this price, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;m very happy with them and would recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> These sponges look like the ones from Spehora however, they are heavy and very high density so when the sponge touches the face, you can feel how hard it is. I am better off using my fingers when applying foundation than this thing.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  They&#x27;re definitely not the best ones I&#x27;ve ever tried.  They absorb a lot of product, even though I always soak them before I use them.  And my foundation always looks a little blotchy when I use them.  I have to blend a lot.</li>
            <li> I used this for for my liquid foundation application, for me it does the job, do not know the difference between the one that cost more but this works for me.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, I wouldn&#x27;t say they are a complete dupe for the beauty blender but it&#x27;s worth the money. Fast shipping. The only thing is it&#x27;s hard to wash the stains out, but overall. You should purchase these.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is I love it work good with my Foundation</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, definitely improves look of makeup application.</li>
            <li> I bought this 4-pack of Makeup sponges as an add-on item and got them at a bargain price.  They work wonderfully!  The different shapes allow you to use the sponges for different purposes - applying foundation, concealer, blending your makeup, layering your foundation, etc...  They are very easy to clean.  You can easily clean them with some dish soap, olive oil, and cold water.  The sponges last a long time if you take proper care of them.  For less than $2.50 each, it doesn&#x27;t hurt the wallet when they need to be replaced - based upon your usage amount and how well you care for them.  They typically last 3-6 months.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, so I do tend to get some extra mileage out of my &amp;#34;beauty accessories&amp;#34;.  These sponges must be dampened before use.  This causes the sponge to suck in makeup, such as liquid foundation, allowing for a more even application.  However, some people complain that this process causes the sponges to suck in too much makeup and cause wastage as a result.  However, if you spritz the sponge so that it is lightly dampened rather than sticking it under running water, this will cause a lot less wastage of your liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> awesome product, i do wish that they were 4 different shapes but other than that they are perfect, i have used them a lot</li>
            <li> very hard. bad for your skin. it is a fake beauty makeup blender. Just don&#x27;t buy it! I regretted so much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much foundation, but when I do, I love to use this sponges! it just leaves a nice and smooth finish to the face! without looking cakey at all! It is so much better than those triangular white sponges! I think is a very good deal for 4 sponges. I just gave 2 away to people who I know use foundation more often than I do. and they love the product! Never tried the original Beauty Blender, I just think it is a lot of money for a sponge, but once again it depend on how much you use it, for you to decide if its worth it!</li>
            <li> These sponges are great beauty blender dupes. They are super soft and blend my foundation and concealer flawlessly without soaking up my makeup.</li>
            <li> The are great for friend christmas gifts and they are in a cute package.  I got them faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Amazing..... this package comes with four sponges. They are great quality and you can&#x27;t beat the.price. 10.99 really. I start my make up channel next week and can&#x27;t wait to rave about this product&lt;br /&gt;.will also tell the girls in make up.class.</li>
            <li> They are just as good as the beauty blender for a fraction of the price! They are nice to have if you cannot afford the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all, compared to the high priced &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34;! I would recommend it for purchase. Great tool for make up beginners.</li>
            <li> You can usually find the one single beauty blender for $20. But this pack comes with 4 (2 of each different shapes) and for half the price? Whaaaaaat?! Hell Yeah!</li>
            <li> This is the best set ever, for whom wanna try sponge applicator for your make up routine and not quite a pro yet and feel like don&#x27;t want to spend $20 ish per a sponge. this is a very good buy you get 4 sponges, same or close to a brand name quality. i am a make up junky and i am glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li> Great for smooth make up application</li>
            <li> It leave streaks on my face, and absorb so much of my foundation! It&#x27;s like the sponges soak up the product and when you put it on your face, there is nothing left.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these for months now and it has performed beautifully! Even with repeated washings, it is not showing any signs of wear. Makeup goes on smoothly with this. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Great for the price. I thought they bit slightly bigger.</li>
            <li> I was contemplating buying the beauty blender and the Sonia Kashuk one at Target, but after looking into reviews these works about the same. You can&#x27;t beat 4 for the price you would pay for one Sonia Kashuk blender and the beauty blender price is just ridiculous. I have used this on my face for blending out my concealer and I can&#x27;t be happier, not to mention the packaging is cute! I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the beauty blender to see what the hype and difference is and why for one sponge it costs double what a pack of 4 is. In my opinion they do the same thing. I noticed no drastic difference when I applied foundation and concealer on with these 2 brands. For what it&#x27;s worth, I wish I had just bought these. I paid for a brand name with the beauty blender. Just because something is cheap in price doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s cheap in quality too- same goes for over priced items. Just because its expensive doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the best/top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deff get this if you want to achieve the same look as the beauty blender and don&#x27;t want to spend the outrageous price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
            <li> Feels so much nicer on the skin.  The foundation glides on without dragging. Great price in the bundle pack.  I tried it and immediately brought the other three sponges to a &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; dinner at friend&#x27;s house and handed them out that very night!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see that these are any better than my store bought sponges, they are firmer and easier to find but I felt fine discarding my other ones and despite washing these have a hard time feeling as if they can be disposable.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these make up blenders and they are a fraction of the price of others.  Best bargan I have gotte in a long time.  I love the colors and different shapes.  YEAH Bundle Monster 4 piece item.</li>
            <li> Cheap alternative to the beauty blender. Make sure you get it wet and wring it out before use.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  They just are not for me.</li>
            <li> These little puffs are great for applying foundation.  With 4 to a pack, you&#x27;ll always have one ready to use while you clean the others.  The colors are fun too!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she is a makeup fanatic she likes high quality items and these were perfect she really enjoyed these</li>
            <li> this is not what I expected at all. Can&#x27;t use it for makeup. hard cheap funky smell and extremely hard to clean and dry</li>
            <li> These came recommended by a YouTube makeup artist. He explains that while &amp;#34;these&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t as squishy as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;, he finds they work just as well and DONT tear easily as do the others! WASH BEFORE USE* I rinsed mine &amp; suds came out, so definitely wash before using on your face! They double in size when rinsed, &amp; get softer. You want them to be damp when applying foundation ( liquid or cream!)  &amp; you will get a flawless application!  A little trial &amp; error may be needed if you&#x27;ve never used these, but it&#x27;s worth it!!  Much better than your fingers, or those little tiny white triangle sponges that shred after 1 use!  It cuts the time in half of applying your foundation &amp; it gives a gorgeous almost airbrushed finish. Great product, GREAT price!  And all the shapes are useable; it&#x27;s just which you prefer ... Highly recommend !!!!  Love these!&lt;br /&gt;* buying more before price goes up, lol.....</li>
            <li> im learning how to put on makeup and this really help me a lot with blending they are perfect, and they shipped really quick</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I used the beauty blender.  I was looking to purchase another one and my friend recommended these as a less expensive alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are great for blending foundation and concealer. However, I don&#x27;t use these to actually apply either foundation or concealer because I feel that a lot of the product gets absorbed by the blender. I use a foundation brush, although I think this is more of a personal preference.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is very important to wet these sponges first and wring out the excess water. I have found that they work 100X better this way. Otherwise they can feel a bit harsh on the skin and not very soft. I found this was the biggest difference for me between these and the beauty blender. The beauty blender does feel nicer on the skin even when dry. It just feels much softer to me. Although I don&#x27;t think the actual blending abilities differ much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated these items 5 stars because:&lt;br /&gt;1) You get 4 of them!&lt;br /&gt;2) Price&lt;br /&gt;3) When wet they work/feel similar to a beauty blender&lt;br /&gt;4) Great at blending foundation/concealer and making look more natural&lt;br /&gt;5) Cute colors :)</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this bundle, I purchased a single sponge from Amazon that was like 2.99 and it was an exact replica of the beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These however, were a disappointment. They are not as soft as the beauty blender, or the 2.99 one I had previously purchased on Amazon. They do apply your make up, but I feel like I have to press the foundation super hard on face to get it to stick. It absorbs all of my foundation!</li>
            <li> I know the price makes it tempting to atleast want to give these a try, but these sponges truely suck and I ended up throwing them all away. They are very hard even after soaking in water and they absorb all your makeup so none of it really makes it to your face and the little that does show up on your skin is streaky. If you have never used a makeup sponge you might like these, but there are definitely better ones on the market.</li>
            <li> I love to find a good deal!  I am not about spending a ton of money on beauty products although I do like to look good.  You get 4 of these and they work great. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re as good as the more expensive name brand one but they do the job.  Just wet (it works better that way) and go.  It does not absorb too much product when wet and blends well.  I use it for highlighting and contouring.</li>
            <li> These sponges are quite different from your typical makeup sponges. The don&#x27;t seem to soak up the foundation like the regular makeup sponges...which is good. The pointy ones are good for applying concealer in places like under your eyes or in the corners. The other one is good for applying your foundation...whichever end you choose to use is up to you. The package doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, so you have to rely on either trial and error, or reviews from other users. I&#x27;m going to see if anyone has a video posted on YouTube...I&#x27;m more of a visual person. But for someone who doesn&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup...these were simple to use!</li>
            <li> Great and so easy to use, applies makeup quick and flawlessly. I love how soft and easy to use the sponges get when there moist.  My new favorite makeup tool!</li>
            <li> These makeup sponges are so soft and apply my foundation wonderfully. I tried something else when these were used up and the sponge was so hard. I immediately ordered more of these. They also take several cleanings/washings before they will begin to tear.</li>
            <li> Save your money BUY the real beauty blender. These are HARD. They are so dense. Even once submerged in water, they really do not become much better. I love the beauty blender, and it is expensive considered it does not last that long. I wear make up everyday, so probably only two months. However, I have decided the beauty blender is completely worth it. Splurge on the real deal. Do not try these!!!</li>
            <li> Why pay $20.00 for a Beauty blender when you get 4 beauty blenders for half the price? Yes, these are slightly smaller, you don&#x27;t need a large blender to be effective. Dip these bad girls in water, squeeze the water out, and pat on your favorite foundation then blend! It works better if you dab the foundation on your forehead, cheeks, nose and chin first. Gently pat the foundation out and blend. So simple and flawless. My foundation goes on so well that I don&#x27;t use my MAC brushes to apply. I was told yesterday that my skin looked like porcelain. I am going to repurchase if I lose any of these items.</li>
            <li> These are NOT comparable to the Beauty Blender, that thing does the best job ever with makeup. These are not the same texture or material at all. These work fine in a pinch but for beauty why skimp just for price?</li>
            <li> The girl loves it, nice and on time.</li>
            <li> Love them. Works amazing when wet so it doesn&#x27;t absorb the makeup . Blends to look natural for a flawless face !</li>
            <li> started to stink and break apart after a while but very good for price</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the very expensive sponge called the BeautyBlender, except with this you get 2 different shapes and 4 sponges. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> No need to spend a million dollars on original beauty blenders. These are sturdy and get the job done. Good value for the money</li>
            <li> I love these so much. Best sponge ever and they give a flawless finish.... Cheaper than the name brand but the quality is still excellent.</li>
            <li> but these work a bit better and don&#x27;t wear out as fast hope everyone who was scammed by the beauty-blender fad has their eyes opened to this wonderful dupe, my only advise is to completely drench the sponge then wring out and use a towel to wring out. works hell of a lot better than beauty blender and you get 4 for nine...don&#x27;t be stupid, just buy this beauty!</li>
            <li> I bought these thru amazon in december 2012 (I know long time coming for a review!) I just came across this bundle monsters again while I was searching for the sonia kashuk or the beauty blender to buy online. For what its worth, the item came neatly wrapped and amazon has always been consistently excellent in their shipment packaging. But I&#x27;m rating the product here so I&#x27;d definitely give it 1 star because after trying out two of the four sponges, I decided it&#x27;s a complete waste of $10. If you like stiff sponges, these may work for you.</li>
            <li> Love the price . so worth the money ...</li>
            <li> Perfect for blending!</li>
            <li> Perfect beauty blenders. I was a bit hesitant because of the negative reviews that said the quality was inferior to the real brand name ones and that they absorb too much product. Maybe they wrote those things so people wouldn&#x27;t buy them and they could keep it all to themselves? *conspiracy theory*&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing these once mine get old and worn out. The right way to use them is soak them under running water for a few seconds while squeezing them, then squeeze the excess water out and dab/tap the makeup product on your face! This gives a great finish to foundation. I love the colors and practical shapes these have. The packaging was exactly as pictured. YAY!</li>
            <li> These are such a bargain for 4 really great sponges, and they clean so easily. My roommate and i love them!</li>
            <li> These sponges are so hard and dense that using them feels like I&#x27;m punching myself in the face rather than bouncing. My boyfriend saw me getting ready one morning and thought I was mad at him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also absorb way too much product, even when wet. Despite the price, I don&#x27;t recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> I just received this package of sponges a few days ago and have used them a couple of times.  They are a great alternative to sponge foundation applicators typically sold at the local drug store.  They are best when used damp...I sqeeze mine into a washcloth to get the excess water out.  I was skeptical that these would give a flawless makeup application, but I was pleasantly surprised.  No streaks or caking of foundation with these cute little makeup blenders.  I have never tried the original beauty blender which costs quite a bit more for a package of only one.  I would absolutely recommend these to anyone considering purchasing them.  They worked well for me and are such amazing bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out the dough for the real thing.  I love the tear drop ones but the other ones are not the same material or something because when you get them wet they don&#x27;t bounce back or keep their shape. I do use them for applying dry powder.</li>
            <li> Easily washable and some of them are shaped to enable precise application and blending of liquid or cream formulas in hard-to-reach areas of the face.</li>
            <li> I was not willing to spend over 12 bucks for one beauty blender, so after some research, I decided for this set and I could not be any more satified with my purchase.  This sponge gives me the best finish a girl can ask. Any of my foundations are now full coverage for my ( most of my foundations are drug store bought) easy to use. Easy to wash ( unlike the Soho one that came apart on the first wash)</li>
            <li> I like this company&#x27;s product. It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great. I like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a quality in a box. One sponge can last for many months if you keep up with cleaning it after every use or every week. It can handle liquid foundations, concealer palettes, even powder! It never soaks up your product so your able to get the maximum potential of the product you are using. Also, its easy to clean. And by it&#x27;s shape and size, you can just use one for everything (Putting concealer in your eyes, putting blush, or doing a whole coverage) Very worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember NOT having this and have to keep using the &#x27;re-usable&#x27; triangular sponges (let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a very known brand too) and I had like 100 in a pack in them but I used everything in a matter of 2-3 months because it&#x27;s hard to clean and once it gets used, you cannot believe the make up stain it leaves! Like it ate 50% of my liquid foundation rather than putting it in my face. So by experience, this is really awesome!</li>
            <li> After doing some research on sponges, I decided to take a chance and order this set. I&#x27;ve watched several of GOSSMAKEUPARTIST&#x27;s tutorials on youtube (decided I need to revamp my enitre technique at 40ish) and he suggested these, or at least this style. His breakdown of it was that these sponges are &amp;#34;private line&amp;#34;, where all different companies buy these from a manufacturer in Hong Kong or China, and just slap their names on them. Since these were so affordable... shoot, you get 4 for about $10 which makes them about $2.50 each, I didn&#x27;t feel like I was risking too much. They arrived yesterday (yay for fast shipping!) and I used one today. It sure beats my old triangle sponge! Depending upon how much water you leave in it will affect how sheer your coverage will be. I need more coverage for my melasma and mild adult acne, so I squeezed out almost all the water and followed with a good squeeze in a clean towel. It didn&#x27;t seem to absorb too much of my foundation and allowed for beautiful stipling and blending. If I notice any issues arise, I&#x27;ll make sure to update.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a dupe for the Beauty Blender if that&#x27;s what you are looking for. Decent price for what you get though. If using these sponges, I recommend only using for touching up foundation and concealer. Not for actual application, as these sponges don&#x27;t seem to really stick the product into your skin as the beauty blender does, since the beauty blender is so porous. Pros and cons to that though.</li>
            <li> Love these! Great price and they work amazing! Make sure to wash them out to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I know some people say only the brand name will do for these but I&#x27;ve used these for a while now and they work perfect. I am able to blend my makeup easily.</li>
            <li> I received this as a christmas gift and it came just as it looks in the picture!&lt;br /&gt;Really nice quality sponges and they blend my foundation nicely!</li>
            <li> The problem with this little sponge is that it doesnt really blend well and is the purpose of it so.... i tried it wet, wring it it out and then blotting on my foundation and it als didnt blend well. I gave it three stars because they are cute and is four for the price of one. However, I think I should have spent the money on the real one. The feel kind of hard too, not softer as I expected. Also, after using both shapes, I do prefer the curvy one, instead of the egg shaped one... if that helps.</li>
            <li> Got everything in good packaging. No harm done what so ever. Came with another item so it might be different.</li>
            <li> They blend foundation perfect and remove excess product, which helps so I don&#x27;t as oily through out the day. They were a great buy for the price too. Plus they&#x27;re latex free, so I can use them on clients who have latex allergies.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I wanted the Beauty Blender sponge, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high amount of money. When I saw the price of the Bundle Monster I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. After trying them out I was very very happy! They work just as well as the fancy makeup sponges! Plus, now I have 4 :)</li>
            <li> Will not but again. Did not work. Even when moistened they left streaks and spotsnin my makeup and absorbed too much product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bundle of four make-up sponges ! Don&#x27;t let their small size scare you , once you wet them they actually expand and double in size . My makeup goes on smoother and without the \\&quot;caked\\&quot; on feeling . I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more !</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little hard but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These little sponge balls are absolutely fantastic! I kind of came across them by accident and being an avid Mac makeup brush user I was super skeptical of the blending powers of these little things but HOLY COW! They are super easy to use, wet them completely, letting them absorb as much water as possible then squeeze it out, use a paper towel to soak up excess water if needed and leave it only slightly damp.. At this point they grow to like 3 times the SIZE! I use them for my foundation, concealer and blush! They blend beautifully almost pressing my makeup into my skin so I dont have a powdery finish to my make up, its very smooth! I would absolutely recommend it to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as mentioned but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected, the bb is soft but doesn&#x27;t blend as well as I thought it should. It kind of just roughly smear your makeup and doesn&#x27;t look flawless.</li>
            <li> Still don&#x27;t really technically know how to use these properly but I like them. They work for what I use them for fine. A LOT cheaper than the more expensive version. From what I can gather they work fine.</li>
            <li> These are soft, easy to use and clean, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for four pieces!  All around great!</li>
            <li> works so good for foundation and cream blushes.</li>
            <li> Once I submerged in water and squeezed out excess it expanded to proper size and became softer will buy again</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter after learning about them on youtube. She likes using these sponges better than the traditional, disposable sponges. Her face/make-up look smooth so they seem to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> They feel so hard like a rock on ur face don&#x27;t waste ur money, spend money on the real ones</li>
            <li> these are great! i am in love with the way that this sets my foundation on perfectly and flawless! i use maybe line true match liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $20 plus dollars for the Beauty Blender and found great dupes for half the price and more product. These are excellent for putting on my foundation and my concealer.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges.  They&#x27;re cheaper than the &#x27;Beauty Blender&#x27;, and work just as well, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  It also saves me on having to constantly buy the disposable sponges.  I use mine daily and love them.  I clean them using California Baby organic baby shampoo, and that gets them really clean.  Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> The beauty blender foundation puff couldn&#x27;t be better.  It applies makeup flawlessly.  They could not be better.  Hurry and Buy at this price.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re really good and everyone should have one in their make up bag! definitely recommend! they&#x27;re super soft and gentle!</li>
            <li> Nothing beats the Beauty Blender. These sponges are a good substitute, though. They are made of a different material than the BB, though. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. The finish is good, just not as good as the BB sponge I also own.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this. I&#x27;ve only tested out the egg shaped/tear drop one. It does not &#x27;double&#x27; in size. It DOES get bigger than it&#x27;s original size are soaking and rinsing in warm water. I like this because it&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s not horribly big, it gives a nicer natural look without brush streaks. Also love it cuz i don&#x27;t accidentally poke myself with brush bristles on my lower lash line. I was very skeptical about buying this, cuz i was like, why blow 9 bucks on a piece of foam. But the fact it came with 4 intrigued me. Another thing i liked is that it doesn&#x27;t soak up a lot of product. And when i rinsed it out, the little product that got on it ALL came out during washing. I used the white one specifically to test that out. It&#x27;s creamy white, just like when i opened the box.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these, they&#x27;re very versatile.</li>
            <li> Puts make up on nicely.  It does feel bulky to me but because of the size it does offer a quick coverage.  I dampen the sponge first which really seems to help.  Would purchase again :-)</li>
            <li> These are exactly as pictured.  I have only used two of them so far as they are very durable.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these beauty blenders. They come in a pack of 4 at a much cheaper price than just one sold in store. They&#x27;ve kept their shape and are easy to wash and use.</li>
            <li> I love these when applying my liquid foundation its a breeze, especially getting under the eye and the sides are so good..it leaves me with that flawless finish no streaks!</li>
            <li> Good Quality &amp; Nice Colors</li>
            <li> I would purchase these again and again. The sponges were very affordable, and they will last me a while. Blends foundation flawlessly. I love to use them damp.</li>
            <li> Great product thats really cheap! Love it!</li>
            <li> great for applying make up, design is perfect. soft, rolls on, great with foundation. 4 in a pack and a money saver!</li>
            <li> They get the job done. Blends out my foundation for an even smoother look and its just amazing. I would definitely recommend this to every mua.</li>
            <li> Just save and get an original beauty blender! I bought this hoping it would change my life but instead it just got rid of my concealer it didn&#x27;t actually blend it just smudged it around! A beauty blender expands when it is placed under water and that&#x27;s what makes for such a nice non crease application of concealer and foundation but these makeup blenders absolutely sucked</li>
            <li> I love!&lt;br /&gt;It really cuts down time and keeps my hands clean from foudation.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars because it does apply makeup amazingly well however, it harbors bacteria so it made my already mild acne problems worse. Because it&#x27;s a spunge it&#x27;s a pain to have to clean all the time so I went back to a foundation brush. But it&#x27;s basically exactly the same as the beauty blender so I wouldn&#x27;t buy the name brand one over it. You&#x27;ll get the same results.</li>
            <li> Harder foam than others I&#x27;ve ordered, but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> A good value, a little stiff at first but after the first wash they cleaned great and were soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> i love these makeup blender foundation puff,  not to big, nice size and works well! yes they do the job  .</li>
            <li> Love these little things. Makes putting on foundation makeup so much easier. Blends very well. Would recommend to anyone that is looking for a blender. Also great price.</li>
            <li> Good package to experiment with the different shapes. I love these makeup sponges, makes everything look very natural, smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Nice set for the price :)</li>
            <li> Great cheaper version of beauty blender</li>
            <li> These are 10x better than the other bootleg Beauty Blenders I&#x27;ve gotten over the years. They are super bouncy, double in size when wet, don&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; all the foundation, and apply really evenly. The value is unbeatable, too. Four for the price of one name brand one. I use them wet to apply my MUFE HD foundation and dry to apply my Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder, and the result is very natural looking. I have found that they last longer if I wash them after each use.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are a bit heavier and firmer than the original beauty blender, but they still do the job. If I had both in front of me, I would pick the original... but when you are talking prices.. I would pick this every time.</li>
            <li> ITEM WAS AS DESCRIBED. I LOVE IT &amp; IT ALSO MAKES A GREAT GIFT. THANK YOU FOR GREAT SERVICE !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to find a great dupe for the Beauty Blender.  While these are good &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; texture makeup sponges, those who have used real BB&#x27;s before will notice that the texture is not the same.  I read some of the reviews that stated to soak them in water, and I did so, but the texture didn&#x27;t really become softer.  I still use them, but don&#x27;t expect  these sponges to be a Beauty Blender or even the Real Techniques formula.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try the Beauty Blender sponge but could not justify the price. So, although I can&#x27;t compare the Bundle Monster sponges to the original Beauty Blender, I can say that these sponges definitely get the job done, blending my foundation smoothly and seamlessly. You get two of each shape, so I gave one of each to my mom and she loves them as well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Work very well. Rings water out well too.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!! Doesn&#x27;t blend well and left my skin peely! Not worth a cent!! Coming from a makeup artist! I bought new foundation and the same time and thought it was he foundation that got great reviews but I decided to put the foundation on with a different sponge and it came out flawlessly!</li>
            <li> Lovely sponges and a good value but just a bit stiff for me. I prefer more airy blenders but these stay in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by these Pro Beauty Flawless Makeup Blenders.  They blend my foundation and concealers out beautifully.  However, I wish all four were shaped in the teardrop shape like the purple and cream colored blenders.  The pink and blue blenders are sort of hard to work with.  Other than that, they&#x27;re worth the buy.</li>
            <li> The product certainly fulfills my expectations. The selling price was a bargain and I expect the blending sponges will last quite a while</li>
            <li> First order got lost in the mail but it was refunded right away...so thank you! My second order (re-order) came earlier than the ETA. I tried only the purple one and so far it&#x27;s working just fine. I love how smooth and how well it blends my foundation unto my face. It does the same to my bronzer, contouring palette and highlighter. All in all, i love them! The color are too cute that my daughter wants to have them.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Beauty Blender and loved it so i bought this product. At first i was disappointed because these sponges aren&#x27;t as squishy as the Beauty Blender but after using it i think it blends my liquid foundation alot better due to the fact that is the sponge isn&#x27;t as soft! i will highly recommend these!! and i will buy again!!</li>
            <li> These sponges smell very odd and are really too large for proper makeup application.  I prefer a good brush to these -- hands down.</li>
            <li> I have looked at several YOUTUBE videos and saw people using these sponges. I wondered..&amp;#34;What&#x27;s the big deal with this sponge?&amp;#34; Well, I orderd these and I now see. These are great for blending. I was going to purchase the actual &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; sponge, however, it was not necessary to spend the extra money to get one sponge. Here, I got 4 and they are really good. My only problem is that they are kinda tough to clean. This is why I give it 4 stars. I had to keep squeezing and rinsing it to rid  it of the soap I used. So I recommend using VERY little soap to  clean it. After all it is a sponge. I think these work well, and  if you are on the fence, go ahead and try them. You will be pleasantly surprised. Also, go to YOUTUBE and you can see how to use it!</li>
            <li> I have seen these sponges on another site for a lot more money and the price was for just one sponge. The set that Bundle Monster is offering is identical to the quality of the other sponge I have seen. With this set you receive 4 sponges, 2 tear drop haped and 2 hour glass shape. I personally prefer the tear drop to the hour glass when applying foundation because I can get into the corners around my nose easier with that shape. Overall they are fantastic sponges, they blend perfectly, are easy to work with and cleanup is a breeze with them. Why spend $20 on up for one when you can get this fantastic 4 piece set for $10.99. Bundle Monster products are always excellent quality and this one will not let you down!!&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> this are so great, they expand so mucho when damp I think this are just like the Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> I bought these before ever owning a Beauty Blender because I couldn&#x27;t justify paying so much for one sponge. I have had these for a few months and they are in okay condition still though I may need to replace them soon. I do take care of them by using a mild facial wash and some olive oil, I keep them in a dry area where they are away from contamination or the elements because I like taking care of my beauty tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this for so long I decided to get a BB when it was on sale so I could compare it since I read mixed reviews, I was not impressed though. I ended up taking it back because these sponges are very much alike to me. They are not identical in application but they are both soft and expand a lot when wet, pick up product and blend it amazingly, texture wise they are almost identical, and these seemed a little more flimsy than the BB but I guess I don&#x27;t care considering how long that have lasted me and the fact that they are a fraction of the price and you get 4 of them! I love how bouncy they are, I can use them for smudging or for blending, and they come in lots of shapes to allow many different application processes to be done with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a brand snob then I suggest Beauty Blender but for people just looking for the same effect and cheaper then I say to give these a try because they really are amazing.</li>
            <li> These sponges are wonderful.  They are big enough to grasp comfortably and control so you can more evenly apply make-up and cream.  They also do not absorb the cream or make-up and are easily cleaned with a little soap and water.  Good product that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love these! I have now gotten my close knit Ladies to use them as well! You do have to get it wet EVERY TIME you use it, but i loooooove it! I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of the sponges but found it to be very durable and work well for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a Beauty Blender because I can&#x27;t justify to myself paying that much for just one sponge. I took a chance on this bundle and regret it. It does expand in size after wetting it and squeezing out the water. However, when you go to use it, it feels like your beating your face up with a sponge. It&#x27;s definitely not soft enough AND it eats up a lot of foundation.</li>
            <li> I first heard about these sponges from a blogger so I decided to try them out. I am not disappointed with them. They blend makeup very well. My only suggestion is to wash them before use as they can be kind of hard coming out of the pack fresh. I would also suggest letting them dry fully before use, as when they are wet they soak up more product than when dry.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was doing everything right until I got this blender sponge!!! It&#x27;s the best ever - makes make-up look flawless everytime</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Beauty Blenders. Love the variety of sizes. and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Applies product like a dream! Various sizes and tips make it possible to access hard-to-reach areas of the face. I can&#x27;t recommend these enough to those looking for an a more affordable version of the Beauty Blender. I will be repurchasing when mine wear out!</li>
            <li> I bought these sponges because I really hate paying the ridiculously high price for the official beauty blender. The name doesn&#x27;t matter to me, just that the product works. The Bundle Monster sponges aren&#x27;t bad. They do increase in size when soaked with water, and they are smooth in texture. And of course, the price is fantastic! Four sponges for less than the price of one beauty blender is a bargain! But I do have some issues with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, if you are looking for a beauty blender dupe, this is not it. Although the sponges look the same, the texture is actually very different. The official beauty blender is more spongy and squishy - when you press it to your face (wet of course) you can almost press it flat. This is great because it absorbs less product - good news if your foundation is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bundle Monster sponges in comparison are VERY dense. There is almost no give to them when pressed against your face (again, when wet). It is a much firmer sponge overall, but it has its pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The finish you get with this product is great. I have no complaints with how my makeup looks after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The pointed tip also makes it easier to get right up to your lower lash line when applying concealer - the original beauty blender has more of a rounded tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Tougher than the beauty blender, and will probably last a lot longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The density of this sponge means it will absorb and waste product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The firmness also makes it difficult to really get into awkward areas of the face, like around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Doesn&#x27;t apply quite as much product as the beauty blender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way I can describe the Bundle Monster sponge is that it isn&#x27;t really spongy at all - it&#x27;s more like a solid piece of foam. It is very reminiscent of my memory foam pillow and those triangle sponges you can pick up at the drug store. The beauty blender, on the other hand, has pores and actually feels like a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave it up to you to decide whether to buy these or not. I can&#x27;t recommend them but nor can I say they are a terrible product. It just depends on what you&#x27;re looking for, but don&#x27;t expect these to be a close match for the official beauty blender.hand, has pores and actually feels like a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave it up to you to decide whether to buy these or not.

            <li> I have used cheap makeup sponges for years and never thought much of it.&lt;br /&gt;I was always switching out my foundation thinking it was not that good.&lt;br /&gt;Well I was WRONG. after using one of these with foundation I thought i did not like as it settled into my poors and looked terrible on my skin even with using good primer, I was very happy. These thing worked very well and smoothed out the look of the foundation on my skin. Made it look much better. So it turns out I have not been using the right applicator!&lt;br /&gt;Wow I love these things.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price and the wait. I will be buying them again when I feel these need replacement. They are well made so it may be a long time before I need to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> These are just adorable! For 10 bucks you get 4 so how could you NOT buy these?!&lt;br /&gt;I love them, they work really well with cream and liquid foundations / concealers.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that kept me from rating this a 5 star product&lt;br /&gt;was the fact that they soak up more product that I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised on the Today Show so I tried it.  My makeup does go on smoother.  I will continue to use the sponges!</li>
            <li> Not as squishy as a genuine Beauty Blender, but still fantastic, and makes my foundation look amazing.</li>
            <li> I wish there were instructions that came with these. They are more compact compared to the original beauty blender sponges, which I think affects application. I find it harder to use than a regular makeup brush, and finish isn&#x27;t that much better. I&#x27;m not getting that &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look everyone talks about. If you&#x27;re not sure if you want to get the original blender because of the price (which I totally understand, twenty bucks for one sponge sounds excessive), I would still say, get the original anyway but from somewhere that you can easily return if you don&#x27;t like it. These won&#x27;t give you the feel for the original product.</li>
            <li> I used this to blend my foundation and concealer.  For me, It gets the job done.  They could be a little softer to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Cant complain, the price is wonderful for 4 of them.  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I suck at blending my BB Cream but i find it helps me control my blemishes/oil better then the days i dont wear it (this is what BB Cream is meant to do its more skin care then true makeup but great as a base if you still need more coverage). I use mine by wetting it then \\&quot;drying it\\&quot; in a dry wash cloth. Apply BB cream to the sponge dab on different areas of the face, then start blending. Next i put on concealer where needed and add my mineral powder which darkens it to my natural color. My boyfriend does not even notice when I wear it but I still hear his dumb-founded remarks about women with caked makeup and how they need to go natural or lighter on the makeup once he found out I wear makeup. Now if only I could find something to make eyeliner easier to put on.</li>
            <li> Good for the cost. I didn&#x27;t want to fork out 40 bucks for something similar to this, but this works just as good. I thought it would come with a box, but it didn&#x27;t. Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I really wish someone had given an honest review before I bought these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are much too heavy, and soak up way to much water, nearly tripling in size. The texture isn&#x27;t the best for any makeup application, it sheers out and absorbs makeup far too much. You can&#x27;t \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; this monstrous sponge off of your face because it&#x27;s far too dense and large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking to get a comparable sponge with which to replace your beauty blender - this is NOT it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my favorite beauty gurus on youtube suggested it. IT&#x27;S NOT SQUISHY BECAUSE YOU&#x27;RE SUPPOSED TO SUBMERSE IT IN WATER BEFORE YOU USE IT. Then squeeze out the excess water and viola! It doubles in size and is muccchhhh more squishy. You should also do this because the water keeps the sponge from absorbing your foundation. Oi.</li>
            <li> This set is extremely small which causes a problem for those who are actually wanted to use this for professional applicators other than that the fabric it pretty good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the beauty blender for many years now.  But, after finding these, I never went back.  These cost less than half of the beauty blender and performs as well or even better.  I will buy again and again :-)</li>
            <li> These are perfect! The pores aren&#x27;t too big, and it&#x27;s very soft on the skin. It absorbs the water and glides the foundation right on. Highly recommend. The only weird thing is it is very hard to clean. Very hard. Lol. I tried with shampoo but it barely took it out.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, definitely comparable to the beauty blender. Foundation application  is flawless and less messy. The texture when you first buy the sponges is hard-ish but once you wet them they transform into a bouncy texture that just makes make up application fun again. Just wet them and blot out the extra water before adding foundation. I like to put foundation on my face, just randomly tap it on in random places with my hands and then go over it with the sponge to blend. I don&#x27;t feel like this \\&quot;steals\\&quot; much of my foundation, if I feel like I need more coverage I just add another layer. The Teardrop sponges are fantastic for around the nose and under the eyes. Blends out cream concealer perfectly! Definitely repurchasing! (:</li>
            <li> This is no substitute for the BeautyBlender makeup sponge. Unfortunately, I thought I&#x27;d found a cheaper version, as it&#x27;s difficult to justify (for me, anyway) paying $10+ for just a single makeup applicator, but these cheap sponges are no deal. They are made from some type of rubbery material, and they smear makeup unevenly, not blend. I am very disappointed. The sponges don&#x27;t absorb water, and can&#x27;t even be properly cleaned. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> worked like the expensive one foamed alittle when i wet it so i would wash it b4 use..good product overall</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a whole set of these and finally i found some at a great price!! love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried some other Beauty Blender dupes, but didn&#x27;t get the hype until I tried these. They plump up enormously when squeezed out under water, and apply color so delicately to the face. Definitely a staple for me now.</li>
            <li> make up really goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Just as described. I use them often and they work great! Would buy them again if/ when I need replacements</li>
            <li> no lo e probado todabia pero lo compre porque la oferta estaba buenisima y no estaba espensive .... y eso es lo mejor</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t quite the same texture as Beauty Blender but they come pretty close. Make sure you soak them before you use them... they also need to be rung out rather well. They work pretty well and are worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> These are good for blending your makeup and concealer.</li>
            <li> These are high quality, soft, and very durable! Exactly as pictured. I probably will not have to buy another set of sponges unless I lose these. For full review, plus video demonstration, please see my beauty/makeup blog: sexybrokelibrarian dot blogspot dot com.</li>
            <li> Great for applying makeup. Various sizes for under eyes or the face. Great price too.</li>
            <li> SOFT AND SQUISHY. I CANT WAIT TO TRY IT OUT. THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING FURTHER PURCHASES WITH YOU.</li>
            <li> They are alright. Very hard feel to them even when you wet them.</li>
            <li> The quality is so bad but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Very good for put on primer or foundation, and better than to use hand. I think it is easy and clean. Also I can wash it every time after used, love it!</li>
            <li> They work just as good as beauty blender! And you get more for your money. Buying more! Just make sure you wet them before using</li>
            <li> These are very close in quality to the original Beauty Blenders, except they are a tiny bit harder but the difference is very minimum. These are good sponges but they rip and end up in the garbage just like the cheaper ones. I don&#x27;t think they are any more special than the old style puffs you buy at your local drug store for just couple bucks for a full bag of them. Yes, true, they are bigger and in a nice shape, which is great for a facial massage in addition to applying foundation. But as far as applying makeup better than brushes or the puffy wedges, they do not and are just as good as the drug store types. Huge waste of money and fuss over an average, meh product. Not sure why &amp;#34;Beauty Blenders&amp;#34; became something to be so excited/fussed about because they don&#x27;t do any more special work than the old ones mentioned. Won&#x27;t bother with none of these anymore and will continue using my old wedge puffs that have been working great for 30 years for me.</li>
            <li> Price point for these makes them a great value.  Wife loves them and says they perform as well as any more expensive products shes tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my foundation has been better applied with these blender sponges. The different shapes are great and I like the smooth almost velvet texture of the sponges.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> Love them so much better than a brush to blend</li>
            <li> I have used both these and an authentic beauty blender makeup sponge, and I prefer these. These are a different material than the beauty blender, and they are heavier, but I feel that they blend makeup just as well at a fraction of the cost. I have severe cystic acne on my chin, and these sponges give me great, natural looking coverage using a cheap drugstore foundation. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing a beauty blender, but I will definitely repurchase these sponges once they wear out. Excellent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I like these they are not very soft they are kinda like hard sponges but non the less they get the work done and they&#x27;re cute too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a make up brush and came across these little foundation blenders. Since it was around $10 for 4, I gave it a try. I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of foundation and it blended and smoothed out beautifully on my skin.  Very even and easy. Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> love my little blenders! Fair price and great quality! I will be a return customer! thanks for the great service!</li>
            <li> i dont like the sponges. they absorb all the foundation and it doesnt go on my skin at all</li>
            <li> Great sponges! This deal gives you more bang for your buck. Similar to the beauty blender but affordable.  Great for foundation blending.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with the Beauty Blender product, you know that it is amazing but it&#x27;s price is not. These offer everything that it does but at a major discount! You can apply liquid foundation or concealer with these wet or dry, and you can set your under-eye concealer or foundation with the tapered sponges dry. These give the skin an airbrushed finish and are very gentle on dark circles. They are also incredibly easy to clean, and they come in the most adorable colors and packaging! I love these and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my gf as a gift and she loved them!,  she loves the creamy looking one the most and she loves them since they are soft and help her alot to do her make up by the size and the form of the product. one of the best purchases i have made.</li>
            <li> Service was excellent. Arrived on time and in good packaging. The material is slightly stiffer  than the real sponge but it works just as well. Colors are very pretty. Can&#x27;t beat the price either. Would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it for an extra christmas gift. Affordable too</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, very good price.  Make sure you wet the sponge before using.</li>
            <li> These work nothing like the originals. They&#x27;re too thick and don&#x27;t spread your make up like the real ones</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it took me so long to discover these blending puffs.  For the record, I have never used the Beauty Blender little pink egg things, so I can&#x27;t offer a comparison.  But these sponges are awesome!  As the previous reviews state, you should soak it in water first and then squeeze it out so it has a fluffier, spongier texture before applying makeup.  It blends very well, and it does create a more natural, air-brushed look.  Again, I don&#x27;t know how awesome this is compared to the Beauty Blender, but it works perfectly fine for me.  I&#x27;m definitely retiring my collection of MAC and Sephora foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this puff everyday and it works amazing. I get it a little wet and then apply my foundation...it makes my foundation look so good and it is simple to clean. I have been using the same one for the last 5 months so they last a long time! Why pay for one beauty blender when you can get 4 for a cheaper price. Promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> never tried the classic beauty blender. but let me tell u what i know.just put one of these great sponges into water, squeeze it and apply ur favorite foundation with. YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THOSE AT ALL!</li>
            <li> ** BUY THESE SPONGES FROM BUNDLE MONSTER INSTEAD OF FROM HONG KONG FOR CHEAPER! I BOUGHT BOTH AND THE ONES FROM BUNDLE MONSTER ARE SOFTER AND EXPAND MORE AND BLEND BETTER! ** These sponges are a must buy! I can&#x27;t compare them to the original BB because I never purchased it but I have purchased the MAC Pro Soonge and these little sponges are 10x better and softer! They expand beautifully and blend like a dream. I bought them for my clients but I just had to use one and I swore to never use a brush again! For this price, this is a steal!</li>
            <li> $20 dollars for on Beauty Blender? NO THANK YOU!  I love this 4pc Beauty Blenders its half the price of the BB and you get FOUR!  I&#x27;ve tried them all and my favorite once and are the organic handle ones. You have to wet and towel dry before using them to get the best results. I wanted to gift them to my friends but then I realize I could have one for almost one day of the week and I became greedy and kept them all. This way I don&#x27;t have to wash just one at the end of the week, I wash them all and the whole week I have a clean one to put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Did not know this product existed, but I must say, they worked very well when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> great makeup sponges! Easy to wash!</li>
            <li> Had to get replacements and these are great.  Awesome price for 4 as well; I paid that much for 1 before</li>
            <li> This sponges are great for the amount of many expended in them,they are actually really similar to the beauty blender.My only complain is that after you soak them in water it doesn&#x27;t come back to their original size or form.But apart from that it was money well spend you get a good product for a small amount of money if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge! Better than using a brush or my hands! I use this to apply my bb cream that is mixed with revlon color stay foundation and it makes the application look so natural and smooth. I just want to say though that when I got this the white sponge is all wrinkly and the blue one has this little yellow stain on it but I will still give it a 5 star since I find these spones so cute!</li>
            <li> I use these sponges to apply my foundation, and they work like a charm. I am so happy that I purchased these instead of getting the more expensive version that you find in beauty stores. These work great.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the reviews on the beauty blender but thought this product was a way better value because you get 4 sponges. These are awesome! They are soft and supple and the best part is they fit right into my product perfectly! I use them with the tigi bed head whipped foundation and it goes on with a beautiful airbrush finish. Will definitely recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li> How did I ever put my foundation on before these?!?!?! These are so amazing! I had wanted a Beauty Blender dupe sponge that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank and these were definitely the ticket! Great product, killer price and such an amazing foundation application!!!! I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> I saw one in Sephora and it is $8 for ONE! Im glad i bought this from amazon. It blends out the foundation pretty well and i use the tip of the puff to use it around of eye area. I gave one of them to my mum and my mum loves it!!</li>
            <li> Great beauty blenders!!!!</li>
            <li> Only the 2 egg shaped sponges could actually be used. The other 2 were tough and felt like I was punching myself in face repeatedly. Still, not a bad deal for the price. Good for people on a budget who want a similar finish to a Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> I liked these better than the beauty blender. Enough said.</li>
            <li> love these little makeup sponges, they are off brand but they work as well as the real thing</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this out to compare to the Beauty Blender...and I totally understand why the BB is better. These are a lot more &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;, and I feel like I&#x27;m going to do permanent damage to my skin when applying foundation/concealer, and blending my makeup. These sponges aren&#x27;t terrible, but I find that the BB overall are better sponges.</li>
            <li> guess I expected this to be like the Beauty Blenders, they are not as soft as the beauty blender so it is harder to apply the makeup with.</li>
            <li> I love these beauty blenders. I bought these and I&#x27;ve also used the actual brand name beauty blender. I love these more than the beauty blender brand. Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Hello there!&lt;br /&gt;I love my blundle monster blender. I just save me a lot of money and I  works the same as the beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;I  definitely will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Does its job....however, you CANNOT clean these! Once you get them wet, they expand and do not go back down!!</li>
            <li> it help so much when i do my makeup its the best. it leaves my face looking nice ass fuhhh</li>
            <li> they will work for extra sponges!</li>
            <li> First off, the price for these is wonderful because these can easily be more expensive. They do exactly what they are supposed to and are very good.</li>
            <li> These make blenders are awesome.  You dab your foundation or concealer with blender and your make up goes on flawlessly.  I wish I can get them in all purple, I just love purple.  I can&#x27;t  remember, if bought them from amazon or eBay, either-way get them.  I wash them with antibacterial soap, water and alcohol , to keep them bacteria free.  Let them set tomdry and re reuse them.  I use the pointed end to clean up brow area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give you a flawless foundation application every single time.&lt;br /&gt;No streaks and no areas with too much makeup or too little.&lt;br /&gt;Make up Blender Sponge , apply it like a Pro</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive blenders and these are just as good.  Easy to use, just run under warm water, squeeze out and you have a great blender. They come in four different shapes. Great price for 4.</li>
            <li> These beauty blenders are great.  You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.  I like them especially to blend my concealer.</li>
