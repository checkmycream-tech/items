            <li>smelled so good</li>
            <li>Buy from a good seller and should not have a problem.  </li>
            <li>This was a good buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely good for work, but I haven&#x27;t tested it for sport.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely good for work, but I haven&#x27;t tested it for sport.</li>
            <li>this is real, clean excellent scent everyone would love.</li>
            <li>EVERY MAN SHOULD OWN THIS........... SMELLS SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>great product and very original.</li>
            <li>I love it.. must have!</li>
            <li>I love this cologne!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I was able to return it to Amazon thankfully!</li>
            <li>and I love the price!</li>
            <li>Love this cologne!</li>
            <li>My wife and I both wear this scent and we both love it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this one !</li>
            <li>I have to say many ladies have commented on how nice a fragrance it is!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very excited!</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect and very easy, the process of buying it, the perfume was exactly what they told.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>This stuff is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>I make my husband wear it after a nice shower before bed.</li>
            <li>The Vetiver from Creed is nice.</li>
            <li>It smells incredible, very masculine and clean and shipping was very quick also great!</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like I hugged a sexy man and his cologne</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t like a very strong scent - it&#x27;s good for me because I don&#x27;t have to pay $300 for original product.</li>
            <li>however the scent is that impressive there are a lot of colonges on the martket, great smelling at lower prices with a little better staying power</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li>They aaaaaaaaall love the way it smells on my body, and I have to say it has done wonders for winning any argument or for enhancing the make up part in break ups to make ups :)</li>
            <li>Creed for Men is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>Better price  with Amazon than Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li>you have to make sure you are getting what you expect.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this smell.</li>
            <li>and I love to wear this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i bought this and verified for myself.</li>
            <li>The only thing impressive about this fragrance may be its price.  </li>
            <li>I love this cologne  </li>
            <li>When I received it in the mail, the envelop and card enclosure smelled incredibly sexy; I was amazed.</li>
            <li>You may find it smells better on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I called and verified myself... :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon: Is the seller authentic?</li>
            <li>Outstanding was going to give it to my honey</li>
            <li>this is easily top 10.</li>
            <li>My husband just love this Creed for Men.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered this for him</li>
            <li>Women seem to love it, but they don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li>Okay I knew this may be a bit off</li>
            <li>It is definitely authentic.</li>
            <li>I know this is the real cologne smells great and is the correct size.</li>
            <li>Still one of my top 10 of all time.</li>
            <li>Again we love the scent, but for the price Creed should make a product that you don&#x27;t have to re-up on.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite from Creed, but one I like to use from time to time</li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent and wanted to give it to my husband.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;s a counterfeit as others have said given the classy sealed packaging and beautifully printed enclosed product folders.  </li>
            <li>Given how strong it is up close, I might not suggest it for sport since that&#x27;ll just make it project with much more strength than it already has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given how strong it is up close, I might not suggest it for sport since that&#x27;ll just make it project with much more strength than it already has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He loved it so much, I got him 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li>a great rich classic fragrance that doesn&#x27;t broadcast your presence.</li>
            <li>Now, a lot of the Creed colognes were originally released 50 years ago or more.  </li>
            <li>If you want to be safe -- continue purchasing it from your original source.</li>
            <li>compared to my original bottle it looks almost identical but the top and the crown logo.</li>
            <li>This is so strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice at first but does not wear well</li>
            <li>EXACTLY THE SAME, WAYYY BETTER PRICE!!!</li>
            <li>Lovely when freshly applied but disappears into nothing.  </li>
            <li>Fruit melon sea salty light airy ocean breezy is what I get</li>
            <li>In any case, my guidance still applies and is still relevant for all stock carried by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Lots of sea salt and ocean scents smells very fresh lasts 12+ hours.  </li>
            <li>This particular scent by Creed is AMAZING and is also Unisex.</li>
            <li>worth the $ you will smell like citrus spanking clean!</li>
            <li>My one and only true Love!!</li>
            <li>The perfume doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one and the box doesn&#x27;t look original.</li>
            <li>i thought i was paying for an AUTHENTIC creed not a fake the box i got</li>
            <li>Millesime Imperial is unique, and people will always ask &amp;</li>
            <li>I Fell in love with creed cologne when I first received one as a gift from nordstrom.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see as original</li>
            <li>This specific scent is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
            <li>and like I said it&#x27;s so powerful strong</li>
            <li>it will last me a bit because i dont plan to use it all the time not at this price so its good for those special nights</li>
            <li>I love the Millesime Imperial cologne by Creed, and the seller was very prompt in delivery.  </li>
            <li>Of all the Creed fragrances this one lasts the least amount of time and is arguably the best smelling.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the original!</li>
            <li>I guess I got lucky getting</li>
            <li>The scent lasts longer on me when I use the eau de parfum rather than the cologne, which wears off quickly on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of thing that&#x27;s faked very often, so if you buy, buy straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of thing that&#x27;s faked very often, so if you buy, buy straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li>One of the sexiest scents I&#x27;ve come across, but, strangely enough, it smells better on the envelop it came in than it does on my skin!</li>
            <li>May be Amazon&#x27;s management is changing and like so many other companies Good customer service will no longer be their main focus.</li>
            <li>Plus the smell did smack me in the fast like the genuine creed cologne.</li>
            <li>The scent does not last but is amazing.</li>
            <li>The Millesime Imperial smells a bit like the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; or \\&quot;sport\\&quot; fragrances that were particularly popular several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I get WAY more compliments with cheap stuff like Chrome (lasts all day) and the relatively cheaper L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Orange Verte (lasts 4 hours).  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny .</li>
            <li>Retails at $330 well worth $150, would not pay $330 though.  </li>
            <li>my favorite so far</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Specifically, I compared a sampler prepared by the department store from a fresh bottle to the scent I bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Price right</li>
            <li>had it before when the bottle was fully golden , still a great product , natural oils stays for a long time , you get alot for the price , its almost cost 3 times as much in neiman marcus</li>
            <li>Was nervous at first about ordering and it wouldn&#x27;t be the right one</li>
            <li>I love this scent but this bottle must be old or something because there is no smell no matter how much I put on.  </li>
            <li>but it doesnt last all day a few hours maybe 3 or 4 at best but for me</li>
            <li>I have bought this at a major department store for much more money and the scent lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was, IMO, better than the recent sample I got from Nieman Marcus.</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this!</li>
            <li>My husband and I first purchased this in downtown Seattle.</li>
            <li>This item looks authentic but has a very short staying life.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve bought through amazon.</li>
            <li>I still remember the first time I smelled this.  </li>
            <li>Hit Basenotes if you want the breakdown of what&#x27;s in it, but from a distance and at the initial spray, this will smell like a more day-ready, watery scent.</li>
            <li>Hit Basenotes if you want the breakdown of what&#x27;s in it, but from a distance and at the initial spray, this will smell like a more day-ready, watery scent.</li>
            <li>i guess i bought the sample first</li>
            <li>so i was aware of its shortcomings [its lack of staying power]</li>
            <li>The store was speedy in the delivery and it was exactly what I had looked at in Nordstrom.</li>
            <li>Looks real and smells real, but the spray part sprays a clump and not a mist and then broke really quickly.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that you&#x27;ll find another option that is not only more distinctive and personal, but also somewhat cheaper and of equal or superior quality.</li>
            <li>Best fragrance by the creed&#x27;s dynasty,also try the creed aventus,amazon price  is reasonable for the ordinary citizen,I actually both a creed from neiman Marcos for $315.00 + tax</li>
            <li>My wife and I love this product and as long as the price stays affordable, we will continue to purchase this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>WHAT CA I SAY, ITS MY FAVORITE SCENT FROM A LONG TIME AGO, WATERMELON NOTE IS VERY DISTINTIVE  </li>
            <li>, if you spray this thing to any part a human might smell up close, it&#x27;ll be too strong.</li>
            <li>, if you spray this thing to any part a human might smell up close, it&#x27;ll be too strong.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing on my fiance but since it is a unisex fragrance, i spray it a little on myself.</li>
            <li>no where on my real creeds does it say that</li>
            <li>and i have the real deal and compared it.....</li>
            <li>I can say, yes this is real deal.</li>
            <li>That one is much stronger.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 100% legit &amp; straight from creed boutique</li>
            <li>The real deal, not your mainstream scent...</li>
            <li>This is genuine Creed and I have purchased this on Amazon several times.  </li>
            <li>It is too much money for that compromise.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast as well.</li>
            <li>, however this product is fake, it lacks many things starting from the box to the bottle when compared to the original which I own and purchased from Creed Boutique.</li>
            <li>Whereas those other scents tend to irritate the nose and have kind of an \\&quot;old man\\</li>
            <li>I would imagine that it just so happens to smell much better (to me) on clothes or anything other than skin.</li>
            <li>Also, the original color of the actual cologne is darker then</li>
            <li>already!&lt;br /&gt;Should definitely be part of your collection, a true classic!</li>
            <li>Very nice, masculine, rich,kinda subtle.</li>
            <li>Given that the Amazon bottle also lasted longer for the same applied amount (well, as best as I could do it), this would suggest that Creed may have cut costs between when the Amazon batch was produced and the most recent department store batch (switching from etching to printing, potentially switching from a longer lasting formulation to one which seems not to last as long).</li>
            <li>currently has a place in my personal top three scents.</li>
            <li>currently has a place in my personal top three scents.</li>
            <li>I definitely would not reccomend you buying this product at amazon, you better spend a little more dollars and buy it at an authorized seller store such as nordstrom or neiman marcus, or at Creed Boutique itself.</li>
            <li>I think all Creed products are of high quality.</li>
            <li>But when you compare it to other colognes available today the lustre really wears off.  </li>
            <li>but this scent has a little something special the wife loves it as well so for me its worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d strongly encourage you to go to the Neiman Marcus counter and smell it alongside other quality fragrances.  </li>
            <li>With one full spray, and it&#x27;s a long spray too, this scent will project.</li>
            <li>With one full spray, and it&#x27;s a long spray too, this scent will project.</li>
            <li>It smells really strong for 30 minutes then dies down to boredom.  </li>
            <li>The box is different and has misspellings that I found outside and inside of it, no certificate of creed aso, material feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind all creed colognes have a unique scent and on bottle won&#x27;t necessarily smell like the next</li>
            <li>After trying many other colognes I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>This is normally important because it implies that the batch has previously been shelved for a while and hadn&#x27;t sold, which may hint at the possibility of spoilage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful bottle but too expensive just to sit on a shelf like it has here at our house for the last decade .</li>
            <li>The first I have tried is [[ASIN:B000KMDQX6 Creed Green Irish Tweed By Creed Eau-de-toilette Spray for Men, 4-Fluid Ounce]], and at this point, I cannot tell which is my favorite, but I would definitely recommend Green Irish Tweed; it&#x27;s one of the scents I get the most compliments</li>
            <li>It has many layers and is hard to define.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a direct quote from a lady friend (or shall I say lady FRIENDS)</li>
            <li>Longevity is weak on this one, it only lasts around 1 hour, smell is almost equal however you can smell more citrus on the original.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son as an early Birthday gift...</li>
            <li>He says random people stop him just to let him know how good he smells.</li>
            <li>THIS style is the most common and generally the one associated with the name.</li>
            <li>The smell is citrus with a little sweet to it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing that really distinguishes these fragrances in general (and Millesime Imperial in particular) from dozens of other designer fragrances from Polo or Armani or whatever.    </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and the scent is exactly the same as when I first purchased it from the store a few years ago...</li>
            <li>This bottle has the bright, melon notes that everyone is crazy about.</li>
            <li>(i.e. Old Spice, English Leather, etc)</li>
            <li>I wear this fragrance constantly and have been wearing it for a while; it never gets old.</li>
            <li>We read the reviews and new it wasn&#x27;t going to be a long lasting scent, but being Creed fans we purchased it anyway.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle but unique.  </li>
            <li>When comparing the original to this one they seem the same, however the bottle caps are slightly different and even do not match and do not fit to each other bottle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s definitely good for work, but I haven&#x27;t tested it for sport.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely good for work, but I haven&#x27;t tested it for sport.</li>
            <li> this is real, clean excellent scent everyone would love.</li>
            <li> EVERY MAN SHOULD OWN THIS........... SMELLS SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> great product and very original.</li>
            <li> I love it.. must have!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I was able to return it to Amazon thankfully!</li>
            <li> and I love the price!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne!</li>
            <li> My wife and I both wear this scent and we both love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this one !</li>
            <li> I have to say many ladies have commented on how nice a fragrance it is!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very excited!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect and very easy, the process of buying it, the perfume was exactly what they told.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> I make my husband wear it after a nice shower before bed.</li>
            <li> The Vetiver from Creed is nice.</li>
            <li> It smells incredible, very masculine and clean and shipping was very quick also great!</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like I hugged a sexy man and his cologne</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t like a very strong scent - it&#x27;s good for me because I don&#x27;t have to pay $300 for original product.</li>
            <li> however the scent is that impressive there are a lot of colonges on the martket, great smelling at lower prices with a little better staying power</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li> They aaaaaaaaall love the way it smells on my body, and I have to say it has done wonders for winning any argument or for enhancing the make up part in break ups to make ups :)</li>
            <li> Creed for Men is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> Better price  with Amazon than Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li> you have to make sure you are getting what you expect.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this smell.</li>
            <li> and I love to wear this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i bought this and verified for myself.</li>
            <li> The only thing impressive about this fragrance may be its price.  </li>
            <li> I love this cologne  </li>
            <li> When I received it in the mail, the envelop and card enclosure smelled incredibly sexy; I was amazed.</li>
            <li> You may find it smells better on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I called and verified myself... :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon: Is the seller authentic?</li>
            <li> Outstanding was going to give it to my honey</li>
            <li> this is easily top 10.</li>
            <li> My husband just love this Creed for Men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered this for him</li>
            <li> Women seem to love it, but they don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> Okay I knew this may be a bit off</li>
            <li> It is definitely authentic.</li>
            <li> I know this is the real cologne smells great and is the correct size.</li>
            <li> Still one of my top 10 of all time.</li>
            <li> Again we love the scent, but for the price Creed should make a product that you don&#x27;t have to re-up on.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite from Creed, but one I like to use from time to time</li>
            <li> its ok</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent and wanted to give it to my husband.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;s a counterfeit as others have said given the classy sealed packaging and beautifully printed enclosed product folders.  </li>
            <li> Given how strong it is up close, I might not suggest it for sport since that&#x27;ll just make it project with much more strength than it already has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given how strong it is up close, I might not suggest it for sport since that&#x27;ll just make it project with much more strength than it already has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He loved it so much, I got him 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li> a great rich classic fragrance that doesn&#x27;t broadcast your presence.</li>
            <li> Now, a lot of the Creed colognes were originally released 50 years ago or more.  </li>
            <li> If you want to be safe -- continue purchasing it from your original source.</li>
            <li> compared to my original bottle it looks almost identical but the top and the crown logo.</li>
            <li> This is so strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice at first but does not wear well</li>
            <li> EXACTLY THE SAME, WAYYY BETTER PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> Lovely when freshly applied but disappears into nothing.  </li>
            <li> Fruit melon sea salty light airy ocean breezy is what I get</li>
            <li> In any case, my guidance still applies and is still relevant for all stock carried by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lots of sea salt and ocean scents smells very fresh lasts 12+ hours.  </li>
            <li> This particular scent by Creed is AMAZING and is also Unisex.</li>
            <li> worth the $ you will smell like citrus spanking clean!</li>
            <li> My one and only true Love!!</li>
            <li> The perfume doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one and the box doesn&#x27;t look original.</li>
            <li> i thought i was paying for an AUTHENTIC creed not a fake the box i got</li>
            <li> Millesime Imperial is unique, and people will always ask &amp;</li>
            <li> I Fell in love with creed cologne when I first received one as a gift from nordstrom.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see as original</li>
            <li> This specific scent is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
            <li> and like I said it&#x27;s so powerful strong</li>
            <li> it will last me a bit because i dont plan to use it all the time not at this price so its good for those special nights</li>
            <li> I love the Millesime Imperial cologne by Creed, and the seller was very prompt in delivery.  </li>
            <li> Of all the Creed fragrances this one lasts the least amount of time and is arguably the best smelling.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the original!</li>
            <li> I guess I got lucky getting</li>
            <li> The scent lasts longer on me when I use the eau de parfum rather than the cologne, which wears off quickly on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of thing that&#x27;s faked very often, so if you buy, buy straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of thing that&#x27;s faked very often, so if you buy, buy straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li> One of the sexiest scents I&#x27;ve come across, but, strangely enough, it smells better on the envelop it came in than it does on my skin!</li>
            <li> May be Amazon&#x27;s management is changing and like so many other companies Good customer service will no longer be their main focus.</li>
            <li> Plus the smell did smack me in the fast like the genuine creed cologne.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last but is amazing.</li>
            <li> The Millesime Imperial smells a bit like the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; or \\&quot;sport\\&quot; fragrances that were particularly popular several years ago.  </li>
            <li> I get WAY more compliments with cheap stuff like Chrome (lasts all day) and the relatively cheaper L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Orange Verte (lasts 4 hours).  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny .</li>
            <li> Retails at $330 well worth $150, would not pay $330 though.  </li>
            <li> my favorite so far</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Specifically, I compared a sampler prepared by the department store from a fresh bottle to the scent I bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Price right</li>
            <li> had it before when the bottle was fully golden , still a great product , natural oils stays for a long time , you get alot for the price , its almost cost 3 times as much in neiman marcus</li>
            <li> Was nervous at first about ordering and it wouldn&#x27;t be the right one</li>
            <li> I love this scent but this bottle must be old or something because there is no smell no matter how much I put on.  </li>
            <li> but it doesnt last all day a few hours maybe 3 or 4 at best but for me</li>
            <li> I have bought this at a major department store for much more money and the scent lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> In fact, it was, IMO, better than the recent sample I got from Nieman Marcus.</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this!</li>
            <li> My husband and I first purchased this in downtown Seattle.</li>
            <li> This item looks authentic but has a very short staying life.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is the first I&#x27;ve bought through amazon.</li>
            <li> I still remember the first time I smelled this.  </li>
            <li> Hit Basenotes if you want the breakdown of what&#x27;s in it, but from a distance and at the initial spray, this will smell like a more day-ready, watery scent.</li>

            <li> i guess i bought the sample first</li>
            <li> so i was aware of its shortcomings [its lack of staying power]</li>
            <li> The store was speedy in the delivery and it was exactly what I had looked at in Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> Looks real and smells real, but the spray part sprays a clump and not a mist and then broke really quickly.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that you&#x27;ll find another option that is not only more distinctive and personal, but also somewhat cheaper and of equal or superior quality.</li>
            <li> Best fragrance by the creed&#x27;s dynasty,also try the creed aventus,amazon price  is reasonable for the ordinary citizen,I actually both a creed from neiman Marcos for $315.00 + tax</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this product and as long as the price stays affordable, we will continue to purchase this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> WHAT CA I SAY, ITS MY FAVORITE SCENT FROM A LONG TIME AGO, WATERMELON NOTE IS VERY DISTINTIVE  </li>
            <li> , if you spray this thing to any part a human might smell up close, it&#x27;ll be too strong.</li>
            <li> , if you spray this thing to any part a human might smell up close, it&#x27;ll be too strong.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing on my fiance but since it is a unisex fragrance, i spray it a little on myself.</li>
            <li> no where on my real creeds does it say that</li>
            <li> and i have the real deal and compared it.....</li>
            <li> I can say, yes this is real deal.</li>
            <li> That one is much stronger.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 100% legit &amp; straight from creed boutique</li>
            <li> The real deal, not your mainstream scent...</li>
            <li> This is genuine Creed and I have purchased this on Amazon several times.  </li>
            <li> It is too much money for that compromise.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast as well.</li>
            <li> , however this product is fake, it lacks many things starting from the box to the bottle when compared to the original which I own and purchased from Creed Boutique.</li>
            <li> Whereas those other scents tend to irritate the nose and have kind of an \\&quot;old man\\</li>
            <li> I would imagine that it just so happens to smell much better (to me) on clothes or anything other than skin.</li>
            <li> Also, the original color of the actual cologne is darker then</li>
            <li> already!&lt;br /&gt;Should definitely be part of your collection, a true classic!</li>
            <li> Very nice, masculine, rich,kinda subtle.</li>
            <li> Given that the Amazon bottle also lasted longer for the same applied amount (well, as best as I could do it), this would suggest that Creed may have cut costs between when the Amazon batch was produced and the most recent department store batch (switching from etching to printing, potentially switching from a longer lasting formulation to one which seems not to last as long).</li>
            <li> currently has a place in my personal top three scents.</li>
            <li> currently has a place in my personal top three scents.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not reccomend you buying this product at amazon, you better spend a little more dollars and buy it at an authorized seller store such as nordstrom or neiman marcus, or at Creed Boutique itself.</li>
            <li> I think all Creed products are of high quality.</li>
            <li> But when you compare it to other colognes available today the lustre really wears off.  </li>
            <li> but this scent has a little something special the wife loves it as well so for me its worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d strongly encourage you to go to the Neiman Marcus counter and smell it alongside other quality fragrances.  </li>
            <li> With one full spray, and it&#x27;s a long spray too, this scent will project.</li>
            <li> With one full spray, and it&#x27;s a long spray too, this scent will project.</li>
            <li> It smells really strong for 30 minutes then dies down to boredom.  </li>
            <li> The box is different and has misspellings that I found outside and inside of it, no certificate of creed aso, material feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind all creed colognes have a unique scent and on bottle won&#x27;t necessarily smell like the next</li>
            <li> After trying many other colognes I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> This is normally important because it implies that the batch has previously been shelved for a while and hadn&#x27;t sold, which may hint at the possibility of spoilage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful bottle but too expensive just to sit on a shelf like it has here at our house for the last decade .</li>
            <li> The first I have tried is [[ASIN:B000KMDQX6 Creed Green Irish Tweed By Creed Eau-de-toilette Spray for Men, 4-Fluid Ounce]], and at this point, I cannot tell which is my favorite, but I would definitely recommend Green Irish Tweed; it&#x27;s one of the scents I get the most compliments</li>
            <li> It has many layers and is hard to define.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a direct quote from a lady friend (or shall I say lady FRIENDS)</li>
            <li> Longevity is weak on this one, it only lasts around 1 hour, smell is almost equal however you can smell more citrus on the original.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son as an early Birthday gift...</li>
            <li> He says random people stop him just to let him know how good he smells.</li>
            <li> THIS style is the most common and generally the one associated with the name.</li>
            <li> The smell is citrus with a little sweet to it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing that really distinguishes these fragrances in general (and Millesime Imperial in particular) from dozens of other designer fragrances from Polo or Armani or whatever.    </li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and the scent is exactly the same as when I first purchased it from the store a few years ago...</li>
            <li> This bottle has the bright, melon notes that everyone is crazy about.</li>
            <li> (i.e. Old Spice, English Leather, etc)</li>
            <li> I wear this fragrance constantly and have been wearing it for a while; it never gets old.</li>
            <li> We read the reviews and new it wasn&#x27;t going to be a long lasting scent, but being Creed fans we purchased it anyway.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle but unique.  </li>
            <li> When comparing the original to this one they seem the same, however the bottle caps are slightly different and even do not match and do not fit to each other bottle.</li>
            <li> seller, who apparently is Creed themselves, shipped me a product that is different from all the other M.I. bottles I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Despite others saying it doesn&#x27;t last, I find it lingers long after the dry-down, very restrained and subtle.</li>
            <li> I have other comments later, I will add them here.</li>
            <li> It is the only fragrance I wear all year round for the last 6 years!!!</li>
            <li> This bottle as well as all of Amazon&#x27;s batch sold through the last few months came from the Middle East judging from the Arabic insert in the Amazon bottle.</li>
            <li> This cologne looks and smells different from the previous ones I&#x27;ve purchase  at the department store.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and did as much research online as humanly possible.</li>
            <li> My wife likes to leave early from work lately</li>
            <li> and they were not very helpful in taking care of it and told us that we should contact the manufacturer directly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> there really is no comparison.  </li>
            <li> It is on the expensive side, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Today, I was told that it is not available, but offer me 2.5 oz cologne with the same price as 4.0 oz.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical in the beginning due to the cheap price</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical as it is sold for a significant lower price than in the department stores here.</li>
            <li> Makes my other colognes seem kinda cheap and artificial in comparison.</li>
            <li> And if you compare them with the other colognes that came out around then</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find any reason to prefer it over other colognes I have.    </li>
            <li> My Creed bottle was everything I expected it to be!</li>
            <li> Would buy other Creed products from this merchant.</li>
            <li> When I seen the price I was very skeptical but believed that it had to be genuine because it&#x27;s on Amazon.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not backed by any facts other than what I saw when comparing what I received to one provided by an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not backed by any facts other than what I saw when comparing what I received to one provided by an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> Legitimate cologne was a little skeptical at first but read the review and went for it</li>
            <li> Upon receiving, I bought the same size from a nameless major department store to compare.</li>
            <li> This is why I bought another bottle from a nameless major department store, which leads me to my next point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got both MI and VIW for less than one bottle at NM or creed boutique.</li>
            <li> It is expensive compared to other colognes, but I find the fragrance classy and understated.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels worse than waking up each day and potentially using a knock off cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne off of Amazon because it is never available in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few bottles of Creed.</li>
            <li> Either these are overstock old batches being sold or they are fake.</li>
            <li> I purchased from a nameless major department store in the DC area and compared the two.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are Amazon Prime members and this was the first time Amazon disappointed us.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this from a department store and never have this problem.  </li>
            <li> Total fake</li>
            <li> Therefore, the smell test could be entirely and utterly wrong.</li>
            <li> Therefore, the smell test could be entirely and utterly wrong.</li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted longer on my skin - hardly noticeable after 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> It smells common.  </li>
            <li> Everyone stops me to ask what I&#x27;m wearing, at least 3-4 people per day.</li>
            <li> The Amazon bottle had an etched lot number on the bottom of the bottle, whereas the department store bottle was printed with a dot matrix printer on the back of the base.</li>
            <li> severas hours bad product do not buy this no original</li>
            <li> We are afraid to touch it least</li>
            <li> Definitely it is a fake.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s about 4 times as expensive as it should be.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Definitely FAKE, bought it from amazon because I thought it is a trustworthy seller</li>
            <li> I have saved thousands of dollars over time as any Creed user knows, this is a truly expensive cologne.  </li>
            <li> Why would anyone assume this product by sold by amazon is a fake?</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get bored or run out of the others.</li>
            <li> That said, *this could be entirely wrong.</li>
            <li> Bad the perfume Is no orginal</li>

            <li> My guy loves this scent.....</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Creed for the last 10 years and this time decided to get it from Amazon.  After a month or so this product lost its smell and the bottle smells like spirit.  Definitely it is a fake. Called Amazon and they were not very helpful in taking care of it and told us that we should contact the manufacturer directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are Amazon Prime members and this was the first time Amazon disappointed us. May be Amazon&#x27;s management is changing and like so many other companies Good customer service will no longer be their main focus.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about buying this on Amazon at such a discounted price.  I was skeptical and did as much research online as humanly possible. I took a chance and ordered it &amp;#34;sold by amazon&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived the next day and was 100% the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;. In fact, it was, IMO, better than the recent sample I got from Nieman Marcus. I know there is a lot of talk about batch codes, etc.... This bottle has the bright, melon notes that everyone is crazy about. I guess I got lucky getting a good vintage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date of order: June 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this! I got both MI and VIW for less than one bottle at NM or creed boutique.</li>
            <li> The perfume doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one and the box doesn&#x27;t look original. It can&#x27;t be returned. Dont buy it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is with the Creed colognes.  All of the reviews just about everywhere seem to indicate that they are the best fragrances ever.    That&#x27;s not my experience.  Now, a lot of the Creed colognes were originally released 50 years ago or more.  And if you compare them with the other colognes that came out around then (i.e. Old Spice, English Leather, etc) there really is no comparison.  Whereas those other scents tend to irritate the nose and have kind of an \\&quot;old man\\&quot; smell, Creed smells like a quality cologne.  I imagine it blew people away back then.    But when you compare it to other colognes available today the lustre really wears off.  It smells common.  There&#x27;s nothing that really distinguishes these fragrances in general (and Millesime Imperial in particular) from dozens of other designer fragrances from Polo or Armani or whatever.    The Millesime Imperial smells a bit like the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; or \\&quot;sport\\&quot; fragrances that were particularly popular several years ago.  It&#x27;s nice.  But I never received any compliments about it and I don&#x27;t find any reason to prefer it over other colognes I have.    In my opinion, it&#x27;s about 4 times as expensive as it should be.  I&#x27;d strongly encourage you to go to the Neiman Marcus counter and smell it alongside other quality fragrances.  I have no doubt that you&#x27;ll find another option that is not only more distinctive and personal, but also somewhat cheaper and of equal or superior quality.</li>
            <li> Was nervous at first about ordering and it wouldn&#x27;t be the right one but I&#x27;m very excited! It smells incredible, very masculine and clean and shipping was very quick also great!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a direct quote from a lady friend (or shall I say lady FRIENDS) They aaaaaaaaall love the way it smells on my body, and I have to say it has done wonders for winning any argument or for enhancing the make up part in break ups to make ups :)&lt;br /&gt;You WON&#x27;T be disappointed</li>
            <li> Best fragrance by the creed&#x27;s dynasty,also try the creed aventus,amazon price  is reasonable for the ordinary citizen,I actually both a creed from neiman Marcos for $315.00 + tax</li>
            <li> Creed for Men is one of my favorite colognes. Better price  with Amazon than Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li> I found out CREED has over 40+ fragrances to choose from SO you have to make sure you are getting what you expect. THIS style is the most common and generally the one associated with the name.</li>
            <li> My husband and I first purchased this in downtown Seattle. The smell is citrus with a little sweet to it. I LOVE LOVE this smell. I make my husband wear it after a nice shower before bed. I love it.. must have!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST CREED out there. If you like Creed, this one is their best and liked by most.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is actually marketed as a unisex fragrance.  I am a woman and I love to wear this.  Kind of smells like I hugged a sexy man and his cologne rubbed off on me, but it&#x27;s still feminine enough that it doesn&#x27;t obviously smell like a woman wearing men&#x27;s cologne.  I think it smells like dune grass and salt water and I definitely get the melon notes that I&#x27;ve heard about.  This is a wonderful fragrance for a day at the office as it is light and unobtrusive.  I do wish it lasted a bit longer though.</li>
            <li> FAKE the item i recieved was very different from the picture and very different from the AUTHENTIC creeds i have at home. yes it smells the same but it only last about 30 min VERY disappointed i thought i was paying for an AUTHENTIC creed not a fake the box i got the crown isnt gold like the picture then it says its made with toliet water no where on my real creeds does it say that lol</li>
            <li> Another fragance i chose. Yes was hesitant to buy this one too because i thought maybe it&#x27;s faux. Well i had been buying it in Nordstroms and i have the real deal and compared it..... EXACTLY THE SAME, WAYYY BETTER PRICE!!! I sweated bullets thinking i&#x27;m going to be taken for. I&#x27;m glad i bought this and verified for myself. I can say, yes this is real deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the Creed Boutique to avoid fakes.  Not impressed.  It smells really strong for 30 minutes then dies down to boredom.  I get WAY more compliments with cheap stuff like Chrome (lasts all day) and the relatively cheaper L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Orange Verte (lasts 4 hours).  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> The only thing impressive about this fragrance may be its price.  Lovely when freshly applied but disappears into nothing.  I prefer Bel-Ami, Equipage for winter and Signoricci, Eau de Rochas for Summer.  The Vetiver from Creed is nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent  I love this cologne  I gave it as a gift</li>
            <li> had it before when the bottle was fully golden , still a great product , natural oils stays for a long time , you get alot for the price , its almost cost 3 times as much in neiman marcus</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this cologne for me for Father&#x27;s Day last year and I am hooked.  Creed cologne is unlike anything you&#x27;d find in a department store.  This specific scent is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever worn.  It is on the expensive side, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> was hoping i can exchange it since it is not what i was expecting...</li>
            <li> One of the sexiest scents I&#x27;ve come across, but, strangely enough, it smells better on the envelop it came in than it does on my skin! When I received it in the mail, the envelop and card enclosure smelled incredibly sexy; I was amazed. On my skin, though, it smells different. I would imagine that it just so happens to smell much better (to me) on clothes or anything other than skin. You may find it smells better on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Creed fragrance. The first I have tried is [[ASIN:B000KMDQX6 Creed Green Irish Tweed By Creed Eau-de-toilette Spray for Men, 4-Fluid Ounce]], and at this point, I cannot tell which is my favorite, but I would definitely recommend Green Irish Tweed; it&#x27;s one of the scents I get the most compliments on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it smells on my skin, I have doubt as to whether I&#x27;d buy a larger size, but if I can wear it on my clothes with it smelling as it does on the card, I would definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have other comments later, I will add them here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never met a cologne quite like this in my life... This cologne got me women at the night club!!! Thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li> this is the best cologne... it can also be  unisex...  it is my go to mans gift... and i have never had anyone not like it... the best.</li>
            <li> I received what was advertised. My Creed bottle was everything I expected it to be! I love this cologne! Awesome!</li>
            <li> What can I say about this cologne that has not already been said? This is an awesome summer/hot weather scent. That watermelon and salt note are to die for and I do not have longevity issues with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will take off one star however as this is not as fresh/new as batch-wise as a sample I have. That one is much stronger.</li>
            <li> If you order purchase from amazon.com LLC it&#x27;s 100% legit &amp; straight from creed boutique I called and verified myself... :)</li>
            <li> EVERY MAN SHOULD OWN THIS........... SMELLS SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> Bad the perfume Is no orginal i already check the perfum in Saks And Is no orginal it smell different and the smell smell Only for severas hours bad product do not buy this no original</li>
            <li> The real deal, not your mainstream scent... just get it already!&lt;br /&gt;Should definitely be part of your collection, a true classic!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this cologne 2 days ago. Today, I was told that it is not available, but offer me 2.5 oz cologne with the same price as 4.0 oz. I checked it today, it is still saying in stock online. I think that they use this try to get you and sale you something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing Creed for years from Neiman Marcus. Finally, I thought I could save 50% by ordering it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller, who apparently is Creed themselves, shipped me a product that is different from all the other M.I. bottles I have purchased. The text is different colors, the liquid is a different color, and the scent is different. I also ordered the Creed Aventus from this seller, to which I have the same problem. If you want to be safe -- continue purchasing it from your original source. Nothing feels worse than waking up each day and potentially using a knock off cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon: Is the seller authentic?</li>
            <li> I actually it isn&#x27;t same before</li>
            <li> Just like the last bottle. Can&#x27;t get enough. Absolutely the original!</li>
            <li> This cologne looks and smells different from the previous ones I&#x27;ve purchase  at the department store. I did not purchased again!!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding was going to give it to my honey smelled so good I wear it myself.</li>
            <li> Definitely FAKE, bought it from amazon because I thought it is a trustworthy seller, however this product is fake, it lacks many things starting from the box to the bottle when compared to the original which I own and purchased from Creed Boutique. I am dissapointed by amazon on this purchase. When comparing the original to this one they seem the same, however the bottle caps are slightly different and even do not match and do not fit to each other bottle. The box is different and has misspellings that I found outside and inside of it, no certificate of creed aso, material feels cheap. Longevity is weak on this one, it only lasts around 1 hour, smell is almost equal however you can smell more citrus on the original. I definitely would not reccomend you buying this product at amazon, you better spend a little more dollars and buy it at an authorized seller store such as nordstrom or neiman marcus, or at Creed Boutique itself.</li>
            <li> a great rich classic fragrance that doesn&#x27;t broadcast your presence. Despite others saying it doesn&#x27;t last, I find it lingers long after the dry-down, very restrained and subtle. Can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;s a counterfeit as others have said given the classy sealed packaging and beautifully printed enclosed product folders.  Would buy other Creed products from this merchant.</li>
            <li> I love this! I wear this fragrance constantly and have been wearing it for a while; it never gets old. It reminds me of oranges and marine freshness and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing. Every time I wear it I get a compliment. Longevity and projection are great too.</li>
            <li> Creed is the best ! My ex turned me on to this ! Great scent . You&#x27;ll never buy another scent again unless you try Creed Irish Tweed . Worth every penny . A couple of sprits and your good to go all day and night !</li>
            <li> This is genuine Creed and I have purchased this on Amazon several times.  I have saved thousands of dollars over time as any Creed user knows, this is a truly expensive cologne.  My wife and I love this product and as long as the price stays affordable, we will continue to purchase this on Amazon.  This particular scent by Creed is AMAZING and is also Unisex.</li>
            <li> This item looks authentic but has a very short staying life. It also irritated my skin.  I was able to return it to Amazon thankfully!</li>
            <li> I love this scent but this bottle must be old or something because there is no smell no matter how much I put on.  I usually buy this from a department store and never have this problem.  I bought it on Amazon because of the cheaper price but I wish I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> All I can say is hmmmmmm</li>
            <li> This is the work of a master perfumer. It has many layers and is hard to define. I just know that I need to have a bottle at all times on my vanity. The scent lasts longer on me when I use the eau de parfum rather than the cologne, which wears off quickly on my skin. I think all Creed products are of high quality. Millesime Imperial is unique, and people will always ask &amp;#34;What is that you&#x27;re wearing? It&#x27;s fabulous.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Total fake, I purchased it for my husband&#x27;s birthday and I sprayed it on himself and I could not smell the scent. Then I tried it, I sprayed some in my arm and it began to burn my skin. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne off of Amazon because it is never available in stores. Amazon had this $40 cheaper than the Creed website. It smells amazing on my fiance but since it is a unisex fragrance, i spray it a little on myself.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> Smells great, smells like the sea.  Lots of sea salt and ocean scents smells very fresh lasts 12+ hours.  Retails at $330 well worth $150, would not pay $330 though.  Buy from a good seller and should not have a problem.  I have over 40 colognes in my current selection this is easily top 10.</li>
            <li> great product and very original.</li>
            <li> worth the $ you will smell like citrus spanking clean!</li>
            <li> My husband just love this Creed for Men. I&#x27;m glad I ordered this for him it was the best choice ever.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son as an early Birthday gift...he loves it and I love the price!</li>
            <li> Very nice, masculine, rich,kinda subtle. Women seem to love it, but they don&#x27;t know why. Makes my other colognes seem kinda cheap and artificial in comparison. I can&#x27;t smell it on myself after 30 minutes or so, but everyone else can for hours....my favorite so far</li>
            <li> Got this as a holiday gift. I am a big fan of the house of creed but this cologne just doesnt last. 3 spritzes and an hour later it&#x27;s almost as if you didnt spray it.</li>
            <li> I Fell in love with creed cologne when I first received one as a gift from nordstrom. When I seen the price I was very skeptical but believed that it had to be genuine because it&#x27;s on Amazon. Man was I wrong!!!...compared to my original bottle it looks almost identical but the top and the crown logo. Plus the smell did smack me in the fast like the genuine creed cologne. I lost out but I figure I write a review and warn others before they get suckered into a scam. Also, the original color of the actual cologne is darker then the one in this bottle...DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> FAKE!!! counterfeit/overseas knock off or expired by several years.  Do Not Buy</li>
            <li> I have bought this at a major department store for much more money and the scent lasted much longer. Okay I knew this may be a bit off but I did not think it&#x27;s lasting power would be so short. I regret spending $150. It is too much money for that compromise.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see as original</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few bottles of Creed. This is the first I&#x27;ve bought through amazon. Saved a lot on it. It is definitely authentic.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone assume this product by sold by amazon is a fake? I have used this product for several years and the scent is exactly the same as when I first purchased it from the store a few years ago... Guys this is real, clean excellent scent everyone would love.</li>
            <li> Best scent in the world!  Everyone stops me to ask what I&#x27;m wearing, at least 3-4 people per day. Must have!!!</li>
            <li> I have not had one comment on it and it only lasts a very short while when sprayed on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the Millesime Imperial cologne by Creed, and the seller was very prompt in delivery.  It is expensive compared to other colognes, but I find the fragrance classy and understated.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect and very easy, the process of buying it, the perfume was exactly what they told.&lt;br /&gt;And it was shipped the same day that i bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Very good experience!</li>
            <li> My one and only true Love!! Price right and with that I can buy 2 for the price of one!!!!!!! It is the only fragrance I wear all year round for the last 6 years!!!</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t like a very strong scent - it&#x27;s good for me because I don&#x27;t have to pay $300 for original product.</li>
            <li> This is so strong. It will grab people&#x27;s attention. I suppose a king could get away with  walking  around in a cloud of this , if he could breathe  ..It&#x27;s nice at first but does not wear well and you need to use it because within 3 or 4 months it literally starts to reek.  It&#x27;s a beautiful bottle but too expensive just to sit on a shelf like it has here at our house for the last decade . We are afraid to touch it least it get on us it and like I said it&#x27;s so powerful strong it will drive  you out of the house.</li>
            <li> My Mother will not let my Father wear anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> WHAT CA I SAY, ITS MY FAVORITE SCENT FROM A LONG TIME AGO, WATERMELON NOTE IS VERY DISTINTIVE  FOR THIS CREED</li>
            <li> Legitimate cologne was a little skeptical at first but read the review and went for it and it was a great buy!! Saved $200</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! I know this is the real cologne smells great and is the correct size. Keep in mind all creed colognes have a unique scent and on bottle won&#x27;t necessarily smell like the next and it might smell different on someone else. My wife and I both wear this scent and we both love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful customer service and experience by amazon and amazing fragrance by creed. Fruit melon sea salty light airy ocean breezy is what I get and I get compliments on these notes. I just wish it lasted longer on my skin - hardly noticeable after 3-4 hours. Still one of my top 10 of all time.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my Dad, whom I think is a King of sorts. He loved it so much, I got him 4 more bottles. It is now his staple perfume. He says random people stop him just to let him know how good he smells.</li>
            <li> I still remember the first time I smelled this.  It is worth every penny. The only word to describe it is irresistible.</li>
            <li> Looks real and smells real, but the spray part sprays a clump and not a mist and then broke really quickly.</li>
            <li> This was a good buy. I was a little skeptical in the beginning due to the cheap price but when I got it it&#x27;s smelled like it should. The shipping was really fast as well.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent. We read the reviews and new it wasn&#x27;t going to be a long lasting scent, but being Creed fans we purchased it anyway. Again we love the scent, but for the price Creed should make a product that you don&#x27;t have to re-up on. Plus men don&#x27;t re-up. Females carry their perfumes with them. Next time we&#x27;ll listen to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this one !</li>
            <li> After trying many other colognes I always come back to this one. I have to say many ladies have commented on how nice a fragrance it is!</li>
            <li> I personally thought it was a lot for a cologne but it&#x27;s what he asked for.  The smell is subtle but unique.  The cologne came on time &amp; was packaged well (I&#x27;ve had some bottles/boxes look banged up)</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance. Not my favorite from Creed, but one I like to use from time to time so I don&#x27;t get bored or run out of the others.</li>
            <li> Note: my review is for the Amazon listing for ASIN # B00152S1CQ, whereas this one is ASIN B00152S1IK. The distinguishing factor between the two is that the IK variant is labeled &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; on Amazon, though I believe all of these are Unisex. In any case, my guidance still applies and is still relevant for all stock carried by Amazon. Here it goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AUTHENTICITY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this from Amazon after keeping an eye on the price. Upon receiving, I bought the same size from a nameless major department store to compare. My notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This bottle as well as all of Amazon&#x27;s batch sold through the last few months came from the Middle East judging from the Arabic insert in the Amazon bottle. This is normally important because it implies that the batch has previously been shelved for a while and hadn&#x27;t sold, which may hint at the possibility of spoilage. This is why I bought another bottle from a nameless major department store, which leads me to my next point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The scents are identical, but the Amazon one seemed to last longer. I purchased from a nameless major department store in the DC area and compared the two. Specifically, I compared a sampler prepared by the department store from a fresh bottle to the scent I bought from Amazon. I have a theory as to why the Amazon one lasted longer, which gets to my last point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The Amazon bottle had an etched lot number on the bottom of the bottle, whereas the department store bottle was printed with a dot matrix printer on the back of the base. Given that the Amazon bottle also lasted longer for the same applied amount (well, as best as I could do it), this would suggest that Creed may have cut costs between when the Amazon batch was produced and the most recent department store batch (switching from etching to printing, potentially switching from a longer lasting formulation to one which seems not to last as long). That said, *this could be entirely wrong.* It&#x27;s just my subjective analysis. That said, the actual bottles as well as the boxes were entirely identical aside from the method used for labeling the lot number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveats in my review: I compared a prepared sampler to an actual bottle. I never compared the scent of the department store bottle to the Amazon bottle; I only compared the bottles and packages visually. Therefore, the smell test could be entirely and utterly wrong. Still, this is my impression given that the sampler was produced in front of me. Additionally, these are all just my suspicions. They&#x27;re not backed by any facts other than what I saw when comparing what I received to one provided by an authorized dealer. For all I know, my analysis of etching v. printing is actually backwards. Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve established the credibility of the product, let us review the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, if you spray this thing to any part a human might smell up close, it&#x27;ll be too strong. Wrists and neck, man. Keep it simple. With one full spray, and it&#x27;s a long spray too, this scent will project. Hit Basenotes if you want the breakdown of what&#x27;s in it, but from a distance and at the initial spray, this will smell like a more day-ready, watery scent. It&#x27;s definitely good for work, but I haven&#x27;t tested it for sport. Given how strong it is up close, I might not suggest it for sport since that&#x27;ll just make it project with much more strength than it already has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This currently has a place in my personal top three scents. The others are Acqua di Parma&#x27;s Oud and Viktor&amp;Rolf&#x27;s Spicebomb (to be cliche like everyone else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMAMRY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, 5/5 would buy from Amazon again. Specifically Amazon. Never anyone else. This is the kind of thing that&#x27;s faked very often, so if you buy, buy straight from Amazon. The bottle I received was entirely legitimate.ctive analysis. That said, the actual bottles as well as the boxes were entirely identical aside from the method used for labeling the lot number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveats in my review: I compared a prepared sampler to an actual bottle.

Hit Basenotes if you want the breakdown of what&#x27;s in it, but from a distance and at the initial spray, this will smell like a more day-ready, watery scent. It&#x27;s definitely good for work, but I haven&#x27;t tested it for sport. Given how strong it is up close, I might not suggest it for sport since that&#x27;ll just make it project with much more strength than it already has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This currently has a place in my personal top three scents. The others are Acqua di Parma&#x27;s Oud and Viktor&amp;Rolf&#x27;s Spicebomb (to be cliche like everyone else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMAMRY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, 5/5 would buy from Amazon again. Specifically Amazon. Never anyone else. This is the kind of thing that&#x27;s faked very often, so if you buy, buy straight from Amazon. The bottle I received was entirely legitimate.</li>
            <li> My wife likes to leave early from work lately i wonder why.  buy it</li>
            <li> This cost me $371 at Neiman Marcus. This fragrance is the best and worst of both worlds. The scent does not last but is amazing. Of all the Creed fragrances this one lasts the least amount of time and is arguably the best smelling. I don&#x27;t know how it is possible for the same cologne to be over $200 cheaper on Amazon but it is. Either these are overstock old batches being sold or they are fake. If it is overstock then it&#x27;s a great deal for Creed.</li>
            <li> very good scent but it doesnt last all day a few hours maybe 3 or 4 at best but for me its ok i guess i bought the sample first so i was aware of its shortcomings [its lack of staying power] however the scent is that impressive there are a lot of colonges on the martket, great smelling at lower prices with a little better staying power but this scent has a little something special the wife loves it as well so for me its worth it it will last me a bit because i dont plan to use it all the time not at this price so its good for those special nights dont expect to put it on during the day and expect it last all night not going to happen but maybe out to dinner and the drive home its a very nice smell i dont wish that they made it to last a bit longer ,on that note i wish i could last a bit longer too11 thats my take on it .</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical as it is sold for a significant lower price than in the department stores here. I LOVE the scent and wanted to give it to my husband.  The store was speedy in the delivery and it was exactly what I had looked at in Nordstrom. It is a great deal!</li>
