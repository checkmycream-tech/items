            <li>Love the cleanser and lotion!!</li>
            <li>It has a good control over oil.</li>
            <li>I decided to give Tea Tree Oil a try after hearing good things about it.</li>
            <li>I guess if you are trying to find a skin care regime for oily/acne prone skin, this would be good.</li>

            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>Everyone has a difference tolerance to many types of treatments out there.  </li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it&#x27;s not something to look forward to for sure.</li>
            <li>I did love the oil though.</li>
            <li>It made it break out even more.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, it leaves your skin really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>If you already have good skin and would like to have a product that leaves your skin smooth and clean I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I tried the face wash when traveling with a friend, and was surprisingly impressed with how clean my face felt, even an hour after washing my face, though it didn&#x27;t over dry.  </li>
            <li>Love this, my face has cleared up, and feels so clean.</li>
            <li>And I enjoy the smell of it.</li>
            <li>and I had heard about how fantastic tea tree oil could be for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Those bumps that I know are filled with oil but aren&#x27;t pimples so you can&#x27;t pop, went away.  </li>
            <li>the tea tree oil semi-helped prevent new acne to form but wasn&#x27;t enough for  me to be impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil is good- same result as Burt Bee&#x27;s acne solutions.&lt;br /&gt;Didnt</li>
            <li>I just ordered the new full size kit from beauty.com!!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve used, I seriously wish I found this sooner.</li>
            <li>When ordering I didn&#x27;t see a full run down of what was included, but I was happy with everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne for many years and had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>Not excessive drying of the skin like most.</li>
            <li>Great little set.</li>
            <li>Does amazing on my skin and definitely wakes me up in the morning.</li>
            <li>The straight tea tree oil in particular does more to heal things quickly and resolve what blemishes I DO have than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I actually like all four of the products in this set and plan to order full size bottles of most.</li>
            <li>and I broke out for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>The oil first, then the face wash, toner then lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to the vitamin E line.</li>
            <li>For a while I used the gentle formula of Proactive and that worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>It really sops the oil from your face but leave it dry, still supple but no oil on your face for most of the day</li>
            <li>It REALLY helped with my oily skin...and</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect too much from it...</li>
            <li>Face wash and toner seperated and got really foamy when i tried to mix</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it though.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Those of us with moderate problems are better off using something like tea tree, which is a natural antiseptic that&#x27;s not drying like salicylic acid or peroxide.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a nice product, but I wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell, and I didn&#x27;t see any drastic improvement in my skin after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>My face feels better, less greasy and brighter.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even break out when I was a teenager or later when i was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Exactly the one they sell on the body shop site, also exactly the same price.</li>
            <li>When I normally have at least one that just wants to be it&#x27;s own continent.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Most of the products really dried my skin out.</li>
            <li>and I am always hesitant to try new skin products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m onto a new regimen now.</li>
            <li>for the dermatologist to get things straightened out, and this is the only thing that will really help your acne; going to a professional.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for something to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps zap pimples fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive for the toner tho.</li>
            <li>I have big pores, very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I am not a teenager anymore, so the normal acid based products dry out my skin dramatically, so I am willing to try anything to get my skin to calm down.....</li>
            <li>I have very mild adult acne, usually one to two blemishes per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a miracle product for me, right from first week I began to see the difference, and now I hardly get any breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>When I read the reviews for this skin care kit, I expected it to have a little bit more of a &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>I saw a major difference.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any major pimples...</li>
            <li>The lotion itself didn&#x27;t fit me so well, but that why I bought a small kit to try it out before I buy the bigger one.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil itself really shrunk my acne down after about a week</li>

            <li> The tea tree oil does still dry out the skin some but</li>
            <li> but my skin was SO dry</li>
            <li> , all this did was dry me out.</li>
            <li> I will diffidently get the larger ones next time</li>
            <li> have not had one single pimple since I began using it three 1/2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I know it depends on your body chemistry, but it&#x27;s so much less expensive than other skin care systems that it&#x27;s definitely worth trying out!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several products to fight acne from past several years, But None worked.</li>
            <li> Product is NOT good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The small kit may meet the basic needs of the skin.</li>
            <li> It worked for other people though so you have to try it for yourself to judge the product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this set, but sadly it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It did reduce the redness a little bit but did not help get rid of the acne I already had.</li>
            <li> The formulas have too much alcohol on it, It dried my skin to the point it itched.:-(</li>
            <li> We have hard water in our apartment</li>
            <li> portable but a little expensive</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I stopped my birth control and it was the worst mistake ever because my skin just exploded with Acne especially around my chin area.</li>
            <li> hate this stuff, dry my skin, stung very badly, made my acne even worse.</li>
            <li> the disinfecting quality of the tea tree means I can put a moisturizer with it and still not clog my pores as bad.  </li>
            <li> Bye $20 :(</li>

            <li> We have hard water in our apartment and I broke out for the first time in my life. I didn&#x27;t even break out when I was a teenager or later when i was pregnant. I literally tried every product to get rid of the blemishes. I bought this product and washed my face with distilled water and after about 2 weeks, my blemishes were all but gone! My skin is almost back to normal. I would highly recommend this. I know it depends on your body chemistry, but it&#x27;s so much less expensive than other skin care systems that it&#x27;s definitely worth trying out!!</li>
            <li> just began to use.It has a good control over oil.And I enjoy the smell of it.The small kit may meet the basic needs of the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes to my face yet...that&#x27;s why i only gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li> my wife likes it and it seems to help she says</li>
            <li> portable but a little expensive</li>
            <li> I have very oily, sensitive skin and I am always hesitant to try new skin products.  I tried the face wash when traveling with a friend, and was surprisingly impressed with how clean my face felt, even an hour after washing my face, though it didn&#x27;t over dry.  I actually like all four of the products in this set and plan to order full size bottles of most.</li>

            <li> this is a great skin care product. Not excessive drying of the skin like most. Tea tree oil scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this set, but sadly it wasn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;ve always had acne since puberty, it comes and goes.1-3 days of using this set and I started to get really big pimples on my chin. The kind that&#x27;s painful and red. So nope. Not good. Bye $20 :(</li>
            <li> Love this, my face has cleared up, and feels so clean. I will be purchasing bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> Nice. My face is better now.</li>
            <li> Good way to sample some of the body shop&#x27;s best products.</li>
            <li> My son loves this Tea Tree Skin Care, it has cleared up his skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect to travel with or to stash out of sight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched far and wide for facial products. Nothing has helpful. I decided to give Tea Tree Oil a try after hearing good things about it. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item. In not time, my face has been noticeably oily and my pores are starting to shrink. I plan to buy bigger bottles for future use.</li>
            <li> I have severe acne and this was my last resort before going to the dermatologist...The toner I loved! It REALLY helped with my oily skin...and the tea tree oil semi-helped prevent new acne to form but wasn&#x27;t enough for  me to be impressed. I guess if you are trying to find a skin care regime for oily/acne prone skin, this would be good. But don&#x27;t expect too much from it...I finally made an appt. for the dermatologist to get things straightened out, and this is the only thing that will really help your acne; going to a professional. good luck and God bless.</li>
            <li> If you need a cleansing routine try this! It&#x27;s wonderful! Great for travel too!</li>
            <li> Face wash and toner seperated and got really foamy when i tried to mix it.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is good- same result as Burt Bee&#x27;s acne solutions.&lt;br /&gt;Didnt work as great at i hoped.</li>
            <li> Great little set. When ordering I didn&#x27;t see a full run down of what was included, but I was happy with everything.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Does amazing on my skin and definitely wakes me up in the morning. Love tea tree.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products to fight acne from past several years, But None worked. This is a miracle product for me, right from first week I began to see the difference, and now I hardly get any breakouts. This is my product for life now!!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work for me, and it made my face so oily ... It worked for other people though so you have to try it for yourself to judge the product. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I had always heard of the benefits of tea tree oil for acne prone skin......problem I am not a teenager anymore, so the normal acid based products dry out my skin dramatically, so I am willing to try anything to get my skin to calm down.....The tea tree oil does still dry out the skin some but the disinfecting quality of the tea tree means I can put a moisturizer with it and still not clog my pores as bad.  It did notice an improvement in my skin, but not a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> This is nice but I have not seen how it works.</li>
            <li> I have endured acne for years and years now. For a while I used the gentle formula of Proactive and that worked pretty well. But I wanted to try something else and I had heard about how fantastic tea tree oil could be for acne prone skin. I have been using this sample kit for about 2 weeks now and so far I am very happy with it. My skin looks and feels better than it has in years. I just ordered the new full size kit from beauty.com!!</li>
            <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used No Lie a must buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the cleanser and lotion!! It definitely helps zap pimples fast. My skin is too sensitive for the toner tho.</li>
            <li> Can get cheaper at BodyShop.com. All body shop products are cheaper on-site. The tea-tree product itself is great, however. Very good for scabs/scars/acne.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used, I seriously wish I found this sooner. I use all four products.  The oil first, then the face wash, toner then lotion. Morning and night.  I have big pores, very oily skin.  Just within 4 days I saw a major difference. Those bumps that I know are filled with oil but aren&#x27;t pimples so you can&#x27;t pop, went away.  I haven&#x27;t had any major pimples... When I normally have at least one that just wants to be it&#x27;s own continent.  My face feels better, less greasy and brighter.  I will diffidently get the larger ones next time and I hope they never discontinue this line.  I&#x27;m going to use it for ever!</li>
            <li> Just like all the time I have.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this for quite sometime now and it seems to be responding well on her skin.  Everyone has a difference tolerance to many types of treatments out there.  The only way to find out if it works is trial-by-error.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, try something else out there.  The oil has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li> I bought the travel size kit to test the product before taking the plunge and buying the larger size bottles. I have very mild adult acne, usually one to two blemishes per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had one single pimple since I began using it three 1/2 weeks ago. I am sold!</li>
            <li> Obviously this smells like tea tree oil and it may sting. I use this for my oily skin and I follow this moisturizer with a thicker creamier moisturizer. This works wonderfully for me!! I will DEF re-purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Product is NOT good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with blemishes and I was looking for something to clear up my skin. Most of the products really dried my skin out.The tea tree oil itself really shrunk my acne down after about a week but my skin was SO dry I&#x27;m onto a new regimen now. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it&#x27;s not something to look forward to for sure. I will continue using the oil as a spot treatment but I am onto the next one until I find something that works, all this did was dry me out.</li>
            <li> Exactly the one they sell on the body shop site, also exactly the same price. Its actually cheaper on the body shop site if you have coupons and if you buy it on days on sale. I noticed that after I bought the product here. Thats why i give it a 4, the review on the product itself is a 5. The shipping was quick, and the item was in great condition. The lotion itself didn&#x27;t fit me so well, but that why I bought a small kit to try it out before I buy the bigger one. I did love the oil though. I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it though.</li>
            <li> The formulas have too much alcohol on it, It dried my skin to the point it itched.:-(</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, it leaves your skin really fresh and clean. I just wished it helped with my acne. It did reduce the redness a little bit but did not help get rid of the acne I already had. I stopped my birth control and it was the worst mistake ever because my skin just exploded with Acne especially around my chin area. This product helped with the inflammation and helped it sooth the skin but not actually get rid of it. If you already have good skin and would like to have a product that leaves your skin smooth and clean I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews for this skin care kit, I expected it to have a little bit more of a &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; effect on my skin. I think it&#x27;s a nice product, but I wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell, and I didn&#x27;t see any drastic improvement in my skin after a few weeks of use. I&#x27;m glad I tried it, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to the vitamin E line.</li>
            <li> hate this stuff, dry my skin, stung very badly, made my acne even worse.</li>
            <li> It really sops the oil from your face but leave it dry, still supple but no oil on your face for most of the day</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. But it didn&#x27;t help my acne at all. Back to Proactive I go...</li>
            <li> It made it break out even more. I&#x27;ve had acne for many years and had high hopes for this. The only thing that seems to work is panoxyl wash</li>
