            <li>I am still working on figuring out how to keep my daughters hair curly throughout the day, but these created gorgeous bouncy spirals that were glossy.  </li>
            <li>I loved them.  </li>

            <li>Once I&#x27;m comfortable with them, they&#x27;ll be great.</li>
            <li>The idea is amazing</li>
            <li>When I opened the envelope, there were those hair curler sitting in the envelope without their own package - I wouldn&#x27;t know if they were used?  </li>
            <li>Happy with the price and excited to get &amp;#34;long and Wide&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Not my favorite purchase.</li>
            <li>I shouldve ordered more.</li>
            <li>Much better trial price than</li>
            <li>Love these so does my daughter we have used them 3 times</li>
            <li>I have mixed-ethnicity hair that knky-curly and bought these to make my curls more ringlet-y.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the long/wide yet, and am hoping that&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li>It came apart more often than not while pulling the hair through the &amp;#34;curl former&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>So great for my natural hair upkeep.</li>
            <li>They are easy to sleep with</li>
            <li>Easy to use with fabulous results</li>
            <li>but  I was happy to see that Amazon had several off brand vendors to choose from.  </li>
            <li>I need to put a lot of product on the hair before going in to the curlers in order to avoid frizzies and have smooth results.  </li>
            <li>It works but make sure you buy the right size ..</li>
            <li>I was excited.  </li>
            <li>installation was challenging at first as there are no directions at all included thankfully</li>
            <li>These will definitely come in handy during cheer season!</li>
            <li>Which was the reason i ordered two packs the seller should have been more clear about what was inculded in the package because this is more of a variety pack  </li>
            <li>it is easy and fun.</li>
            <li>Its fast and easy</li>
            <li>It broke within the first 10 curlers and I had to tape it together to finish my hair!</li>
            <li>I happily plucked down my credit card and was super excited that the curlers came in much sooner than the estimated delivery</li>
            <li>but they are not even worth that.</li>
            <li>I bought these as a supplement for the Vakind Hair Curlers I bought for my daughter with much longer hair and ended up using more of the other kind, as they were longer.  </li>
            <li>For those curls in which all of my hair fit into it they were smooth, shiny, bouncy, and everything i was lead to believe was possible.  </li>
            <li>so i  ordered two packs because the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>They did exactly what they said they would.</li>
            <li>So now i have 20 curlers that i will not be able to use since my hair is too long for them</li>
            <li>Easy enough for a child to do.</li>
            <li>I wanted a heatless way to achieve large curls and body without having to straighten (heat) and then curl (heat) my hair.  </li>
            <li>Still, I cannot complain too much because these curlers are fabulous, but I would suggest going with a higher quality brand/label, I purchased a second set from another brand paid a little higher and my wand is sturdy and has yet to give me any problems :)</li>
            <li>And they seem much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well but the sticks would not hold together</li>
            <li>It sounds like the happiest people with these are those who have naturally straight, Caucasian hair.  </li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning excited to see the results.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maintain just rinse and lay them to dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone who wants to make curls on their hair.</li>
            <li>Again, these are for SUPER SHORT HAIR!</li>
            <li>these are the longs but in general they are pretty short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were not in any brand new packaging.  </li>
            <li>and these particular curlers are not wide at all.</li>
            <li>They also do an amazing job on my niece&#x27;s hair and her hair is very thick and already has a natural curl to it.</li>
            <li>; curlers for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to curl their hair at night.  </li>
            <li>I guess that should have been my red flag to do more research, well i was expecting all of the curlers to be long and wide for longer hair and that is not what i received.</li>
            <li>Total length loss was nearly a foot with the curls!</li>
            <li>The green and orange curlformers are for SUPER short hair.  </li>
            <li>These are not long and they are not wide.</li>
            <li>my 5 year old daughter who has shoulder length hair could even use these you literally have to have really thin right below your ear hair for these to be of any use!</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair a frizzy mess and really does nothing.</li>

            <li> If your hair is no longer that 5-6&amp;#34; in length and very thin you might be satisfied with this</li>
            <li> I think the trick is that if u have think hair grab less hair per roll and more hair is ur hair is thin.</li>
            <li> &gt; If you&#x27;re hair is longer and or thicker and you just cannot resist the price point save yourself the frustration of having only half a head done, with 3-4&amp;#34; of hair sticking out of most of them and go ahead and pluck down the money for at least 3 sets.  </li>
            <li> you put a short and long on the hook together and have both on one strand of hair it works</li>
            <li> /&gt;i put the short one closer to my head and the long one on the bottom.</li>
            <li> short (shoulder length) hair and only the pink and orange ones were long enough to capture all my hair.  </li>
            <li> YouTube has several helpful tutorials and I got through well enough only pulling my scalp badly a few times.  </li>
            <li> i ask for long ones</li>
            <li> The rest were only half curled or the last 3-4 inches were a frizzy</li>
            <li> They are so tiny not Long or Wide @ all!!!</li>
            <li> So when I found several You tube videos of other naturals touting this type of curler</li>
            <li> The blue and green ones are for really short hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing my Afro textured hair natural for the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li> The items is described as Long and Wide Curlformers  </li>
            <li> I put these in my six year old daughters hair and couldn&#x27;t even use all the green or orange ones because her nearly-shoulder length hair was too long half way up her head.  </li>
            <li> I order the long and wide and got 18 short and narrow ones and two of them were almost falling apart.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions in the package, had to look it up online - otherwise they were what  I expected</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected from the description.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed not worth the money since you won&#x27;t be able to use them...</li>
            <li> Instead there are 9 long ones (approximately 9-10inches) and 9 extremely short ones (maybe 5 inches).  </li>
            <li> These are very uncomfortable to sleep in and result in a much tighter curl than I wanted.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use and not very useable if you have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit hard to get your hair through, but I expect it&#x27;s just a learning curve.</li>
            <li> There difficult to put on</li>
            <li> but they are horrible and do not work to perm hair even though multiple websites say you can use them to perm the hair.</li>
            <li> Of course the name brand ones were insanely and ridiculously priced</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed once i received my product.</li>
            <li> These are pathetic!!!</li>

            <li> The green and orange curlformers are for SUPER short hair.  I put these in my six year old daughters hair and couldn&#x27;t even use all the green or orange ones because her nearly-shoulder length hair was too long half way up her head.  I bought these as a supplement for the Vakind Hair Curlers I bought for my daughter with much longer hair and ended up using more of the other kind, as they were longer.  Again, these are for SUPER SHORT HAIR! And they seem much cheaper.  Not my favorite purchase.</li>
            <li> Product was just as described. The blue and green ones are for really short hair. shorter than mine. I shouldve ordered more. Next time I know. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing my Afro textured hair natural for the past 4 years.  I wanted a heatless way to achieve large curls and body without having to straighten (heat) and then curl (heat) my hair.  So when I found several You tube videos of other naturals touting this type of curler I was excited.  Of course the name brand ones were insanely and ridiculously priced but  I was happy to see that Amazon had several off brand vendors to choose from.  Happy with the price and excited to get &amp;#34;long and Wide&amp;#34; curlers for such a reasonable price.  I happily plucked down my credit card and was super excited that the curlers came in much sooner than the estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package and was dismayed to find that despite the optical illusion presented in the picture they are not all the &amp;#34;long and wide&amp;#34; rollers I was led to believe.  Instead there are 9 long ones (approximately 9-10inches) and 9 extremely short ones (maybe 5 inches).  If your hair is no longer that 5-6&amp;#34; in length and very thin you might be satisfied with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you&#x27;re hair is longer and or thicker and you just cannot resist the price point save yourself the frustration of having only half a head done, with 3-4&amp;#34; of hair sticking out of most of them and go ahead and pluck down the money for at least 3 sets.  That is still a substantial savings from the name brand rollers and you can double the shorter ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation was challenging at first as there are no directions at all included thankfully YouTube has several helpful tutorials and I got through well enough only pulling my scalp badly a few times.  I chose to sleep in my curlers  and let&#x27;s just say a perfect night&#x27;s sleep will not be achieved.  I woke up the next morning excited to see the results.  For those curls in which all of my hair fit into it they were smooth, shiny, bouncy, and everything i was lead to believe was possible.  The rest were only half curled or the last 3-4 inches were a frizzy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story: Buy 3 packs so you can double the length and have enough for the entire head, or save your money and spend $65 for the name brand set.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions in the package, had to look it up online - otherwise they were what  I expected</li>
            <li> Got stuck in Chinese customs for quite a while, but these arrived as advertised. They&#x27;re a bit hard to get your hair through, but I expect it&#x27;s just a learning curve. Once I&#x27;m comfortable with them, they&#x27;ll be great. Much better trial price than the $40 my beauty supply store was asking for!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item 2.5 months ago and today I finally received the replacement (after contacting the seller).  The package came from China.  When I opened the envelope, there were those hair curler sitting in the envelope without their own package - I wouldn&#x27;t know if they were used?  They were not in any brand new packaging.  Stay away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase. They work great ,makes my hair look great and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling everyone I know about these. So great for my natural hair upkeep.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed once i received my product. The items is described as Long and Wide Curlformers  so i  ordered two packs because the price was very reasonable. I guess that should have been my red flag to do more research, well i was expecting all of the curlers to be long and wide for longer hair and that is not what i received. With the two packs combined I only have a total of 20 curler that i can use on my hair which is clearly not enough. Which was the reason i ordered two packs the seller should have been more clear about what was inculded in the package because this is more of a variety pack  and these particular curlers are not wide at all. So now i have 20 curlers that i will not be able to use since my hair is too long for them</li>
            <li> Love these so does my daughter we have used them 3 times it is easy and fun. We loved the look it gave our hair.</li>
            <li> These are pathetic!!! They look nothing like the picture. They are so tiny not Long or Wide @ all!!! Highly disappointed not worth the money since you won&#x27;t be able to use them... my 5 year old daughter who has shoulder length hair could even use these you literally have to have really thin right below your ear hair for these to be of any use! These suck don&#x27;t buy and they take months for you to get them anyway! If I could give it 0 stars I would!</li>

            <li> Worked very well but the sticks would not hold together</li>
            <li> they were to short i ask for long ones</li>
            <li> It sounds like the happiest people with these are those who have naturally straight, Caucasian hair.  I have mixed-ethnicity hair that knky-curly and bought these to make my curls more ringlet-y.  I&#x27;ve found that I have to be careful, with naturally curly hair, one risks looking like a poodle upon removing the curlers.  I haven&#x27;t tried the long/wide yet, and am hoping that&#x27;s better.  I need to put a lot of product on the hair before going in to the curlers in order to avoid frizzies and have smooth results.  I will try, instead of using curl crèmes, to use straightening crèmes in hopes that will balance the poodle effect.  Total length loss was nearly a foot with the curls!</li>
            <li> They did exactly what they said they would.</li>
            <li> They work great on my daughters hair. They also do an amazing job on my niece&#x27;s hair and her hair is very thick and already has a natural curl to it. I also tried them out on my hair and they did great and my hair does not curl or hold a curl at all. Its fast and easy and we use them almost every night.</li>
            <li> Please save your money! These are not long and they are not wide. I purchased these for 6 bucks but they are not even worth that.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with fabulous results I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to curl their hair at night.  They are easy to sleep with so you can get a good nights rest.</li>
            <li> I absolutely think these are a waste of time and money. There difficult to put on and they don&#x27;t curl</li>
            <li> These are not wide or long.  I have short (shoulder length) hair and only the pink and orange ones were long enough to capture all my hair.  These are very uncomfortable to sleep in and result in a much tighter curl than I wanted.</li>
            <li> These worked well for me the only drawback bring the quality of the wand. It came apart more often than not while pulling the hair through the &amp;#34;curl former&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve since replaced it with the wand made by curlformers.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use and not very useable if you have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I order the long and wide and got 18 short and narrow ones and two of them were almost falling apart.</li>
            <li> The idea is amazing but they are horrible and do not work to perm hair even though multiple websites say you can use them to perm the hair. It leaves the hair a frizzy mess and really does nothing. I have tried them 4 times on different people and they all got the same results....damaged hair that was not curled at all.</li>
            <li> Work great!😄 Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> These curlers work great but the problem was the wand. It broke within the first 10 curlers and I had to tape it together to finish my hair! Still, I cannot complain too much because these curlers are fabulous, but I would suggest going with a higher quality brand/label, I purchased a second set from another brand paid a little higher and my wand is sturdy and has yet to give me any problems :)</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!  I am still working on figuring out how to keep my daughters hair curly throughout the day, but these created gorgeous bouncy spirals that were glossy.  These will definitely come in handy during cheer season!</li>
            <li> It works but make sure you buy the right size ..</li>
            <li> These curlers are amazing! Excellent value, no need to pay full price for brand name products. These are perfect!</li>
            <li> I loved them.  It did take a while to receive, but some came Hong Kong.  To see how I used them, click here:  [...]</li>
