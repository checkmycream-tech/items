            <li>I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I did not notice any improvement on my skin.</li>

            <li>How cool is that to find a great night cream that contains 2.5% Retinal.</li>
            <li>Customer service is excellent, they respond quickly and are super helpful.</li>
            <li>Absolutely Love it --- I  am on my second one.....feels good, works good, looks good!</li>
            <li>This is by far, the best face cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I noticed since I started using it that my pores have shrunk and I have a nice glow to my skin as well as a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is by far the very best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this face cream is awesome!</li>
            <li>This way, your skin can effectively absorb potent ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!</li>
            <li>fragrance is light and very pleasant; texture and consistency is perfect and not at all greasy-feeling; it contains an almost-unheard of level of 91% natural/71% organic ingredients with aloe, antioxidant green tea, shea butter &amp; vitamins A, E, &amp; B5, and 2.5% retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am using it along with a very good daytime product, so I can&#x27;t be sure which product is responsible for what,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually very happy to say that with only applying before bed my skin is feeling nice and aive inthe morning.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is so pretty and looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful and I really like the pump that is included with the product.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m already seeing some fine lines disappear!</li>
            <li>This was very smooth to touch and made my face feel like silk (no joke).</li>
            <li>so far I like it although I&#x27;ve not noticed any remarkable changes as of yet!</li>
            <li>but now I have REWIND to heal it right up &amp;amp; the BEST part of it, is it improves the appearance and quality of my skin… thank you pure life labs, please don&#x27;t ever stop making this!  </li>
            <li>This is the one product at an amazing price that did not contain witch hazel, and all the good stuff is listed as the first ingredients.</li>
            <li>This was huge!</li>
            <li>Love this night cream.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wake</li>
            <li>I noticed (as did many of my friends and family)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love that this product improves my skin tone and texture in addition to clearing my hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>And the best part is the pores on my nose have become noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li>Will stick with this cream  for sure.</li>
            <li>So many products irritate my face.</li>
            <li>I want to put it on my face more often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely the best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel smoother and look better.</li>
            <li>Love the feel on my skin before bed.  </li>
            <li>UV protection; smoother, firmer skin; a more even tone; fewer breakouts; and tighter pores.</li>
            <li>I love putting this on my skin because I feel that it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li>I did love that feel of this product and</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and use it as my night cream every night.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything u have used.</li>
            <li>If it was you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it on amazon and it wouldn&#x27;t be this price.  </li>
            <li>a list of respectable ingredients, keep in mind your skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the softness it leaves on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the follow-up emails from the company asking how I like the product and if I have any concerns.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product for sure.</li>
            <li>Customer service seemed great, as is the packaging (hence the 2 stars vs 1), but the product really did not work for me.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is organic and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Ok Ladies, this product is a must have.  </li>
            <li>Each morning my skin looks better and better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is brighter and has a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t gone by any means, but they do look better.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>Would love more Skinthera products.</li>
            <li>and I must say, when I woke this AM, I thought my skin looked better (?)</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with the RETINOL night cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love this retinol</li>
            <li>I love the way this cream feels on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is firmer and has a more youthful look to it.</li>
            <li>(I think because of the amount of retinol that&#x27;s in it), so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it any more than that.</li>
            <li>One pump is about a pea sized amount of product, and that amount seems perfect to cover my entire face.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>As my skin ages I see that my skin sags more and more</li>
            <li>I love love this product...</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>Very rich cream.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>As a 40 year with the start of wrinkles, I was looking for a good retinol cream that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin too much - this is it!  </li>
            <li>The cream goes on non greasy and very easy with the user friendly airless pump.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found this product!</li>
            <li>This has a nice mild scent to it, it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It has no scent, which is nice, and I put my moisturizer on right over top of this once it dries.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30s now, and I want to be sure that I am doing what I can to prevent fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>but this is a great natural retinol night cream and affordable</li>
            <li>I totally loved this product, I only have it for more than 2 weeks and use it twice a week, its amazing to see the changes on my skin.</li>
            <li>Good results, thanks.</li>
            <li>I have ordered and purchased so many retinol creams and this one is my absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li>I found it was easy to incorporate into my routine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy now to see why.</li>
            <li>I would like to make special note that retinol can work magic on the neck area where time has written rows of lines in a woman&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>For me it has worked best at lightening dark spots.</li>
            <li>however i haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in fine lines and wrinkles..</li>
            <li>and I do think it will aid in preventing fine lines and wrinkles as well.</li>
            <li>My Dermatologist told me to start using a retinol product to help lighten age marks and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I feel that it has made a noticeable difference in the quality of my skin (55+) which is now visibly smoother with fewer fine lines and still some deeper ones</li>
            <li>It also helped minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and even reducing acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>Retinol can help reduce discoloration, fine lines, wrinkles and skin texture.</li>
            <li>The main factors were the lack of scent and most being able to tolerate the effects without any substantial negatives for most users.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My acne cleared up and face looks really smoothe and healthy now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy but not greasy and keeps my skin tight and looking great!</li>
            <li>I have used it for a little over 2 months and my skin looks the best it has in YEARS!</li>
            <li>Easily applied and absorbed, and no breakouts!</li>
            <li>and I can already see a huge difference in my pores on my nose and</li>
            <li>I just started using this yesterday, and it already feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>It hydrates and my skin feels silky smooth in the morning.  </li>
            <li>This cream leaves my skin smooth and acne-free.  </li>
            <li>how smooth it went it.</li>
            <li>When this opportunity became available to get this product I jumped on it as it has 2.5% Retinol.  </li>
            <li>It is light and not greasy at all like some night creams I have tried before.</li>
            <li>just there no changes not 100% chemical free</li>
            <li>That being said, my skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I receive this product on a discount price or free for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li>This cream is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a smooth product that absorbs well.</li>
            <li>so far so good, I feel my skin is brighter</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet very effective and if you start to use it daily can cause some peeling so pace yourself and watch how your own skin reacts.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so refreshed after using it for the first time!!  .</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful retinol cream.</li>
            <li>I am 52 with fair skin that blushes easily and tends to get red and blotchy.  </li>
            <li>I was provided this product with a significant discount to provide a review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what this product will  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions exactly and be sure to follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this so much!  </li>
            <li>and I love the packaging/color first of all.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li>Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li>I do not see any significant changes.</li>
            <li>I had acne as a teenager (as many people do) because I have pretty oily skin, I think.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of results I would receive when I brought this evening facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would love to find something that makes my skin feel just as amazing to wear under my makeup on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It looks nice on my vanity, and the pump action works smoothly.</li>
            <li>It absorbed well and did not leave any residue and was just as easy to remove to re apply.</li>
            <li>It feels like it absorbs really quickly, and my skin feels silky smooth and taut after using it.  </li>
            <li>Not what  I expected doesnot work that great wouldn&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li>love this cream so much.  </li>
            <li>My face is really looking better.</li>
            <li>The patch is almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;Receiving this product at a discount was a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>and I started using it every other day because of the retinol and its working great.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Pure Life Labs for thinking of us!!</li>
            <li>I plan to continue using this product and am confident the results will only get better.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is light, not greasy, and all natural.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly also.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pump out much, I have a big face, lol.</li>
            <li>The lowest line has narrowed enough that a scar from an injury when I was 6 is more prominent than the line</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>like its mild scent too and the consistency of the cream.</li>
            <li>Would love more of these products to try and hopefully use for my daily regime...</li>
            <li>My skin is bright and clear and feels incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>bottle has a pump cap that easily dispenses a large drop.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very soft, feels more supple, and looks super.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, this started as an impulse buy because I saw it for such a good deal, but I&#x27;m actually really into using this face cream now!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how much better my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>My face seems smoother and I can see the fine lines getting less noticeable Very happy with this product and will be a regular customer..</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for an organic product that works and doesn&#x27;t take a mortgage to pay for it!!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product and will be buying more way before I run out!</li>
            <li>Like all retinol products it leaves your skin a little more sensitive, and you need to use a good sunscreen if you use this product because else you will get really easily a sunburn.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much wrinkle reduction (I&#x27;m 48) but fine lines are a tad diminished.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply it to any areas with fine wrinkles or damage from sunlight, such as around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li>almost a month later (and i used this maybe 5 times a week at most), the fine lines by my eyes.... gone.</li>
            <li>It is such a nice, luxurious-looking bottle.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face moisturizing cream by far.</li>
            <li>My favorite serum thus far.</li>
            <li>This cream has moisturizers built in for those like me who have more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m definitely willing to keep using it for as long as it takes to fairly assess.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my skin looks tighter and brighter, and it just feels nice.  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I used it at night ,my face skin feels so soft and better after...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I really love thing organic and natural.</li>
            <li>So easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>Worth giving this product a try.</li>
            <li>I experienced some tingling and drying after the first few applications but that quickly went away with the addition of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It glides on like silk, soaks right in, with no oily feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a difference between looking young and everyone not being able to shut up about it ;)</li>
            <li>I love this product will buy again.two weeks and can tell a major difference</li>
            <li>I was using the most popular over the counter drug store brand for deep wrinkles which left my skin irritated.  </li>
            <li>Nice and light but extremely moisturizing!!</li>
            <li>I am only in my twenties, but I tend to laugh quite a bit and find that I need to start taking better care of my skin.</li>
            <li>It would be great if they come out with an entire line that includes a cleanser, toner, night cream and daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>There are few products on the market that I&#x27;ve been able to use but this will be a favorite</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not going to mess with good results.</li>
            <li>Skin feels so soft and smooth after using this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!!</li>
            <li>I first received this Retinol Night Cream, I let it sit around for a couple of days before I used it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It lasted exactly three months using it every night.</li>
            <li>If your expectations are reasonable it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>I am really amazed by this product!</li>
            <li>Even after the 1st application &amp;amp; I can only imagine how great this will work over a long period of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sure wish you sold this in a larger bottle!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so refreshed after using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I am 59 and this is my first experience with retinol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally this does seem to have some effect on craping but it is the hardest to quantify and exists mostly on my arms and the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, my pores are smaller, and my skin tone is more even.  </li>
            <li>I used it first as an anti-aging cream at night for one month.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and has a soft silky texture.</li>
            <li>I feel like with continued use I will see even better results in the future!</li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue using this!</li>
            <li>skin feels refreshed from the first day</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and sinks into your skin well.</li>
            <li>I really like how it has 2.5% retinol!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling instantly firmer with more tone.</li>
            <li>Exfoliating is essential for youthful-looking, healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Your complexion also looks smoother and products are able to sink deep into the skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is so soft and smooth and when you put it on you skin it feels like silk.</li>
            <li>I might check back in here in a month or two to say more about that.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve worked up to that from once or twice a week when I first got it).  </li>
            <li>Who says you can&#x27;t go green and still look gorgeous?</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time!</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well &amp;amp; has left my face so, so soft!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few days now, and many of my fine lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li>I mainly have the crows feet around my eyes when I smile</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m 34 and I don&#x27;t really wear make up on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any positive changes to my skin during these months.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone who wants to have a healthy skin, it works and worth every penny you spent.</li>
            <li>I am very cautious about what I put on my skin, using only natural ingredients, and I am loving this product.</li>
            <li>I really saw results the first night I used the product.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have have a ton of wrinkles, but the wrinkles on forehead are pretty pronounced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised also that I have had no breakouts although I have very sensitive skin and breakout easily.</li>
            <li>Though they&#x27;re more potent than their over-the-counter counterparts, retinoids are also more irritating to the skin with potential side effects like peeling and redness.</li>
            <li>The easy to use pump also makes applying just enough easier.</li>
            <li>My face is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, you may can use this product more than twice-per-week.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone who has large pores.</li>
            <li>This year, I have been searching for new and better ways to look and feel younger and healthier.</li>
            <li>This was very soft and smooth feeling and contains the natural vitamins your skin needs.</li>
            <li>I add a little rose hip oil to my regime at night with this product.  </li>
            <li>but I think this one is effective in slowing down my wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I just did a facial on one of my regular clients and her skin looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>looks amazing after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>, it is much softer and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It has really helped moisturize my face.</li>
            <li>It went on very even and was weightless.</li>
            <li>It seems to working very well.</li>
            <li>my aunt like this one thank you so much to having this one</li>
            <li>I waited until I&#x27;d used a whole bottle before writing this review-</li>
            <li>but it is exceptionally gentle.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like the packaging too.</li>
            <li>I thought retinol would be drying, but this leaves my face feeling very hydrated.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected to see better results</li>
            <li>After using it every night for a couple of months, I really see a difference.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling and looking so smooth and not red at all.  </li>
            <li>Really like this cream.</li>
            <li>I am always really iffy on amazon reviews because sometimes I feel like they are posted by people that are paid to do so...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 3 weeks now, and can notice a GREAT improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Also a vitamin A derivative, retinoids are only available by prescription from your dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I really like this Night time</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my story: during my pre-bed routine I started putting two pumps onto my hands and gently rubbing it into my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have lines, and I can&#x27;t really tell any difference since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>it is very soothing.</li>
            <li>been using it for a few days; so far so good .. we&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have nearly the amount of acne that I used to when I was younger, but I still find using a face cream like this to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat it has helped to clear up breakouts and erase blemishes.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all positive reviews there were no negative reviews 2 months ago.</li>
            <li>I love that I can rely on other like minded consumers to tell me how the product worked for them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just getting into my early twenties and have very few wrinkles; however this &#x60;anti-aging&#x27; product seemed too good to pass on.</li>
            <li>This is a light cream that goes a long way on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the top name (and expensive) anti-aging moisturizers and serums and this one has worked wonders for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Priced decently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 and have mild crow&#x27;s feet, the 11 at bridge of noise, marionette lines and wrinkles on edge of upper lip.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied enough with the results to order it again, and will keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels moisturized and vibrant using this cream.</li>
            <li>The very 1st night that I used it, I noticed that this cream made my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li>Plus it is very important to me that product is all natural because other products tended to make me itch...</li>
            <li>and I really like it so far!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Retinol night cream to everyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Many other products claim to do this, but this is the first one that actually has.</li>
            <li>why not give it a little help to look better.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, dry skin, and usually can feel an adverse affect immediately, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be applied after bathing or washing and allowed to be absorbed into the skin and then followed with application of a gentle moisturizer, with sunscreen in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Skin is more firm.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy and for the most part it is unscented.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the slight changes I noticed - at 38, some wrinkles have popped up, and the retinol cream seems to help with them a little bit.</li>
            <li>This product is strong enough that I see it working on the puffiness and fine lines around my eyes, but gentle enough that my sensitive skin can handle using it every other day</li>
            <li>By removing dead skin cells, new, healthier cells are able to come through.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product at any age, as I am thirty and notice the positive effects!</li>
            <li>it was only this year that i started to pay attention to the fine lines that were starting to appear.  </li>
            <li>But, as with any new skin routine, my face needed to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>I have found a new go to recommended to friends and others</li>
            <li>The lines will fade within weeks, and you&#x27;ll be a new woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New</li>
            <li>But use it as directed because it can make ur face very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with breaking out or itching.</li>
            <li>I was getting my nails done over the weekend and someone told me that I looked very young to be a Grandmother.</li>
            <li>First time I applied the cream, you will instantly feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love it and definitely recommend it for other women!</li>
            <li>; but I&#x27;m just so surprised that I&#x27;m also seeing a natural rosy look to my cheeks that I haven&#x27;t had in ages!</li>
            <li>after a few days, fine lines were still there, but my face started to look clearer and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>am not a huge huge fan of moisturizers that have a strong smell or that feels heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this Retinol Night Cream by Pure Labs for 4 days</li>
            <li>I have always had an issue with large pores, I have had this cream and used it daily for a week, my pores are literally shrinking.</li>
            <li>This product having such high reviews and being all natural was the main reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li>So keeping my skin clear and fresher looking is something I strive for</li>
            <li>Anyway, my pores always seem to be filled with something, even if it&#x27;s not a full-fledged blackhead, so I really like that Rewind can tighten them up and make my skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also sensitive.</li>
            <li>up and my skin is so refresed and soft</li>
            <li>and this is not heavy on ur skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has not irritated it.</li>
            <li>so far i like it.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin, just like me &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin.</li>
            <li>My face and neck haven&#x27;t felt this soft since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has a professional strength percentage of Retinol that works to reduce wrinkles, lighten skin, reduce pores, etc.</li>
            <li>My skin is loosing is natural glow.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist said this product is a complete hoax.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I also appreciate it being all natural.</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;re working on those (creams can only do so much against time and</li>
            <li>when I woke up to my skin lines faded and looking much smoother and younger!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and renewed in the morning after using it.  </li>
            <li>This product is 97% natural and 71% organic.</li>
            <li>and I do not have sensitive</li>
            <li>Too early to share my result</li>
            <li>I then had my teen daughter use it for her acne, which also works very well.</li>
            <li>I am 52 years old and have rosacea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>That it is NATURAL, ORGANIC &amp; PARABAN</li>
            <li>Too early to tell</li>
            <li>but so far, no allergic reaction nor irritation from it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This seems to work very well, for a lesser cost than some others.</li>
            <li>I have also been using this on my hands and it had made my hands and face so much smoother and younger</li>
            <li>But really, the thing that sold me was the actual effect of the product.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother which makes it look younger!</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about this product is that it does not contain parabens, is not tested on animals, and is 97% natural &amp; 71% organic.  </li>
            <li>I use this nightly and can see a considerable amount of difference.</li>
            <li>Absorbs well into the skin leaving your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much so this should last you awhile.</li>
            <li>When I started I had three distinct lines in my forehead with the lower and middle being solid fully across the area.</li>
            <li>In just a few days, I noticed a significant difference on my face.  </li>
            <li>I actually find that my skin feels smoother and tighter when using the Retinol, which amazes me because the weather is so bitter right now that I normally would be battling winter skin.</li>
            <li>I did a little research and retinol is a revolutionary complex that combines soothing aloe, shea butter &amp; green tea for incredibly safe, effective way to boost collagen, minimize wrinkles &amp; sagginess for stronger and firmer skin that reverses the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>a week and a half later, the skin felt baby smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never really been into cleaning my face before going to bed, or using any skin creams, but after seeing how much smoother my skin looked when I used Rewind, I don&#x27;t know why I wouldn&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li>I have been finding that a lot of them have witch hazel, which is fine in moderation, but using this daily can cause dryness, and prolonged everyday use can cause irritation.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and normally, creams either irritate me to the point in which I get a rash or dry my skin out and make it flaky, both of which are a pain in the tail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week, and if my skin was going to pitch a fit it would have already done so.  </li>
            <li>I expected to only be able to use it every other day or so</li>
            <li>As much as I put my face through daily, I have finally found a product to help renew my skin to its radiant self.</li>
            <li>Anti-aging ingredients come and go, but retinoids have been major players for decades.</li>
            <li>I also keep one in my purse and use as a hand lotion after washing my hands as I have very dry hands because I wash them so much</li>
            <li>I really do not have a strong opinion either way on the subject yet.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to it, but to be honest have not used it long enough to be able to see any long term anti aging results.</li>
            <li>Plus, it can improve skin tone and color for generally younger-looking, even skin.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol stimulates cell turnover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always careful about moisturizers and any skin care products really.</li>
            <li>I treated my face twice-per-week, because my skin is naturally oilly, especially around my nose, chin, and forehead.</li>
            <li>As far as my wrinkles, I definitely think they are improved.</li>
            <li>so I can keep wearing a bare face.</li>
            <li>This vitamin A derivative helps skin produce collagen, a natural component of the dermis that gives skin its youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol gives skin an overall healthier appearance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to whom has a dry skin.</li>
            <li>This skin cream is viscous and milky white, with a fresh fragrance that is neutral or perhaps slightly herbal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see a subtle difference in the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>If you have especially sensitive skin, try it every other night.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I have larger pores and I&#x27;m never completely happy with anything I try.</li>
            <li>When used with sunscreen it seems to be working on my arms slowly clearing spots of skin on my forearm and the light liver spots I had on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>The first couple of days I started using it, I broke out a little.  </li>
            <li>Being in my early 70&#x27;s,  I thought I was doomed to dry, wrinkly skin....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin is softer and fine lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I live in Michigan and the air can sometimes be very dry since I have to run the heat during the evenings to keep the house at a moderate temperature</li>
            <li>It is so much softer, and there are less visible lines, especially around my mouth and eyes.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I have tried dozens and dozens of products, I was so shocked and surprised</li>

            <li> Absolutely Love it --- I  am on my second one.....feels good, works good, looks good!</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best face cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I noticed since I started using it that my pores have shrunk and I have a nice glow to my skin as well as a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is by far the very best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this face cream is awesome!</li>
            <li> This way, your skin can effectively absorb potent ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!</li>
            <li> fragrance is light and very pleasant; texture and consistency is perfect and not at all greasy-feeling; it contains an almost-unheard of level of 91% natural/71% organic ingredients with aloe, antioxidant green tea, shea butter &amp; vitamins A, E, &amp; B5, and 2.5% retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using it along with a very good daytime product, so I can&#x27;t be sure which product is responsible for what,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually very happy to say that with only applying before bed my skin is feeling nice and aive inthe morning.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is so pretty and looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful and I really like the pump that is included with the product.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m already seeing some fine lines disappear!</li>
            <li> This was very smooth to touch and made my face feel like silk (no joke).</li>
            <li> so far I like it although I&#x27;ve not noticed any remarkable changes as of yet!</li>
            <li> but now I have REWIND to heal it right up &amp;amp; the BEST part of it, is it improves the appearance and quality of my skin… thank you pure life labs, please don&#x27;t ever stop making this!  </li>
            <li> This is the one product at an amazing price that did not contain witch hazel, and all the good stuff is listed as the first ingredients.</li>
            <li> This was huge!</li>
            <li> Love this night cream.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wake</li>
            <li> I noticed (as did many of my friends and family)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love that this product improves my skin tone and texture in addition to clearing my hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> And the best part is the pores on my nose have become noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li> Will stick with this cream  for sure.</li>
            <li> So many products irritate my face.</li>
            <li> I want to put it on my face more often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> UV protection; smoother, firmer skin; a more even tone; fewer breakouts; and tighter pores.</li>
            <li> I love putting this on my skin because I feel that it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> I did love that feel of this product and</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and use it as my night cream every night.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything u have used.</li>
            <li> If it was you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it on amazon and it wouldn&#x27;t be this price.  </li>
            <li> a list of respectable ingredients, keep in mind your skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product</li>

            <li> Also, I love the follow-up emails from the company asking how I like the product and if I have any concerns.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for sure.</li>
            <li> Customer service seemed great, as is the packaging (hence the 2 stars vs 1), but the product really did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is organic and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Ok Ladies, this product is a must have.  </li>
            <li> Each morning my skin looks better and better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is brighter and has a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t gone by any means, but they do look better.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> Would love more Skinthera products.</li>
            <li> and I must say, when I woke this AM, I thought my skin looked better (?)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with the RETINOL night cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love this retinol</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream feels on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is firmer and has a more youthful look to it.</li>
            <li> (I think because of the amount of retinol that&#x27;s in it), so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it any more than that.</li>
            <li> One pump is about a pea sized amount of product, and that amount seems perfect to cover my entire face.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> As my skin ages I see that my skin sags more and more</li>
            <li> I love love this product...</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> Love this brand.</li>
            <li> Very rich cream.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> As a 40 year with the start of wrinkles, I was looking for a good retinol cream that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin too much - this is it!  </li>
            <li> The cream goes on non greasy and very easy with the user friendly airless pump.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found this product!</li>
            <li> This has a nice mild scent to it, it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It has no scent, which is nice, and I put my moisturizer on right over top of this once it dries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s now, and I want to be sure that I am doing what I can to prevent fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> but this is a great natural retinol night cream and affordable</li>
            <li> I totally loved this product, I only have it for more than 2 weeks and use it twice a week, its amazing to see the changes on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good results, thanks.</li>
            <li> I have ordered and purchased so many retinol creams and this one is my absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li> I found it was easy to incorporate into my routine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy now to see why.</li>
            <li> I would like to make special note that retinol can work magic on the neck area where time has written rows of lines in a woman&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> For me it has worked best at lightening dark spots.</li>
            <li> however i haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in fine lines and wrinkles..</li>
            <li> and I do think it will aid in preventing fine lines and wrinkles as well.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist told me to start using a retinol product to help lighten age marks and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I feel that it has made a noticeable difference in the quality of my skin (55+) which is now visibly smoother with fewer fine lines and still some deeper ones</li>
            <li> It also helped minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and even reducing acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> Retinol can help reduce discoloration, fine lines, wrinkles and skin texture.</li>
            <li> The main factors were the lack of scent and most being able to tolerate the effects without any substantial negatives for most users.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My acne cleared up and face looks really smoothe and healthy now!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy but not greasy and keeps my skin tight and looking great!</li>

            <li> This cream is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The skin feels and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth product that absorbs well.</li>
            <li> so far so good, I feel my skin is brighter</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet very effective and if you start to use it daily can cause some peeling so pace yourself and watch how your own skin reacts.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so refreshed after using it for the first time!!  .</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful retinol cream.</li>

            <li> I was provided this product with a significant discount to provide a review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what this product will  </li>

            <li> Love this so much!  </li>
            <li> and I love the packaging/color first of all.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li> Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> I do not see any significant changes.</li>
            <li> I had acne as a teenager (as many people do) because I have pretty oily skin, I think.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of results I would receive when I brought this evening facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I would love to find something that makes my skin feel just as amazing to wear under my makeup on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It looks nice on my vanity, and the pump action works smoothly.</li>
            <li> It absorbed well and did not leave any residue and was just as easy to remove to re apply.</li>
            <li> It feels like it absorbs really quickly, and my skin feels silky smooth and taut after using it.  </li>
            <li> Not what  I expected doesnot work that great wouldn&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> love this cream so much.  </li>
            <li> My face is really looking better.</li>
            <li> The patch is almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;Receiving this product at a discount was a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> and I started using it every other day because of the retinol and its working great.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Pure Life Labs for thinking of us!!</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using this product and am confident the results will only get better.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is light, not greasy, and all natural.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly also.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pump out much, I have a big face, lol.</li>
            <li> The lowest line has narrowed enough that a scar from an injury when I was 6 is more prominent than the line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> like its mild scent too and the consistency of the cream.</li>
            <li> Would love more of these products to try and hopefully use for my daily regime...</li>
            <li> My skin is bright and clear and feels incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> bottle has a pump cap that easily dispenses a large drop.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very soft, feels more supple, and looks super.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, this started as an impulse buy because I saw it for such a good deal, but I&#x27;m actually really into using this face cream now!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how much better my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> My face seems smoother and I can see the fine lines getting less noticeable Very happy with this product and will be a regular customer..</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for an organic product that works and doesn&#x27;t take a mortgage to pay for it!!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product and will be buying more way before I run out!</li>
            <li> Like all retinol products it leaves your skin a little more sensitive, and you need to use a good sunscreen if you use this product because else you will get really easily a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much wrinkle reduction (I&#x27;m 48) but fine lines are a tad diminished.</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply it to any areas with fine wrinkles or damage from sunlight, such as around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li> almost a month later (and i used this maybe 5 times a week at most), the fine lines by my eyes.... gone.</li>
            <li> It is such a nice, luxurious-looking bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face moisturizing cream by far.</li>
            <li> My favorite serum thus far.</li>
            <li> This cream has moisturizers built in for those like me who have more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m definitely willing to keep using it for as long as it takes to fairly assess.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my skin looks tighter and brighter, and it just feels nice.  </li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product so far.  </li>
            <li> I used it at night ,my face skin feels so soft and better after...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I really love thing organic and natural.</li>
            <li> So easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> Worth giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> I experienced some tingling and drying after the first few applications but that quickly went away with the addition of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It glides on like silk, soaks right in, with no oily feel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a difference between looking young and everyone not being able to shut up about it ;)</li>
            <li> I love this product will buy again.two weeks and can tell a major difference</li>
            <li> I was using the most popular over the counter drug store brand for deep wrinkles which left my skin irritated.  </li>
            <li> Nice and light but extremely moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> I am only in my twenties, but I tend to laugh quite a bit and find that I need to start taking better care of my skin.</li>
            <li> It would be great if they come out with an entire line that includes a cleanser, toner, night cream and daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> There are few products on the market that I&#x27;ve been able to use but this will be a favorite</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not going to mess with good results.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so soft and smooth after using this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream!!</li>
            <li> I first received this Retinol Night Cream, I let it sit around for a couple of days before I used it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It lasted exactly three months using it every night.</li>
            <li> If your expectations are reasonable it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I am really amazed by this product!</li>
            <li> Even after the 1st application &amp;amp; I can only imagine how great this will work over a long period of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sure wish you sold this in a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so refreshed after using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I am 59 and this is my first experience with retinol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally this does seem to have some effect on craping but it is the hardest to quantify and exists mostly on my arms and the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, my pores are smaller, and my skin tone is more even.  </li>
            <li> I used it first as an anti-aging cream at night for one month.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has a soft silky texture.</li>
            <li> I feel like with continued use I will see even better results in the future!</li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue using this!</li>
            <li> skin feels refreshed from the first day</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and sinks into your skin well.</li>
            <li> I really like how it has 2.5% retinol!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling instantly firmer with more tone.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating is essential for youthful-looking, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Your complexion also looks smoother and products are able to sink deep into the skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is so soft and smooth and when you put it on you skin it feels like silk.</li>
            <li> I might check back in here in a month or two to say more about that.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve worked up to that from once or twice a week when I first got it).  </li>
            <li> Who says you can&#x27;t go green and still look gorgeous?</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time!</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well &amp;amp; has left my face so, so soft!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days now, and many of my fine lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I mainly have the crows feet around my eyes when I smile</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m 34 and I don&#x27;t really wear make up on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any positive changes to my skin during these months.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone who wants to have a healthy skin, it works and worth every penny you spent.</li>
            <li> I am very cautious about what I put on my skin, using only natural ingredients, and I am loving this product.</li>
            <li> I really saw results the first night I used the product.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t have have a ton of wrinkles, but the wrinkles on forehead are pretty pronounced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised also that I have had no breakouts although I have very sensitive skin and breakout easily.</li>
            <li> Though they&#x27;re more potent than their over-the-counter counterparts, retinoids are also more irritating to the skin with potential side effects like peeling and redness.</li>
            <li> The easy to use pump also makes applying just enough easier.</li>
            <li> My face is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you may can use this product more than twice-per-week.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone who has large pores.</li>
            <li> This year, I have been searching for new and better ways to look and feel younger and healthier.</li>
            <li> This was very soft and smooth feeling and contains the natural vitamins your skin needs.</li>
            <li> I add a little rose hip oil to my regime at night with this product.  </li>
            <li> but I think this one is effective in slowing down my wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I just did a facial on one of my regular clients and her skin looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> looks amazing after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> , it is much softer and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> , I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> It has really helped moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> It went on very even and was weightless.</li>
            <li> It seems to working very well.</li>
            <li> my aunt like this one thank you so much to having this one</li>
            <li> I waited until I&#x27;d used a whole bottle before writing this review-</li>
            <li> but it is exceptionally gentle.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like the packaging too.</li>
            <li> I thought retinol would be drying, but this leaves my face feeling very hydrated.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected to see better results</li>
            <li> After using it every night for a couple of months, I really see a difference.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling and looking so smooth and not red at all.  </li>
            <li> Really like this cream.</li>
            <li> I am always really iffy on amazon reviews because sometimes I feel like they are posted by people that are paid to do so...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 3 weeks now, and can notice a GREAT improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Also a vitamin A derivative, retinoids are only available by prescription from your dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I really like this Night time</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my story: during my pre-bed routine I started putting two pumps onto my hands and gently rubbing it into my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have lines, and I can&#x27;t really tell any difference since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> been using it for a few days; so far so good .. we&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have nearly the amount of acne that I used to when I was younger, but I still find using a face cream like this to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat it has helped to clear up breakouts and erase blemishes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all positive reviews there were no negative reviews 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> I love that I can rely on other like minded consumers to tell me how the product worked for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into my early twenties and have very few wrinkles; however this &#x60;anti-aging&#x27; product seemed too good to pass on.</li>
            <li> This is a light cream that goes a long way on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the top name (and expensive) anti-aging moisturizers and serums and this one has worked wonders for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Priced decently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and have mild crow&#x27;s feet, the 11 at bridge of noise, marionette lines and wrinkles on edge of upper lip.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied enough with the results to order it again, and will keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels moisturized and vibrant using this cream.</li>
            <li> The very 1st night that I used it, I noticed that this cream made my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Plus it is very important to me that product is all natural because other products tended to make me itch...</li>
            <li> and I really like it so far!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Retinol night cream to everyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Many other products claim to do this, but this is the first one that actually has.</li>
            <li> why not give it a little help to look better.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, dry skin, and usually can feel an adverse affect immediately, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be applied after bathing or washing and allowed to be absorbed into the skin and then followed with application of a gentle moisturizer, with sunscreen in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Skin is more firm.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and for the most part it is unscented.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the slight changes I noticed - at 38, some wrinkles have popped up, and the retinol cream seems to help with them a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product is strong enough that I see it working on the puffiness and fine lines around my eyes, but gentle enough that my sensitive skin can handle using it every other day</li>
            <li> By removing dead skin cells, new, healthier cells are able to come through.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product at any age, as I am thirty and notice the positive effects!</li>
            <li> it was only this year that i started to pay attention to the fine lines that were starting to appear.  </li>
            <li> But, as with any new skin routine, my face needed to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I have found a new go to recommended to friends and others</li>
            <li> The lines will fade within weeks, and you&#x27;ll be a new woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> New</li>
            <li> But use it as directed because it can make ur face very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with breaking out or itching.</li>
            <li> I was getting my nails done over the weekend and someone told me that I looked very young to be a Grandmother.</li>
            <li> First time I applied the cream, you will instantly feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love it and definitely recommend it for other women!</li>
            <li> ; but I&#x27;m just so surprised that I&#x27;m also seeing a natural rosy look to my cheeks that I haven&#x27;t had in ages!</li>
            <li> after a few days, fine lines were still there, but my face started to look clearer and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> am not a huge huge fan of moisturizers that have a strong smell or that feels heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this Retinol Night Cream by Pure Labs for 4 days</li>
            <li> I have always had an issue with large pores, I have had this cream and used it daily for a week, my pores are literally shrinking.</li>
            <li> This product having such high reviews and being all natural was the main reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> So keeping my skin clear and fresher looking is something I strive for</li>
            <li> Anyway, my pores always seem to be filled with something, even if it&#x27;s not a full-fledged blackhead, so I really like that Rewind can tighten them up and make my skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also sensitive.</li>
            <li> up and my skin is so refresed and soft</li>
            <li> and this is not heavy on ur skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has not irritated it.</li>
            <li> so far i like it.</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin, just like me &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin.</li>
            <li> My face and neck haven&#x27;t felt this soft since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has a professional strength percentage of Retinol that works to reduce wrinkles, lighten skin, reduce pores, etc.</li>
            <li> My skin is loosing is natural glow.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said this product is a complete hoax.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> I also appreciate it being all natural.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;re working on those (creams can only do so much against time and</li>
            <li> when I woke up to my skin lines faded and looking much smoother and younger!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and renewed in the morning after using it.  </li>
            <li> This product is 97% natural and 71% organic.</li>
            <li> and I do not have sensitive</li>
            <li> Too early to share my result</li>
            <li> I then had my teen daughter use it for her acne, which also works very well.</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and have rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> That it is NATURAL, ORGANIC &amp; PARABAN</li>
            <li> Too early to tell</li>
            <li> but so far, no allergic reaction nor irritation from it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This seems to work very well, for a lesser cost than some others.</li>
            <li> I have also been using this on my hands and it had made my hands and face so much smoother and younger</li>
            <li> But really, the thing that sold me was the actual effect of the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother which makes it look younger!</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about this product is that it does not contain parabens, is not tested on animals, and is 97% natural &amp; 71% organic.  </li>
            <li> I use this nightly and can see a considerable amount of difference.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well into the skin leaving your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much so this should last you awhile.</li>
            <li> When I started I had three distinct lines in my forehead with the lower and middle being solid fully across the area.</li>
            <li> In just a few days, I noticed a significant difference on my face.  </li>
            <li> I actually find that my skin feels smoother and tighter when using the Retinol, which amazes me because the weather is so bitter right now that I normally would be battling winter skin.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and retinol is a revolutionary complex that combines soothing aloe, shea butter &amp; green tea for incredibly safe, effective way to boost collagen, minimize wrinkles &amp; sagginess for stronger and firmer skin that reverses the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> a week and a half later, the skin felt baby smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never really been into cleaning my face before going to bed, or using any skin creams, but after seeing how much smoother my skin looked when I used Rewind, I don&#x27;t know why I wouldn&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> I have been finding that a lot of them have witch hazel, which is fine in moderation, but using this daily can cause dryness, and prolonged everyday use can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and normally, creams either irritate me to the point in which I get a rash or dry my skin out and make it flaky, both of which are a pain in the tail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week, and if my skin was going to pitch a fit it would have already done so.  </li>
            <li> I expected to only be able to use it every other day or so</li>
            <li> As much as I put my face through daily, I have finally found a product to help renew my skin to its radiant self.</li>
            <li> Anti-aging ingredients come and go, but retinoids have been major players for decades.</li>
            <li> I also keep one in my purse and use as a hand lotion after washing my hands as I have very dry hands because I wash them so much</li>
            <li> I really do not have a strong opinion either way on the subject yet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to it, but to be honest have not used it long enough to be able to see any long term anti aging results.</li>
            <li> Plus, it can improve skin tone and color for generally younger-looking, even skin.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol stimulates cell turnover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always careful about moisturizers and any skin care products really.</li>
            <li> I treated my face twice-per-week, because my skin is naturally oilly, especially around my nose, chin, and forehead.</li>
            <li> As far as my wrinkles, I definitely think they are improved.</li>
            <li> so I can keep wearing a bare face.</li>
            <li> This vitamin A derivative helps skin produce collagen, a natural component of the dermis that gives skin its youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol gives skin an overall healthier appearance.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to whom has a dry skin.</li>
            <li> This skin cream is viscous and milky white, with a fresh fragrance that is neutral or perhaps slightly herbal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see a subtle difference in the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> If you have especially sensitive skin, try it every other night.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I have larger pores and I&#x27;m never completely happy with anything I try.</li>
            <li> When used with sunscreen it seems to be working on my arms slowly clearing spots of skin on my forearm and the light liver spots I had on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days I started using it, I broke out a little.  </li>
            <li> Being in my early 70&#x27;s,  I thought I was doomed to dry, wrinkly skin....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin is softer and fine lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I live in Michigan and the air can sometimes be very dry since I have to run the heat during the evenings to keep the house at a moderate temperature</li>
            <li> It is so much softer, and there are less visible lines, especially around my mouth and eyes.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I have tried dozens and dozens of products, I was so shocked and surprised</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and the dark spots slowly dissappear.</li>
            <li> This one needs time to soak in to do its natural and organic age-defying transformation, from treating acme to polishing away dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to decide.  </li>
            <li> With a pile of dead skin cells on your face, products have a tough time penetrating this top layer and can&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next morning, I could noticeably tell that my pores were smaller and my forehead wrinkles less obvious.</li>
            <li> So far this has not dried out my skin as other retinol treatments in the past have done.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and took precaution steps applying just a little in the beginning.</li>
            <li> My only other experience with skin care is a sample testing of Epionce which did resolve some minor rosacea in my checks when used regularly; this has not worked on the rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for as long as even a month, but this is what I can say about it</li>
            <li> I just received this product which I haven&#x27;t been using that long.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term results will be.</li>
            <li> is the noticeable improvement to tiny fine lines I&#x27;d started seeing, to the overall texture of my facial skin, decreased pore size, and lightening of age spots &amp; small scarring from both chin acne &amp; other scars from accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i did hav3 to cut back to every other night.</li>
            <li> I have tossed all of my other facial creams in the trash to use this one product exclusively and permanently!</li>
            <li> It seems very light and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily and dry - it&#x27;s a bummer.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> , this cured my chronic dry hands in 24 hours of using this...</li>
            <li> After only two weeks using this cream, my 40+ face is looking quite a few years younger.</li>
            <li> I even got through a summer with no new freckles  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  starting to see a change in my complexion, this product works plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many very expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I had a very disturbing patch of thick skin forming on my cheek before I started using the Retinol night cream and the rose hip oil daily.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something to help replace that natural glow and moisturizer my dull skin.</li>
            <li> Because of this I have to be careful with what I use.</li>
            <li> so turning back the clock is an everyday goal of mine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days now, and I already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no way there is &amp;#34;2.5%&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> At 61 my skin is showing bigger pores and a few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days, but it has not irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> It really hard for me to give 5 star ratings particularly for a product type I have little to no experience with</li>
            <li> Not  strong enough</li>
            <li> My skin is the typical combination T-zone type, dry but sometimes oily on the nose, chin and forehead</li>
            <li> My skin is slightly on the dry side</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave an oily residue as other creams.  </li>
            <li> planning on researching this company to see if they have any other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It contains retinol in a base of mostly botanical ingredients including oils, glycerin, and fatty acids, with vitamins such as E and B5, as well as the vitamin</li>
            <li> I will however continue to use it for the other benefits</li>
            <li> Use SPF 15+ daily.&amp;#34; I was like I don&#x27;t want to use this product if I don&#x27;t have those other products that needs to be applied after this because I dont have</li>
            <li> I decided to try it every other night instead.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Got the item the other day</li>
            <li> I usually struggle with hormonal breakouts on a monthly basis...but even that has been improved since starting this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every 3 days, as directed, but will be soon switching to every other night.  </li>
            <li> I also have noticed that spots that are slightly darker due to scarring are lighting up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be really hard to only use it every couple of nights.</li>
            <li> 10 days of applying it night after night, I notice the rash-like bumps in my face is clearing up, dark spots from my pimples is lightening and my skin looks healthier now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and no strong fragrance, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to any dramatic results as far as rewinding any aging( I&#x27;m 36 and didn&#x27;t have any issue with wrinkles yet, or crows feet)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed less acne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brighter, smoother and wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> They are softer and slightly smoother.</li>
            <li> And it costs way less than the prescriptions did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little while but this retinol product works.</li>
            <li> A little will go</li>
            <li> I am always a little worried about applying products to my skin.</li>
            <li> In the past i have tried some other retinol creams and i have found some that i like</li>
            <li> But after reading all about the product description, and the I get less skeptical about it because its ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always ready for disappointment.</li>
            <li> Brown spots are lighter in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll revisit in a few weeks to share about my....</li>
            <li> I will update the review in a few weeks probably.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see the changes in just a few weeks of using every 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using the retinol face cream for a few weeks now and saw improvements in my skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen noticeable results after using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> ingredients include: 97% Natural/71% Organic: Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Sunflower Oil, Palm Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Vitamin E, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Wildcrafted Propolis, Shea Butter, Vitamin B5,</li>
            <li> Takes a few weeks for your skin to get acclimated, which is why they suggest 2x per week until your skin can tolerate.  </li>
            <li> It literally takes me a few seconds before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I have not used it but a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, and there is no strong odor.</li>
            <li> It is a 4 ounce bottle, and it takes very little.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit thick.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how it compares to prescription retinols.</li>
            <li> I was experimenting &amp; hoping it would take away a small stretch mark on my stomach</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often struggled with moisturizer sinking in, then leaving a layer of oil slick in my t-zone.</li>
            <li> The retinol creams I&#x27;ve purchased in the past were not &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; creams.</li>
            <li> I use this, and I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> While retinol works to reduce telltale signs of aging, it also treats &amp;#34;acne-ridden skin,&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is less irritating than retinoids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It soothes delicate skin when applied and then protects it from loss of moisture and promotes healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say although it&#x27;s a lotion, not a time machine or plastic surgeon, so don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning, late afternoon, and at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> My face had bad acne after a few days of using it and lasted until I finally gave up on the product.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat thick as you would expect from a cream product.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other night because I am guilty of grabbing rays of sunshine</li>
            <li> I will re-purchase when I run out of it because is has helped me solve a serious skin issue.</li>
            <li> Probably not good for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The package design is really slick and also gender neutral, so I didn&#x27;t feel weird being a guy and using it.</li>
            <li> My frown lines have decreased as well.</li>
            <li> seriously try it!</li>
            <li> Breaks me out really badly. :/</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to try yet another face cream.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> I would, however, recommend this product if you want to give someone you don&#x27;t like terrible acne!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this night cream.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin but it&#x27;s also sensitive. Because of this I have to be careful with what I use. Since I purchased this I have used it every night and have seen a noticeable change in my skin, it is much softer and very moisturized. This product has also not made my skin break out in anyway. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wake up and my skin is so refresed and soft</li>
            <li> Nice and creamy. Comes out in a correct proportion, too.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream. Feels great on skin. Only have used it one week so I am not sure how it compares to prescription retinols.</li>
            <li> Does not leave an oily residue as other creams.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results after regular use!!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I&#x27;m on the starter portion of it where you only use it twice a week and I really like it so far!  I feel like I&#x27;m already seeing some fine lines disappear!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I have very oily skin and this is not heavy on ur skin. But use it as directed because it can make ur face very sensitive</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of results I would receive when I brought this evening facial moisturizer. I&#x27;m actually very happy to say that with only applying before bed my skin is feeling nice and aive inthe morning. I live in Michigan and the air can sometimes be very dry since I have to run the heat during the evenings to keep the house at a moderate temperature and I wake up in the morning not only feeling thirsty but as if my skin has been zapped of all moisture. with evening applications I have found that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel a spark but when I wake up. The easy to use pump also makes applying just enough easier. I do not experience any burning sensations nor does it feel too greasy.</li>
            <li> First off, the packaging is beautiful! It is such a nice, luxurious-looking bottle. I am only in my twenties, but I tend to laugh quite a bit and find that I need to start taking better care of my skin. A nice, light-weight formula. I was provided this product with a significant discount to provide a review.</li>
            <li> I like that this product has no sulfates or phthalates. I have sensitive skin and this has not irritated it. It has moisturized my skin and has helped my skin look brighter.</li>
            <li> I just did a facial on one of my regular clients and her skin looks amazing.  She has used this product for only one week and I can see a visible differance.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while but this retinol product works. Like all retinol products it leaves your skin a little more sensitive, and you need to use a good sunscreen if you use this product because else you will get really easily a sunburn. I am happy with the slight changes I noticed - at 38, some wrinkles have popped up, and the retinol cream seems to help with them a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love this product will buy again.two weeks and can tell a major difference</li>
            <li> I started addi g this to my nightly rutine about  2 weeks ago. It works great and i did hav3 to cut back to every other night. Ive used retinol surum daily so i disregarded the directions  stating to use just a couple  times a week. I woke up with a red face but nothing  that didnt go away after applying my lotion. This twlls me its stronger than im used to which is a great thing.  I love the way my skin glows the follimg mornings after using this lotion!</li>
            <li> i got this at discounted price. so far i like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin is softer and fine lines less noticeable.  You can only use it at night since it does contain retinol and I do wear sunscreen daily.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and retinol is a revolutionary complex that combines soothing aloe, shea butter &amp; green tea for incredibly safe, effective way to boost collagen, minimize wrinkles &amp; sagginess for stronger and firmer skin that reverses the signs of aging. I am sharing this with my daughter who is using it to get rid of her acne &amp; acne scars. She has sensitive skin, just like me &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin. I&#x27;m happy to report that we have been seeing great results with product!</li>
            <li> The basics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light and very pleasant; texture and consistency is perfect and not at all greasy-feeling; it contains an almost-unheard of level of 91% natural/71% organic ingredients with aloe, antioxidant green tea, shea butter &amp; vitamins A, E, &amp; B5, and 2.5% retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed in the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using this is the noticeable improvement to tiny fine lines I&#x27;d started seeing, to the overall texture of my facial skin, decreased pore size, and lightening of age spots &amp; small scarring from both chin acne &amp; other scars from accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it nightly, following a cleansing and toning ritual that I&#x27;ve done for years. If you have especially sensitive skin, try it every other night.</li>
            <li> I am in awe of this amazing product!  I have tried many of the top name (and expensive) anti-aging moisturizers and serums and this one has worked wonders for my skin.  I just turned 49 so turning back the clock is an everyday goal of mine.  I noticed (as did many of my friends and family) almost immediate results with my skin feeling smoother, tighter and appearing more radiant!  I plan to continue using this product and am confident the results will only get better.  I feel and look younger!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice nighttime face cream.  Smells nice &amp; feels good.  I was experimenting &amp; hoping it would take away a small stretch mark on my stomach but it did not.  :(  Oh well, still nice for the face.</li>
            <li> Retinol Night Cream is a wonderful product that I would highly recommend. I have very sensitive skin and normally, creams either irritate me to the point in which I get a rash or dry my skin out and make it flaky, both of which are a pain in the tail. However, with Retinol I do not have that problem at all! I actually find that my skin feels smoother and tighter when using the Retinol, which amazes me because the weather is so bitter right now that I normally would be battling winter skin. I also have noticed that spots that are slightly darker due to scarring are lighting up. I love that it is light, not greasy, and all natural. I would definitely recommend this product at any age, as I am thirty and notice the positive effects!</li>
            <li> love this cream so much.  My skin is firmer since using this and skins spots have faded.  Skin feels so soft and smooth after using this.  I love it</li>
            <li> I love that this product improves my skin tone and texture in addition to clearing my hormonal acne. I highly recommend this cream!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face moisturizing cream by far. I have seen a noticeable improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance and feel. My face and neck haven&#x27;t felt this soft since I was a teenager. And the best part is the pores on my nose have become noticeably smaller. My skin is the typical combination T-zone type, dry but sometimes oily on the nose, chin and forehead and it works great on both combo skin qualities. I use this lotion twice a day.&#x60;</li>
            <li> Love this product! It has really helped moisturize my face. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a great product at a great price. I&#x27;m an Esthetician and always pay attention to the ingredients in all facial and body products. I have been finding that a lot of them have witch hazel, which is fine in moderation, but using this daily can cause dryness, and prolonged everyday use can cause irritation. This is the one product at an amazing price that did not contain witch hazel, and all the good stuff is listed as the first ingredients. Which shows the quality. I just started using this yesterday, and it already feels fantastic. I have extremely sensitive, dry skin, and usually can feel an adverse affect immediately, but so far so good! I will update my review after a couple weeks!</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Best retinol cream ever, great customer service. Will stick with this cream  for sure.</li>
            <li> Not  strong enough I didn&#x27;t feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add extra moisture to my skin at night and I started using it every other day because of the retinol and its working great.  It hydrates and my skin feels silky smooth in the morning.  I have sensitive skin and I like that it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and it just works as it&#x27;s suppose to.  thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always careful about moisturizers and any skin care products really. My face is super sensitive. It&#x27;s oily and dry - it&#x27;s a bummer. On top of that, I have larger pores and I&#x27;m never completely happy with anything I try. So many products irritate my face. I&#x27;m the girl that is always visiting Sephora, getting samples to try before spending a fortune. Once in a while, I&#x27;ll find something but it&#x27;s difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received this Retinol Night Cream, I let it sit around for a couple of days before I used it. I&#x27;m always ready for disappointment. This was very smooth to touch and made my face feel like silk (no joke). I noticed a big difference after applying in the way my skin felt. It went on very even and was weightless. It&#x27;s going to be really hard to only use it every couple of nights. I want to put it on my face more often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on researching this company to see if they have any other products. I would love to find something that makes my skin feel just as amazing to wear under my makeup on a daily basis. It would be great if they come out with an entire line that includes a cleanser, toner, night cream and daily moisturizer. I would definitely be a regular customer and recommend the products to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was exactly what I was hoping for! Definitely the best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days now, and I already notice a difference. It&#x27;s not greasy and no strong fragrance, and a little bit goes a long way. A great purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. My face seems smoother and I can see the fine lines getting less noticeable Very happy with this product and will be a regular customer..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  Works great!</li>
            <li> feels really good on the face</li>
            <li> This skin cream is viscous and milky white, with a fresh fragrance that is neutral or perhaps slightly herbal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains retinol in a base of mostly botanical ingredients including oils, glycerin, and fatty acids, with vitamins such as E and B5, as well as the vitamin A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soothes delicate skin when applied and then protects it from loss of moisture and promotes healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a pump cap that easily dispenses a large drop.  A little will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be applied after bathing or washing and allowed to be absorbed into the skin and then followed with application of a gentle moisturizer, with sunscreen in the morning.  Be sure to apply it to any areas with fine wrinkles or damage from sunlight, such as around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Life Labs provided a bottle of night cream for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream. It smells good, nothing overwhelming.  It minimizes pores, clears acne and smoothes wrinkles.  My favorite serum thus far.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer! Will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect night cream. It has a professional strength percentage of Retinol that works to reduce wrinkles, lighten skin, reduce pores, etc. This cream has moisturizers built in for those like me who have more sensitive skin. There is no greasy feel to it. Your skin will feel smoother and look better. And if you don&#x27;t like your results, there is a money back guarantee. I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> Good results, thanks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for as long as even a month, but this is what I can say about it; it delivers the perfect amount of moisture. I&#x27;ve often struggled with moisturizer sinking in, then leaving a layer of oil slick in my t-zone. Not this . It has not irritated and has seemed to contribute positively to my current skin regimen. I can&#x27;t speak to any dramatic results as far as rewinding any aging( I&#x27;m 36 and didn&#x27;t have any issue with wrinkles yet, or crows feet) but I&#x27;m definitely willing to keep using it for as long as it takes to fairly assess.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on my skin. My skin is loosing is natural glow. Decided to give Retinol Night Cream a try. With an upcoming wedding of my son, I was not looking forward to all the pictures. I wanted something to help replace that natural glow and moisturizer my dull skin. I was very surprised at how much better my skin looks and feels. I feel younger and look younger. My makeup goes on smoother</li>
            <li> Love the feel on my skin before bed.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days I started using it, I broke out a little.  But, as with any new skin routine, my face needed to get used to it.  Now, just after about 9 days, my skin is so much better!!!  My pores are smaller, my skin looks tighter and brighter, and it just feels nice.  I would definitely suggest this to someone.</li>
            <li> So far this has not dried out my skin as other retinol treatments in the past have done. I do still recommend a sunscreen during the day to prevent burning.</li>
            <li> This night cream has a very pleasant scent. It&#x27;s not overwhelming but it is there so people with sensitivities to scents should be aware. Customer service is excellent, they respond quickly and are super helpful. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a short time but so far I like it although I&#x27;ve not noticed any remarkable changes as of yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for a week now and absolutely love it! The bottle itself is so pretty and looks great in my bathroom. Killer product and great look!</li>
            <li> I can feel this working. Brown spots are lighter in just a few days. I took a before picture and will take one each week to compare !</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best face cream I have ever used.  I have menopausal skin and still breakout.  This targets both the wrinkles and acne.  I was using the most popular over the counter drug store brand for deep wrinkles which left my skin irritated.  This cream leaves my skin smooth and acne-free.  I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER CREAM!  Please don&#x27;t stop making this product.  It is truly a winner!</li>
            <li> Who says you can&#x27;t go green and still look gorgeous? Anti-aging ingredients come and go, but retinoids have been major players for decades. This class of vitamin A derivatives has been used in skin care since the ’70s. UV protection; smoother, firmer skin; a more even tone; fewer breakouts; and tighter pores.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love it --- I  am on my second one.....feels good, works good, looks good!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.  I love putting this on my skin because I feel that it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> It seems to working very well.</li>
            <li> been using it for a few days; so far so good .. we&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> This product having such high reviews and being all natural was the main reason I purchased it. I love that I can rely on other like minded consumers to tell me how the product worked for them. Since I rely on others opinions I always try to write me own.. I did love that feel of this product and how smooth it went it. It is beautifully packaged like many are saying.  It is great for moisturizing however i haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in fine lines and wrinkles.. I mainly have the crows feet around my eyes when I smile so maybe it&#x27;s the enough for this. I will however continue to use it for the other benefits and I do think it will aid in preventing fine lines and wrinkles as well.</li>
            <li> Product works great. Would def buy again</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing product!!! I love this moisturizer and use it as my night cream every night. It&#x27;s creamy but not greasy and keeps my skin tight and looking great!</li>
            <li> Great skin coverage and feels great.  Seems to be working well with my skin!</li>
            <li> Works better than anything u have used. I&#x27;ve tried many very expensive brands. I have found a new go to recommended to friends and others</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said this product is a complete hoax.  There is absolutely no way there is &amp;#34;2.5%&amp;#34; retinol in this cream!  If it was you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it on amazon and it wouldn&#x27;t be this price.  I feel so ripped off and how people buy into these kinds of products makes me want to stop using amazon altogether sometimes.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist told me to start using a retinol product to help lighten age marks and fine lines. When this opportunity became available to get this product I jumped on it as it has 2.5% Retinol.  The cream goes on non greasy and very easy with the user friendly airless pump.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how my face feels once applied and along with Aloe and Shea Butter it&#x27;s a win win for skin care.  I started using it just at night but have decided to apply it in the morning after a shower as well.  I&#x27;m  starting to see a change in my complexion, this product works plain and simple. I hope everyone out there with similar issues gives it a try you will not be dissapointed</li>
            <li> I like this retinol night cream. It is light and not greasy at all like some night creams I have tried before. I noticed since I started using it that my pores have shrunk and I have a nice glow to my skin as well as a more even skin tone. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised also that I have had no breakouts although I have very sensitive skin and breakout easily.</li>
            <li> its is good product my aunt like this one thank you so much to having this one</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product so far.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week, and if my skin was going to pitch a fit it would have already done so.  No issues, no reactions, no sensitivity.  Feels great going on.  Nice formula, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> just there no changes not 100% chemical free</li>
            <li> Very good product and very happy with my purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful retinol cream. The retinol creams I&#x27;ve purchased in the past were not &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; creams. This one needs time to soak in to do its natural and organic age-defying transformation, from treating acme to polishing away dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a list of respectable ingredients, keep in mind your skin&#x27;s texture. If you have dry skin, you may can use this product more than twice-per-week. I could not. I treated my face twice-per-week, because my skin is naturally oilly, especially around my nose, chin, and forehead. I would like to make special note that retinol can work magic on the neck area where time has written rows of lines in a woman&#x27;s skin. Keep up with your application schedule. The lines will fade within weeks, and you&#x27;ll be a new woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a difference between looking young and everyone not being able to shut up about it ;)</li>
            <li> I like this product but it&#x27;s not for me. It made me break out. So I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff it&#x27;s really good. My skin id&#x27;s glowing again!</li>
            <li> I waited until I&#x27;d used a whole bottle before writing this review- It lasted exactly three months using it every night. I need two pumps to generously cover my face. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say although it&#x27;s a lotion, not a time machine or plastic surgeon, so don&#x27;t expect miracles. That being said, my skin looks fantastic. I have sensitive skin and this never irritated my face or made me break out even though I use it daily. I expected to only be able to use it every other day or so but it is exceptionally gentle. It has no odor and absorbs well. It really is a perfect night cream. I haven&#x27;t noticed much wrinkle reduction (I&#x27;m 48) but fine lines are a tad diminished. For me it has worked best at lightening dark spots. Sun spots which were just starting are gone and those that had been around a while are definitely lighter.(Again, they didn&#x27;t vanish, but are lighter.)  I even got through a summer with no new freckles  My skin is bright and clear and feels incredibly smooth and soft. I also appreciate it being all natural. Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product and I promptly reordered when I started running low. If your expectations are reasonable it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. My face is really looking better.</li>
            <li> Easily applied and absorbed, and no breakouts! I found it was easy to incorporate into my routine.</li>
            <li> Works so well as a night lotion. I don&#x27;t wake up looking like a mombie when I remember to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed. After only two weeks using this cream, my 40+ face is looking quite a few years younger. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Have had very good results with this cream. It is gentle yet very effective and if you start to use it daily can cause some peeling so pace yourself and watch how your own skin reacts. I feel that it has made a noticeable difference in the quality of my skin (55+) which is now visibly smoother with fewer fine lines and still some deeper ones but we&#x27;re working on those (creams can only do so much against time and this cream does a great job)</li>
            <li> Use it with and eye syrum and you can see a difference in a week</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Reduced lines and wrinkles. Skin is more firm. My age 58. Priced decently.</li>
            <li> My skin already looks years younger!!! Honestly I have tried dozens and dozens of products, I was so shocked and surprised when I woke up to my skin lines faded and looking much smoother and younger!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this Retinol Night Cream by Pure Labs for 4 days and I can already see a huge difference in my pores on my nose and the flakiness on sides of nose is gone too! I&#x27;m 53 and have mild crow&#x27;s feet, the 11 at bridge of noise, marionette lines and wrinkles on edge of upper lip. I&#x27;m excited to see what this product will  for my &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m just so surprised that I&#x27;m also seeing a natural rosy look to my cheeks that I haven&#x27;t had in ages! I&#x27;ll revisit in a few weeks to share about my....uhh, dare I say it, wrinkles. Thank you so much for an organic product that works and doesn&#x27;t take a mortgage to pay for it!!</li>
            <li> Breaks me out really badly. :/</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in a short period of time..I used it at night ,my face skin feels so soft and better after...looking forward for more changes with this product...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I really love this night cream and the way it makes my skin feel. I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with breaking out or itching. There are few products on the market that I&#x27;ve been able to use but this will be a favorite and I will definitely re-order it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great Product, Great Service. My Retinol Night Cream was delivered quickly, in nice packaging. The pump works well, giving the perfect amount. This moisturizer feels great!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am really amazed by this product! I have been using it for a few days now, and many of my fine lines are disappearing. Many other products claim to do this, but this is the first one that actually has. It&#x27;s not greasy, and there is no strong odor. I really like the packaging too. It looks nice on my vanity, and the pump action works smoothly. I highly recommend Retinol night cream to everyone.</li>
            <li> I thought retinol would be drying, but this leaves my face feeling very hydrated. I was satisfied enough with the results to order it again, and will keep using it in the future. I am using it along with a very good daytime product, so I can&#x27;t be sure which product is responsible for what, but I&#x27;m not going to mess with good results.</li>
            <li> Works great on damaged skin</li>
            <li> it was only this year that i started to pay attention to the fine lines that were starting to appear.  being a person with no beauty regimen, i thought i&#x27;d give it a try.  after a few days, fine lines were still there, but my face started to look clearer and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.  a week and a half later, the skin felt baby smooth. almost a month later (and i used this maybe 5 times a week at most), the fine lines by my eyes.... gone.</li>
            <li> Loving this product. At 61 my skin is showing bigger pores and a few wrinkles. My pores have shrunk and my skin feels smoother. It is a 4 ounce bottle, and it takes very little. Dries quickly also. My age spots on my neck are fading and almost gone.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It does not feel greasy and makes my skin feel hydrated. Over all, I&#x27;m seeing improvements on my skin and I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 weeks now and have not noticed any difference in appearance on my face. I do like that it is organic, but for the price I guess I expected to see better results</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pump out much, I have a big face, lol.</li>
            <li> This night cream works beautifully.  My skin feels so soft and renewed in the morning after using it.  I have extremely dry skin and I battle to keep my skin moisturized every day.  I add a little rose hip oil to my regime at night with this product.  I had a very disturbing patch of thick skin forming on my cheek before I started using the Retinol night cream and the rose hip oil daily.  The patch is almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;Receiving this product at a discount was a nice bonus.  I will re-purchase when I run out of it because is has helped me solve a serious skin issue.</li>
            <li> I just received this product which I haven&#x27;t been using that long. I will update the review in a few weeks probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I really love thing organic and natural. This product is 97% natural and 71% organic. It isn&#x27;t 100% but its better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge huge fan of moisturizers that have a strong smell or that feels heavy. I am really pleased with this product. It isn&#x27;t heavy and for the most part it is unscented. I also like that it has aloe Vera in it! That is a must have ingredient for any of my moisturizers..</li>
            <li> Not what  I expected doesnot work that great wouldn&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face look ....and also works on hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a week and can already feel the difference.</li>
            <li> so far so good, I feel my skin is brighter and I&#x27;ve noticed less acne</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh... You MUST try this!  It works amazingly well &amp;amp; has left my face so, so soft!  Even after the 1st application &amp;amp; I can only imagine how great this will work over a long period of use.&lt;br /&gt;Ok... Here&#x27;s an update after using this product for 2 weeks exclusively on my skin... I have tossed all of my other facial creams in the trash to use this one product exclusively and permanently! It is by far the very best I have ever used!  I use it on my face, neck, chest, hands and my arms… And it has improved the quality, clarity, smoothness, and texture of mine skin!  I apply it in the morning, late afternoon, and at bedtime.  I also keep one in my purse and use as a hand lotion after washing my hands as I have very dry hands because I wash them so much, this cured my chronic dry hands in 24 hours of using this... The back of my hands used to split open from over washing but now I have REWIND to heal it right up &amp;amp; the BEST part of it, is it improves the appearance and quality of my skin… thank you pure life labs, please don&#x27;t ever stop making this!  I sure wish you sold this in a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> My skin does feel softer with this product but did not notice any difference in the way my face looked.  It did not soften any lines or even make my face peel which you would think so with 2.5% retinol.</li>
            <li> At the beginning I was scared of using this product because in the directions it states &#x27;&#x27;Moisturizer should follow serum, if used. Use SPF 15+ daily.&amp;#34; I was like I don&#x27;t want to use this product if I don&#x27;t have those other products that needs to be applied after this because I dont have or I dont put any SPF in my skin and I&#x27;m living in a state where I feel its always summer. But after reading all about the product description, and the I get less skeptical about it because its ingredients are all natural. First time I applied the cream, you will instantly feel refreshed. It has a cooling effect in the skin, I&#x27;m thinking maybe because it has aloe in it. 10 days of applying it night after night, I notice the rash-like bumps in my face is clearing up, dark spots from my pimples is lightening and my skin looks healthier now.  I got the retinol face cream in a great discounted price, and I have put my experience with this product in my own experience and honest words. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to have a healthy skin, it works and worth every penny you spent.</li>
            <li> My skins seems smoother since I&#x27;ve started using this. Can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term results will be.</li>
            <li> As an African American it did not thing for my skin.</li>
            <li> This has become my go-to nightly cream at bedtime. I feel like it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Awesome organic Retinol night cream!! How cool is that to find a great night cream that contains 2.5% Retinal. My skin feels so refreshed after using it for the first time. Nothing like having your skin feel like a newborn baby!!! That&#x27;s happened a after every use of this great serum.  I receive this product on a discount price or free for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Great product started using immediately. Love the smell. Love the softness it leaves on my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic.  So easily absorbed by the skin. I can see the changes in just a few weeks of using every 3 days. I will definitely continue to use this nectar of the Gods.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and the company that makes it! After just one use I woke up to brighter looking skin and faded acne scaring. I&#x27;ve used Retinol before but never at this strength or quality. Follow the directions exactly and be sure to follow with a moisturizer. I experienced some tingling and drying after the first few applications but that quickly went away with the addition of a moisturizer. Also, I love the follow-up emails from the company asking how I like the product and if I have any concerns. Who does that in this day and age?! I definitely recommend this product and will be buying more way before I run out! I am 51 years old and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time!</li>
            <li> Amazing retinol cream ! I purchased this cream for my mom and her skin looks amazing after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I have been using the retinol face cream for a few weeks now and saw improvements in my skin appearance. I have a sensitive skin and took precaution steps applying just a little in the beginning. I will continue to use this product for sure.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. After three weeks of use I do notice a difference in the skin on my face. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I am starting at a 4 star and may adjust. It really hard for me to give 5 star ratings particularly for a product type I have little to no experience with so I am reserving judgement to some extent. I am 59 and this is my first experience with retinol. The reviews of this product convinced me to try it. The main factors were the lack of scent and most being able to tolerate the effects without any substantial negatives for most users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product daily for 6 weeks [plus two week start up/skin test]. When I started I had three distinct lines in my forehead with the lower and middle being solid fully across the area. The upper line is now only visible at the corners of the forehead and the middle line has &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; into two parts. The lowest line has narrowed enough that a scar from an injury when I was 6 is more prominent than the line is now [I had forgotten all about it not seeing in for {?} years]. I believe that collagen around the eyes has increased but photo evidence does not yet confirm that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still testing the effects on skin color and have been using it on my forearms to aid in restoring uniform skin color. When used with sunscreen it seems to be working on my arms slowly clearing spots of skin on my forearm and the light liver spots I had on the back of my hands. The recovery is not uniform across the skin but is releasing the stored melatonin on the forearm. My bald head has not shown the same effect. My only other experience with skin care is a sample testing of Epionce which did resolve some minor rosacea in my checks when used regularly; this has not worked on the rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally this does seem to have some effect on craping but it is the hardest to quantify and exists mostly on my arms and the back of my hands. I really do not have a strong opinion either way on the subject yet.</li>
            <li> I am 52 with fair skin that blushes easily and tends to get red and blotchy.  This potion is a wonder! It glides on like silk, soaks right in, with no oily feel.  After using it every night for a couple of months, I really see a difference. My skin is smoother, my pores are smaller, and my skin tone is more even.  It really works.  Also, the customer service is excellent. I don&#x27;t review many products, but wanted to share the good news about this one!  Try it!</li>
            <li> Customer service seemed great, as is the packaging (hence the 2 stars vs 1), but the product really did not work for me. I&#x27;ve never had acne until I used this face cream. I kept up with it from April--&amp;#62; July just in case it was taking a while for my skin to get used to it, even reducing the amount from every day as suggested to every 3 days. My face had bad acne after a few days of using it and lasted until I finally gave up on the product. I didn&#x27;t notice any positive changes to my skin during these months. My skin is slightly on the dry side and I do not have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to necessarily deter anyone from using the product (especially based on all the raving reviews it has received), but it personally did not work for me. I would, however, recommend this product if you want to give someone you don&#x27;t like terrible acne!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I am only 21 but I was told that it would help with acne and blemishes and it definitely worked! My acne cleared up and face looks really smoothe and healthy now! Such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Too early to share my result but this is a great natural retinol night cream and affordable</li>
            <li> This is, bar none, the best organic retinol product I have found. I used it first as an anti-aging cream at night for one month. I am honestly impressed with its performance. My skin is very soft, feels more supple, and looks super. I then had my teen daughter use it for her acne, which also works very well. It helps to unclog pores and prevent outbreaks. The best part for us is the organic content, the fact that renewable energy is used to produce it, no synthetic colors, or fragrance, and the bottle is BPA, BPF, AND BPA FREE, and Made in the USA! We will both continue to use it and will recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  The texture of my face and neck has changed in a weeks time. I love the fact that it is organic and does not irritate my skin. I have many years of sun damage on my face, this product makes my skin look refreshed! so happy I found this thank you!</li>
            <li> Only a week into using this product and I can already see improvement in my skin tone and texture. I am 52 years old and have rosacea. Needless to say, I was very skeptical. In addition to my face and neck, I have been applying to the back of my hands and can see an improvement on them as well. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product! I will post again after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Ok Ladies, this product is a must have.  In just a few days, I noticed a significant difference on my face.  It&#x27;s brighter, smoother and wrinkles less noticeable.  Thank you Pure Life Labs for thinking of us!!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found this product! I can see such a difference in a short period of time. The lines are disappearing - this  is just amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into my early twenties and have very few wrinkles; however this &#x60;anti-aging&#x27; product seemed too good to pass on. Right off the bat it has helped to clear up breakouts and erase blemishes. My skin feels firmer and fresher every day since I&#x27;ve began using this product. I&#x27;ve heard doctors recommend women start using retinol products in their 20&#x27;s and it&#x27;s easy now to see why. As much as I put my face through daily, I have finally found a product to help renew my skin to its radiant self.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has a soft silky texture. I was looking for a night time retinol and this one seems to be doing the trick. I can see a subtle difference in the fine lines on my face. They are softer and slightly smoother. I feel like with continued use I will see even better results in the future!</li>
            <li> Amazing, I used Every night I feel my face like  New</li>
            <li> The retinol face cream is an excellent value for the money. I&#x27;ve seen noticeable results after using this for a few weeks now. My skin is now even tone and have a smoother texture. It is also good at keeping my skin moisturized. It also helped minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and even reducing acne breakouts. It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly. Totally love this product!  I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I gave this away as a house warming present.&lt;br /&gt;According to her &amp;#34;very skin conscientious&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;She LOVES it, especially for it being over the counter.</li>
            <li> Love this so much!  As a 40 year with the start of wrinkles, I was looking for a good retinol cream that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin too much - this is it!  It leaves my skin feeling and looking so smooth and not red at all.  I will most definitely continue using this!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it just like Skinthera recommended and am now to the point where I am using it nightly. Each morning my skin looks better and better. I need to show before and after pics! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I am very cautious about what I put on my skin, using only natural ingredients, and I am loving this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have sensitive skin and this face cream is awesome!</li>
            <li> skin feels refreshed from the first day</li>
            <li> This year, I have been searching for new and better ways to look and feel younger and healthier. I am always a little worried about applying products to my skin. Worried that my skin might get irritated. Decided to give it a try after I red up on the product.&lt;br /&gt;I received the night cream on time and intact. The bottle was eye catching.&lt;br /&gt;It says to wash face and apply nightly. I decided to try it every other night instead. I have to say, I do see an improvement after just 1 week. I have been applying it to my face, neck and hands. The skin feels and looks fantastic. I have noticed the skin appears tighter and younger looking. I am simply amazed.</li>
            <li> Really like this cream. It seems very light and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I did not notice any improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have used everything available and this has been the best.. I&#x27;m 53 and my skin is so soft. I use it every night</li>
            <li> This was very soft and smooth feeling and contains the natural vitamins your skin needs. The bottle was easy to use and hold, fits perfectly in purse or diaper bag for when your skin needs that pick me up. It absorbed well and did not leave any residue and was just as easy to remove to re apply.Did not notice any allergy related products in question.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly Very good indeed !</li>
            <li> Omg this night cream has  silky feeling going on your face. I really saw results the first night I used the product. Didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling at all. I also like the pump dispenser. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice retinol cream! I prefer to use my retinol at night and this is a night specific cream! It has a nice smell. It is definitely a cream consistency - white and opaque. It goes on nicely and sinks into your skin well. I always follow up with a moisturizer. I really like how it has 2.5% retinol! The best part though?? That it is NATURAL, ORGANIC &amp; PARABAN FREE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include: 97% Natural/71% Organic: Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Sunflower Oil, Palm Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Vitamin E, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Wildcrafted Propolis, Shea Butter, Vitamin B5, Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has an airless pump so it stays sterile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!</li>
            <li> I am always really iffy on amazon reviews because sometimes I feel like they are posted by people that are paid to do so... but I bought this face cream anyway based on the good reviews. I have used it for a little over 2 months and my skin looks the best it has in YEARS! It is brighter and has a more even skin tone. I feel it has minimized my pores (although it may just be my imagination). As far as my wrinkles, I definitely think they are improved. They aren&#x27;t gone by any means, but they do look better. I&#x27;m only in my late 20&#x27;s so I really don&#x27;t have have a ton of wrinkles, but the wrinkles on forehead are pretty pronounced. I tried Nerium for a couple of months and it did nothing. This stuff is so great!! seriously try it!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. So soothing.</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream.  It did not feel greasy or make my skin oil and did not irritate my skin.  You only need a very small amount and it goes a long way.  The bottle is beautiful and I really like the pump that is included with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  My skin looks and feels better than it has in years.  Would love more Skinthera products.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! Nice and light but extremely moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
            <li> Got the item the other day and I love the packaging/color first of all.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the pump mechanism is perfect for dispensing the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used it last night and I must say, when I woke this AM, I thought my skin looked better (?) fresher?&lt;br /&gt;Well... Too early to tell but I think this one is effective in slowing down my wrinkles! :) I&#x27;m 34 and I don&#x27;t really wear make up on a daily basis. So keeping my skin clear and fresher looking is something I strive for so I can keep wearing a bare face. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t look into its ingredients but so far, no allergic reaction nor irritation from it.&lt;br /&gt;I like its mild scent too and the consistency of the cream. Worth giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> IT doesn&#x27;t do anything AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and wonderful consistency! I look forward to future results!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this night cream.  I  wish I had it years ago</li>
            <li> This seems to work very well, for a lesser cost than some others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 3 weeks now, and can notice a GREAT improvement in my skin.  It is so much softer, and there are less visible lines, especially around my mouth and eyes.  I usually struggle with hormonal breakouts on a monthly basis...but even that has been improved since starting this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it every 3 days, as directed, but will be soon switching to every other night.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the RETINOL night cream.  Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> This is a smooth product that absorbs well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay at best would not bother buying it again.  I do not see any significant changes.</li>
            <li> I received a discounted item for product testing. I totally loved this product, I only have it for more than 2 weeks and use it twice a week, its amazing to see the changes on my skin. My skin feels so smooth and the dark spots slowly dissappear. I preferred to use it at night and after I woke up in the morning my skin stays moisturize. Highly recommended to whom has a dry skin. The best anti-aging cream!</li>
            <li> I love this retinol but I can&#x27;t use it in the daytime  it&#x27;s a little bit thick.But this is night cream so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream feels on my face and neck.  I use it every other night because I am guilty of grabbing rays of sunshine and I don&#x27;t want to experience a reaction.  It doesn&#x27;t burn when it goes on and I am especially pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing on my neck.  Very rich cream.</li>
            <li> This is a light cream that goes a long way on your skin. It leaves my face feeling instantly firmer with more tone.</li>
            <li> I have ordered and purchased so many retinol creams and this one is my absolute favorite!  Takes a few weeks for your skin to get acclimated, which is why they suggest 2x per week until your skin can tolerate.  I use this cream along with Aragon/rose hip oil to prevent over drying. I love the way my skin feels/looks.  Will reorder!</li>
            <li> I see the lines disappearing around my eyes.  Love that!</li>
            <li> After a month of using it I can say that my skin looks more lifted and shining!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all positive reviews there were no negative reviews 2 months ago. I don&#x27;t see any different I use it 2 months</li>
            <li> Awesome organic Retinol night cream!! How cool is that to find a great night cream that contains 2.5% Retinal. My skin feels so refreshed after using it for the first time!!  . I cant wait to see how it looks after a week of its use.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like having your skin feel like a newborn baby!!! That&#x27;s happened a after every use of this great serum. The packaging nice and the products are one of a kind!!!&lt;br /&gt;Retinol rejuvenates the skin. This vitamin A derivative helps skin produce collagen, a natural component of the dermis that gives skin its youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol gives skin an overall healthier appearance. Retinol can help reduce discoloration, fine lines, wrinkles and skin texture. Plus, it can improve skin tone and color for generally younger-looking, even skin.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol stimulates cell turnover. Exfoliating is essential for youthful-looking, healthy skin. By removing dead skin cells, new, healthier cells are able to come through. Your complexion also looks smoother and products are able to sink deep into the skin. This way, your skin can effectively absorb potent ingredients. With a pile of dead skin cells on your face, products have a tough time penetrating this top layer and can&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol addresses acne. While retinol works to reduce telltale signs of aging, it also treats &amp;#34;acne-ridden skin,&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is less irritating than retinoids. Also a vitamin A derivative, retinoids are only available by prescription from your dermatologist. Though they&#x27;re more potent than their over-the-counter counterparts, retinoids are also more irritating to the skin with potential side effects like peeling and redness. Retinol is gentler because it gradually converts to retinoic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This Retinol Cream is Amazing. This cream is so soft and smooth and when you put it on you skin it feels like silk. I loved the idea of having a Retinol night cream. You skin does amazing things while you sleep so why not give it a little help to look better.  In the past i have tried some other retinol creams and i have found some that i like but i haven&#x27;t found a good night cream and i dont need to look any farther this is my choice.  I have also been using this on my hands and it had made my hands and face so much smoother and younger looking.  I feel like my skin is firmer and has a more youthful look to it. I really like this Night time Retinol cream and i would recommend it someone looking for a good night time cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, this started as an impulse buy because I saw it for such a good deal, but I&#x27;m actually really into using this face cream now! The package design is really slick and also gender neutral, so I didn&#x27;t feel weird being a guy and using it. But really, the thing that sold me was the actual effect of the product. Here&#x27;s my story: during my pre-bed routine I started putting two pumps onto my hands and gently rubbing it into my forehead and cheeks. The next morning, I could noticeably tell that my pores were smaller and my forehead wrinkles less obvious. AND I&#x27;M ONLY 24!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never really been into cleaning my face before going to bed, or using any skin creams, but after seeing how much smoother my skin looked when I used Rewind, I don&#x27;t know why I wouldn&#x27;t use it! It&#x27;s not greasy, oily or any sort of pain to put on your face. It literally takes me a few seconds before I go to bed. It does say to only use it twice a week (I think because of the amount of retinol that&#x27;s in it), so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it any more than that. Probably not good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m a man - I have a beard - and I still use this stuff. It&#x27;s not just for ladies. I had acne as a teenager (as many people do) because I have pretty oily skin, I think. Anyway, my pores always seem to be filled with something, even if it&#x27;s not a full-fledged blackhead, so I really like that Rewind can tighten them up and make my skin appear smoother. I don&#x27;t have nearly the amount of acne that I used to when I was younger, but I still find using a face cream like this to be worthwhile. Would recommend it to anyone who has large pores.</li>
            <li> This has a nice mild scent to it, it is not greasy at all. I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to it, but to be honest have not used it long enough to be able to see any long term anti aging results. I might check back in here in a month or two to say more about that. I like the texture on this and like that it hasn&#x27;t caused any sort of break outs for me. I think it&#x27;s a great price for a great product though!</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I have always had an issue with large pores, I have had this cream and used it daily for a week, my pores are literally shrinking. My skin is so much smoother which makes it look younger! Much, Much Better looking! As I am 50+, I am so thankful I gave this product a try!</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the night cream. It is somewhat thick as you would expect from a cream product.  I have only been using it for a few days, but it has not irritated my skin.  I like that it comes in pump bottle, which works well.</li>
            <li> This retinol cream is just what I was looking for for my skin care regimen.  I&#x27;m in my 30s now, and I want to be sure that I am doing what I can to prevent fine lines and wrinkles.  This product is strong enough that I see it working on the puffiness and fine lines around my eyes, but gentle enough that my sensitive skin can handle using it every other day (I&#x27;ve worked up to that from once or twice a week when I first got it).  It has no scent, which is nice, and I put my moisturizer on right over top of this once it dries.  It feels like it absorbs really quickly, and my skin feels silky smooth and taut after using it.  Another thing I like about this product is that it does not contain parabens, is not tested on animals, and is 97% natural &amp; 71% organic.  One pump is about a pea sized amount of product, and that amount seems perfect to cover my entire face.  If you&#x27;re using it for your neck or chest area, you may need a second pump. I think this product will last awhile, and I&#x27;m hopeful that I&#x27;ll have continued results from using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to decide.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love this Retinol Night Cream moisturizer! My skin looks and feels better than it has in years. As my skin ages I see that my skin sags more and more and I am starting to look like my mom. It kinda scares me to look like my mom, but why not... I did come from her and I think she is beautiful! Would love more of these products to try and hopefully use for my daily regime...</li>
            <li> I noticed changes to skin in a week. My skin always feels moisturized and vibrant using this cream. I use it at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li> Afgter usiung the product for over a month I did not notice any difference in wrinkles or age spots.  I will ot reorder.</li>
            <li> I love love this product... I use it every night!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Just wish the bottles were bigger, so they lasted longer!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to try yet another face cream. The very 1st night that I used it, I noticed that this cream made my face feel very soft. After one week I noticed that the rosacea that I have had for over ten years was almost gone. This was huge! I have gone to two Dermatologists and gotten prescriptions for roseaca and it just did not go away. This cream is awesome! And it costs way less than the prescriptions did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was getting my nails done over the weekend and someone told me that I looked very young to be a Grandmother. I am sold! Skinthera will be the only anti aging face cream that I use. I love it and definitely recommend it for other women!</li>
            <li> O-M-G...this is some of the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. I absolutely love retinol creams and this is one of the best that I&#x27;ve used. I use this nightly and can see a considerable amount of difference. My crows feet have diminished big time. My frown lines have decreased as well. Absorbs well into the skin leaving your skin feeling so soft. Doesn&#x27;t take much so this should last you awhile. Love this brand.</li>
            <li> I use this, and I&#x27;m not sure why.  I have lines, and I can&#x27;t really tell any difference since I started using this product. I have not used it but a few weeks.  I will continue to use it because I like the way it feels, and I keep hoping to look 23 again!!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It feels good on my face and to the touch......not greasy.</li>
            <li> Being in my early 70&#x27;s,  I thought I was doomed to dry, wrinkly skin....not so....with Rewind by Skinthera,  my skin looks and feels like a much younger woman...what a treat!  Plus it is very important to me that product is all natural because other products tended to make me itch...this does not...it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Good seller, good product</li>
            <li> Very good product that lives up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
    </ol>
