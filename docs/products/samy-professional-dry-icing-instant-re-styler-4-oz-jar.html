            <li>I love this hair product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I bought so many.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more of a foam or a mouse.</li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>glad Amazon is carrying it now.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything better.</li>

            <li>gives texture, dimension,lift and support to ANY hairstyle, and guess what, IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN STICKY which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product for giving your hair some non-greasy body when you are putting your hair in an updo.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>LOVE the product when new.  </li>
            <li>You only need about a nickels size depending on the length of your hair, must rub it between your hands good first then tossel it throughout your hair compeltely.  </li>
            <li>When my perms die, I really need thickness and body, and I use this (sparingly!)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and Dry Icing work well to give me lift and</li>
            <li>Chose 1 star because the product I received was USED (about 2/3 full) and either old or had been stored improperly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for any hair but especially for fine hair like I have.</li>
            <li>I have tried to use this product on my fine, short hair, and just can&#x27;t make it work.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely devastated that they are discontinuing it.</li>
            <li>This product is very pricey.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because I can see the intension would work on the few areas it would spread through the hair, but there has to be a better way to apply it so it spread out, not in clumps.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this 1 other time on Amazon and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I have very thin fly away hair and after washing cannot do anyting with.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair that I wash daily, so it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to gum up on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using less, I&#x27;ve tried using more, same results.  </li>
            <li>Dry Icing is better than I expected!  </li>
            <li>I used Dry Icing on my hair after I took hot curlers out.  </li>
            <li>I usually dry my hair first then put it in.</li>
            <li>My straight hair is cut in layers and tends to lay flat and has no volume.  </li>
            <li>Because of this, there are areas that have just too much product that can&#x27;t be spread out, and it&#x27;s more of a greasy - heavy feeling to the hair, instead of fluffy volume, which is what I was hoping for when buying the product.</li>
            <li>I had tried a range of \\&quot;Gels\\&quot; starting from Loreal FX (the old one tho the ones at Walgreen</li>
            <li>EXACTLY AS EXPECTED, THANKS.</li>
            <li>And, the tag line should read, &amp;#34;from flat to fabulous FOR 30 seconds&amp;#34;, as my hair just falls flat, even with a stiff hair spray.  </li>

            <li> I have very fine hair and Dry Icing work well to give me lift and that piecey look I want</li>
            <li> I love this hair product, it lives up to all it&#x27;s promises.  I have tried many hair products over the years and this one is my favorite.  Please do not stop making it. I have 1 jar that is just about gone and 2 more unopened in a drawer, don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. I am absolutely devastated that they are discontinuing it. That&#x27;s why I bought so many.</li>

They need to go back and re-work this product so it&#x27;s more of a foam or a mouse. It is like &amp;#34;icing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This works great.  A small amount will give my fine limp hair a lot of volume.  It lasts most of the day.  Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> When my perms die, I really need thickness and body, and I use this (sparingly!) to get some body.  It smells good and works well.  I have short, fine hair that I wash daily, so it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to gum up on me.</li>
            <li> Over rated.  Not as good as advertised</li>
            <li> This was a reorder of this Samy product which I have used before.  Its great for creating volume and giving your hair a full look.  Only a little is used so this product lasts several months.  I would recommend it for any hair but especially for fine hair like I have.</li>
            <li> This product is very pricey.  I had heard it was great to give your hair thickness and volume.  It didn&#x27;t do that for me, it weighed it down and made it limp.  The big factor is the fragrance, it is really awful.  I could smell it all day and I was hoping people around me  weren&#x27;t offended by it.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out of my hair, and I am probably going to end up throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Chose 1 star because the product I received was USED (about 2/3 full) and either old or had been stored improperly. It was like GLUE!!!  I have ordered this 1 other time on Amazon and it was fine. LOVE the product when new.  Used to always purchase it at Walgreens, but they discontinued it in their stores. Am now looking for a reliable souce on line.</li>
            <li> Too greasy, I didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> I prefer the Samy Dry Icing spray, which is terrific.  The cream is a bit too goopy.  If you use the spray, spray after shaking into palm of your hand, then work through hair.  Great hold, great volume.  Does leave a feeling of stiffness, but even a finger-comb will solve that problem, leaving the shape and volume intact.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 as I had been purchasing this product at a Walgreens, but then could no longer get it there. Excellent price, for an excellent product ;)</li>
            <li> Gives my hair volume without leaving it feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> The best hairstyle product I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve been using these kind of products since I was 13. I had tried a range of \\&quot;Gels\\&quot; starting from Loreal FX (the old one tho the ones at Walgreen now are a total waste of money), AXE which surprisingly performs in the first couple or weeks and then it looses its efficacy somehow, Nivea Fixation which unfortunately was put in the market for a limited time,Fructis Style, Got2b(ughh), American Crew and finally Samy Ice Drying. This product is well worth the money! gives texture, dimension,lift and support to ANY hairstyle, and guess what, IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN STICKY which is a huge plus. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY AS EXPECTED, THANKS.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use this product on my fine, short hair, and just can&#x27;t make it work.  I find it very difficult to work with.  I follow the instructions, but, once I&#x27;ve applied it, it becomes like glue.  And, the tag line should read, &amp;#34;from flat to fabulous FOR 30 seconds&amp;#34;, as my hair just falls flat, even with a stiff hair spray.  I&#x27;ve tried using less, I&#x27;ve tried using more, same results.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Dry Icing is better than I expected!  My straight hair is cut in layers and tends to lay flat and has no volume.  I used Dry Icing on my hair after I took hot curlers out.  I put only a small amount in my hands and styled my hair with my fingers...scrunching and fluffing.  AMAZING  my hair had volume and style.  During the course of the day a little fluff will bring my hairstyle back to life. Dry Icing does not clump like spray and styling gel.  It does not leave your hair tacky.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 3 years, usually get it from HSN glad Amazon is carrying it now.  I have very thin fly away hair and after washing cannot do anyting with. I use it sometimes on wet hair and sometimes just dry.  You only need about a nickels size depending on the length of your hair, must rub it between your hands good first then tossel it throughout your hair compeltely.  It will be thicker instantly. If I put it on when my hair is still wet then dry it, it can be a little stiff to brush, so I usually dry my hair first then put it in. I also use it to smooth hair ends during the day and if I need more body to maybe the front of my hair I put some in and it looks like I used curling iron for body. You can still brush your hair out and re-use without washing again.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin but when I use the icing it feels thick and holds a setting. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Met all expectations from description.</li>
            <li> i love samy products they are the best..really great to fix your hair and revive your hair style love it</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product for giving your hair some non-greasy body when you are putting your hair in an updo. It appears that this product might be discontinued, but I hope not. I&#x27;ve never found anything better.</li>
