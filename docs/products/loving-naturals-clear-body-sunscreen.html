            <li>Worked great and NO harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>It worked MARVELOUSLY!!  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great!  </li>
            <li>Its great!</li>
            <li>Incredible.  </li>
            <li>Spreads great and works great!!</li>
            <li>and I feel good putting it on my kids!  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a great mineral sunscreen for use by toddlers, kids and adults alike.  </li>
            <li>and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Bought this sunblock because I read great reviews on how it works.</li>
            <li>And, I do think it works great...</li>
            <li>LOVE this sunscreen!!</li>
            <li>It also rubs in very nicely.</li>
            <li>Using Loving Naturals will get you burned!</li>
            <li>Good sun protection for adults and kids.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>Went on good, worked in well, invisible, protected us well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this stuff, but my friend who does says it&#x27;s the best and worth the seemingly exorbitant price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to the sunscreens sold in most stores then you may not be happy with this.  </li>
            <li>Tried this and the Adorable Baby brands and both were great.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s okay for the body, it definitely isn&#x27;t great on my face.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>But, I love the beach!  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time on my trip to Miami and its the best</li>
            <li>Product goes on nicely</li>
            <li>Have really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I will never use any products from Loving Naturals again.</li>
            <li>Good, healthy ingredients, but it feels like vaseline.</li>
            <li>We really liked it.</li>
            <li>I think Loving Naturals will forever sit in my cabinet untouched until someone forgets how greasy it is and mistakenly puts it on.</li>
            <li>Yes it is more work to put on your child then the spray ones, and yes it is safer and better quality then any spray sunscreen!</li>
            <li>of course its not going to smell like vanilla if you dont put vanilla right??!!!</li>
            <li>I must say though, the Loving Naturals consistency is much better.  </li>
            <li>this is well rated on EWG but it leaves a greasy film on your skin that doesn&#x27;t go away, I would recommend think baby instead which rubs in better and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD Loving naturals has a non-nano</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Very good for protection from UVA and UVB rays because of the high zinc.</li>
            <li>seems to be nice product, did not put it to test completly.. but defintely worth a try as it  has a good rating in EWG.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I came across this brand.  </li>
            <li>peace n love:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to give this more stars, because I applaud the company for researching and disclosing all ingredients.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen was rated among the top sunscreens in the market with few/no toxic ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Which is awesome.definately gonna buy more in bulk. :)</li>
            <li>Like many others I checked the EWG guide for sunscreen and found this at the top.</li>
            <li>Much better that California baby sunscreen.</li>
            <li>much better than some obnoxious faxe coconut</li>
            <li>this sunscreen is pricier than what most consumers of sunscreen are accustomed to.  </li>
            <li>I also like how it is safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>After trying this product, I love this company even more.  </li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is the oily feel, but it&#x27;s better than others.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice a residue at all, but just made sure I rubbed it in well.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen after hours of research into safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I am nothing but pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and i hope they come up with a more burn-proof formula.</li>
            <li>I like that the formula is safe and doesn&#x27;t contain nano zinc oxide or oxybenzone.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Loving Naturals!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t live in a tropical climate, but it does a great job when we spend time outdoors.</li>
            <li>More oily than I expected, but, excellent odorless sunblock.  </li>
            <li>Probably could find an equally safe product that applies more comfortably.</li>
            <li>I think this formula really sits on top of your skin which is good for protection, but I can&#x27;t take the greasy film</li>
            <li>Also, it does not offer enough protection for my very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion really works good protecting from the sun</li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on easily but has a bit of an oily feel.</li>
            <li>I know from experience that spray on sunscreen, while seemingly convenient and easy to apply, has its pitfalls.  </li>
            <li>but I think the fact that it&#x27;s greasy helps to keep it from washing off easily.  </li>
            <li>It is greasy and slippery, but I was willing to overlook that if it was effective and non-toxic.</li>
            <li>The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s study found this sunscreen to be both effective and likely very safe.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend, however, was completely fine.  </li>
            <li>Naturals fit all three</li>
            <li>And as a extra added bonus, the company has GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li>Great to use, no white sheen, not-too-greasy.</li>
            <li>It is also free of hormone blockers and Vitamin A.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and seemed to stay on well at the pool and beach.  </li>
            <li>No worries about chemicals and its fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t have any of those chemicals store brought sunscreen has.</li>
            <li>Pour about 0.8 oz of clean water (filtered or bottled-water is fine) into the spray bottle.]&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than not being effective, I could say I feel good that does not have toxins in the product.</li>
            <li>I am very fair and really need to be careful when spending any extended period of time (basically, more than 20 mins) in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested it&#x27;s effectiveness, and trust that it is a relatively safe product based on its stellar rating on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s &amp;#34;2015 Guide to Sunscreens&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema so this really helped! :)</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, definitely waterproof, and gives great sun protection!  </li>
            <li>Rinse the bottle with clean water.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Keep the tip of the spray nozzle clean by wiping off the excess on your sibling/offspring (when they are asleep)&lt;br /&gt;Result</li>
            <li>The best thing is that it goes on clear and you don&#x27;t look white.  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients and that&#x27;s what I love about it!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice natural herbs and coconut, sunflower, grape seed oil...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone should read the full report from this not-for-profit organization (EWG - Environmental Working Group).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a good sunscreen or not, because it was SO greasy, that I never actually wore it out.</li>
            <li>Pour about 0.75 oz of Loving Naturals Clear Body SPF 30+ Non-Nano Zinc Oxide into the spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>Someone correct me if i&#x27;m not doing this right, but I&#x27;d tried other natural sunscreen that rubbed-in perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&quot;m not dissuading individuals from purchasing this item, but know it doesn&#x27;t rub-in in easily, nor is a non-greasy product.</li>
            <li>all of the above reasons make this sunscreen ideal for children, or anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I like it because it is definitely a lot more pricey than mainstream sunscreens.</li>
            <li>he burned quickly using it in almost any situation</li>
            <li>I got it&#x27;s name from Environmental Working Group website, which is full of great independent research and data on sunscreen and other products and love it!</li>
            <li>It is safe and clear and goes on very smoothly - even with two young kids trying to escape application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is my second year using Loving Naturals.</li>
            <li>While I love that the company uses purely natural ingredients, I can say after using this product, that i&#x27;ll not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>but, I think it&#x27;s worth it to use a product that keeps me/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that their clear face sunblock is even better, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I love natural products, I bought this for my kids.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and non oily.</li>
            <li>Loving Naturals Clear Body didn&#x27;t really work out that well.  </li>
            <li>I was already a fan of Loving Naturals because their baby sunblock is relatively easy to apply, has great ingredients, doesn&#x27;t bead up, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li>Easy to spread and totally clear!</li>
            <li>Rubs in quickly leaving a greasy look but one that is more tolerable than the white residue of Badger and Butterbean.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, rubs in nicely and is completely unscented.  </li>
            <li>so far so good, only used one time.</li>
            <li>This goes on easy and as far as my research goes</li>
            <li>Works very well and love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>It really is as good as any other of its kind and works perfectly on my young children as well as my wife and I, and we&#x27;ve been repeat purchasers for several years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I am 27 and aware of the sun&#x27;s damage to the skin</li>
            <li>First started using this when she was 6 months.</li>
            <li>Absorbs better, earlier to apply, does not condense into water after the first use, like California baby does.</li>
            <li>i can honestly say that this product has ZERO water resistance as tested on my 8 year old son and it barely holds up to even non-water situations.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Okay, I don&#x27;t know how they made a non-nano natural zinc oxide sunblock clear, but they did.  </li>
            <li>: you now have two non-toxic active ingredients (one good at UVB, the other at UVA protection) in an airport-friendly(&lt; 3.4oz) spray-can for easy application and even distribution, diluted with water to get the most out your money, refillable easily, easily visible how much you have left, put this in a zip-lock bag to protect from accidental leakage (bottle sprayer unscrewing), and you have got yourself the ultimate sun protection in your purse/swim bag/glove box/basement on Earth!</li>
            <li>I suspect some of the chemicals in most other brands/products (propellants, fragrances, wetting agents, etc) are likely more carcinogenic than the sun itself.</li>
            <li>Thick greasy lotion isn&#x27;t the most comfortable thing to have on your skin when sitting in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a natural sunblock that scores well on EWG and is easy to apply and clear then this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li>Given the fact that this is one of the better sunscreens in terms of ingredients and effectiveness, it&#x27;s quite easy to apply unlike so many of those other zinc oxide sunscreens that are thick and whitish.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I would pay this much for sunscreen is because it works and just as important - it isn&#x27;t toxic.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product specifically because of the excellent \\&quot;ewg score\\&quot; and because it does not use crazy unpronounceable chemicals in its formulation.</li>
            <li>This was separated and very oily--maybe it was spoiled?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it was really a bit too greasy</li>
            <li>Very greasy, and separates after a while.</li>
            <li>but it also means that it stand up to the SUN and the WATER that much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how much time this product took to absorb into my skin, and even then my shirt picked up a couple greasy stains from the product.</li>
            <li>When you rub the sunscreen on your skin it immediately disappears but I feel that it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li>the old adage does not fail us though...</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 21 month old, THis is his first sunscreen ever, we used this when we were in San diego.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work though and if . 5 stars if they bring down the price and put it in a more functional bottle.</li>
            <li>and I used it while floating down a river for 3 hours in mostly sun</li>
            <li>JK smears on white (even if you use minuscule amounts), is twice the price, and also got a &#x27;1&#x27; score on the Skin Deep Cosmetics Safe EWG database.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t constantly squeezing out more to cover her entire body.  </li>
            <li>I qualify this product in the same manner:&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very worthwhile product, though it takes a little getting used to its application, as one has to really work it in to the skin so as to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for others looking for a zinc based sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Yes, lots of things claim to be all natural these days, but this sunscreen lacks the HARMFUL CHEMICALS found in most other sunscreens(i.e.</li>
            <li>other products with a lower UV rating were considerably and noticeably better at warding off burning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little oily but living in Colorado we all here can use more oil, plus I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>I was looking for a sunscreen that scored 1 or lower on the EWG, was more affordable than other sunscreens with the same score and was clear (rather than the ghostly white of most &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;Loving</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive and it was very oily and did not work for me.</li>
            <li>oxybenzone, vitamin A.,) which disturb hormone balance, break down easily because they are chemically unstable, and have been found to be carcinogenic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(We live in Seattle, though, fwiw.)</li>
            <li>We live in New England, I start using it in April when finally we get the first signs of spring and</li>
            <li>had also purchased Jersey Kids as I was not sure which would work better.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the all natural ingredients, but it&#x27;s not always practical to be covered in oil that stays on the skin!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s about the same price as other safer ones and free shipping on amazon!</li>
            <li>If you can get past feeling like a buttered turkey, you&#x27;ll like it.  :-)</li>
            <li>I cut the bottle open when I was done with the first bottle and there was (complete eyeball guesstimate)</li>
            <li>This works fine, but it has a little funky smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;They sent me the clear body stuff and the clear face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also bought the Clear Face, which has even a lighter feel.  </li>
            <li>Another sunscreen that does work well is Ocean Potion Face (spf 45) clear zinc oxide.</li>
            <li>formula!&lt;br /&gt;4. clear.  </li>
            <li>so you can see where you are applying it and then turns clear.</li>
            <li>It dries clear.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear and greasy.</li>
            <li>Its natural wich everyone should use</li>
            <li>But if you have oily skin dont use too much and use a big hat to cover ur face, ears, and neck.</li>
            <li>Use natural stay out of chemicals...</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because of its natural ingredients and lack of toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I would warn anyone with sensitive skin away from using this.</li>
            <li>I got this product because it is a natural product and scored well on EWG.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I was to set sail on a vacation with my very fair-skinned boyfriend, who&#x27;d gotten severely sunburned last time we went to the beach.  </li>
            <li>all natural and mineral based.  </li>
            <li>i have a 2 year old and plan to use it on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very shiny and leaves a residue, so if you&#x27;re on a beach, sand will stick to you big time.</li>
            <li>I did tons of research on sunblock before visiting the Caribbean with my 8 month old daughter, and this is by far the safest on the market here in the US.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer that over the natural sunscreen that won&#x27;t rub in.</li>
            <li>I used it on my 16 month old while camping at a lake</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>so I use sunblock frequently.</li>
            <li>I like this product for its natural, non-dangerous ingredients, but I find it leaves a bit of a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a few different products from this company and I love them all.  </li>
            <li>The tube is small, but I believe this will go a longer way because of how easy it is to apply -</li>
            <li>As a result, I&#x27;ve had to unscrew the cap and stick a long stick into the bottle to scrape out what is left over (enough for several more applications).</li>
            <li>It does not break out my kids eczema skin, goes on easily and most importantly provides insane protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>But when I put this product on first, and then went out, not only did I get sun burn, but I was red as a tomato!  </li>
            <li>i paid top dollar for this product due to it stating its&#x27; non-nano and non-GMO ingredients, although research will turn up many other products already commonly on the market with neither (they just don&#x27;t openly state it).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very particular individual, especially when it comes to fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It is very sticky and greasy; it does not &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; or dry with time either.  </li>
            <li>It is very oily and left white coat on my sons skin this suncreen was there on him for hours ( did not re-apply  for 6 hrs we were in zoo and beach)</li>
            <li>My skin is a light brown/olive shade, and I found that I had a hard time rubbing the product into my skin sufficiently to make the product blend into my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>clear body&#x27;stuff is gritty.  </li>
            <li>Also it goes on clear with no white marks on my brown skin.</li>
            <li>I bought the product because of the natural ingredients, but it simply does not work!</li>
            <li>After making the decision to try to use natural products whenever possible, I saw this product and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>paranoia and with it being all natural, the sand sticking thing isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>Even if I reapply frequently (which feels really gross), I&#x27;ve still gotten a bit burned on two separate occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is dark enough so that i rarely, if ever, burn.  </li>
            <li>Get another sunblock (rated highly on EWG) with titanium dioxide as the active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it on my little kids, even after I rub it in really well, their hair turns into greasy strings from contacting their shoulders and necks.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Great to find non-toxic children&#x27;s products that work!</li>
            <li> Worked great and NO harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Soaks in well and provides excellent protection!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> It worked MARVELOUSLY!!  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  </li>
            <li> Its great!</li>
            <li> Incredible.  </li>
            <li> Spreads great and works great!!</li>
            <li> and I feel good putting it on my kids!  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a great mineral sunscreen for use by toddlers, kids and adults alike.  </li>
            <li> and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Bought this sunblock because I read great reviews on how it works.</li>
            <li> And, I do think it works great...</li>
            <li> LOVE this sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> It also rubs in very nicely.</li>
            <li> Using Loving Naturals will get you burned!</li>
            <li> Good sun protection for adults and kids.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> Went on good, worked in well, invisible, protected us well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this stuff, but my friend who does says it&#x27;s the best and worth the seemingly exorbitant price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the sunscreens sold in most stores then you may not be happy with this.  </li>
            <li> Tried this and the Adorable Baby brands and both were great.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s okay for the body, it definitely isn&#x27;t great on my face.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> But, I love the beach!  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time on my trip to Miami and its the best</li>
            <li> Product goes on nicely</li>
            <li> Have really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any products from Loving Naturals again.</li>
            <li> Good, healthy ingredients, but it feels like vaseline.</li>
            <li> We really liked it.</li>
            <li> I think Loving Naturals will forever sit in my cabinet untouched until someone forgets how greasy it is and mistakenly puts it on.</li>
            <li> Yes it is more work to put on your child then the spray ones, and yes it is safer and better quality then any spray sunscreen!</li>
            <li> of course its not going to smell like vanilla if you dont put vanilla right??!!!</li>
            <li> I must say though, the Loving Naturals consistency is much better.  </li>
            <li> this is well rated on EWG but it leaves a greasy film on your skin that doesn&#x27;t go away, I would recommend think baby instead which rubs in better and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD Loving naturals has a non-nano</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Very good for protection from UVA and UVB rays because of the high zinc.</li>
            <li> seems to be nice product, did not put it to test completly.. but defintely worth a try as it  has a good rating in EWG.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I came across this brand.  </li>
            <li> peace n love:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this more stars, because I applaud the company for researching and disclosing all ingredients.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was rated among the top sunscreens in the market with few/no toxic ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Which is awesome.definately gonna buy more in bulk. :)</li>
            <li> Like many others I checked the EWG guide for sunscreen and found this at the top.</li>
            <li> Much better that California baby sunscreen.</li>
            <li> much better than some obnoxious faxe coconut</li>
            <li> this sunscreen is pricier than what most consumers of sunscreen are accustomed to.  </li>
            <li> I also like how it is safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> After trying this product, I love this company even more.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is the oily feel, but it&#x27;s better than others.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice a residue at all, but just made sure I rubbed it in well.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen after hours of research into safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I am nothing but pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and i hope they come up with a more burn-proof formula.</li>
            <li> I like that the formula is safe and doesn&#x27;t contain nano zinc oxide or oxybenzone.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Loving Naturals!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t live in a tropical climate, but it does a great job when we spend time outdoors.</li>
            <li> More oily than I expected, but, excellent odorless sunblock.  </li>
            <li> Probably could find an equally safe product that applies more comfortably.</li>
            <li> I think this formula really sits on top of your skin which is good for protection, but I can&#x27;t take the greasy film</li>
            <li> Also, it does not offer enough protection for my very fair skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion really works good protecting from the sun</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on easily but has a bit of an oily feel.</li>
            <li> I know from experience that spray on sunscreen, while seemingly convenient and easy to apply, has its pitfalls.  </li>
            <li> but I think the fact that it&#x27;s greasy helps to keep it from washing off easily.  </li>
            <li> It is greasy and slippery, but I was willing to overlook that if it was effective and non-toxic.</li>
            <li> The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s study found this sunscreen to be both effective and likely very safe.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend, however, was completely fine.  </li>
            <li> Naturals fit all three</li>
            <li> And as a extra added bonus, the company has GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li> Great to use, no white sheen, not-too-greasy.</li>
            <li> It is also free of hormone blockers and Vitamin A.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and seemed to stay on well at the pool and beach.  </li>
            <li> No worries about chemicals and its fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t have any of those chemicals store brought sunscreen has.</li>
            <li> Pour about 0.8 oz of clean water (filtered or bottled-water is fine) into the spray bottle.]&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than not being effective, I could say I feel good that does not have toxins in the product.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and really need to be careful when spending any extended period of time (basically, more than 20 mins) in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested it&#x27;s effectiveness, and trust that it is a relatively safe product based on its stellar rating on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s &amp;#34;2015 Guide to Sunscreens&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema so this really helped! :)</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, definitely waterproof, and gives great sun protection!  </li>
            <li> Rinse the bottle with clean water.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Keep the tip of the spray nozzle clean by wiping off the excess on your sibling/offspring (when they are asleep)&lt;br /&gt;Result</li>
            <li> The best thing is that it goes on clear and you don&#x27;t look white.  </li>
            <li> All natural ingredients and that&#x27;s what I love about it!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice natural herbs and coconut, sunflower, grape seed oil...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone should read the full report from this not-for-profit organization (EWG - Environmental Working Group).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a good sunscreen or not, because it was SO greasy, that I never actually wore it out.</li>
            <li> Pour about 0.75 oz of Loving Naturals Clear Body SPF 30+ Non-Nano Zinc Oxide into the spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Someone correct me if i&#x27;m not doing this right, but I&#x27;d tried other natural sunscreen that rubbed-in perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&quot;m not dissuading individuals from purchasing this item, but know it doesn&#x27;t rub-in in easily, nor is a non-greasy product.</li>
            <li> all of the above reasons make this sunscreen ideal for children, or anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I like it because it is definitely a lot more pricey than mainstream sunscreens.</li>
            <li> he burned quickly using it in almost any situation</li>
            <li> I got it&#x27;s name from Environmental Working Group website, which is full of great independent research and data on sunscreen and other products and love it!</li>
            <li> It is safe and clear and goes on very smoothly - even with two young kids trying to escape application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is my second year using Loving Naturals.</li>
            <li> While I love that the company uses purely natural ingredients, I can say after using this product, that i&#x27;ll not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> but, I think it&#x27;s worth it to use a product that keeps me/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that their clear face sunblock is even better, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love natural products, I bought this for my kids.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and non oily.</li>
            <li> Loving Naturals Clear Body didn&#x27;t really work out that well.  </li>
            <li> I was already a fan of Loving Naturals because their baby sunblock is relatively easy to apply, has great ingredients, doesn&#x27;t bead up, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> Easy to spread and totally clear!</li>
            <li> Rubs in quickly leaving a greasy look but one that is more tolerable than the white residue of Badger and Butterbean.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, rubs in nicely and is completely unscented.  </li>
            <li> so far so good, only used one time.</li>
            <li> This goes on easy and as far as my research goes</li>
            <li> Works very well and love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> It really is as good as any other of its kind and works perfectly on my young children as well as my wife and I, and we&#x27;ve been repeat purchasers for several years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I am 27 and aware of the sun&#x27;s damage to the skin</li>
            <li> First started using this when she was 6 months.</li>
            <li> Absorbs better, earlier to apply, does not condense into water after the first use, like California baby does.</li>
            <li> i can honestly say that this product has ZERO water resistance as tested on my 8 year old son and it barely holds up to even non-water situations.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t know how they made a non-nano natural zinc oxide sunblock clear, but they did.  </li>
            <li> : you now have two non-toxic active ingredients (one good at UVB, the other at UVA protection) in an airport-friendly(&lt; 3.4oz) spray-can for easy application and even distribution, diluted with water to get the most out your money, refillable easily, easily visible how much you have left, put this in a zip-lock bag to protect from accidental leakage (bottle sprayer unscrewing), and you have got yourself the ultimate sun protection in your purse/swim bag/glove box/basement on Earth!</li>
            <li> I suspect some of the chemicals in most other brands/products (propellants, fragrances, wetting agents, etc) are likely more carcinogenic than the sun itself.</li>
            <li> Thick greasy lotion isn&#x27;t the most comfortable thing to have on your skin when sitting in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a natural sunblock that scores well on EWG and is easy to apply and clear then this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li> Given the fact that this is one of the better sunscreens in terms of ingredients and effectiveness, it&#x27;s quite easy to apply unlike so many of those other zinc oxide sunscreens that are thick and whitish.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I would pay this much for sunscreen is because it works and just as important - it isn&#x27;t toxic.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product specifically because of the excellent \\&quot;ewg score\\&quot; and because it does not use crazy unpronounceable chemicals in its formulation.</li>
            <li> This was separated and very oily--maybe it was spoiled?</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it was really a bit too greasy</li>
            <li> Very greasy, and separates after a while.</li>
            <li> but it also means that it stand up to the SUN and the WATER that much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how much time this product took to absorb into my skin, and even then my shirt picked up a couple greasy stains from the product.</li>
            <li> When you rub the sunscreen on your skin it immediately disappears but I feel that it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li> the old adage does not fail us though...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 21 month old, THis is his first sunscreen ever, we used this when we were in San diego.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work though and if . 5 stars if they bring down the price and put it in a more functional bottle.</li>
            <li> and I used it while floating down a river for 3 hours in mostly sun</li>
            <li> JK smears on white (even if you use minuscule amounts), is twice the price, and also got a &#x27;1&#x27; score on the Skin Deep Cosmetics Safe EWG database.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t constantly squeezing out more to cover her entire body.  </li>
            <li> I qualify this product in the same manner:&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very worthwhile product, though it takes a little getting used to its application, as one has to really work it in to the skin so as to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for others looking for a zinc based sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes, lots of things claim to be all natural these days, but this sunscreen lacks the HARMFUL CHEMICALS found in most other sunscreens(i.e.</li>
            <li> other products with a lower UV rating were considerably and noticeably better at warding off burning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily but living in Colorado we all here can use more oil, plus I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that scored 1 or lower on the EWG, was more affordable than other sunscreens with the same score and was clear (rather than the ghostly white of most &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;Loving</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and it was very oily and did not work for me.</li>
            <li> oxybenzone, vitamin A.,) which disturb hormone balance, break down easily because they are chemically unstable, and have been found to be carcinogenic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (We live in Seattle, though, fwiw.)</li>
            <li> We live in New England, I start using it in April when finally we get the first signs of spring and</li>
            <li> had also purchased Jersey Kids as I was not sure which would work better.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the all natural ingredients, but it&#x27;s not always practical to be covered in oil that stays on the skin!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s about the same price as other safer ones and free shipping on amazon!</li>
            <li> If you can get past feeling like a buttered turkey, you&#x27;ll like it.  :-)</li>
            <li> I cut the bottle open when I was done with the first bottle and there was (complete eyeball guesstimate)</li>
            <li> This works fine, but it has a little funky smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;They sent me the clear body stuff and the clear face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also bought the Clear Face, which has even a lighter feel.  </li>
            <li> Another sunscreen that does work well is Ocean Potion Face (spf 45) clear zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> formula!&lt;br /&gt;4. clear.  </li>
            <li> so you can see where you are applying it and then turns clear.</li>
            <li> It dries clear.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear and greasy.</li>
            <li> Its natural wich everyone should use</li>
            <li> But if you have oily skin dont use too much and use a big hat to cover ur face, ears, and neck.</li>
            <li> Use natural stay out of chemicals...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of its natural ingredients and lack of toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I would warn anyone with sensitive skin away from using this.</li>
            <li> I got this product because it is a natural product and scored well on EWG.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I was to set sail on a vacation with my very fair-skinned boyfriend, who&#x27;d gotten severely sunburned last time we went to the beach.  </li>
            <li> all natural and mineral based.  </li>
            <li> i have a 2 year old and plan to use it on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very shiny and leaves a residue, so if you&#x27;re on a beach, sand will stick to you big time.</li>
            <li> I did tons of research on sunblock before visiting the Caribbean with my 8 month old daughter, and this is by far the safest on the market here in the US.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer that over the natural sunscreen that won&#x27;t rub in.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 16 month old while camping at a lake</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> so I use sunblock frequently.</li>
            <li> I like this product for its natural, non-dangerous ingredients, but I find it leaves a bit of a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few different products from this company and I love them all.  </li>
            <li> The tube is small, but I believe this will go a longer way because of how easy it is to apply -</li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;ve had to unscrew the cap and stick a long stick into the bottle to scrape out what is left over (enough for several more applications).</li>
            <li> It does not break out my kids eczema skin, goes on easily and most importantly provides insane protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> But when I put this product on first, and then went out, not only did I get sun burn, but I was red as a tomato!  </li>
            <li> i paid top dollar for this product due to it stating its&#x27; non-nano and non-GMO ingredients, although research will turn up many other products already commonly on the market with neither (they just don&#x27;t openly state it).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very particular individual, especially when it comes to fragrances.  </li>
            <li> It is very sticky and greasy; it does not &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; or dry with time either.  </li>
            <li> It is very oily and left white coat on my sons skin this suncreen was there on him for hours ( did not re-apply  for 6 hrs we were in zoo and beach)</li>
            <li> My skin is a light brown/olive shade, and I found that I had a hard time rubbing the product into my skin sufficiently to make the product blend into my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> clear body&#x27;stuff is gritty.  </li>
            <li> Also it goes on clear with no white marks on my brown skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the product because of the natural ingredients, but it simply does not work!</li>
            <li> After making the decision to try to use natural products whenever possible, I saw this product and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> paranoia and with it being all natural, the sand sticking thing isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> Even if I reapply frequently (which feels really gross), I&#x27;ve still gotten a bit burned on two separate occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is dark enough so that i rarely, if ever, burn.  </li>
            <li> Get another sunblock (rated highly on EWG) with titanium dioxide as the active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it on my little kids, even after I rub it in really well, their hair turns into greasy strings from contacting their shoulders and necks.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other \\&quot;Loving Naturals\\&quot; products, so I didn&#x27;t think that I would be disappointed, but I wanted to try the smaller bottle first.</li>
            <li> is not a water-based sunblock, so you will probably be better off if your other sunblock is water-based, or thin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various natural sunscreens over the past five years or so, and I really liked the idea of getting one that didn&#x27;t have the terrible bluing effect of many mineral sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> sunscreen does appear clear on our skin, unlike the other oxide-based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little bit greasy, but it&#x27;s clear!  </li>
            <li> Some people might be put off by how greasy it is, but the alternative is another physical sunblock that shows up pearly white and is even harder to apply.  </li>
            <li> This is a similar review to other like products, which I feel all possess the same intrinsic value.</li>
            <li> Zinc or Titanium oxide is usually the main ingredient in mineral-based sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I put it on, a bit greasy, at least 45 minutes before exposure to the sun and got very burned.</li>
            <li> And the &#x27;clear face&#x27; dried up in no time</li>
            <li> Careful though - since it&#x27;s a physical sunblock it can wipe off and I ended up with some burns on my feet where my sandals had rubbed it off.</li>
            <li> long can she stand to be that greasy?</li>
            <li> However, next time I&#x27;ll opt to look chalky but less greasy with a different brand.</li>
            <li> This is a shame because the product works, smells nice enough and compared to other quality lotions, the price isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it since my kids don&#x27;t complain that it makes them look &amp;#34;white like a ghost&amp;#34; like other mineral-based natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I emailed again, saying for a second time I wanted a replacement due to what happened.</li>
            <li> Unless you have extremely dry skin, I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> It is slightly greasy but leaves no white residue.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick, so thick it will not come out of the squeeze hole, you have to unscrew the cap and does not spread easily; also leaves a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I prefer a physical sunblock and was trying to go for the least ingredients that have side effects as possible.</li>
            <li> it takes a lot of work to get the last few globs of sunscreen out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that didn&#x27;t have all the questionable chemicals in it, yet wasn&#x27;t thick/goopy and didn&#x27;t leave behind the white residue that so many products with zinc oxide do.  </li>
            <li> We spent a lot of time in the sun</li>
            <li> and i gave up using it after about 8 tries and could not justify the burning any longer.  </li>
            <li> and it never really soaks in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try out a few other sunscreens from my local health food store before I try purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Some say it was greasy, I say a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Other surfer boys and girls swear by it too.</li>
            <li> However, it is extremely oily.</li>
            <li> Pour about 1.25 oz of the other sunblock into the spray bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the packaging...</li>
            <li> Ive been trying numerous sunscreens lately.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this by the company after I complained that the previous sun block of theirs that I tried was so runny that my kid was covered in white paint and nothing soaked</li>
            <li> Hopefully some day the price can come down.  </li>
            <li> Way down.</li>
            <li> The other reviews were correct!</li>
            <li> I used this product and was sunburned badly in less than 2 hours on the beach.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have $21.99 to be spending on sunblock every week and a half.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that there are no nanoparticles, but I wonder if the manufacturers couldn&#x27;t find a less greasy binder ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones and its hands down my fave.</li>
            <li> Just thick, dry stuff you can&#x27;t spread on anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> rather it be a little shiny rather than purple/white or sticky.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it does tend to stay a little greasy on your skin.</li>
            <li> but it was a little to greasy for me</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because its zinc oxide</li>
            <li> Very thick and is white, it takes a lot of rubbing into the skin to make it disappear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, which means you have to spend a few extra minutes applying it.  </li>
            <li> This product also has no discernible scent, for those put off by heavily scented products.  </li>
            <li> I reapplied each time I got out of the water/towel dried</li>
            <li> I had a basal cell carcinoma spot a few months ago</li>
            <li> None of us have ever gotten burnt using this product and we&#x27;ve worn it in the dead of summer in Disney World and on the beaches.</li>
            <li> I wear sunblock both as an everyday application as well as for the beach</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a &amp;#34;Clear Face&amp;#34; sunscreen mentioned in a few places, but I could not find it to try on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Badger for the last few years, which is also highly rated for both UVA/UVB protection and an overall lack of nasty chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell one apart from the other in their efficacy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought the 2.5oz sunscreen because I was not sure how I would like it</li>
            <li> , no more of this brand for me.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how small this would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I would say that she goes through only 2-3 oz in a year.</li>
            <li> When these particles are too small, they are harmful because they seep into the skin.  </li>
            <li> 4-oz can is small for the money, but here is how to stretch your buck:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> IF you can get past how greasy this sunblock is.  </li>
            <li> Looking at other chemically loaded sunscreens I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s worse the sun or the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit expensive and also the shape of the bottle makes it hard to squeeze out the last bits of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am always worried about burns since my family is very pale</li>
            <li> i do appreciate and understand that it is a small business and hesitate to write a negative review for that reason,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely expensive, it goes on greasy, and the bottle is very hard to squeeze which makes it tough to get every last pricey little drop out of it.</li>
            <li> It actually leans towards being a little greasy, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> It is kinda thick i think because of the beeswax but its moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick, stays on, and is greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick or sticky.</li>
            <li> Achieving sufficient and even coverage with them is difficult, and you wind up using half the can!&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> This goes on ridiculously greasy, but it works.  </li>
            <li> I have always had bad reactions to different sunscreens and refused using them for a while.  </li>
            <li> Not as bad, but still, SPF 30 is supposed to protect them for 1 hr/day they play outside.</li>
            <li> Not good for face or under makeup</li>
            <li> The sunscreen has a slight odor bot not too bad and it is a little greasy</li>
            <li> It was very hard for us to aplly to our son as it was very thick and the oil seprated form the cream.</li>
            <li> I got bad sun burn using this product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> He was the only one with a very bad sunburn that turned into sun poisoning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There seems to be something wrong with their formula...or  it can&#x27;t take the NY heat?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 3 days of using the product, I broke out in a rash all over my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> I got it in the mail today and thought they had sent me the wrong size.</li>
            <li> my family from burning and also doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of questionable chemicals which could impact my or my family&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> i am so sorry it didn&#x27;t work out</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of all that zinc oxide, with this stuff you won&#x27;t be looking like Caspar at the pool.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> On our vacation, I stupidly chose not to wear sunscreen and got sunburned.  </li>
            <li> I hate sunscreens that turn the skin purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always had bad reactions to different sunscreens and refused using them for a while.  Now that I am 27 and aware of the sun&#x27;s damage to the skin I have gone back to sunscreen and I am so glad I came across this brand.  When in Cancun my boyfriend was passing everyone the lotion and forgot to put it on himself.  He was the only one with a very bad sunburn that turned into sun poisoning.  It&#x27;s worth the money.  Some say it was greasy, I say a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is my second year using Loving Naturals. I love it! I am always worried about burns since my family is very pale and I know I can trust this sunscreen. It is safe and clear and goes on very smoothly - even with two young kids trying to escape application. My only complaint would be the packaging...it takes a lot of work to get the last few globs of sunscreen out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that scored 1 or lower on the EWG, was more affordable than other sunscreens with the same score and was clear (rather than the ghostly white of most &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;Loving Naturals fit all three criteria.&lt;br /&gt;Will rebuy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also purchased Jersey Kids as I was not sure which would work better.  JK smears on white (even if you use minuscule amounts), is twice the price, and also got a &#x27;1&#x27; score on the Skin Deep Cosmetics Safe EWG database.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this stuff, but my friend who does says it&#x27;s the best and worth the seemingly exorbitant price. He&#x27;s a roofer and surfer so except when it snows in Hawaii, he&#x27;s out in the sun every day. Other surfer boys and girls swear by it too.</li>
            <li> Its natural wich everyone should use But if you have oily skin dont use too much and use a big hat to cover ur face, ears, and neck. The smell is nice natural herbs and coconut, sunflower, grape seed oil...of course its not going to smell like vanilla if you dont put vanilla right??!!! Use natural stay out of chemicals...peace n love:)</li>
            <li> I bought the 2.5oz sunscreen because I was not sure how I would like it and if it would work well. I chose this product specifically because of the excellent \\&quot;ewg score\\&quot; and because it does not use crazy unpronounceable chemicals in its formulation. I have purchased other \\&quot;Loving Naturals\\&quot; products, so I didn&#x27;t think that I would be disappointed, but I wanted to try the smaller bottle first. Seriously, this stuff is great. It does not break out my kids eczema skin, goes on easily and most importantly provides insane protection from the sun. Now, I don&#x27;t spend hours in the sun and I don&#x27;t live in a tropical climate, but it does a great job when we spend time outdoors. And as a extra added bonus, the company has GREAT customer service. Thanks, Loving Naturals!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this more stars, because I applaud the company for researching and disclosing all ingredients. The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s study found this sunscreen to be both effective and likely very safe. However, it is extremely oily. Every time I use it on my little kids, even after I rub it in really well, their hair turns into greasy strings from contacting their shoulders and necks.  (They have medium-long hair and will not leave ponytails in.)  I got this sunscreen on sale, but I&#x27;ve probably already made up the difference by needing to use extra shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen does appear clear on our skin, unlike the other oxide-based sunscreens. However, next time I&#x27;ll opt to look chalky but less greasy with a different brand.</li>
            <li> Search the web for &#x27;EWG Sunscreen list&#x27;. This sunscreen was rated among the top sunscreens in the market with few/no toxic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should read the full report from this not-for-profit organization (EWG - Environmental Working Group).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Very thick and is white, it takes a lot of rubbing into the skin to make it disappear.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this by the company after I complained that the previous sun block of theirs that I tried was so runny that my kid was covered in white paint and nothing soaked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent me the clear body stuff and the clear face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;clear body&#x27;stuff is gritty.  I feel as if I&#x27;m exfoliating my tot when I rub it on her.  And the &#x27;clear face&#x27; dried up in no time and I&#x27;ve had to discard it.  Just thick, dry stuff you can&#x27;t spread on anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be something wrong with their formula...or  it can&#x27;t take the NY heat? I was storing them indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, no more of this brand for me.</li>
            <li> This was separated and very oily--maybe it was spoiled? My skin is really sensitive and it was very oily and did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of its natural ingredients and lack of toxic ingredients.  It is greasy and slippery, but I was willing to overlook that if it was effective and non-toxic. Unfortunately, after 3 days of using the product, I broke out in a rash all over my arms and legs.  I would warn anyone with sensitive skin away from using this.</li>
            <li> Found this on the skin deep cosmetics site.  We&#x27;ve been using Badger for the last few years, which is also highly rated for both UVA/UVB protection and an overall lack of nasty chemical ingredients.  I must say though, the Loving Naturals consistency is much better.  It goes on clear, rubs in nicely and is completely unscented.  I also bought the Clear Face, which has even a lighter feel.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of all that zinc oxide, with this stuff you won&#x27;t be looking like Caspar at the pool.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. It&#x27;s the only one I use with my family.</li>
            <li> Very good for protection from UVA and UVB rays because of the high zinc. Also it goes on clear with no white marks on my brown skin. It is kinda thick i think because of the beeswax but its moisturizing. Which is awesome.definately gonna buy more in bulk. :)</li>
            <li> I used this product and was sunburned badly in less than 2 hours on the beach. I put it on, a bit greasy, at least 45 minutes before exposure to the sun and got very burned. I bought the product because of the natural ingredients, but it simply does not work! I replaced Natures Gate, which does work well, with this product and got scorched. Another sunscreen that does work well is Ocean Potion Face (spf 45) clear zinc oxide. Using Loving Naturals will get you burned!</li>
            <li> While I love that the company uses purely natural ingredients, I can say after using this product, that i&#x27;ll not be purchasing again. Even after putting on, and letting it sit, it&#x27;s greasy. Putting it on and rubbing it in profusely, still greasy. I look like I have petroleum jelly all over my arms! Someone correct me if i&#x27;m not doing this right, but I&#x27;d tried other natural sunscreen that rubbed-in perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&quot;m not dissuading individuals from purchasing this item, but know it doesn&#x27;t rub-in in easily, nor is a non-greasy product.</li>
            <li> Yes it is more work to put on your child then the spray ones, and yes it is safer and better quality then any spray sunscreen! I got it&#x27;s name from Environmental Working Group website, which is full of great independent research and data on sunscreen and other products and love it! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how small this would be. $21.99 for this puny bottle? I got it in the mail today and thought they had sent me the wrong size. I don&#x27;t have $21.99 to be spending on sunblock every week and a half. I use sunblock consistently, daily, on any body part that is possibly exposed and this would last maximum two weeks.</li>
            <li> Great to use, no white sheen, not-too-greasy. It&#x27;s also a bit expensive and also the shape of the bottle makes it hard to squeeze out the last bits of the sunscreen. As a result, I&#x27;ve had to unscrew the cap and stick a long stick into the bottle to scrape out what is left over (enough for several more applications).</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few different products from this company and I love them all.  Great to find non-toxic children&#x27;s products that work!</li>
            <li> After making the decision to try to use natural products whenever possible, I saw this product and decided to try it.  My skin is a light brown/olive shade, and I found that I had a hard time rubbing the product into my skin sufficiently to make the product blend into my skin tone.  Instead it left a grayish/whitish tent on my skin, that I had to wash off to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for anyone with olive or brown skin tones.</li>
            <li> Its the only sunscreen that does not make my children look freakishly purple. It also does not have an overpowering scent which I like.</li>
            <li> This is a similar review to other like products, which I feel all possess the same intrinsic value. I qualify this product in the same manner:&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very worthwhile product, though it takes a little getting used to its application, as one has to really work it in to the skin so as to spread it evenly. It really is as good as any other of its kind and works perfectly on my young children as well as my wife and I, and we&#x27;ve been repeat purchasers for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;Remember, it&#x27;s a bit tricky to work with only on account that it is not that \\&quot;ready-serve\\&quot; toxic bullcrap that everyone is used to spraying on themselves; the \\&quot;automatic for the people\\&quot; scenario that is often desired. So if that is what you are accustomed to, be prepared to have to manually spread this over your skin. I suspect some of the chemicals in most other brands/products (propellants, fragrances, wetting agents, etc) are likely more carcinogenic than the sun itself.</li>
            <li> Worked great and NO harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a good sunscreen or not, because it was SO greasy, that I never actually wore it out. I put it on once and couldn&#x27;t take it on my skin. I washed it off, put it in a drawer, and finally threw it away. Unless you have extremely dry skin, I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Researched a ton of sunscreens to use on my infant daughter. First started using this when she was 6 months. It&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s expensive, but I would say that she goes through only 2-3 oz in a year. (We live in Seattle, though, fwiw.)</li>
            <li> so far so good, only used one time.</li>
            <li> This goes on easy and as far as my research goes it&#x27;s one of the safest and easiest to use. I don&#x27;t mind putting this on my children. Looking at other chemically loaded sunscreens I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s worse the sun or the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I got this product because it is a natural product and scored well on EWG.&lt;br /&gt;but it was really a bit too greasy and i didn&#x27;t like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;so i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works very well and love that it&#x27;s all natural. Soaks in well and provides excellent protection!</li>
            <li> Great product! Used it for 4 summers now. Must apply often, if you don&#x27;t your child will get burned. All natural ingredients and that&#x27;s what I love about it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face shiny and sticky. It is so shiny that I look like I just ran a marathon. It also makes my skin sticky that my hair sticks to where ever I&#x27;ve applied the product.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying numerous sunscreens lately. I prefer a physical sunblock and was trying to go for the least ingredients that have side effects as possible. this is well rated on EWG but it leaves a greasy film on your skin that doesn&#x27;t go away, I would recommend think baby instead which rubs in better and has a nice scent. or products by elta MD.</li>
            <li> Like many others I checked the EWG guide for sunscreen and found this at the top. It is slightly greasy but leaves no white residue. Good sun protection for adults and kids. The only downside is the cost. I would highly recommend this for others looking for a zinc based sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Very greasy, and separates after a while. I do like the fact that there are no nanoparticles, but I wonder if the manufacturers couldn&#x27;t find a less greasy binder ...</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it since my kids don&#x27;t complain that it makes them look &amp;#34;white like a ghost&amp;#34; like other mineral-based natural sunscreens.  Highest rating from EWG.</li>
            <li> Given the fact that this is one of the better sunscreens in terms of ingredients and effectiveness, it&#x27;s quite easy to apply unlike so many of those other zinc oxide sunscreens that are thick and whitish.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen! I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones and its hands down my fave. It&#x27;s a little oily but living in Colorado we all here can use more oil, plus I&#x27;d rather it be a little shiny rather than purple/white or sticky.</li>
            <li> The only reason I would pay this much for sunscreen is because it works and just as important - it isn&#x27;t toxic.  I&#x27;ve tested it&#x27;s effectiveness, and trust that it is a relatively safe product based on its stellar rating on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s &amp;#34;2015 Guide to Sunscreens&amp;#34;.  Hopefully some day the price can come down.  Way down.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a great mineral sunscreen for use by toddlers, kids and adults alike.  This sunscreen goes on easily but has a bit of an oily feel.</li>
            <li> Much better that California baby sunscreen. Absorbs better, earlier to apply, does not condense into water after the first use, like California baby does. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I did hours of research before deciding to purchase this sunscreen.  I was to set sail on a vacation with my very fair-skinned boyfriend, who&#x27;d gotten severely sunburned last time we went to the beach.  I was determined not to let that happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this sunscreen for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. protects against both UVA and UVB rays, something the vast majority of sunscreens do not.&lt;br /&gt;2. all natural and mineral based.  Yes, lots of things claim to be all natural these days, but this sunscreen lacks the HARMFUL CHEMICALS found in most other sunscreens(i.e. oxybenzone, vitamin A.,) which disturb hormone balance, break down easily because they are chemically unstable, and have been found to be carcinogenic.&lt;br /&gt;3.  non-nano zinc oxide.  Zinc or Titanium oxide is usually the main ingredient in mineral-based sunscreen.  When these particles are too small, they are harmful because they seep into the skin.  SO GLAD Loving naturals has a non-nano formula!&lt;br /&gt;4. clear.  I hate sunscreens that turn the skin purple.&lt;br /&gt;5. NOT a spray.  I know from experience that spray on sunscreen, while seemingly convenient and easy to apply, has its pitfalls.  Achieving sufficient and even coverage with them is difficult, and you wind up using half the can!&lt;br /&gt;6. no obnoxious smell&lt;br /&gt;7. all of the above reasons make this sunscreen ideal for children, or anyone with sensitive skin.  i have a 2 year old and plan to use it on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, this is what i found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s very thick, which means you have to spend a few extra minutes applying it.  but it also means that it stand up to the SUN and the WATER that much better.&lt;br /&gt;2. I like the way it smells.  I&#x27;d read a review complaining about the smell.  I&#x27;m a very particular individual, especially when it comes to fragrances.  This sunscreen is \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; which means they don&#x27;t add fragrance.  of course, it has a smell, but it does not smell at all medicinally.  the smell is akin to shea butter.  much better than some obnoxious faxe coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;3. It worked MARVELOUSLY!!  The Bahamian sun is NO JOKE.  My skin is dark enough so that i rarely, if ever, burn.  I can spend 12 hours at the beach in nj and not get sunburned.  On our vacation, I stupidly chose not to wear sunscreen and got sunburned.  My boyfriend, however, was completely fine.  He was amazed at the fact that he no longer had to fear being outside in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note:  this sunscreen is pricier than what most consumers of sunscreen are accustomed to.  the old adage does not fail us though... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  I&#x27;d much rather shell out a few extra bucks and have the peace of mind that comes with knowing i won&#x27;t get a sunburn!  You can&#x27;t put a price on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: this is the only sunscreen i will purchase from now on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 21 month old, THis is his first sunscreen ever, we used this when we were in San diego. It was very hard for us to aplly to our son as it was very thick and the oil seprated form the cream. It is very oily and left white coat on my sons skin this suncreen was there on him for hours ( did not re-apply  for 6 hrs we were in zoo and beach) he did  not have any tan or sun burn. Washing off the sunscreen was another challenge.&lt;br /&gt;overall seems to be nice product, did not put it to test completly.. but defintely worth a try as it  has a good rating in EWG.</li>
            <li> This product works.  No issues there.  It is also free of hormone blockers and Vitamin A.  However, I had to shower twice to get the stuff off!  It goes on thick, stays on, and is greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  I am very fair and really need to be careful when spending any extended period of time (basically, more than 20 mins) in the sun.  But, I love the beach!  I purchased this before my husband and I left for our beach vacation.  I was looking for a product that didn&#x27;t have all the questionable chemicals in it, yet wasn&#x27;t thick/goopy and didn&#x27;t leave behind the white residue that so many products with zinc oxide do.  This product also has no discernible scent, for those put off by heavily scented products.  You just apply and rub until the sunscreen is no longer visible on your skin.  I reapplied each time I got out of the water/towel dried and I never got burned at all.  Ingredients listed on the bottle:  24.7% Uncoated Non-nano Zinc Oxide; Grape Seed oil, Organic Sunflower oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides(from Coconut oil), Organic Beeswax, Stearic Acid(from Palm oil), Organic Honey, Sea Salt and Purified Water.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey; but, I think it&#x27;s worth it to use a product that keeps me/my family from burning and also doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of questionable chemicals which could impact my or my family&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and so I have been using sunscreens for years. I like that this starts out white so you can see where you are applying it and then turns clear. I also like how it is safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick, so thick it will not come out of the squeeze hole, you have to unscrew the cap and does not spread easily; also leaves a sticky residue. Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> I like this product but it does tend to stay a little greasy on your skin. It applies well though and soaks in so you aren&#x27;t white from it. Careful though - since it&#x27;s a physical sunblock it can wipe off and I ended up with some burns on my feet where my sandals had rubbed it off.</li>
            <li> I had read that these zinc oxide formulas leave a white film. This does not at ALL. It dries clear. It&#x27;s also very shiny and leaves a residue, so if you&#x27;re on a beach, sand will stick to you big time. I had a basal cell carcinoma spot a few months ago so this eased my &amp;#34;skin cancer&amp;#34; paranoia and with it being all natural, the sand sticking thing isn&#x27;t a big deal. Just shower after as you would anyway after a beach or swimming in salt water. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t know how they made a non-nano natural zinc oxide sunblock clear, but they did.  I was already a fan of Loving Naturals because their baby sunblock is relatively easy to apply, has great ingredients, doesn&#x27;t bead up, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  After trying this product, I love this company even more.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little bit greasy, but it&#x27;s clear!  Incredible.  It goes on smooth and seemed to stay on well at the pool and beach.  I tend to reapply anyway because I&#x27;m one of those moms but I think the fact that it&#x27;s greasy helps to keep it from washing off easily.  If you&#x27;re used to the sunscreens sold in most stores then you may not be happy with this.  But if you&#x27;re looking for a natural sunblock that scores well on EWG and is easy to apply and clear then this is the one for you.  I&#x27;ve read that their clear face sunblock is even better, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I did tons of research on sunblock before visiting the Caribbean with my 8 month old daughter, and this is by far the safest on the market here in the US.  Some people might be put off by how greasy it is, but the alternative is another physical sunblock that shows up pearly white and is even harder to apply.  If your baby hates having lotions rubbed on their body and face, this is the pick for you.  The tube is small, but I believe this will go a longer way because of how easy it is to apply - I wasn&#x27;t constantly squeezing out more to cover her entire body.  We spent a lot of time in the sun and she did not get burned.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how much time this product took to absorb into my skin, and even then my shirt picked up a couple greasy stains from the product.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or too white/thick.  Product goes on nicely and I feel good putting it on my kids!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This works fine, but it has a little funky smell</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, definitely waterproof, and gives great sun protection!  I haven&#x27;t found any of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens that I like, but this works well. What I don&#x27;t like is the oily feel, but it&#x27;s better than others.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works good protecting from the sun but it was a little to greasy for me</li>
            <li> I appreciate the all natural ingredients, but it&#x27;s not always practical to be covered in oil that stays on the skin!</li>
            <li> Purchased for use during pregnancy.  Have really liked it.  Not overly greasy and I didn&#x27;t notice a residue at all, but just made sure I rubbed it in well.</li>
            <li> My wife insisted that we only put this all-natural, tree-hugger stuff on our children so I bought two bottles. It&#x27;s extremely expensive, it goes on greasy, and the bottle is very hard to squeeze which makes it tough to get every last pricey little drop out of it. I cut the bottle open when I was done with the first bottle and there was (complete eyeball guesstimate) 20% of product left in the bottle. Do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work though and if . 5 stars if they bring down the price and put it in a more functional bottle.</li>
            <li> I love natural products, I bought this for my kids. We live in New England, I start using it in April when finally we get the first signs of spring and my kids got sun burn! Not as bad, but still, SPF 30 is supposed to protect them for 1 hr/day they play outside. Other than not being effective, I could say I feel good that does not have toxins in the product.</li>
            <li> Only physical sunscreen (zinc oxide, non-nano) that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue. Rubs in quickly leaving a greasy look but one that is more tolerable than the white residue of Badger and Butterbean.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen has a slight odor bot not too bad and it is a little greasy but I prefer that over the natural sunscreen that won&#x27;t rub in.</li>
            <li> More oily than I expected, but, excellent odorless sunblock.  Found about it from EWG website  4-oz can is small for the money, but here is how to stretch your buck:&lt;br /&gt;1. Go to dollar tree/99c/Family Dollar/Walmart and get a ~2.8 OZ transparent dispenser with a mist spray head (sometimes they sell 2-3 of these together for one dollar)&lt;br /&gt;2. Get another sunblock (rated highly on EWG) with titanium dioxide as the active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;3. Rinse the bottle with clean water.&lt;br /&gt;4. Pour about 0.75 oz of Loving Naturals Clear Body SPF 30+ Non-Nano Zinc Oxide into the spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;5. Pour about 1.25 oz of the other sunblock into the spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;6. Pour about 0.8 oz of clean water (filtered or bottled-water is fine) into the spray bottle.]&lt;br /&gt;7. Shake Shake Shake.  Shake Shake Shake. Shake Your bottle!&lt;br /&gt;This is not a water-based sunblock, so you will probably be better off if your other sunblock is water-based, or thin.  Otherwise, repeat step 7 several times.&lt;br /&gt;8. Keep the tip of the spray nozzle clean by wiping off the excess on your sibling/offspring (when they are asleep)&lt;br /&gt;Result: you now have two non-toxic active ingredients (one good at UVB, the other at UVA protection) in an airport-friendly(&lt; 3.4oz) spray-can for easy application and even distribution, diluted with water to get the most out your money, refillable easily, easily visible how much you have left, put this in a zip-lock bag to protect from accidental leakage (bottle sprayer unscrewing), and you have got yourself the ultimate sun protection in your purse/swim bag/glove box/basement on Earth!</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen after hours of research into safe sunscreens. I am nothing but pleased with it. I used it on my 16 month old while camping at a lake and I used it while floating down a river for 3 hours in mostly sun and we both didn&#x27;t burn. It suggests to reapply every hour or 2 but I just put it on an hour before we left and it worked great. It also rubs in very nicely. I was a little worried because its zinc oxide but this one has no white residue at all. Once it hits our skin it&#x27;s clear. I&#x27;m so glad I like it because it is definitely a lot more pricey than mainstream sunscreens. I&#x27;d say the price is the only downfall but it&#x27;s about the same price as other safer ones and free shipping on amazon!</li>
            <li> Terrible product! I got bad sun burn using this product a few months ago. I was hiking and was out for only 45 minutes. I never get sun burn when hiking for that period of time. But when I put this product on first, and then went out, not only did I get sun burn, but I was red as a tomato!  I thought the product was defective and emailed the company for customer service help (since they don&#x27;t release a phone number).  I got no response.  I emailed again, saying for a second time I wanted a replacement due to what happened. No response. I will never use any products from Loving Naturals again. I use Badger sun screen now and had zero problems in the sun.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat allergic to the contents.</li>
            <li> Its great! No worries about chemicals and its fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t have any of those chemicals store brought sunscreen has. I have eczema so this really helped! :)</li>
            <li> Good, healthy ingredients, but it feels like vaseline. Thick greasy lotion isn&#x27;t the most comfortable thing to have on your skin when sitting in the hot sun. Definitely increases the sweat factor. Probably could find an equally safe product that applies more comfortably.</li>
            <li> We really liked it. Went on good, worked in well, invisible, protected us well. Nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> i paid top dollar for this product due to it stating its&#x27; non-nano and non-GMO ingredients, although research will turn up many other products already commonly on the market with neither (they just don&#x27;t openly state it).  i do appreciate and understand that it is a small business and hesitate to write a negative review for that reason, BUT, it is a top-dollar item and it shoudl deliver accordingly.  i can honestly say that this product has ZERO water resistance as tested on my 8 year old son and it barely holds up to even non-water situations. he burned quickly using it in almost any situation and i gave up using it after about 8 tries and could not justify the burning any longer.  other products with a lower UV rating were considerably and noticeably better at warding off burning.  i am so sorry it didn&#x27;t work out and i hope they come up with a more burn-proof formula.</li>
            <li> LOVE this sunscreen!! This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found so far. It&#x27;s not too thick or sticky. It actually leans towards being a little greasy, but not in a bad way. Spreads great and works great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to all sunscreen so I had to look for something for myself and my family to go on a family trip. This works and it&#x27;s natural. I used it on my baby boy and he didn&#x27;t get a sunburn at all. The best thing is that it goes on clear and you don&#x27;t look white.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This goes on ridiculously greasy, but it works.  If you can get past feeling like a buttered turkey, you&#x27;ll like it.  :-) None of us have ever gotten burnt using this product and we&#x27;ve worn it in the dead of summer in Disney World and on the beaches. Word of caution:  It only lasts for one season.  When we went to use what was left in the tube the next summer, it smelled like rancid oil.  You could try refrigerating it to make it last, but I&#x27;ve never tried it.  Why didn&#x27;t I think of that before??</li>
            <li> Bought this sunblock because I read great reviews on how it works. And, I do think it works great...IF and this is a big if....IF you can get past how greasy this sunblock is.  I wear sunblock both as an everyday application as well as for the beach so I use sunblock frequently. As soon as I put it on, I felt like I spread vegetable oil on my skin and it never really soaks in. It&#x27;s a clear and greasy. I felt like someone was playing a trick on me. \\&quot;How long can she stand to be that greasy? Let&#x27;s watch!\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t want to touch anything after applying it. Didn&#x27;t want the grease to get on my car seats, my clothes, my pets, my glasses, my hair, my camera, etc. Forget about ever applying it to my picky son who hates the feeling of lotion anyway. And, I&#x27;d never put this on my face! A teenager would be one big pimple in 5 minutes. This is a shame because the product works, smells nice enough and compared to other quality lotions, the price isn&#x27;t that bad. I used this twice and couldn&#x27;t bear to put it on again. I bought California Baby at the same time and we&#x27;ve been using that all summer instead. I think Loving Naturals will forever sit in my cabinet untouched until someone forgets how greasy it is and mistakenly puts it on.</li>
            <li> Greasy doesn&#x27;t soak into skin, stays greasy</li>
            <li> The other reviews were correct! It worked for 7 days in St. Croix snorkeling several hours a day. Easy to spread and totally clear!</li>
            <li> I like this product for its natural, non-dangerous ingredients, but I find it leaves a bit of a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Tried this and the Adorable Baby brands and both were great.  Hard to tell one apart from the other in their efficacy.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and non oily. I used it for the first time on my trip to Miami and its the best</li>
            <li> This is quite sticky when you apply it. Not good for face or under makeup</li>
            <li> I like that the formula is safe and doesn&#x27;t contain nano zinc oxide or oxybenzone. When you rub the sunscreen on your skin it immediately disappears but I feel that it&#x27;s really greasy. I think this formula really sits on top of your skin which is good for protection, but I can&#x27;t take the greasy film so I wash it off as soon as I get home. I&#x27;m going to try out a few other sunscreens from my local health food store before I try purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various natural sunscreens over the past five years or so, and I really liked the idea of getting one that didn&#x27;t have the terrible bluing effect of many mineral sunscreens.  Loving Naturals Clear Body didn&#x27;t really work out that well.  It is very sticky and greasy; it does not &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; or dry with time either.  While it&#x27;s okay for the body, it definitely isn&#x27;t great on my face.  Also, it does not offer enough protection for my very fair skin.  Even if I reapply frequently (which feels really gross), I&#x27;ve still gotten a bit burned on two separate occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a &amp;#34;Clear Face&amp;#34; sunscreen mentioned in a few places, but I could not find it to try on Amazon.  It may have been discontinued.  I will not be buying this formula again.</li>
