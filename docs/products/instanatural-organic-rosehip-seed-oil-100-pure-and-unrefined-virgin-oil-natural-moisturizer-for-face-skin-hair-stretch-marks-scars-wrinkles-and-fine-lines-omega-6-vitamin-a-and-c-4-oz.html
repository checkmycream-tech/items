            <li>very nice product.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural makes great quality products so if you&#x27;re contemplating whether you should by from them, trust me as an honest consumer who loves good quality products, yes you should!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So points for being very good for my skin, but a star off for the presentation, and because I can&#x27;t honestly see some of the benefits I should be seeing.  </li>

            <li>Works so good for the skin and for the hair.</li>

            <li>Rosehip oil is particularly good for circulatory problems</li>
            <li>I appreciate that there are no additives and that it is organic and of good quality.</li>
            <li>It is a light oil that goes on evenly and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t give a fair rating yet, because i just got it and</li>
            <li>I heard that it is good for rosacea and it has helped the redness a lot.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so good and because it&#x27;s kept refrigerated (for longer life)</li>
            <li>(I received this item at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>I bought this oil after reading that it was good for your skin.</li>

            <li>loved using this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I used it both day and night for maximum benefits and loved how my skin felt immediately after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good thing about this oil is that it doesn&#x27;t break  me skin out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has an earthy scent, which was surprising to me since I assumed it would smell like roses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective and is working great for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beauty-wise, I have normal-to-dry skin (fair w/freckles)</li>

            <li>It has always been a challenge to find a moisturizer that feels good on those areas.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to others.</li>

            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The fragrance wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;rosey&amp;#34; as I had hoped (more seedy than I care for) but it does have aroma that is pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell is not terrible but exactly pleasant either.</li>
            <li>I am most pleased with my order which arrived beautifully packaged a week ago.</li>
            <li>Another positive about this product (aside from the zillion already listed) is that it works perfectly as a massage oil.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in excellent  conditions and I have been using it for a 2 weeks period and certainly seems to help.</li>
            <li>I did lots of reading into what pure argan oil should be and how best to use it.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have added fragrances to make the product smell great (and irritate your skin), they are just 100% pure and sometimes that doesn&#x27;t smell so great.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling amazing -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and non-greasy, works great for your face.</li>
            <li>Review by the wife: &amp;#34;My skin looks and feel amazing, acne scars are lighter, and no breakouts - even while PMSing.</li>
            <li>This  oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s 100% non comedogenic, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>This oil is really amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the Rosehip Oil, the Vitamin C Serum or the Jojoba oil that I started using or maybe a combo of all, but my face looks amazing.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>you might want to add this amazing Rosehip oil to your list</li>
            <li>The rosehip seed oil is amazing for sunburns.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural also has amazing customer service.  </li>
            <li>Plus 4 oz is a HUGE bottle, at a great price.&lt;br</li>

            <li>stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>but I have seen amazing results after adding this product and a vitamin c serum to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>This is some amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Its amazing</li>
            <li>I have seen amazing results and the product does not leave my skin oily and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I still gave it 5 stars because I have decided to use the product as a body lotion/oil instead and its amazing.  </li>
            <li>I received this at no cost to be in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>--it had a kind of nutty, tea smell.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own</li>
            <li>I also thought I liked the idea of a pump and not a dropper for dispensing the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have been using rose hip oil combine with my body lotion for stretch marks</li>
            <li>My skin has a nice glow in the mornings.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it on his elbows and it leaves them looking nice and</li>
            <li>I do have to tell you that it does not have a rose like scent like the Moroccan Rose Water.</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t see the rose scent in this oil.</li>
            <li>I liked the oil - it was used in an oil blend.  </li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount, in return for my honest review and feedback.</li>
            <li>Now you can have skin like a rose</li>
            <li>liked the smell myself.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like flowers (Rose) to me</li>
            <li>Rosehip Seed Oil smells, well, kind of yucky.</li>
            <li>I wash my face, shave, and apply the rose hips before I hit the sack.  </li>
            <li>I have had some stubborn spots, and as soon as I use this, it&#x27;s all good :)</li>
            <li>So, I received this in conjunction with the rose hip seed oil from InstaNatural as a trial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even got in the habit of adding this after my shaving routine to effectively combat razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part is this one is really organic....</li>
            <li>I was hoping it had a rose tint smell.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; hormonal skin is loving this oil.  </li>
            <li>I recommend rose oil and this seller.</li>
            <li>I like to make my own skin care products and bought it to use in a recipe.</li>
            <li>My reviews are my honest opinion</li>
            <li>This rosehip oil felt nice when I applied it.</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing me with this bottle to review and send my honest feedback.  </li>
            <li>Thrilled with this purchase</li>
            <li>As soon as I started using this organic Rose hip oil</li>
            <li>rose hip oil  </li>
            <li>I have never tried Rose Hip Oil</li>
            <li>However, I really liked the fact that it was packaged in a pump glass bottle.</li>
            <li>But, for my face and neck I prefer to rely on the rose hip seed oil I was buying before.</li>
            <li>I purchased the rose hip oil for two reasons.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>I believe in the power of serums over creams (although I use one I make myself) because it is the best way for products to get into the skin, so I made a serum using this oil, and it is really benefiting my skin health.</li>
            <li>When I started using the Rose hip oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes this a greatly effective beauty oil?</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and has done so much for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly had never heard of rosehip oil or any of it&#x27;s uses.</li>
            <li>look to the reviews in hopes that people are being honest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honest in my reviews.</li>
            <li>With a organic shampoo and the rose hip oil I am hoping to rejuvenate some of my hair follicles into growing.</li>
            <li>seller sent instructions on how to use/store which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>After I cleanse at night, then I tone with the InstaNatural Rose Water</li>
            <li>The service was prompt and I also received follow-up inquiries to be sure that I had indeed received and was satisfied with the item - great customer service.</li>
            <li>Instanatural rose hip oil is organic, cold-pressed, and unrefined oil from the fruit or hip of the sweetbrier, also known in the Andes as rosa mosqueta, or scientifically as Rosa</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and absorbs into your skin nicely.</li>
            <li>My Grandma used to keep rose hip oil around, I never knew why, now I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here is the reason why I am loving it-</li>
            <li>I started this Rose Hip Oil review just 2 days ago</li>
            <li>I have been using this oil as well as the rose water toner from InstaNatural for one week.  </li>
            <li>This Rosehip oil seems to be of nice quality.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>That is until I discovered Instanatural Rose Hip Seed Oil.</li>

            <li>I purchased it to make my own anti-aging serum, but ended up using it by itself.</li>
            <li>I adore rose hip seed oil and after trying it for the 1st time I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I thought I would try their Rosehip Seed Oil and all can I say is that I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>This is my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>but this rose</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and smells very nice would buy again def recommend</li>
            <li>It is a light oil but very effective.</li>

            <li>so I&#x27;m glad they mention that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was using another brand that cost more</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a bit more of a floral fragrance</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my skin feel and have noticed a more even tone to my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you InstaNatursl for offering such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This company is great they really follow up with you and send you all the information you need.</li>

            <li>After using the Rosehip oil, the itch has lessened and so has the flaking, which in turn alleviated my soreness.</li>
            <li>am elated to have been able to use this product and can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>

            <li>Mostly anti-aging.</li>
            <li>And even my make up seems to go on more even and smoother as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product for many things but mostly to keep my scalp moist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered more to ensure I never run out of this product.  </li>
            <li>she doesn&#x27;t love the smell (it smells like an oil --</li>
            <li>Love this as an all purpose oil for my skin and face</li>
            <li>, I make sure I always have it on hand!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I hope it works and love the feeling of it.</li>
            <li>I have to stay constantly on top of foot care</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a chemical and preservative free formula!  </li>

            <li>I really love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love this Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li>and I love the results I am getting.</li>
            <li>but if I keep sharing my cream I will be buying more sooner than I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I use it more as a body oil now..</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I just love how it feels on my skin the day after.</li>

            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>and my skin began looking more rejuvenated and supple.</li>
            <li>Can I say I LOVE THIS?</li>
            <li>This ended up being a lovely transaction with a company that still believes in outstanding customer service in a day and age when ANY customer service seems to have all but disappeared.  </li>
            <li>This oil is lovely.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Most come in a 1oz size.  </li>
            <li>so whenever I do use it, I make sure that I&#x27;m not going anywhere that day.</li>
            <li>and I know with continued use they being to fade more and more.</li>
            <li>Very happy, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad that the description recommends to keep it refrigerated.</li>
            <li>and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- read the email the seller sends you about what you can expect (the fact that they actually send you an intro email is impressive, btw)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference on the texture of the skin on my face--it&#x27;s softer, more supple.&lt;br /&gt;Legs</li>
            <li>but, the consistency and odor I found to more agreeable to pop corn with than to slather on face and body.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks I can confirm that I love it and will continue the regime.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this product and will not go without it :)</li>
            <li>I really love this oil, i wear it at night before i sleep.</li>
            <li>I love the dispenser on this bottle.</li>
            <li>I think the best way to use this product is mixed in with one&#x27;s favorite lotion or cream.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and neck every day and love how it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t overwhelming</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to research more, but thought I&#x27;d post my question here as well.</li>
            <li>I will update the review when/if I find out more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mostly use it at night because of the smell.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like I have to exfoliate more often</li>
            <li>He isn&#x27;t sure if the rosehip oil is helping but feels like the scar is healing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It should be refrigerated but that just makes it all the more refreshing when using.</li>
            <li>I say 4 stars because comparatively, this oil is darker in color and has a more potent smell, with that said.</li>
            <li>I could not be happier or more grateful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been lovely.  </li>

            <li>My skin soaked the oil a lot better.</li>
            <li>Most of all the results I get with this rosehip oil does not leave an oily feel but my skin feels like lite silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Of the two products I can&#x27;t do without, this is one and the other is the InstaNatural rose water which is the best toner in the world.</li>
            <li>it absorbs into my skin quickly and goes on very lightly (yay!).</li>
            <li>wonderful product, very fast absorbing and love the smell.</li>
            <li>The company was wonderful and sent me a new bottle quickly.</li>
            <li>on my temple area, I&#x27;m very excited to see if this will help reduce the appearance of it.</li>
            <li>Pump is very useful!</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil has a nice rich</li>
            <li>The scent, which is quite nice and unique, dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>If you are interested in trying rosehip oil, this is a good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell to me was a bit off-putting, not really bad, but kind of nutty.</li>
            <li>I loved the results the first couple days</li>
            <li>As someone who really wants to limit the chemicals in my products but doesn&#x27;t want to sacrifice potency and effectiveness, I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this nourishing oil!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality oil I have tried cheaper oils that claim to be 100% pure even though they aren&#x27;t if you compare this oil to a cheaper one you will definitely be able to see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>Very nice, high quality rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li>I apply at night and my face looks significantly brighter!</li>
            <li>but, I love the way it soaks in easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply because it has a pump top</li>
            <li>I hope more rosehip seed oil providers adopt this easy to use pump-glass-bottle method of packaging.</li>
            <li>The pump top dispenses easily.</li>
            <li>There is no awful smell to it and it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is especially effective on dry, elbows, knees, cracked lips, and heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is especially effective on dry, elbows, knees, cracked lips, and heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love this product, but it does have a pungent smell almost like a strong paint.</li>
            <li>This is my second InstaNatural product (also have used their Rose Water), and my experience has been great on both counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I don’t even need that much for it to look good and healthy.</li>
            <li>I really like rose water and rose tea, so I thought I would like this.</li>
            <li>She is very discerning, and has been thrilled with this Rose oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an outstanding customer service and please keep maintaining the good quality product of this oil</li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with what this and the others have done to my skin and also the great customer service from Instanatural.</li>
            <li>I find that it’s best to use it right after a shower, as that’s when your skin is soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It will make fine wrinkles better</li>
            <li>It softens the skin on my hands and although I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles on my face, it is supposed to help diminish fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love using it under and around my eyes as it helps with fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love how it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that I purchased the rose hip oil and certainly will leave a positive review on Amazon regarding the rose hip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just makes it so easy to use, and when you&#x27;re doin gall these things in the morning to get ready for work, it&#x27;s great that the manufacturer makes it so easy to use their product without a huge hassle.</li>

            <li>This company is investing time and effort into making sure the customer is made to feel important.  </li>
            <li>most of all, the customer service is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it came time to buy more RSO, the brand I was using was no longer available.</li>
            <li>Arrived early; as advertised; feels great on skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural product to replace the use of chemical retinol creams, something I purposely wanted to get away from.  </li>
            <li>I read an article where a London model talked about her most important beauty tips and the nightly use of organic rosehip oil was her number one treatment.</li>
            <li>I love that it is available through Amazon Prime so that I can get it within 2 days.  </li>
            <li>This makes me happy because it is completely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a great product that can be recommended to anyone because it natural.</li>
            <li>What is fabulous about it is that is seals in moisture and leaves your skin with a lovely glow.  </li>

            <li>It was nice to have all the info right there at my fingertips to review.  </li>
            <li>Now I apply it right after my rose water.</li>

            <li>This stuff works great to make skin and face beautiful, soft and feel younger.</li>
            <li>I use other organic rosehip seed oil brands and they are perfect, but I still recommend this one if your skin can tolerate its power.</li>

            <li>Also seen a big improvement in my nails (the length) which is great :)</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly into skin.</li>
            <li>After using the clarisonic to clean my face, i apply this oil and my skin looks better than ever.  </li>

            <li>I am impressed with the few products I have used from the Instanatural line and look forward to trying out more of them in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I did notice the strong.</li>
            <li>Cons : strong odor</li>
            <li>I read reviews about the smell and that it&#x27;s strong for some people, but the smell didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>(I call them &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; scents), but if you prefer unfragranced products, it probably isn&#x27;t for you, just because it&#x27;s so strong.</li>
            <li>It has bit strong smell.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the InstaNatural 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li>The rosehip seed oil has a darker amber color and a very strong, earthy scent; it makes me think of freshly brewed tea.</li>
            <li>It does help to nourish and moisturize my skin in a very gentle and effective manner.  </li>
            <li>LOVE that it comes in a large bottle and is such a great value!  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing for a 4 oz bottle; can&#x27;t imagine higher quality.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the fridge as recommended which feels amazing since it is hot now.  </li>
            <li>wow, how amazing!  </li>
            <li>When I was offered the chance to try out this amazing, organic rosehip oil for the first time.</li>
            <li>Okay, I will start off by saying that this product doesn&#x27;t smell the best in my experience as far as these types of products go, it&#x27;s smell is earthy and indeed, well, natural.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it because it offers a great light weight moisture and a brightening affect  to the skin.</li>
            <li>First I apply rose water and then oil.</li>
            <li>May. Not only is the weather beautiful, my birthday and Mother</li>
            <li>Besides I have a normal skin which is naturally in a good condition</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was going to disregard the first email because, frankly, who has time?  </li>
            <li>Received quickly, nicely packaged, and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful &amp;#34;goldish&amp;#34; color &amp; smells as it should (remember, there are no additives such as a floral scent).</li>
            <li>their skin is more clean and smooth now.</li>
            <li>This product is also meant to be used for your face to treat fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>my fine lines under my eyes are still there no improvement</li>
            <li>smell was fine-</li>
            <li>I keep it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh, so its a nice cool treatment after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>The oil bottle was fine - no problem with oil or bottle.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin glow, fine lines disappear, and acne scars lighten.</li>
            <li>but when i put it on my face it felt fine and not too oily.  </li>
            <li>Still yet to see a change in my fine lines</li>
            <li>I am not super impressed</li>
            <li>I have fine lines and some wrinkles started</li>
            <li>How about adding it to a massaging oil and giving your significant other the best massage they ever</li>
            <li>He said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This is actually a great product I ordered it for myself and when I first got it didn&#x27;t care much for the smell (I</li>

            <li>Very mosturizing, the smell is kind of strong.</li>
            <li>I applied for the promotion this company was doing, and was super happy to be able to try out their facial oil.</li>
            <li>but it turns out a little oil does wonderful things.</li>
            <li>I love that this oil is 100% pure and organic , as are most skin products that I use.</li>
            <li>The best results I have had is with grade a pure African undiluted Shea butter which is antibacterial</li>
            <li>I just wanted to find something to calm, soothe and help to clear up my skin, and I certainly found it with this wonderful Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li>I order exclusively through this particular seller, and would recommend the same for anyone interested in great products, and great customer service.</li>
            <li>first thing that I noticed was that Rosehip oil is not greasy, it is very light, and it absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>I also have scaring which I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle</li>
            <li>and you can be really creative when making your own natural beauty/bath/body products including it.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle of rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>HUGE bottle</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge so I will have some for awhile</li>
            <li>This is a Huge bottle.  </li>
            <li>This bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>I had a huge zit that wouldn&#x27;t go away for 3 months.</li>
            <li>&amp; I see a huge difference on my skin (face).</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It will make you skin look Fabulous</li>
            <li>1-2 tiny drops was great for my hands/cuticles.</li>
            <li>This is such great stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>For me it even works under makeup, it&#x27;s that light.</li>
            <li>I was given lots of feedback from the company and also a free bottle of the oil</li>
            <li>(this is the case for any oils - heat and light are undesirable).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light oil.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, my hands and body and lightly on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Argan Oil recently with great results and was given an opportunity to also try this organic Rosehip Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it in the evening as well so when Iwakeup I still have smooth, radiant skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>what happened and they offered to mail a free replacement.</li>
            <li>It does add some shine, which is important to keep in mind for use on the face.  </li>
            <li>and I massaged it making him feel relaxed and his scalp was smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazing company really appreciate their customer service.  </li>
            <li>I use this primarily on my skin and it has done wonders.</li>
            <li>And on Amazon it’s free shipping.  </li>
            <li>so much to this company for this great present and the opportunity to try such wonderful products.</li>
            <li>They followed up to see how we were liking the product and then offered to send us free samples.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great</li>
            <li>so smooth..</li>
            <li>It has an earthy, natural smell to it that isn&#x27;t the most appealing to many.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure - free sample provided</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic cosmetic oil ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also supposed to be great for scars -- can&#x27;t speak to that as I don&#x27;t have scars to try it on, but since it&#x27;s so moisturizing I can only think it could help scarred skin.</li>
            <li>Finally, the customer service from InstaNatural has been great.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this works great on recent scars I have caused by acne.</li>
            <li>Personally it does not smell like roses lol.</li>
            <li>I enjoy caring for my skin.</li>
            <li>Two important steps are cleansing &amp; moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Lightly tap for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Would recommend using just a few drops to find out what amount works best for your skin.    </li>
            <li>I was sent this product for free to review, and share my thoughts.</li>
            <li>I also find using it this way during the day is great especially if you want to wear makeup, this way your face is not too oil/greasy</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received a free product for review.</li>
            <li>I received a free product for review.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>serum is so Orange, it looks like you gave yourself a cheap tan out of a can.&lt;br /&gt;After about an hour, I started to itch.</li>
            <li>They also sent me a free bottle of their Rosehip Oil as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After washing my face, I smooth on Hyaluronic acid, then I used about 5 drops of Rosehip.</li>
            <li>I smooth all but my eye cream onto my neck &amp; front of my hands.</li>
            <li>This has made an amazing and very noticeable improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>For the hair, I mixed it up with the coconut oil which is also great as well.</li>
            <li>it free to try out.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from InstaNatural to try and review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is light, and not too greasy and rubs in well with my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Natural is important to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I give the detailed benefits of this oil, I would like to list the components that make it veryeffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yet, it was a great essential oil to have to try.</li>
            <li>My wife said that her cuticles feel great and her scars and stretch marks are actually starting to look lighter.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>I apply this oil at night and my skin feels really smooth in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and light rosacea</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing and moisturize throughout  the whole day.</li>
            <li>My scars don&#x27;t improve much but overall it&#x27;s good!!!</li>
            <li>I was elated because I have heard so may good thing about this natural organic seed.</li>
            <li>It is another good quality product by Insta Natural .</li>
            <li>and it is going good so far.</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves my skin SO soft.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>But to me they smells good because it smells natural and earthy.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Beta-Carotene - A good source of pro-Vitamin A, another form of antioxidant&lt;br /&gt;- Natural Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip oil is a natural alternative and the oil form is the most effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Beta-Carotene - A good source of pro-Vitamin A, another form of antioxidant&lt;br /&gt;- Natural Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip oil is a natural alternative and the oil form is the most effective.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks good and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this oil I applied it at bedtime, the next morning my face looked so radiant, smooth and velvety, it was amazing!!</li>
            <li>this is a grat oil, specially it can erase any imperfection of your skin although it&#x27;s an oil it not so oily, because it&#x27;s easily absobed by your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the pleasant summery scent and the protection against drying that it has provided to my skin during this long winter’s end.</li>
            <li>2 more stars right there</li>
            <li>InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil is naturally rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega 3, 6 and 9), Vitamin A and C, that&#x27;s what makes it perfect for your face, hair and nails, plus it&#x27;s a skin enhancer.  </li>
            <li>The high beta carotene content gives it a beautiful golden orange that was quite a surprise the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a very nice cobalt blue glass bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li>she does say it does seem to helping and that her skin looks more vibrant and healthy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic , my skin loves it, I love it, natural product easy to read is the way to go!</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic and 100% pure!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product is pretty great, hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems yet (which is saying a lot because I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts)-</li>
            <li>It doesn’t have a very strong odor–it really just smells like what you’d expect oil to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love Rosehip Oil and this brand is just as effective as the more expense direct sales brands and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The instanatural line of products are high quality and nicely packed as well as packaged.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much will continue to buy ,my skin is much better after two weeks of use</li>
            <li>I love all the InstaNatural products--no chemicals, not tested on animals--but I have to say this is my new favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This spring I came to the realization that all my products were loaded with parabens and chemicals, nothing natural or pure and the result was that I was doing my skin and hair more harm than good.  </li>
            <li>bottle is a very generous 4 ounce size with an easy to dispense pump top.</li>
            <li>This would also help mask the smell if it really bothers you but even using the oil on its own, the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Wish it came in plastic container or travel friendly..</li>
            <li>Rosehip Oil is rich in Vitamin A and has often been referred to as “Mother Nature’s Retin-A” because of its anti-aging benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this - it&#x27;s my first time trying it</li>
            <li>Original order was damaged in transit and InstaNatural contacted me asking why I requested a refund (I did not, Amazon automatically did because of carrier damage).</li>
            <li>have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I would love it after the first whiff but the results make me chant vitamins for your face.  </li>
            <li>The preparation is also rich in antioxidants&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>skin is more radiant and it looks so much softer and youthful!</li>
            <li>it seems to moisturize it better than the hot oil I used on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Well a few months later I am happy to say that this product is incredible.</li>
            <li>Still, I was excited to try the product, and did so as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has helped reduce my fine lines and made my skin super</li>
            <li>Just wonderful smooth skin, it&#x27;s even brightened my face which is the only place I&#x27;ve used it so far.</li>
            <li>Though it is more expensive, cold-pressed is best because it has not been altered by heat and therefore retains more nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I might try mixing it with other ingredients to give it a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Feels nice, applies smoothly, and leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Most people think I look like I am in my 50s anyway (unless they are being extra kind).  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin super smooth and I have also been using it on my cuticles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>Light and super absorbent.</li>
            <li>I don’t believe you can find a better price for such an amazing product anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive these oils to try, I use the  rosehip seed oil in a rose petal salve and used it on my elbows and they have stayed soft for along time!  </li>
            <li>I have become really self conscious about these marks and am so happy to see them lightening.  </li>
            <li>The product is an oil but feels quite light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is a great skin oil for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more clear and feels more nourished.</li>
            <li>Works great for dry skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels SUPER smooth.  </li>
            <li>The pump is also good because the product is not exposed to light and air like it would be if you were having to open a dropper bottle all the time to use it.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I love a product that has many uses and is all natural, this is it.</li>
            <li>So many uses and such a nice sized bottle.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Non, greasy, and super light.</li>
            <li>This product is great for stretch marks and scars, I really can see how this oil has improved the appearance of my old stretch marks from my pregnancy and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find companies nowadays with such great customer service.</li>
            <li>It smells clean, actually.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients</li>
            <li>InstaNatural quickly sent the oil which was securely packaged.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of insta natural&#x27;s products, and I have to say that I am completely impressed.  </li>
            <li>My hair had the clean feeling without the slipperiness that I had become accustomed to from the chemical hair conditioners.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial product I have EVER bought in my life.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quick and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very light and fair skinned, maybe it doesn&#x27;t show on other skin types.</li>
            <li>Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very surprised that the Instanatural&#x27;s rose hip oil is diminishing fines lines and decreasing the size of pores.  </li>
            <li>I’m asked for gift ideas this time of year, I often don’t know what to say, and when I try to think of Mother’s Day gift ideas to give to the special women in my life, I’m stumped too.</li>
            <li>Love the large bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they have the 4 OZ and having it 100% pure</li>
            <li>love that this Rosehip Seed Oil is organic, 100% pure, has no chemicals, additives or added fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a 100% pure and organic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many claims and uses for this oil--from minimizing scars and stretch marks to moisturizing face, skin, hair, and nails.</li>
            <li>And the way it soaks right in with no oily feel!</li>
            <li>It is a very nice almost &#x27;dry&#x27; feeling oil, so you don&#x27;t feel all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was also a great price for such a large bottle of organic RHS oil!</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil has a distinct scent, but it is very mild and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve not had any adverse reactions with this particular brand, which is always great.</li>
            <li>The consistency is great, soaks right in, has tremendously helped my acne scars and current acne.</li>
            <li>All in all, very high quality oil with many benefits.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for 74  year old skin.</li>
            <li>WOW, what an amazing product this is.</li>
            <li>it had a hint of rose essence to make it smell pretty, as it just doesn&#x27;t have much smell at all now.</li>
            <li>Really made my skin look better in  days.</li>
            <li>This product keeps on working for a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase and noticed this time around the smell is stronger and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>but I say 3 weeks is good of enough time to see results</li>
            <li>Now, to be fair, I also bought another cream from InstaNatural and began using it at the same time.</li>
            <li>I mix one pump of it with sweet almond oil and put it under my eyes at night for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>You can read my full review here [...]</li>

            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

            <li>I use it on my face and It leaves it very hydrated without leaving it oily which I love.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soooo good the next morning.</li>
            <li>Check out my full review here: http://dianareese1.com/2014/09/26/instanatural-100-rosehip-seed-oil-review/</li>
            <li>I really hoped to like this product, since it has received so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>At night I&#x27;m more inclined to just use it straight up on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is also a good amount that will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only really good for the face, but I&#x27;m using it on my cuticles and nails/very healing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so good with my morning regime that everyone thinks Im 6-7 years younger than what I am..</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years and nothing ever really helped.</li>
            <li>I tried this Rosehip oil and was surprised at how nice my feet have been staying.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this rosehip oil so much..</li>
            <li>Not even sure if it is the real stuff- it smells like mustard oil.</li>
            <li>Loving the effects so far.</li>
            <li>I’d definitely recommend giving this a try for those looking for more natural solutions for their skincare needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d be happy to answer any questions/</li>
            <li>I am glad to have found a moisture that really works, I use it each morning and night.  </li>
            <li>so it hasn&#x27;t been a full 60 days</li>
            <li>Smells very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; which is not my favorite smell</li>
            <li>As a result, my hair is much softer, more manageable</li>
            <li>Came quickly, it is a true oil, I use it and can feel and see the improvement .</li>
            <li>I love him so much, says I should wear the stretch marks as badges of honor for the pregnancies of our two boys, but I just don&#x27;t think I am cool with that yet.</li>
            <li>It is pure, and so smells more like pleasant garden smells, such as fresh leaves.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just something to keep in mind if you don&#x27;t like products with a distinct fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip seed oil is also slightly dry and works great on the face.</li>
            <li>Rosehip Oil by Instanatural is a wonderful product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with combination (what I have), dry, or generally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t have much of a scent to it.</li>
            <li>The company shipped the product out very quickly with simplified packaging and personally contacted me by email to see how I liked the product.  </li>
            <li>It is POTENT and really doesn&#x27;t go away too quickly either.  </li>
            <li>it soaks right in and makes my skin look and feel fabulous</li>
            <li>I am loving finding new and interesting uses for this goodness and am excited to make some natural beauty/bath/body products including this oil.</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth, had volume, was soft, revitalized and there was a healthy clean sheen.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal though; and the cool temperature helps to make it all the more refreshing to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels amazing after using the Rose Hip for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>So far I used this product for two weeks and my skin is really happy and already feels super soft.  </li>
            <li>This type of oil does not clog pores and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a good quality natural product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Package came quickly and met my expectations.</li>

            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month, can&#x27;t say enough how much I love it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and I no longer notice a smell:</li>
            <li>This is great with acne-prone sensitive skin, I have almost no break outs and my old acne scars</li>
            <li>and it goes away rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>It feels oily for a minute or two (of course, it IS an oil) but soaks in quickly and leaves skin</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and I like this oil</li>
            <li>and I have them in my quick buy option now with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>As with most things it is accumulative and only gets better with time.</li>
            <li>Within a day of making my purchase, I received an email from the company containing useful tips and more information about this product, which was very helpful since I had not used Rosehip Oil before.</li>
            <li>Luckily it does not linger for longer.</li>
            <li>Oil absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the grime it had picked off on my face after just a quick sweep of the area.</li>
            <li>or I get athletes foot that quickly gets out of control.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly followed by an e-mail from AJ explaining how to use the oil, what it should look like, smell like and how it works.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, as it should.  </li>
            <li>: After receiving more information from the seller, I think I used more than I needed to the 3rd time.</li>
            <li>I love that I can get results like this from a natural oil - not some over priced, over marketed, chemical filled cream.  </li>
            <li>I think the beauty industry is turning more and more to these healing ingredients as an alternative to the chemicals we have relied on in the recent past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have given this product a five star rating as it is the best deal by far world wide.</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s a bloody marvelous deal and a great product.</li>
            <li>This particular brand has no fillers which is refreshing.</li>
            <li>Overall my skin feels better and looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have very dry under eyes and this is the BEST under eye serum ever, I was using philosophy&#x27;s Miracle worker under eye gel, which was ok but not great, this oil is far more superior in hydrating the under eye area</li>
            <li>Love it,, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The scent dissipates quickly though and is certainly not so unpleasant that I wouldn’t use it at all.</li>
            <li>oil has a mild smell, but it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>and I love the applicator, it works very well to dispense just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I then heated the glass jar with the Rosehip in a bowl of very hot water for about 30 seconds, so the oil was very warm but not hot.  </li>
            <li>I want you to know that it feels fantastic when you first  put it</li>
            <li>I also had a great experience with the customer service and will most definitely do business with this company again in the future.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Organic Rosehip Oil and am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>After the very first use (before bed) I woke up that morning and noticed my skin looked dewey and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The oil is somewhat more thicker and greasier than the Trilogy brand I normally use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been very inventive with my use of it up until now, simply using it to moisturize my nails and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that know you can ship to Mexico, and it arrived in only two days.</li>
            <li>I have bought several products from InstaNatural  &amp; have been very, very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Keeps it fresh and feels cool going on.</li>
            <li>but the scent is not totally unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a firm believer that these are the foundation of having beautiful skin and preventing premature aging.  </li>
            <li>Rosehip oil also has antioxidant properties which is good for your skin in the long term.</li>
            <li>Pure Rosehip Seed Oil absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on fine lines and wrinkles for about 3 weeks now, and even upon first application, my skin felt replenished, calm, and my skin tone looked healthier.  </li>
            <li>I did receive my product very promptly,  the price was the best for the size, packaging was very protective and the product itself appears to be very beneficial,  although i have only used it for a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a distinct odor, but not unpleasant and it fades fairly quickly after applying, so it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me.  </li>
            <li>I keep it in the fridge to keep it nice and fresh since its starting to get real hot.</li>
            <li>THEY contacted me and offered me a new bottle free of charge!  </li>
            <li>So cool, right?</li>
            <li>and I have some still bright and visible small scars as a reminder that I am hoping to fade a bit more.</li>
            <li>It does great for smoothing my skin and making scars less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It smells very earthy and the odor very quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li>It makes all of those dry patches look good.</li>
            <li>This will stay freshest in the fridge which makes it feel nice and cool to put on when it&#x27;s roasting outside.</li>
            <li>The pump is wonderful because I&#x27;m pretty clumsy and always end up spilling dropper bottles.</li>
            <li>It has been prone to bleed easily if I scratch it and is now much healthier looking and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dry oil that help in keeping your skin moisterized.  </li>
            <li>scalp is dry at times and this helps with dryness and makes my hair have a good look and feel.</li>
            <li>love the oil, it makes my skin very soft and easier to put on make up</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my face feel - very soft.  </li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this oil and this brand!!!</li>
            <li>I used to buy the make-up counter face products from Macy&#x27;s until I tried my first product from this company!</li>
            <li>First time in my life!</li>
            <li>First!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>To alleviate this simply add the rosehip oil to your favorite lotion and voila!</li>
            <li>I love all natural and organic skin and makeup products!</li>
            <li>I admit I was one of the many I bet that was surprised that this oil was not like &amp;#34;roses&amp;#34; at all!</li>

            <li>(it comes from the seeds/stems, not the rose petals), but mostly like black tea...</li>
            <li>Plus it reminds me of delicious memories of french crepes.&lt;br /&gt;During winter time it appears to Help on preventing dry skin cracking on hands too.</li>
            <li>The bottle suggests to add favorite essential oil which I have done, but I can still smell the strong oil smell.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin leaving it feeling supple, smooth, and very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came very quickly and is exactly as listed....;)  </li>

            <li>I wanted something else with a little more oompf and read the many fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li>it is very moisturizing and light.</li>
            <li>The combination of these products has given me amazing results -- revitalizing my skin and making me look younger!</li>
            <li>I few drops works great for me.</li>

            <li>The results after about a month of twice daily use is amazing.</li>

            <li>There aren&#x27;t many products I can use near my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face at night before bed and wake up with skin that looks alive and healthy.</li>
            <li>Such a nice company.  </li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Powerful and</li>
            <li>I am glad to have found a natural product I can use on my face as well as anywhere.</li>
            <li>I use it with my makeup remover and after fresh face moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li>worth a try.</li>
            <li>I was initially contacted by the company to see how I liked the products.</li>
            <li>but this one does what it says in a natural organic way which is much more preferable.  </li>
            <li>Ive bought many things from amazon but this product really surprised me.</li>
            <li>This goes on and spreads so smoothly, then soaks in and leaves your skin feeling baby booty smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the Rose Water toner from the same company.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>If you know anything about oils, some do have a distinct smell which disappears in minutes.  </li>
            <li>I received a bottle complimentary but the opinion expressed is all mine.</li>
            <li>This has no chemicals, is 100% natural, and works better too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising to see that they are fading slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>when winter hits and the heaters come on, it will be just as useful.</li>

            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth getting this one for convenience.</li>
            <li>I have bought a lot of pricey skin care and the rose hip oil makes my skin softer than any of the big name products with ingredients I cannot begin to pronounce!</li>
            <li>That’s a product worth its weight in gold during sandal</li>

            <li>i was more than surprised sample provided for review</li>
            <li>Overall I have healed nicely and function close to 100%.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product I&#x27;ve noticed the scar tissue on both my leg and knee is much more pliable and soft.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I have been using this AM and PM and so far love the results.</li>
            <li>It is worth literally every penny.</li>
            <li>so I put Rose hip to the test and it worked the next day</li>
            <li>It works in nice and really gives the skin a soft feel and appearance.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing in the email was the need for the rosehip oil to be refrigerated (I missed that initially on the label).  </li>
            <li>I had to laugh because she is 83 and in a nursing home</li>
            <li>It does have a distinct smell to it, but it was not rancid for me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their skin to feel soft as rose petals.</li>
            <li>I know now why it has been used for generations and why the people that use it have such beautiful, clear, &#x27;pretty&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li>This purchase was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Good product, good vendor, you can&#x27;t go wrong with ordering anything from InstaNatural.</li>
            <li>The oil was a vibrant amber just like it is supposed to be and the pump makes it easy (&amp; hygienic) to dispense.</li>
            <li>I have used the rosehip oil now for about 3 weeks and can see a considerable difference in my scars and even though my stretch marks are from pregnancies of more than 20 years ago, I can still see a difference in the color and texture of them.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hands feeling refreshed and worth it.</li>
            <li>that provides natural and safe</li>
            <li>The company has emailed me to check to see how I liked their products and give me proper instructions on how to apply their products.</li>
            <li>I use this oil along with Argan Oil (from the same manufacturer) and coconut oil to make my own face cream</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels..</li>
            <li>I have noticed a smoother, more plump, soft appearance to my skin in the morning.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more luminous and soft.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the fridge to keep it fresh</li>
            <li>Made my nails grow and my skin soft love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can be used directly from the bottle, or mix it into your favorite moisturizer or lotion.</li>
            <li>Love that it is totally natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beginning to love my skin and not be so self conscious anymore.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve received many compliments since I started using it that my skin looks soft (&amp; it is.....</li>
            <li>Love this product so far.</li>
            <li>and I feel much better putting the natural rosehip oil on my face rather than lots of chemicals</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for just that.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural is COMPLETELY natural and feels better on my skin than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and performs as I need it to.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking soft and healthy..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, however, and tends to fade away once the product has been absorbed.</li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is useful for premature aging and skin pigmentation problems.  </li>
            <li>It is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I rarely get acne</li>
            <li>Just started using it and see results and love how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m changing my lifestyle to more organic, natural products</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural, organic and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>I did however add a few drops of vitamin E, which alone is wonderful on the skin, just for a natural preservative .</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the smell of all those healthy Omega 3s that naturally occur in the oil.</li>
            <li>This is highly reputable to organic natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Am still working out my own personal formula</li>
            <li>I have been using this for like only 2 weeks and the result is good so far!!!</li>
            <li>I mix InstaNatural ORGANIC Rosehip Oil 100% Pure &amp; USDA Certified 4OZ with Original Keri Lotion and then put L&#x27;Oreal Visible lift CC Cream over both.  </li>
            <li>It looked dry and flakey but now looks great and normal.</li>
            <li>In my honest opinion, I would look at other brands if you want to buy facial oils, as it looks like Instanatural gives out a lot of free/discounted product for good reviews.</li>
            <li>The color is rich golden and it has an unusual, nutty scent.</li>
            <li>It is a rich feeling oil that can moisturize and make your face feel so incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I just needed a  straight-out moisturizer without any frills (as I said, I have so many other things I layer on my skin that I&#x27;m already doing triple duty in most areas of skin care management.)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really expect to see any results this soon, then the other day my mother asked what I was doing to my skin because it looks great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unrefined rose hip oil has an unusual clean, verdant odor, similar to the leaves and stems of roses.  </li>
            <li>The first time I bought rosehip seed oil, shortly after the purchase I received an email from the seller stating the qualities of a good pure oil.</li>
            <li>I received this a few days ago and I am in love with this!!</li>
            <li>By the way, the customer service is superior and the seller was not aware of my profession.</li>
            <li>Which is a good thing because wearing it could clash with your perfume or other fragranced products that you use.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the other ones I have used.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice, dark glass pump container, which is so much easier than just a twist off top,</li>
            <li>My routine right now is OCM (castor/almond oils),</li>
            <li>I appy it on my face right after the shower and my legs too.</li>
            <li>Right now is too soon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying nightly right after showering, then wrapping the skin while I sleep.</li>
            <li>But we always strive for and want some improvement, right?</li>
            <li>And also try applying it right after taking the shower when the benefits from using beauty products are the highest.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C serums are all the rage right now and what’s not to like?</li>
            <li>price makes this oil just right for a Vitamin C serum that can be used all over the body.</li>
            <li>This is quality rosehip oil right here.</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference right way.</li>
            <li>Right away, I could tell my skin agreed with it</li>
            <li>nighttime use is recommended, right before bed</li>
            <li>It nourishes your skin and you will see and feel the nutrients right away.</li>
            <li>My friends and family have made unsolicited positive comments!  </li>
            <li>but my main benefit was to look for one that will me smooth out my skin and reduce the appearance of my stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used rose hip seed oil before, so I am aware of the fact that it does not actually smell of roses.</li>
            <li>The color of this oil is pretty much similar to its mountain rose herbs counterpart.</li>
            <li>Its the best $16 bucks I have spent in a LONG time.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see its positive long term results specially on the damaged parts of my skin :)</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs very quickly and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>However, it may be the exception that proves the rule, ‘a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.’</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to any one with acne scar and dry skin issue!&amp;#34; Thank you Amazon for this amazing product!</li>
            <li>Quickly noticed positive signs in my skin.</li>
            <li>There is a distinct odor to this product - it smells earthy and very much like some of the products I use for leather conditioning.  </li>
            <li>but I usually have a pretty good sniffer and it was fine with me.</li>
            <li>but to be fair, i also started using another new  product around the same time i started using this</li>
            <li>So far everyone is loving my new cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product after using it for three weeks, generally in the morning after I wash my face, cleanse with Moroccan Rose and then put a little of this</li>
            <li>this product is really easy to use packaging is fantastic and the bottle is a generous supply that will lat and last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The four ounce glass bottle is tinted blue to protect the oil from light, and the cap has a glass dropper for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stinking and oily, but that&#x27;s expected.&amp;#34; He assured me the oil absorbed quickly but he has been adding a spray lotion after using the rosehip oil because he really didn&#x27;t like the rosehip oil smell.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after a co worker recommend it, I got a minor rash that seemed like a heat rash on my face, I continued to use it because of the amazing reviews .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently making the transition into using more natural beauty products in my nightly routine to encourage healthy cell growth and keep wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li>and my face looks much better more soft, fresher and younger</li>
            <li>It does feel oily when you first put it on,  but it does get absorbed soon after.  </li>
            <li>When I first I applied it went on oily but it quickly absorbed into my skin and the oily sheen vanished</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because the bottle arrived covered in oil which really ticked me off, though the bottle was still full</li>
            <li>My skin also is NOT sensitive, so please adjust what I say to your own situation.  </li>
            <li>I usually purchase my organic rose hip seed oil in bulk from mountain rose herbs, so buying it from Amazon was new for me.</li>
            <li>And the price is amazing for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>As far as the fairly noticeable difference in overall color in comparison to my right elbow, well since I&#x27;ve been using this product they are almost a matching pair of elbows once again.</li>
            <li>I have used many rosehip seed oils from different brands, but decided to try this one due to the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is rich in vitamins and this makes it ideal for adding bounce and silkiness back into limp, lifeless</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is rich in vitamins and this makes it ideal for adding bounce and silkiness back into limp, lifeless</li>
            <li>Does anyone else feel like the year is flying by, because I certainly do!</li>
            <li>As pure as it gets!</li>
            <li>could not believe how amazing this oil helped my dry skin on my face but</li>
            <li>Even though goes on very oily, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It also helps to heal super fast too.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks younger, more dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on dry patches on my own skin, and for my son&#x27;s cradle cap and even diaper rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of rosehip oil along my skin care journey and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This oil leaves my skin petal soft and is easily absorbt</li>
            <li>Then I tried this awesome oil in my hair and it left it shiny and bouncy as it air dried.</li>
            <li>For a facial moisturizer it&#x27;s been great, my pores seem smaller and any blackheads I had seem to be disappearing.</li>
            <li>The company even took the time to reach out to me a few weeks after having ordered to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>After using this in various beauty uses for a couple of months, I can say that it is a good all over moisturizer for the winter so far.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a similar consistence to the Vit C serum, but this is very moisturizing and feels amazing on my face.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and makes the skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>but, to my big surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and pretty much a one ingredient product for my face.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Not the kind of natural written on labels of national brands, but REAL natural products that have REAL ingredients, not lab created ones.</li>
            <li>I love the way this oil blend right into my skin instantly.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all, and it is worthwhile for your dry skin.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>This oil absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this has a multitude of uses, it’s been working very, very well to repair my damaged hands</li>
            <li>I very much like this oil, and would recommend it highly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fine lines, small brown spots faded and keeps my face a nice texture.</li>
            <li>The best part is that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this oil is that it’s an all natural product with no fillers, rich in antioxidants, essential fatty acids and on top of all that it’s a multi-purpose moisturizer with healing affects for face, skin, hair, nails, stretchmarks, scars, spots and even psoriasis and eczema.</li>
            <li>It is a little sticky but once again after it absorbs the sticky feel will go away and it absorbs nice into the skin especially after a warm bath/ or shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Yes, when it first goes on it will be a bit shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However this helps me so much!</li>
            <li>After one month of using it I have to say I really like it!</li>
            <li>I love this...added some essential oil to cut the smell.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Rosehip Seed Oil I have purchased</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget that glass of wine ;)</li>
            <li>Love using this on my face with essential oils!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product, I simply use it for everything, body, face, hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all !</li>
            <li>I love the results enough for put up with the smell.</li>
            <li>first I don&#x27;t like the smell, but now I&#x27;m getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This is a great sized bottle and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working okay, haven&#x27;t been using daily.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If your bathroom gets hot and steamy then keep it somewhere else</li>
            <li>No one up close and personal will be able to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference within the first 2 days.  </li>
            <li>have tried so many different products and nothing came close to the results I have from this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really have noticed a difference, which is so rare in my world of skincare product experimentation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told by complete strangers that my skin looks fantastic and that it&#x27;s glowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase more InstaNatural products in the future.</li>
            <li>First it was lupus,</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first experience with using Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li>I won’t lie, it’s pretty</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly I didn’t quite like the oil when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>It is a chemical and preservative free formula extracted from (Rosa Mosqueta) that provides natural and safe protection and total skin revitalization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cap cracked and broke the first time I screwed it on.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, but it is very sticky and has a distinct odor.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this product, I used it at night.  </li>
            <li>Great product in a 4 ounce bottle that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I am definitely continuing use to see how much more improvement</li>
            <li>into your pours- really moisturizing!</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, or if you have acne prone skin, be aware that it can block your pores.</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite smell in the world, but I got used to it after several times of using it.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that they will get even lighter with continued use, and then maybe I won&#x27;t feel so funny</li>
            <li>What I like most is, it keeps my skin looking hydrated all day and actually changes the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>One squirt rubbed into my hands makes my hands soft and smooth and it protects my hands, even in water, until I use soap.</li>
            <li>and it also helps the skin produce more collagen which will make you look younger and make your face or skin</li>
            <li>and so I first looked to InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil for increasing the blood circulation in my face.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about this company and will continue to order their products as long as they are around.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>First I must warn you that it smells like vitamins.  </li>
            <li>That is what I kept telling myself when I applied it to my face the first night.</li>
            <li>Even the first morning after applying it I could feel a difference.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I feel like my face is softer and looks clearer and more even-toned.</li>
            <li>But the second I get home and start using it again, it looks better.</li>
            <li>this is my first time using it</li>
            <li>More about the actual product from Instanatural...</li>
            <li>and I will most definitely order another bottle as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li>I love how this product improves my overall skin</li>
            <li>well-so much better than not using anything or covering with a bandage only.  </li>
            <li>It is also a very generous size so it is well worth its price.</li>
            <li>However, this one smells exactly like SOY SAUCE.</li>
            <li>Got this for free from Insta Natural</li>
            <li>Like this brand better than the last one I ordered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger and a better value.</li>
            <li>for several weeks, as the bottle runs out, she&#x27;s been asking me to buy more.</li>
            <li>so I will update my review later with any and all results after I have used this more to see if this claim is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the ingredients are stellar.  </li>
            <li>Just want to have more information about this oil, I read about it in difference languages, the benefits about this oil are almost the same as well.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of muscle tightness from my job and this oil makes it much easier to get those knots out!</li>
            <li>No negative reactions and my skin stays moist with one or two moisturizer application and the rose hip oil instead of multiple applications throughout the day before buying this product.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and soft even with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what InstaNatural says it does.  </li>
            <li>I love using essential oils  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft, smooth and helps it look brighter.</li>
            <li>My hair has not only felt healthier, it also seems more voluminous after using the Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I most likely will not purchase again.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate how the Insta Natural Rosehip Oil makes my skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I normally use it after I have used the Moroccan Rose Water Facial Toner.</li>
            <li>The first night I tried it, I didn&#x27;t have makeup on.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and a pretty big bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like this Rosehip Oil!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although at first the logo turned me off (first impressions and all), the positives outweighed the logo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it as a carrier with essential oils for my skin serum and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and when I run out, I will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li>The oil at first seems</li>
            <li>Thanks AJ!</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in the softness of my skin after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more soon.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Rosehip Seed oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;- use it immediately after your skin is moist, like after taking a hot shower</li>
            <li>It also smells sort of like eggs at first</li>
            <li>Thanks InstaNatural!</li>
            <li>At first the smell didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>so primarily wanted it as an all natural moisturizer that didn&#x27;t burn/sting.  </li>
            <li>love these products from InstaNatural and would definitely recommend them!e</li>
            <li>The smell was pretty off-putting, but after reading a suggestion from another reviewer to use it as an add-in with another moisturizer, I went with four stars.</li>
            <li>I love this oil and have added it to my daily moisturizing regime.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of InstaNatural&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different creams and lotions to help this problem, yet nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Very Pleases!  </li>
            <li>were within the first couple applications.  </li>
            <li>first I tried to apply my moisturizer first, then the oil but</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes I would be interested in trying the vit. C, I have never used vit. C and would like to know how it works on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using oils.</li>
            <li>Okay so I tried a different brand..</li>
            <li>This is the first Rosehip Oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well</li>
            <li>Nice pure amber oil, smells mellow and not odd or unexpected.</li>
            <li>You can mix in the oil in your favorite cream, use it alone or make a refreshing facial mist in just a few easy steps.</li>
            <li>Skin is super soft!!</li>
            <li>wearing my shorts.&lt;br /&gt;IT also works great on extra dry skin like your elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin and does well mixed with Argan oil as an overnight hair treatment--wash out in the morning.</li>
            <li>She tells me it is quick dissolving on the fingertip and that you really don&#x27;t need a napkin or anything like to apply; straight from hand to face.  </li>
            <li>But honestly, it only took about three uses to adjust and once you begin working it into your skin that initial fishy funk turns earthy and pleasant.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed it and my face was super soft.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil in general is really good for your skin (especially if you have scars that need healing) and this one is as good (if not better) than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did - the oil makes my skin soft and younger looking without the harsh chemicals and it was happy to find that the oil is organic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip oil has a high content of essential fatty acids and is a perfect skin hydration tool.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip oil has a high content of essential fatty acids and is a perfect skin hydration tool.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again and love that it is unrefined, organic and a large bottle for the price paid.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for natural products to use on my skin and hair and was excited about trying this organic rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really excited to try Insta Natural&#x27;s Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>The smell of this rose hip seed oil is extremely fishy.</li>
            <li>I love this oil it has so many uses and really softens skin, it also will help get rid of past sun damage and tanning bed damage</li>
            <li>I was using a different brand from the healthfood store but this is half the price and just as good!</li>
            <li>The smell is  kind of like walnuts&#x27;s smell, and only smell strongly in the first few seconds, and quickly loosest the smell.  </li>
            <li>Its a very high quality oil at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing [duh], and great to mix with lotions.</li>
            <li>Lightly pat the oil onto your clean, dry face.</li>
            <li>I am a product whore and test lots of things from drugstore to brand name ... for a decent price I say it&#x27;s worth it, but give it time.</li>
            <li>But it’s only because I had no experience with using any kind of natural oil for skin purposes</li>
            <li>I am now making my own products with totally organic and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Intranatural rosehip seedoil is, according to a female friend, fast absorbing and makes her feel more confident going into her job regarding her facial appearance.  </li>
            <li>The price is more reasonable than Argan oil, especially when you consider this comes in a 4 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They offer a money back guarantee if you aren&#x27;t completely satisfied, so you have absolutely nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li>I must say that it has a very fish oil smell and although it fades when it dries, it can come back at the end of the day so it might be better to use it at night</li>
            <li>Better blood circulation mean better cell repair and smoother brighter</li>
            <li>I love that there are no fillers in this, 100% pure + that the seller really believes in their product with the 100% money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to let it dry out first if you are going to use the oil on your feet and put some socks on.</li>
            <li>I hope I will see some positive results soon.</li>
            <li>Was super hesitant to try oil on my sensitive, sometimes break-out prime skin, but I had finally heard enough good things</li>
            <li>i am a first time user of this product, i am the type of girl who doesnt know much about beauty products</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, I have been using everyday and can see the change it has made in my skin.</li>
            <li>At first, I was worried that this oil might not suit my skin type, but it turned out very well.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice much difference with use</li>
            <li>However, I find that I am using it pretty much as a stand alone product every night.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It seems very oily when you first put it on</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant at first my skin being combination and getting blackheads on my T zone.</li>
            <li>Could the secret to beautiful skin lie in roses?</li>
            <li>I have used it for close to a month in place of the retinol and have noticed it works as good as, if not better, than retinol.  </li>
            <li>If you can get past the scent, it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>I usually use about two drops per hand and that is ample to get good</li>
            <li>someone that has used rosehip seed in the past, it&#x27;s a pleasure to pass along some uses and why I feel this is a good brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have older skin, wrinkles and lines;  haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to know if it will help these problems or not, but it leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>They really work on fine lines and wrinkles have seen a huge difference using this product along with their other anti aging face creams.</li>
            <li>My pores were becoming so large it was so gross.</li>
            <li>I have been using their Argan oil daily on my nails and have never before had fingernails that are so strong, long and healthy.</li>
            <li>I use it in my face and my body as a moisturizer, in result my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>By morning my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave shine, is nearly odorless (smells a bit nutty during application but doesn&#x27;t linger), doesn&#x27;t transfer, works well under makeup, and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li>It can be used as a moisturizer, an anti-aging agent, to help repair sun damage and scars, to make dry hair healthy and shiny, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so my skin can be a bit more dry.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves my face/hands feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a refreshing lotion for the dry summer skin.</li>
            <li>However, once you apply and it sets it makes your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I also use it in the place of my facial moisturizer, it absorbs easily, and then I apply my sunscreen followed by my cosmetic</li>
            <li>Be sure to store in a cool spot with no light.</li>
            <li>I actually like that it&#x27;s not perfumed and strong</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, spreads easily, and after a little while, my skin feels like silk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily wiped down for a clean feel and even though it&#x27;s oily, it does not aggravate my oily skin in any way.  </li>
            <li>It is an item that certainly I will keep buying over and over again.</li>
            <li>After I use this for a while I will add coconut oil, olive oil or any pure oils I have to my skin routine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is organic and pure.</li>
            <li>Look for 100% Pure on the label.</li>
            <li>Instanatural 100% pure rosehip seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve been using InstaNatural 100% pure Rosehip Seed Oil for a week now</li>
            <li>InstaNatural believes in the earthy scent of pure oil</li>
            <li>oil comes in a fairly large bottle</li>
            <li>100% pure, certified organic, Rosehip Seed Oil by InstaNaturals contains no fillers and comes in a large 4 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been using organic pure rosehip oil for about 5 years for face, neck, chest, and hands.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that is completely pure.  </li>
            <li>Organic rosehip oil 100% pure .</li>
            <li>product appears to be pure as advertised</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 100% pure &amp; organic</li>
            <li>100% pure, Organic, and</li>
            <li>It comes in a large bottle and dispensed by a spray.  </li>
            <li>pure Rosehip oil on stretch marks, age spots, hyper-pigmentation, burns, and scars</li>
            <li>Massage pure Rosehip oil into the scalp; leave it on for 30 minutes, and then shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pure Rosehip oil on stretch marks, age spots, hyper-pigmentation, burns, and scars</li>
            <li>Massage pure Rosehip oil into the scalp; leave it on for 30 minutes, and then shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, age spots seem to be lighter , and my laugh lines seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li>As much as I still have a nice figure, my tiger stripes (stretch marks) really bother me and shot my confidence down.</li>
            <li>The Rosehip oil keeps my skin smoother longer than the Argon oil-though it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or oily especially when I use it on my face and neck-this makes skin silky smooth where Argon is a little heavier and more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great on skin and hair (wet or dry) and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smoother, gives it an extra glow, seems to be smoothing some fine lines and has not made me break out at all.</li>
            <li>only time will tell if it helps with the fine lines and acne scars.</li>
            <li>I apply this nightly to my face and neck mixed with lavender and carrot seed oil to reduce fine lines, minimize discoloration and rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this regularly, I have noticed a pretty significant change in the condition of my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this exceptional product in the past, without a hitch.  </li>
            <li>very emollient, good for your skin, and definitely something I&#x27;d add to a moisturizing cream or lotion to up the ante against dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very dry an I love how it feels after I massage my hands and face with it before going to bed....</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smooth and my face isn&#x27;t dry or oily, it is just right.</li>
            <li>I just scrub every night with cetaphil antibacterial soap and put on a little bit of rosehip oil before bed, and just rub my face with really warm water instead of re-washing.</li>
            <li>Works good especially because I have dry patches in my skin!</li>
            <li>Then I appy Insta Natural Toning Rose Water with a clean cotton pad using small upward circles again.</li>
            <li>Nest I have some conflict previous to trying the Rose Hip Oil due to reading that it can have a &amp;#34;Fishy&amp;#34; order and not to expect at all al &amp;#34;Rose&amp;#34; scent like many do.</li>
            <li>This oil made such a huge difference to my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I got my product within 2 days of ordering and that was the free shipping option that stated it would take at least 5-8, so WOW amazing turn around time to start.</li>
            <li>The entire transaction, from start to finish, was smooth and shipping was lightning fast.</li>
            <li>, we&#x27;re talking very fine)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the item was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>Such a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference since I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my face.</li>
            <li>Seller was very responsive and helpful with questions.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to try rosehip because I have always heard so much about it.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate their warning, but this info needs to be presented BEFORE people buy it.</li>
            <li>Since adding this oil, about a month ago, my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li>Now, my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li>My skin really likes this.</li>
            <li>If your skin feels greasy, you&#x27;ve applied too much.</li>
            <li>This product is even better at keeping my limbs moisturized than I expected and has streamlined my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>I have bought every $70 bottle of wrinkle serum out there and this actually is so much nicer.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this product And hightly recomend it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Is really softening my skin.  </li>
            <li>Now I haven&#x27;t invested much time to the Argan Oil</li>
            <li>so I think it might cause break outs if you have oily skin because it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really seen none</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not saying it really was fish oil,</li>
            <li>My Order came on time and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>All natural, fast absorbing, soft and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>The end result is very smooth,radiant skin that stays so all day.</li>
            <li>I have started using it, but don’t see too much difference yet</li>
            <li>I really like that it is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this organic, yes organic rosehip oil!</li>
            <li>so having saying that i didnt notice much changes in my skin with using this product</li>
            <li>but i do enjoy the smoothness and moisterizing that it left of my skin that i do continue to use it</li>
            <li>A real treasure to Amazon.</li>
            <li>The Rosehip Oil is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The heat and dryness really takes a toll on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used several products that claim to improve and smooth blah blah blah</li>
            <li>I use the rosehip oil in areas that I need then smooth over a very tiny bit of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it some time before reviewing it and my skin has reacted really well to it.</li>
            <li>i like how it soften my hair not so much and the smell dont realy like it</li>
            <li>really like the benefits of the rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li>Really has softened my hands and skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>has a very funky smell.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really get this oil for all that stuff</li>
            <li>Highly recommand it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very please with the product.</li>
            <li>Haha,</li>
            <li>I also like InstaNatural - very conscientious ....</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people mentioned the smell, but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>using gentle strokes.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my partner and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, but not oily at all.</li>
            <li>Melissa from InstaNatural responded promptly and was very appreciative.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>I just need a straight out moisturizer, and I thought I&#x27;d give this rosehip oil a try.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>ha it just really smells like soy sauce.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This oil provided so much pain relief and lightened the color of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>oil has a bit of an unusual odor, I can&#x27;t seem to place it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
            <li>However, I have never used a rosehip seed oil that smelled this much fishy either.</li>
            <li>This made getting the oil much easier than using a dropper.</li>
            <li>and I can say that it works Very</li>
            <li>Unless someone is really close to you they cannot smell it at all.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see any real change in it after using it for just under a month now.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it is very hydrating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>how MUCH would be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oddly enough, Instanatural sends you an email when you order the product with the disclaimer that it&#x27;s not recommended for acne-prone skin, but I&#x27;ve had fabulous luck with this stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair also feels much softer after one application.</li>
            <li>Very versatile and gentle.</li>
            <li>And if you have a question, a real person will respond.  </li>
            <li>But i found it very nourishing to my skin and hair and halfway through</li>
            <li>And by the time the drops have reached your skin, they are room and very soon, body temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so your makeup doesn&#x27;t slip around too much on your face.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well overnight and really does help with skin tone.  </li>
            <li>oil itself has a VERY earthy smell, it didn&#x27;t bother me, but I could see where it would bother some.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped on time and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I like this product as a moisturizer, it moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li>and my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural tends to be very generous with their product, and that&#x27;s always a plus.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think my face was in need of too much cleaning.</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t do much for me by itself.</li>
            <li>I apply a light layer working it well into the foot then put on white cotton socks before bed.</li>
            <li>Skin is so much softer, healthier, glowing.</li>
            <li>It seems not to clog pores, and has been really miraculous for her.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>It seems fresh, and I put it directly into the fridge to preserve it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d gently massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin smooth without the greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and so I spent more to get this.</li>
            <li>It has a much fresher, earthier scent than what I have purchased in retail stores.</li>
            <li>It was also much cheaper per ounce.</li>
            <li>This Rosehip seed oil is proving to be equally effective at dealing with overall hand moisturizing, and seems to be a bit better (or at least quicker) in dealing with cuticle</li>
            <li>Once absorbed it leaves my skin feeling soft but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very hormonal acne ridden skin and a combination of this (and birth control)</li>
            <li>I find that my legs are definitely so much smoother and softer after using this.</li>
            <li>I really like InstaNatural&#x27;s organic rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>3 pumps covers my whole face &amp; neck very well....</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have much reason to try the rosehip seed oil</li>
            <li>But it really seems to be working.</li>
            <li>If you have acne and have seem to have tried everything, you really need to try this.</li>
            <li>Very earthy.</li>
            <li>This company really does care about their products and ur satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Money could have been better spent.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>I would go to the dermatologist often and nothing would really work.</li>
            <li>I was prescribed pills, creams but who wants to take pills all their life for acne</li>
            <li>I had purchased a cuticle oil, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing much of anything.</li>
            <li>The oil is very efficient in fighting signs of aging, as well as diminishes photo aging.  </li>
            <li>Rosehip oil to sunburn for an immediate soothing effect, as the oil will also gently aid the healing process and reduce the inflammation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oil is very efficient in fighting signs of aging, as well as diminishes photo aging.  </li>
            <li>Rosehip oil to sunburn for an immediate soothing effect, as the oil will also gently aid the healing process and reduce the inflammation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it gets really oily in the summer.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment on that</li>
            <li>Thanks to rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it straight</li>
            <li>Came fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product is everything as described.</li>
            <li>It has never bothered me using it straight.  </li>
            <li>This bottle is bigger than I expected but thats good because I will get to use it for all of the things I want to try.</li>
            <li>At least one good thing came out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it does have a nice, light, non irritating smell.</li>
            <li>The InstaNatural oil is like it is supposed to be: deep yellow color and warm earthy smell.</li>
            <li>I notice that my skin looks more radiant and it definitely feels soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Finally, on the third email, I replied (after having time to truly try out the product and give an honest response).  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li>I used this in a homemade body balm and it is a much higher quality rose hip oil than I used in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural so that why I feel my pores are smaller &amp; look better.</li>
            <li>There;&#x27;s no need to buy expensive face potions when natural stuff is best!</li>
            <li>I do at nighttime every few days and on any kind of spot or blemish.</li>
            <li>I definitely felt more moisturized after using the oil, and it does leave the skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, you don&#x27;t need a lot and it makes your face soft and even seems to help heal facial imperfections.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to people with  dry  parts of their body, you are going to love this nourishing oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Insta Natural!!!</li>
            <li>use Instanatural 100% pure rosehip seed oil for my hands and nails, but it has many other uses too.</li>
            <li>This absorbs well into your skin and leaves you silky and with a nice glow, You only need a small amount which is easily dispensed from  the pump.</li>
            <li>The fruit of the wild rose, or rose hips, have been eaten for centuries for their Vitamin C to ward off scurvy and other ailments when citrus fruits were not available.</li>
            <li>I’ve been a recent convert to using Argan oil to help deal with dry, cracked fingertips, and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing this particular oil as well as purchasing from this particular company.  </li>
            <li>This is worth a try for the skin care conscious out there, also the quality is so much better than other brands that have rosehip oils that are triple the price.</li>
            <li>felt that such a cheap product (rosehip oil) couldn&#x27;t do anything more than the other products Ive tried...</li>
            <li>And the e-mails are so professional, friendly and contain so much useful information that you can only wish that all sellers were like them.</li>
            <li>I could see improvement on my hair, skin and nails even after the first use (no joke) and I am so excited to see how Rosehip Oil would work in a long term use.</li>
            <li>Better than any other rosehip oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands and I don&#x27;t feel they were as concentrated or potent.</li>
            <li>It is definitely DILUTED and does not carry a unique amber color, which is the signature color of rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>(more than a year after the other attempt)&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft like no other moisturizer could ever come close to.  </li>
            <li>I bought two more bottles, one for me and the other for my daughter.</li>
            <li>In two weeks time the scars have smooth flat</li>
            <li>I found that there are not as many uses for Rosehip oil as there are for other oils</li>
            <li>This is high quality, pure, one ingredient oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil to EVERYONE, and this brand is very high quality.</li>
            <li>Just recently I used &amp;#34;Rosehip Seed Oil&amp;#34; on clean skin once a day to help diminish the appearance of my scars.</li>
            <li>That way when you&#x27;re finished using first batch, the second batch is still fresh.</li>
            <li>I am at the &#x60;mature&#x27; age, in my sixties, and I am aware that thinning hair can start at any time, so I do take note of how much hair loss there may be every time I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it a great oil &amp; a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to protect their nails and cuticles or skin for that matter</li>
            <li>Good bye rough, dry and cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li>It keeps my mature dry skin hydrated better than</li>
            <li>Smoother skin, lighter brown spots, and less fine wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>I normally have dry, sensitive skin that needs a rich moisturizer on top of a serum, but this has not been necessary with the rosehip oil!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I looked nearly as tired as I would have without using this amazing product!</li>
            <li>Not sure how i would have liked it.  </li>
            <li>My immediate first impression was that the quantity provided for this price is outstanding; Four ounces is a substantial amount that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Love that this product comes in a dark bottle plus</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is leaving my skin more moisturized, and is helping diminish the dark spots on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll report back after a full 60 days.  </li>
            <li>Using a hot wet clean washcloth</li>
            <li>She also has been getting some mild acne, very sensitive to products in general.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels amazing, especially in weather where it would normally feel dry</li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many moisturizers for my dry skin (hot Arizona sun) and have finally found rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to put the bottle in the fridge, decanting only what you need for a few weeks at a time, or mixing with other ingredients that can prolong shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At 31 I&#x27;m getting carded all the time again (not so much before), and new people I meet often assume I&#x27;m in college.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and it is not too greasy,  it leaves my hair shiny and smooth and for dry skin</li>
            <li>My skin is dry with just advanced night repair and this...</li>
            <li>It makes my skin less wrinkled and more radiant.</li>
            <li>and I was able to see a slight change in their appearance.</li>
            <li>With my previous product, my makeup seemed to go on a bit better over the oil.  </li>
            <li>And 4 ounces for the price is better than some people are selling 2 ounces or less.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft, fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>and I have used it on myself and older daughter as a hair oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a super fan  for oils that will help me look younger, help my hair , help my nails and skin.</li>
            <li>As we all know oils do have there particular smells.  </li>
            <li>yes, the smell is &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;, but if you&#x27;ve ever hiked in mossy forests near rivers, you may actually enjoy the scent, I definitely don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>I bought this Rosehip oil after reading it on one of the beauty review website, mainly for the wrinkles under my eye.</li>
            <li>I found this oil on Amazon and the price for it from this particular seller is just unbeatable.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of daily and evening use on my tummy, I am pleased to say I am back in a bikini.</li>
            <li>While I have only been using it for a short time, I have noticed that my skin feels softer and has a more even, glowing appearance.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to use this product in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I mainly take advantage of the moisturizing aspect of the serum.</li>
            <li>I was able to test out their Rosehip Seed Oil and their Deep Cleansing Facial Oil.  </li>
            <li>face, neck, even on my pregnant belly against potential stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>I used Instanaturals Rosehip Oil mainly on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have many scars from surgeries and more unfortunately, stretch marks.</li>
            <li>main thing to remember about this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of all the oils that I have tried, Rosehip and Argan have given me the most favorable results; however, Argan is substantially more expensive, so for me once again InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil will be used</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that the company is VERY responsive if you have any questions at all, which is nearly unheard of these days and very much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>thing with the rosehip oil is that at first it does have a strong smell to it that takes a little time to get used to.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and makes skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I am not sure yet, if I will purchase more RSO from them, but based on their level of customer care, I will certainly consider it—as long as I continue to stay breakout free.</li>
            <li>This rosehip oil is also great for my hair I have really damage hair because I use to dye my hair and straighten it all the time I apply a small amount after I shower while my hair is still wet</li>
            <li>But once I learned how to use it without a mess, I love it.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try for free Organic  Rosehip Oil from this company, normally I do not post a review</li>
            <li>so I am excited to see how well it works with a continued long term use.</li>
            <li>This type of oil is supposed to help with scars, sunburns and sun damage, thanks to high levels of vitamins A and C, though I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say for sure</li>
            <li>This is high quality stuff.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it too  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave it a five star rating and highly recommend it to everyone even if you don&#x27;t have troublesome</li>
            <li>I highly suggest doing some research into Linoleic vs Oleic acids-</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend both the product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I was using high end moisturizers.</li>
            <li>tried this company because of the Amazon ratings on their oil and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend ordering from this company</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I am also using a vitamin C serum very lightly on my feet as well once a week with salasylic acid to help slough the dead skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for skincare.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Rosehip oil, but not this product.</li>
            <li>I added this to my face oil (avocado and almond oil mixture) and within days it made a huge difference in the dry patches I was having!</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin that reacts to any foreign matter like chemicals, stress etc.  </li>
            <li>This is indeed a very decent and professional seller.</li>
            <li>and I have used the oil on its own and mixed in with my other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I personally add it to my daily moisturizers and use it on a daily basis (many report a dewy glow to the skin right after using it as well as improvement in the tone of the skin).</li>
            <li>Insta natural 100% pure rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>Today want to speak to you about Insta Natural&#x27;s 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li>I chose InstaNatural because I read that is was 100% Pure, Natural, Organic, and unrefined.  </li>
            <li>It is a pure and natural moisturizer that leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li>Makes my face soft !!</li>
            <li>Need a little more time to see if it will help wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is better to smell a little then to have a &amp;#34;pleasant fragrance&amp;#34; that just breaks you out.</li>
            <li>I will definitely look to your company first!</li>
            <li>The little seal on the bottle declared that it was USDA organic, so I felt confident that it was a quality oil.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it is smell-less, absorbs quickly despite of its oily nature and it moisturizes my skin and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a good size bottle and a little bit of this oil can go a long way.</li>
            <li>I attributed it to the fact that I was getting older and told myself that I just needed to “live with it.”</li>
            <li>so far I really like this rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>There seems to be a firming effect which I can definitely use and it has all the great ingredients:  essential fatty acids, vitamins A and</li>
            <li>I ended up not using this too much because it smelled rancid and old.  </li>
            <li>This is my fav skin care oil so far... very hydrating</li>
            <li>Really makes your skin soft and helps to reduce lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>And you have this amazing product in a huge 4oz bottle which will last you for long and long months considering you are going to only need some 2-3 drops with each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and soothing on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Oil is the real thing with</li>
            <li>Really makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling really moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>The Rosehip oil makes my face feel so smooth and the rough spots I have on my face are disapearing.  </li>
            <li>and so far it is doing VERY well.</li>
            <li>Havent used too much of this product, but it does keep my skin soft and hydrated when i do use it.</li>
            <li>12 year old&#x27;s skin has really responded to this.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal??</li>
            <li>use it everyday and the scent is lovely</li>
            <li>Rather than use my normal pomade, I&#x27;ve been using 4-5 drops of this rubbed in my plams then run through my hair.</li>
            <li>I think it may be too heavy for oily skin but can&#x27;t say for sure because I don&#x27;t have oily skin.</li>
            <li>However, I received a few more follow-up emails letting me know that their product is satisfaction guaranteed and if there were any questions or problems, to contact them.  </li>
            <li>Seems to moisturize well and sink into (not sit on top of) skin after a few min.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s just normal..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it, not routinely, on a few of their suggestions, and each timeI was pleased.</li>
            <li>Forget all the spray on remedies from the local drug store - i have tried them all with zero success.  </li>
            <li>It is too early to say much about the effects, but my skin feels very silky and soft on application.  </li>
            <li>You can mix a few drops into your favorite moisturizer and apply it to your skin that way, to get the added benefits from Rosehip Seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin is more even-toned and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I thought they&#x27;d send fresh oil the second time around.</li>
            <li>Past the natural smell, this oil works great on my baby&#x27;s dry skin</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s a fine</li>
            <li>I love the scent, Plus, always prefer natural organic beauty item since there is less chemicals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exfoliates and reduces wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Repairs damaged, dry skin by adding back lost moisture, leaving it looking smoother and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip</li>
            <li>My feet get so dry that sometimes my feet are more hooves than anything human.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.feet get so dry that sometimes my feet are more hooves than anything human.</li>
            <li>I used over my entire face, and it interestingly seemed to moisturize the dry parts and not grease up the oily-ish ones.</li>
            <li>It seems to help keep my hair less crunchy and more soft.  </li>
            <li>have oily and dry skin, especially in morning, my husband even made joke said he can make pancake on my oily morning face:)</li>
            <li>As you may know, if you dry out oily skin - that only triggers it to produce even more oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30 year old female with mild acne and severe acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I have literally tried every single salve, soap, oil and prescription medicine to try to get my skin back and nothing worked better than this.</li>
            <li>bottle of Rosehip Seed oil is $23.95 right now and is regularly priced $49.95</li>
            <li>That right there is the only skin care regimen you&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
            <li>VC20 - Potent 20% Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex! ]].</li>
            <li>So I got some for a friend who had knee surgery and was left with a very large scar.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft and smooth... gets rid of my dry patches!</li>
            <li>I should really refrigerate it, as it is such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>(The familiar scent of roses comes from the petals, but this product is made from the seeds, which is why the scent is not as expected).</li>
            <li>It should be kept in a cool dark place or refrigerated to keep it at its full potential.</li>
            <li>However, I mixed a little of my Ole Heniriksen in with it and it took on a nice citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>So my new nighttime routine is toner, serum, rosehip oil, and then moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am having some surgery this year and was not looking forward to having to live with the scars.</li>
            <li>With new scars I know I will not have to live with these scares forever.</li>
            <li>And who wouldn&#x27;t live that?</li>
            <li>Using this new combo has cleared my face and keeps it well moisturized.</li>
            <li>Although I notice they have updated their bottles, so hopefully the new ones don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>This product is a new one for me.  </li>
            <li>I found my new face and hair oil.</li>
            <li>a decided to try a new brand.</li>
            <li>This is yet another product that didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>The dryness is gone &amp; my face looks so much healthier, younger and vibrant!</li>
            <li>The results may not be instant and noticeable right after the first or second use</li>
            <li>I used it on my face this morning just one drop with my wet freshly clean face</li>
            <li>I have tried many (cheap and expensive) face moisturizers and none work as well as Rosehip oil-there is no stinging like I get with the face moisturizers-------great for my lips too</li>
            <li>added organic  therapeutic grade essential oils to boost its effectiveness and enjoy this product immensely</li>
            <li>Immediately followed with Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum and just one squirt of this Insta Natural Rosehip Oil (which is all you really need for your face).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides uses for pre-aging and moisturizing, it also can be used to minimises the size of pores and helps blemishes to go way quicker giving you smoother-looking even toned skin with a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reason I decided to try Rosehip Seed oil is because of</li>
            <li>I believe the reason is because this Organic Rosehip Oil product in particular, made by InstaNatural is truly all natural and no added fragrances or aroma masking chemicals have been added.</li>
            <li>Oil treatments truly help my dry skin out tremendously.</li>
            <li>You really want to find a high-quailty organic oil, because there are major differences in results.</li>
            <li>I use this for my thick straight long hair to keep my hair shiny and smooth frizz free all the time.</li>
            <li>After using it the skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I have had no issues, no break outs, etc.  </li>
            <li>I use after a I shower and it makes my skin very soft (non ashy) all day.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night, and in the morning my face feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Once using it, the skin become very soft.</li>
            <li>Plus my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>And skin is very soft after the oil soaks in.  </li>
            <li>Since using I have not had one single large cyst or pimple (just little, very easily popable ones).</li>
            <li>is a huge bottle, so I have a dark brown 1 OZ bottle that I fill and keep in my bathroom drawer</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this product!</li>
            <li>So far ecxellent!</li>
            <li>Okay so here is why I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li>I put a small amount of the rosehip seed oil on top.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and I see the fine lines in my face are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to buy another bottle after this first one.</li>
            <li>and I think the Rosehip oil works just as well, if not better for skin than Argon oil which I think works better on hair.</li>
            <li>Most of the other rosehip oil products on amazon are 2 OZ or smaller</li>
            <li>Will come back in month to give you my experience since this is just my first impression.</li>
            <li>More than twice the size of the usual Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hands a lot more than usual because I have a baby in the house and have found my hands are a lot drier these days.  </li>
            <li>Pretty helpful and informative, actually.  </li>
            <li>is my first purchase with this company, but not the last!  </li>
            <li>The first thing you will notice when you open the bottle is that there is no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Facial Oil was pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li>first, their was a definite oil feel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to add that I credit this product for making my elbow look and feel soft and normal again.</li>
            <li>Even better, add a bit of MSM.&lt;br /&gt;Slather on clean, dry hair, cover with cap (I use a disposable shower cap and over that a thick stretch headband) and leave on for 5 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It has completely saved my face!</li>
            <li>I have tried many rosehip oil brands in the past like trilogy, sukin, and Aubrey organics and none of them smells close to the way this smells.</li>
            <li>Results (glowing soft skin!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and my wrinkles seem to be getting smoother including my neck!  </li>
            <li>I am completely sold!</li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes are not dry and wrinkles are less prominent.</li>
            <li>I found the serum works quickly on newly formed scars but is no slouch with old scars and blemishes either.</li>
            <li>I was sent a new bottle at no charge within two days and kept the old bottle as well.  </li>
            <li>Carrot is pretty expensive, but amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Sinks in quickly and can apply makeup soon after without any issues.</li>
            <li>He was extremely responsive and sent me another bottle right away no questions asked!</li>
            <li>I was down in FL recently and really love how my tummy looks even after just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I read countless reviews and knew it would do something positive, but I truly had no idea</li>
            <li>Will report back in six weeks if results are positive.</li>
            <li>It smells a little odd, and at first it was off putting, but after I saw how amazing my skin looked, I could easily look past the scent.</li>
            <li>I look in the mirror and see the face of a 24 yr old - not a 34 yr old!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps my previous oil absorbed a little better.  </li>
            <li>You could buy a cheaper product or more of a product for less money and get the same effects</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle for this product, which means I WAS satisfied with the previous ones.</li>
            <li>She is Asian, if that is important to anyone reading this, and has dry skin.</li>
            <li>elbow on the left is what I call my computer elbow, and that&#x27;s because it get&#x27;s really dry and often lightly discolored from resting it on my desk with my head propped on my fist palm while I&#x27;m at the computer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying it to my neck and shoulders after several hours of harsh sunlight [ahh, the first sunburn of the season..], and it speed-heals my skin- pretty much overnight!</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all on face and my dry skin soaks it right up.</li>
            <li>(especially around the eyes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said it is advised to those who have moderate/severe acne to avoid direct application to trouble areas, but rosehip seed oil has a higher percentage of Linoleic acid  (44%) compared to Oleic acid (14%) which is richer and more likely to cause problems for those with acne.</li>
            <li>I have only been using RSO for going on 3 weeks now, so I am excited to see what the long term effects will be.</li>
            <li>I have been applying this product on scars but it has not shown very profound impact.</li>
            <li>For example the fatty acids, Omega 3,6 and 9 and Vitamin A helps prevent and improve fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>That makes it superior for treating dry skin compared to standard heavy duty lotions.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product as a replacement for a very expensive Rose Hip Oil I was using as part of my face regiment</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but it certainly adds another step to the process of using it.</li>
            <li>Pure Rosehip Seed Oil is a moisturizing product that can be used for a variety of different purposes.  </li>
            <li>The glass bottle is large -- 4 oz. -- and will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li>bottle is fairly large and will last you for quite some time.</li>
            <li>For me personally, the pure oil makes me break-out.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does have a fishy smell due to the presence of omega 3, but the smell dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly if used alone, or you can mix it in with your other skin products.  </li>
            <li>I have no seen a significant decrease in the appeared of some scars left from acne as a teenager, but I have not been using this oil very long.</li>
            <li>oil is super rich and you only need a tiny little bit to completely cover your face, or mix it with your regular lotion if you don&#x27;t like putting the straight oil on.  </li>
            <li>eyes helps keep my eyes clear.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few nights before bed and in the morning the texture of  my skin looks and feels smooth, soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>i apply this on my stretch marks and cheeks since that&#x27;s the most common for my scars so far I see improvement.  </li>
            <li>order however, is clear and lacks any smell.</li>
            <li>and my skin is moisturized and clear.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a slight, it has a tint of orange color, this is like what they clean you with before surgery color</li>
            <li>A few drops on my cuticles , makes the area soft and smooth too.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li>I am fairly young</li>
            <li>I find it helps keep my cuticles soft too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Surprised how well this absorbs.  </li>
            <li>Check back in another six weeks,  thanks,</li>
            <li>I remember even from when I was young, my grandmother used it for everything.</li>
            <li>You can apply this oil directly to your skin, either face or body.</li>
            <li>but people think early 50&#x27;s  </li>
            <li>and so far no complaints.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Have only been using 2 weeks, but really seems to be helping my skin.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and not a greasy as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>but wow.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Does everything I need it to as a moisturizer and the plus is that it&#x27;s totally natural.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t see any results like at all my blemishes are still looking the same ....</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s to early to see results</li>
            <li>if I see any change going on maybe it&#x27;s still to early to see results</li>
            <li>Perhaps, I got an old, rancid bottle.</li>
            <li>Years old and have always bated my hair because it was so</li>
            <li>I am soft from my head to my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My face just loves all of this company&#x27;s all natural skin care products.</li>
            <li>it is old?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, the sizing of this bottle is very generous for the price, the bottle came packaged well and sealed properly.</li>
            <li>makes my skin soft and youthful.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft not oily at all.</li>
            <li>so I was really conscious and even concerned over how it may affect my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and smells in beauty products, so maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to using products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like this product, especially for summer</li>
            <li>With all the natural products that are out there</li>
            <li>/&gt;  diminishes the look of old marks and scars&lt;</li>
            <li>Tried some on a old scar, seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I am not as sensitive to some odors as others</li>
            <li>It’s just that it is a natural product with not added chemical fragrances</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fond of the big bottle because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to run out at a moment&#x27;s notice!</li>
            <li>It feels natural and my skin is responding well to it.</li>
            <li>It worked a thousand year ago and it works now, our skin is made to receive natural oil and not stuff</li>
            <li>My 50 year old skin just loves the InstaNatural line apparently….and</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts….not</li>
            <li>a ONE with this natural line.</li>
            <li>I have combination, sensitive skin, so I was hesitant to put oil on my face</li>
            <li>I also found the Insta natural Vitamin C Serum which I use at night and the Rosehip oil in the morning.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>He has been complimenting me on it frequently since I began using it.</li>
            <li>It definitely smells very earthy</li>
            <li>it just smells like a natural oil.</li>
            <li>since I got this product, also I&#x27;m using Insta Natural Vitamin C-Serum and the difference with these two products together</li>
            <li>It is made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>so it works well with my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far their products have lived up to the claims made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But skin is so soft..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too early to know if this will help fade my scars</li>
            <li>So far I like this oil.  </li>
            <li>My skin is really appreciating the extra level of moisture that rosehip oil provides.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several suppliers of organic rosehip oil but the folks at InstaNatural really suprised me with their customer service.</li>
            <li>As far as my stretch marks go I haven&#x27;t noticed a dent</li>
            <li>I have been storing the oil in the fridge and used it twice a day so far</li>
            <li>I use this oil after cleansing and applying the Insta natural vit c serum.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural 100%</li>
            <li>Not the nicest smelling for products I&#x27;ll admit, but that is the nature of buying natural products.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and found using this actually balances my face out as It causes me to excrete oil.</li>
            <li>suffer from psoriasis on my scalp that frequently itches and flakes, which in turn causes soreness.</li>
            <li>This organic rosehip oil is a deep orange oil that can make the face oily looking if too much is applied.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed some fading so far.</li>
            <li>Which a lot of these are non natural products have even with the fragrance piled on.</li>
            <li>Nothing so far</li>
            <li>It is a real winter skin saver when mixed into moisturizers and lotions.</li>
            <li>Of all the oils I&#x27;ve used thus far . . .</li>
            <li>I love that my skin soaks it up and doesn&#x27;t feel the least bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I would caution that my eight year old son thought the smell was horrid</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I now prefer to skip the store brand chemicals and go natural..</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil is exactly as described a fe drops go a long way</li>
            <li>I find I&#x27;m frequently adding it to my lips  thru-out the day.</li>
            <li>My face feels cleaner with out stripping away my natural oils in my face.</li>
            <li>My 50 year old skin loves it too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and has been used for generations</li>
            <li>But I do have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip oil contains over 500 natural ingredients that are beneficial to all kinds of skin.</li>
            <li>Keep it away from direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li>I did both when I was young .</li>
            <li>a vegan, eat healthy, get plenty of exercise, drink lots of water and get at least 9 hours of sleep every day.  </li>
            <li>so I guess it really wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s an all natural product and</li>
            <li>the smell is natural too - not chemical like.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>must for anyone that likes natural DIY skincare.</li>
            <li>This product, for being all natural, has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>I then decided to go all natural with my face care.</li>
            <li>It reinforces to me that forms closest their natural state are best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this oil for several months now and really see no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>natural Acne and Eczema Treatment&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leave for about an hour and then wash thoroughly; the result is soft, revitalized</li>
            <li>natural Acne and Eczema Treatment&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leave for about an hour and then wash thoroughly; the result is soft, revitalized</li>
            <li>Now they are about 60% improved, much softer, and the dryness is starting to go away.</li>
            <li>I no longer feel self conscious when wearing sandals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>woke up with soft non greasy loven it 👍😊</li>
            <li>Organic Rosehip Oil by InstaNatural leaves the skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Insta Natural sent me this product for review purposes.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has not made me have a reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The essential fatty acids in rosehip seed make it one of my favorite carrier oils for hair</li>
            <li>It sets an excellent base before foundation.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be like me, and be slow to get on the rosehip band wagon, as the sooner you begin to use it the better off</li>
            <li>She tried this on the scars and it slowly, but surely gets rid of them.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal for the most part, but it can get a little dry in some places, and a tad oily in the T-zone.</li>
            <li>Liberal application of InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil right after a soaking bath has made them so soft and baby pink</li>
            <li>Liberal application of InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil right after a soaking bath has made them so soft and baby pink</li>
            <li>The scent that it has does not last long once this product absorbs, and it absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Whenever I try a new product and it doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin, I go straight to rosehip oil - it seems to have healing properties and calms my skin right down instantly.</li>
            <li>I put the Vit. C on first, let it dry, then put the oil over it.  </li>
            <li>it still over half full.</li>
            <li>Dark glass is imperative as this is an oil that can lose it&#x27;s beneficial properties if not stored correctly, and can also go rancid quickly.</li>
            <li>I suffer from hyper pigmentation on my chin &amp; the dark spots have faded tremendously</li>
            <li>As strong as fish oil pills that I have taken in the past.  </li>
            <li>Instead of leaving my skin soft with a subtle glow, this oil seems oily and just sits on the top.</li>
            <li>I use this when I have dry patches on my face and it has been the only thing that has worked so quickly.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product for the first time, I was a little hesitant/skeptical if it&#x27;d really work.</li>
            <li>People have been using Rosehip oil for a long time back when other products were not available its a fantastic staple to have in your home for so many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell at first is a little unusual, almost like a flax seed smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is naturally rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega 6, 3 and 9) and Vitamin A and C that make it a face, hair, nail and skin restorer.</li>
            <li>Seriously, after one application my hands started to look and feel better.</li>
            <li>There is a slight smell, but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>Actually so impressed, that I ridded my medicine cabinet of all the ridiculously expensive skincare items I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Plus, it absorbs quickly while still leaving skin hydrated-looking, so it&#x27;s helped a lot with some slight flaking I had.</li>
            <li>Just keep your bottle refrigerated to make it stay fresh and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have been using rosehip seed oil for several years particularly on my face.</li>
            <li>When a free sample of this was offered for review purposes, I almost turned it down because I personally do not have a use for it.</li>
            <li>I applied a few pumps after I got out of the shower and when my hair dried it was so soft and smooth !!</li>
            <li>Not only is the product highly recommended, so is the seller.</li>
            <li>I have middle age skin and suffer from all the skin issues that come from that, not to mention living in the high altitude and desert of NM.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for this problem and actually like the smell.</li>
            <li>This oil is super rich and you only need a tiny little bit and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This particular brand is different from other rose hip seed oil I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>This oil has helped my skin feel softer and younger and the fine lines around my face seem a little softer as well.</li>
            <li>Finally, I finish up with my moisturizer with a little finely ground L Ascorbic Acid &amp; then eye cream.</li>
            <li>My feet have been staying smooth and none of the usual drying and cracking I have been fighting.</li>
            <li>I am soon to be 34 yrs old, and while I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, per se, I do have the beginnings of fine lines and just generally dull skin.  </li>
            <li>I applied it to my entire scalp each night, let it sit for about 5 minutes and then went forward with normal hair washing.</li>
            <li>The oil delivers almost EXACTLY what I expected it to</li>
            <li>It works well, just different from my normal supplier.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This amazing oil is USDA Certified Pure, Organic, Unrefined, Cold pressed Rosehip Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too bad because it was a large bottle at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I expected it not to smell like perfume has been added because it clearly states pure, unrefined organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually very cautious with new products, I start once every other day</li>
            <li>My skin was so dry due to weather, this made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Initially the fragrance of this oil is earthy but fragrance quickly disappears, as other users have noted.  </li>
            <li>Next, I pumped the oil into my palms, I noticed the color was very different to every other rosehip seed oil I&#x27;ve tried - it was brown, rather than light yellow/orange.</li>
            <li>My bottle had a faulty pump, so I emailed the company, and they had a new bottle in my hands the next day (which was a Sunday.)</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s dark spots is already fading and my complexion is not dull anymore!!!</li>
            <li>I tried 2-3 drops (may have been too much) rubbed on my hands and into my dry hair - being a rainy day</li>
            <li>My skin is much less dry and is much more supple and that is after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Works very well to reduce dry skin and lines.</li>
            <li>I grabbed a dry facecloth, applied the oil and began to gently wipe my face.</li>
            <li>I poured the oil very sparingly around my dry hair and scalp and thoroughly massaged my head for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one leaves less greasy residue on my skin as if it is absorbed immediately.  </li>
            <li>My hands get super dry and cracked during dry weather and it has helped my hands.</li>
            <li>but fortunately it doesn&#x27;t last but a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Luckily the scent dissipates within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Saving the best for last, is the results I had putting it that on an annoying skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>My skin has not only cleared up from the nagging blemishes, irritations and &amp;#34;crankiness&amp;#34;, but it has smoothed out in texture, tone and is really very soft now.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly the same as the red raspberry seed oil I purchased at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have seen a major improvement.</li>
            <li>This product (and other rosehip oil products) have done so much for my skin!</li>
            <li>Four ounces may not sound like much, but it’s actually quite a large size when it comes to something like rosehip seed oil, which tends to come in smaller packages for high prices.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t apply this oil to my trouble areas on the sides of my forehead, but I&#x27;ve been applying it to minor trouble areas on the sides of my cheeks (note: MINOR) and haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts.</li>
            <li>face and neck seem to be tighter and my freckles brought on naturally but way extremely with sun exposure are fading fast and</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil comes in a long lasting, dark, glass bottle with an easy to use pump.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip seed oil is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine</li>
            <li>as it&#x27;s too oily for under makeup, unless you have very dry skin that will absorb this fast.</li>
            <li>The areas around my cuticles get VERY dry - so much so that I have hang nails all the time</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s absorbed so after a little while my skin no longer feels oily from the product.</li>
            <li>The oil is light and it hardly has any scent to it.</li>
            <li>A lot of people complain in general about the smell of rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>This is an issue with rosehips products in general, but I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;love\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It has cleared up her facial complexion and now her face is clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts, but I notice my pimples clear faster, and my overall skin tone has improved.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and will last a long time...</li>
            <li>glass is the ONLY way to store this oil, and I have seen brands in clear glass as well as the dreaded plastic.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is barely there.</li>
            <li>Plus, it’s all natural, has only one ingredient</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been 2 months and my 10-year old stretch marks are 70% gone</li>
            <li>Organic, natural beauty products that actually work?</li>
            <li>Barely touched my cream since I got the oil.</li>
            <li>I first started using rosehip seed oil to combat the dark circles/bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>She barely had to trim my cuticles, which helps protect my nails.  </li>
            <li>I am  58 years old and have finally found something that will moisturize without clogging my pores and causing problems.</li>
            <li>The skin is already shiny and pink and well on its way to healing thanks to this oil.</li>
            <li>and it left me completely breathless</li>
            <li>I have barely used any of it</li>
            <li>Now that my initial testing period for review is over I might swap to using it on my hands to keep them looking young because I did like it in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>My stretch marks and dark spot on my face have really lightened up!  </li>
            <li>I was recently diagnosed with allergies to multiple preservatives which are commonly used in most products put on our bodies - from toothpaste to body lotions to laundry detergents,</li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to try Insta Natural’s Rosehip Seed Oil and one thing that I can tell you about this miracle oil</li>
            <li>I have spent SOOOOOOO much money on beauty products, and I sorta</li>
            <li>I developed rosacea last year and have been battling it since.</li>
            <li>keep recommending this product to friends because it&#x27;s the only all natural product that&#x27;s ever helpe my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>My deep forehead wrinkles are almost completely gone and my skin looks brighter and smoother than it has in years.</li>
            <li>Rosehip Seed Oil is 100% organic and cold pressed and is supposed to help reduce the appearance of scars, acne and stretch marks and is a good all around moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that it was packaged in a glass bottle, since I am am wary of the BPA in plastics.</li>
            <li>I break out from thick moisturizers and sometimes so called light ones, but not this.</li>
            <li>growth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to share my recipe for an overnight hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Start with a few tablespoons of avocado oil or mashed fresh avocado, add a tablespoon each of jojoba oil and rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>but it goes away within a few minutes once it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li>Be advised that it has a small odor to it, it&#x27;s not a bad odor, but smells a bit like cooking oil.  </li>
            <li>hip oil is high in Omegas and helps with aging and dry skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this seed oil if you have dry flaky skin like</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve been getting older, I &#x27;ve found that I have to be very careful with what kinds of face products I use, as my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had extremely dry skin since starting menopause and this has really boosted the moisture level of my skin.</li>
            <li>I only use this oil at night after I wash my face very well, I don&#x27;t dry my face, and put 2 drapes</li>
            <li>Now even without moisturizer my heels look normal without that dry cast.</li>
            <li>I have tried other oils in the past and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It dissipates after a few minutes and what is left is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>bottle is huge and a little goes a long way so it will last forever.</li>
            <li>Take a few drops of Insta Natural 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil on to the tips of your fingers.</li>
            <li>I made a gentle face oil for a friend that has a little acne problem and so far it&#x27;s been helping.  </li>
            <li>The rosehip oil is in a spray bottle - so much easier to use as opposed to other products that you have to shake and shake to get out the oil.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the dropper that a lot of the other products come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>stuff (other brands included) have really really impacted my skin.</li>
            <li>I change brand often because it is hard to find always the same available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not being over dramatic for the sake of an interesting review..</li>
            <li>This oil is actually harvested from the tiny rosehip seeds collected on budding.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin please be cautious and test small areas first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and when so little product goes such as long way, this bottle will last for months.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the sun has really done a number on my face over the last few years.</li>
            <li>When I first used the oil, I was a little overwhelmed by the smell.</li>
            <li>The oil seems a little different, perhaps a little more greasy than what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>You get a huge bottle that will last a long time since you only need a few drops at a time</li>
            <li>I have also read up on rosehip oil and have found again, that this oil is what should be expected of high quality rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin is very delicate and should be taken care of properly with the proper products for your skin type :)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few weeks bring in a whole new younger looking beauty!</li>
            <li>Have been using for a few weeks and am currently 13 weeks pregnant and just starting to get bigger.</li>
            <li>Also, it is very refreshing to put this oil on when it is cold.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about the oil other than its benefits and its relatively short shelf-life, 2)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about ingredients that can&#x27;t be pronounced or anything other than all natural oils with a natural scent.</li>
            <li>I use this at night mainly because of the smell- both products smell very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; which is a hard smell for me to get used to.</li>
            <li>I was a tiny bit disappointed with this, it smells much more herbal and is more greasy than other oils I have used.</li>
            <li>Also, adding a few drops to a hot bath is recommended.</li>
            <li>first of all the oil has a rancid smell (like fish) but that&#x27;s because it has omega fatty acids</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is oily when first applied, it soaks in well after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I also had a few days of hardly any sleep, and this oil really did work amazingly to hide those dark circles!</li>
            <li>If you have tough skin with dark spots , this oil is perfect for you as it smoothed your skin tone as well as your dark spots!!!!</li>
            <li>specific bottle of InstaNatural Rosehip oil is all organic, and it should last you a couple of months due to its large size.</li>
            <li>Nourishing oil for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is rich in the essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (or omega-6), as well as linoleic acid (or omega-3).  </li>
            <li>Nourishing oil for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is rich in the essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (or omega-6), as well as linoleic acid (or omega-3).  </li>
            <li>Smells a bit odd, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference with the look of my skin after first few applications but it does seem to leave it feeling softer and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.</li>
            <li>Lately, it&#x27;s been hot and dry where I live and my skin gets super dried out, especially on my legs, but my face needs extra hydration too-so I don&#x27;t get wrinkled up like a prune.</li>
            <li>(not sure if I spelled it right)</li>
            <li>I add a small amount of tea tree oil in about a 1/4 ratio to this, with or without a carrier oil, and apply it right after washing my face.</li>
            <li>have very long natural unmanageable hair that is always freest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I like what it&#x27;s done for my dry skin so far.</li>
            <li>My gildfriend has less than 2 weeks using it in her face,  and has really shown a noticeable change.</li>
            <li>The redness has completely diminished, and the dry patches of skin are about 80% gone.</li>
            <li>After having the opportunity to try the Insta Natural Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, much to my surprise, after only a few weeks, I began to notice my facial pores getting smaller</li>
            <li>It prevents signs of aging (no, it doesn&#x27;t prevent you from actually aging;)) and helps those of us with an uneven skin</li>
            <li>Also, in the hot summer months, I don&#x27;t want to use a facial moisturizer that&#x27;s heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>The oil has a thin texture and absorbs to the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>I think that you can find Rosehip oil for a cheaper price, but I really wanted something in a glass bottle that I could reuse for homemade skincare that included essential oils (which eventually break down plastic)</li>
            <li>And I also started recently using it for other parts of my body, in particular my feet and hands.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first because of it&#x27;s unusual natural aroma and amber color.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Rosehip oil and for only just those few nights am amazed at the almost instant results!  </li>
            <li>Since starting to use this oil I have noticed that the dry skin is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have found an unrefined version that isnt diluted, it helps alot with tough to fix dry areas, such as the elbows and knuckles&lt;</li>
            <li>This has helped lubricate my face enough that I am able to continue an aggressive procedure a few minutes longer without the previous irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and chemical color treated hair and my final test was using Rosehip Oil as a deep conditioning hair remedy.  </li>
            <li>I’m definitely going to come back again to them to make another purchase and would highly recommend them to all other buyers.</li>
            <li>I had never previously used a oil on these dry spots (why I don&#x27;t even know).</li>
            <li>I must first say that this oil is a big bottle and a little goes a loooong way!</li>
            <li>and it is absorbed completely and the smell lasts a few seconds, it is not unpleasant dont get me wrong.  </li>
            <li>But I find it less useful to me than a number of the other products that InstaNatural markets.  </li>
            <li>This oil is good only smells bad.</li>
            <li>After using this oil on my face for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how soft my face is and how clear my complexion seems to be.  </li>

            <li> Rosehip oil is particularly good for circulatory problems</li>

            <li> It is a light oil that goes on evenly and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t give a fair rating yet, because i just got it and</li>
            <li> I heard that it is good for rosacea and it has helped the redness a lot.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so good and because it&#x27;s kept refrigerated (for longer life)</li>
            <li> (I received this item at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I bought this oil after reading that it was good for your skin.</li>
            <li> but with the word \\&quot;rose\\&quot; in the name of this product you would hope this would smell good, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is good for my split ends.  </li>

            <li> good effect</li>
            <li> A good compliment to Argan oil.</li>

            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> This is good rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is organic ..meaning all of it is good for me.....</li>
            <li> In addition it&#x27;s offered at a fair price.</li>
            <li> loved using this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used it both day and night for maximum benefits and loved how my skin felt immediately after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good thing about this oil is that it doesn&#x27;t break  me skin out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an earthy scent, which was surprising to me since I assumed it would smell like roses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective and is working great for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beauty-wise, I have normal-to-dry skin (fair w/freckles)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good oily that locks in moisture onto my skin and keeps it from getting even oilier.  </li>
            <li> It has always been a challenge to find a moisturizer that feels good on those areas.  </li>
            <li> Good luck to others.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> But have been extremely pleased by the results!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The fragrance wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;rosey&amp;#34; as I had hoped (more seedy than I care for) but it does have aroma that is pleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell is not terrible but exactly pleasant either.</li>
            <li> I am most pleased with my order which arrived beautifully packaged a week ago.</li>
            <li> Another positive about this product (aside from the zillion already listed) is that it works perfectly as a massage oil.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in excellent  conditions and I have been using it for a 2 weeks period and certainly seems to help.</li>
            <li> I did lots of reading into what pure argan oil should be and how best to use it.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have added fragrances to make the product smell great (and irritate your skin), they are just 100% pure and sometimes that doesn&#x27;t smell so great.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling amazing -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and non-greasy, works great for your face.</li>
            <li> Review by the wife: &amp;#34;My skin looks and feel amazing, acne scars are lighter, and no breakouts - even while PMSing.</li>
            <li> This  oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s 100% non comedogenic, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> This oil is really amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the Rosehip Oil, the Vitamin C Serum or the Jojoba oil that I started using or maybe a combo of all, but my face looks amazing.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> you might want to add this amazing Rosehip oil to your list</li>
            <li> The rosehip seed oil is amazing for sunburns.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural also has amazing customer service.  </li>
            <li> Plus 4 oz is a HUGE bottle, at a great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another great asset to this product is that InstaNatural is a fantastic company to purchase from.  </li>

            <li> I do have to tell you that it does not have a rose like scent like the Moroccan Rose Water.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t see the rose scent in this oil.</li>
            <li> I liked the oil - it was used in an oil blend.  </li>

            <li> Now you can have skin like a rose</li>
            <li> liked the smell myself.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like flowers (Rose) to me</li>
            <li> Rosehip Seed Oil smells, well, kind of yucky.</li>
            <li> I wash my face, shave, and apply the rose hips before I hit the sack.  </li>
            <li> I have had some stubborn spots, and as soon as I use this, it&#x27;s all good :)</li>
            <li> So, I received this in conjunction with the rose hip seed oil from InstaNatural as a trial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even got in the habit of adding this after my shaving routine to effectively combat razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best part is this one is really organic....</li>
            <li> I was hoping it had a rose tint smell.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; hormonal skin is loving this oil.  </li>
            <li> I recommend rose oil and this seller.</li>
            <li> I like to make my own skin care products and bought it to use in a recipe.</li>
            <li> My reviews are my honest opinion</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil felt nice when I applied it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing me with this bottle to review and send my honest feedback.  </li>
            <li> Thrilled with this purchase</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using this organic Rose hip oil</li>
            <li> rose hip oil  </li>
            <li> I have never tried Rose Hip Oil</li>
            <li> However, I really liked the fact that it was packaged in a pump glass bottle.</li>
            <li> But, for my face and neck I prefer to rely on the rose hip seed oil I was buying before.</li>
            <li> I purchased the rose hip oil for two reasons.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> I believe in the power of serums over creams (although I use one I make myself) because it is the best way for products to get into the skin, so I made a serum using this oil, and it is really benefiting my skin health.</li>
            <li> When I started using the Rose hip oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes this a greatly effective beauty oil?</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and has done so much for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly had never heard of rosehip oil or any of it&#x27;s uses.</li>
            <li> look to the reviews in hopes that people are being honest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honest in my reviews.</li>
            <li> With a organic shampoo and the rose hip oil I am hoping to rejuvenate some of my hair follicles into growing.</li>
            <li> seller sent instructions on how to use/store which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> After I cleanse at night, then I tone with the InstaNatural Rose Water</li>
            <li> The service was prompt and I also received follow-up inquiries to be sure that I had indeed received and was satisfied with the item - great customer service.</li>
            <li> Instanatural rose hip oil is organic, cold-pressed, and unrefined oil from the fruit or hip of the sweetbrier, also known in the Andes as rosa mosqueta, or scientifically as Rosa</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and absorbs into your skin nicely.</li>
            <li> My Grandma used to keep rose hip oil around, I never knew why, now I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here is the reason why I am loving it-</li>
            <li> I started this Rose Hip Oil review just 2 days ago</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil as well as the rose water toner from InstaNatural for one week.  </li>
            <li> This Rosehip oil seems to be of nice quality.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> That is until I discovered Instanatural Rose Hip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> this nice Thank you again</li>
            <li> I purchased it to make my own anti-aging serum, but ended up using it by itself.</li>
            <li> I adore rose hip seed oil and after trying it for the 1st time I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I thought I would try their Rosehip Seed Oil and all can I say is that I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> This is my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> but this rose</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and smells very nice would buy again def recommend</li>
            <li> It is a light oil but very effective.</li>
            <li> After having tried Argan Oil with really great results, I was really excited to try this [[ASIN:</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s light and pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> The oil is a bright orange and seems to soak into my skin rather easily without leaving a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> Great way to create loyal customers.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle, the dispenser is perfect and doesn&#x27;t pump out too much.</li>

            <li> I do know that it&#x27;s an excellent day or night moisturizer, layers well under makeup, and leaves my face very soft and glowy without any shininess or grease.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to incorporate this into any skin care regime as well.  </li>
            <li> It is very strong</li>
            <li> The fish smell that some reviewers posted is VERY strong.  </li>
            <li> The company provides exceptional customer service and followed up to make certain I was happy with the product and that it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The combination is amazing and makes my face very smooth and moisturized.</li>

            <li> Customer service here is very good and shipping times are fast.</li>
            <li> For those unfamiliar with what this is, it’s basically the oil obtained from cold-pressing a special type of rose seed, and it contains a variety of antioxidants, vitamins, and fatty-acids which are good for the skin.</li>
            <li> Good product but the smell is a lil strong, but it does not bother me because i only use one drop with two drops of my organ oil perfect for my face, love it!</li>
            <li> It feels really nice and is almost odorless which I love.</li>

            <li> That said, I wish I could be more enthusiastic about the rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> in my 30&#x27;s and have tried many, many, many skin care products - many of them good.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts me about 6 months, so it&#x27;s way more cost effective than even store-brand creams that are mostly fillers.</li>

            <li> Like having one product that do many jobs.    </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic, unrefined, and contains no chemicals.</li>
            <li> But rosehip oil has so many benefits for your skin that I can get over the smell factor.  </li>
            <li> You can squirt and mix with water and put in a squirt bottle for a refreshing face spray.</li>
            <li> After using the Rosehip oil, the itch has lessened and so has the flaking, which in turn alleviated my soreness.</li>
            <li> am elated to have been able to use this product and can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for many things but mostly to keep my scalp moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered more to ensure I never run out of this product.  </li>
            <li> she doesn&#x27;t love the smell (it smells like an oil --</li>
            <li> Love this as an all purpose oil for my skin and face</li>
            <li> , I make sure I always have it on hand!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I hope it works and love the feeling of it.</li>
            <li> I have to stay constantly on top of foot care</li>

            <li> and I love the results I am getting.</li>
            <li> but if I keep sharing my cream I will be buying more sooner than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> I use it more as a body oil now..</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I just love how it feels on my skin the day after.</li>
            <li> just make it better.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> and my skin began looking more rejuvenated and supple.</li>
            <li> Can I say I LOVE THIS?</li>
            <li> This ended up being a lovely transaction with a company that still believes in outstanding customer service in a day and age when ANY customer service seems to have all but disappeared.  </li>
            <li> This oil is lovely.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Most come in a 1oz size.  </li>
            <li> so whenever I do use it, I make sure that I&#x27;m not going anywhere that day.</li>
            <li> and I know with continued use they being to fade more and more.</li>
            <li> Very happy, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am glad that the description recommends to keep it refrigerated.</li>
            <li> and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- read the email the seller sends you about what you can expect (the fact that they actually send you an intro email is impressive, btw)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference on the texture of the skin on my face--it&#x27;s softer, more supple.&lt;br /&gt;Legs</li>
            <li> but, the consistency and odor I found to more agreeable to pop corn with than to slather on face and body.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I can confirm that I love it and will continue the regime.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this product and will not go without it :)</li>
            <li> I really love this oil, i wear it at night before i sleep.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser on this bottle.</li>
            <li> I think the best way to use this product is mixed in with one&#x27;s favorite lotion or cream.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and neck every day and love how it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overwhelming</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to research more, but thought I&#x27;d post my question here as well.</li>
            <li> I will update the review when/if I find out more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mostly use it at night because of the smell.  </li>
            <li> I do feel like I have to exfoliate more often</li>
            <li> He isn&#x27;t sure if the rosehip oil is helping but feels like the scar is healing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND MORE</li>
            <li> Thank you Instanatural for such Fast shipping, Great Product and Amazing results!!!!</li>

            <li> It should be refrigerated but that just makes it all the more refreshing when using.</li>
            <li> I say 4 stars because comparatively, this oil is darker in color and has a more potent smell, with that said.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier or more grateful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been lovely.  </li>

            <li> My skin soaked the oil a lot better.</li>
            <li> Most of all the results I get with this rosehip oil does not leave an oily feel but my skin feels like lite silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Of the two products I can&#x27;t do without, this is one and the other is the InstaNatural rose water which is the best toner in the world.</li>
            <li> it absorbs into my skin quickly and goes on very lightly (yay!).</li>
            <li> wonderful product, very fast absorbing and love the smell.</li>
            <li> The company was wonderful and sent me a new bottle quickly.</li>
            <li> on my temple area, I&#x27;m very excited to see if this will help reduce the appearance of it.</li>
            <li> Pump is very useful!</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil has a nice rich</li>
            <li> The scent, which is quite nice and unique, dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> If you are interested in trying rosehip oil, this is a good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell to me was a bit off-putting, not really bad, but kind of nutty.</li>
            <li> I loved the results the first couple days</li>
            <li> As someone who really wants to limit the chemicals in my products but doesn&#x27;t want to sacrifice potency and effectiveness, I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this nourishing oil!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality oil I have tried cheaper oils that claim to be 100% pure even though they aren&#x27;t if you compare this oil to a cheaper one you will definitely be able to see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Very nice, high quality rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> I apply at night and my face looks significantly brighter!</li>
            <li> but, I love the way it soaks in easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply because it has a pump top</li>
            <li> I hope more rosehip seed oil providers adopt this easy to use pump-glass-bottle method of packaging.</li>
            <li> The pump top dispenses easily.</li>
            <li> There is no awful smell to it and it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is especially effective on dry, elbows, knees, cracked lips, and heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is especially effective on dry, elbows, knees, cracked lips, and heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do love this product, but it does have a pungent smell almost like a strong paint.</li>
            <li> This is my second InstaNatural product (also have used their Rose Water), and my experience has been great on both counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I don’t even need that much for it to look good and healthy.</li>
            <li> I really like rose water and rose tea, so I thought I would like this.</li>
            <li> She is very discerning, and has been thrilled with this Rose oil.</li>
            <li> Thanks for an outstanding customer service and please keep maintaining the good quality product of this oil</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with what this and the others have done to my skin and also the great customer service from Instanatural.</li>
            <li> I find that it’s best to use it right after a shower, as that’s when your skin is soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It will make fine wrinkles better</li>
            <li> It softens the skin on my hands and although I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles on my face, it is supposed to help diminish fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love using it under and around my eyes as it helps with fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Love how it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I purchased the rose hip oil and certainly will leave a positive review on Amazon regarding the rose hip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just makes it so easy to use, and when you&#x27;re doin gall these things in the morning to get ready for work, it&#x27;s great that the manufacturer makes it so easy to use their product without a huge hassle.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair, then my hair is more smooth.</li>
            <li> This company is investing time and effort into making sure the customer is made to feel important.  </li>
            <li> most of all, the customer service is fantastic.</li>
            <li> it came time to buy more RSO, the brand I was using was no longer available.</li>
            <li> Arrived early; as advertised; feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural product to replace the use of chemical retinol creams, something I purposely wanted to get away from.  </li>
            <li> I read an article where a London model talked about her most important beauty tips and the nightly use of organic rosehip oil was her number one treatment.</li>
            <li> I love that it is available through Amazon Prime so that I can get it within 2 days.  </li>
            <li> This makes me happy because it is completely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a great product that can be recommended to anyone because it natural.</li>
            <li> What is fabulous about it is that is seals in moisture and leaves your skin with a lovely glow.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product, timely delivery, all as expected.</li>

            <li> I use other organic rosehip seed oil brands and they are perfect, but I still recommend this one if your skin can tolerate its power.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> it seems to absorb very quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> The texture isnt sticky or greasy and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> it is so easy to disperse.  </li>
            <li> Also, the dropper makes things easy and mess-free.</li>
            <li> Also seen a big improvement in my nails (the length) which is great :)</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly into skin.</li>
            <li> After using the clarisonic to clean my face, i apply this oil and my skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li> It rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and comes with a lot.</li>
            <li> The oil has a very mild scent, which basically disappears soon after applying.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly into the skin and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the few products I have used from the Instanatural line and look forward to trying out more of them in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I did notice the strong.</li>
            <li> Cons : strong odor</li>
            <li> I read reviews about the smell and that it&#x27;s strong for some people, but the smell didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> (I call them &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; scents), but if you prefer unfragranced products, it probably isn&#x27;t for you, just because it&#x27;s so strong.</li>
            <li> It has bit strong smell.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the InstaNatural 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> The rosehip seed oil has a darker amber color and a very strong, earthy scent; it makes me think of freshly brewed tea.</li>
            <li> It does help to nourish and moisturize my skin in a very gentle and effective manner.  </li>
            <li> LOVE that it comes in a large bottle and is such a great value!  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing for a 4 oz bottle; can&#x27;t imagine higher quality.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge as recommended which feels amazing since it is hot now.  </li>
            <li> wow, how amazing!  </li>
            <li> When I was offered the chance to try out this amazing, organic rosehip oil for the first time.</li>
            <li> Okay, I will start off by saying that this product doesn&#x27;t smell the best in my experience as far as these types of products go, it&#x27;s smell is earthy and indeed, well, natural.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it because it offers a great light weight moisture and a brightening affect  to the skin.</li>
            <li> First I apply rose water and then oil.</li>
            <li> May. Not only is the weather beautiful, my birthday and Mother</li>
            <li> Besides I have a normal skin which is naturally in a good condition</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was going to disregard the first email because, frankly, who has time?  </li>
            <li> Received quickly, nicely packaged, and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful &amp;#34;goldish&amp;#34; color &amp; smells as it should (remember, there are no additives such as a floral scent).</li>
            <li> their skin is more clean and smooth now.</li>
            <li> This product is also meant to be used for your face to treat fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> my fine lines under my eyes are still there no improvement</li>
            <li> smell was fine-</li>
            <li> I keep it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh, so its a nice cool treatment after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> The oil bottle was fine - no problem with oil or bottle.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin glow, fine lines disappear, and acne scars lighten.</li>
            <li> but when i put it on my face it felt fine and not too oily.  </li>
            <li> Still yet to see a change in my fine lines</li>
            <li> I am not super impressed</li>
            <li> I have fine lines and some wrinkles started</li>
            <li> How about adding it to a massaging oil and giving your significant other the best massage they ever</li>
            <li> He said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great product I ordered it for myself and when I first got it didn&#x27;t care much for the smell (I</li>
            <li> up some Rosehip oil in a bowl (not too hot, just slightly warm and comfortable to touch), then massage it into hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> up some Rosehip oil in a bowl (not too hot, just slightly warm and comfortable to touch), then massage it into hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t tangle as easily and brushes out smoothly and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love that it is not oily and doesn’t leave a residue on my face, it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> I love how it absorbs and works so quickly.</li>
            <li> I wish more companies were this quick about responding to their customers.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you again for your quick response!</li>
            <li> and I am super pleased.</li>
            <li> and I can feel my skin absorb the mixture more quickly.</li>
            <li> Opinions are solely my own and I am in no way obligated to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> Opinions are solely my own and I am in no way obligated to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> Very mosturizing, the smell is kind of strong.</li>
            <li> I applied for the promotion this company was doing, and was super happy to be able to try out their facial oil.</li>
            <li> but it turns out a little oil does wonderful things.</li>
            <li> I love that this oil is 100% pure and organic , as are most skin products that I use.</li>
            <li> The best results I have had is with grade a pure African undiluted Shea butter which is antibacterial</li>
            <li> I just wanted to find something to calm, soothe and help to clear up my skin, and I certainly found it with this wonderful Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> I order exclusively through this particular seller, and would recommend the same for anyone interested in great products, and great customer service.</li>
            <li> first thing that I noticed was that Rosehip oil is not greasy, it is very light, and it absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> I also have scaring which I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle</li>
            <li> and you can be really creative when making your own natural beauty/bath/body products including it.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle of rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> HUGE bottle</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge so I will have some for awhile</li>
            <li> This is a Huge bottle.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> I had a huge zit that wouldn&#x27;t go away for 3 months.</li>
            <li> &amp; I see a huge difference on my skin (face).</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It will make you skin look Fabulous</li>
            <li> 1-2 tiny drops was great for my hands/cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is such great stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> For me it even works under makeup, it&#x27;s that light.</li>
            <li> I was given lots of feedback from the company and also a free bottle of the oil</li>
            <li> (this is the case for any oils - heat and light are undesirable).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light oil.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, my hands and body and lightly on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil recently with great results and was given an opportunity to also try this organic Rosehip Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in the evening as well so when Iwakeup I still have smooth, radiant skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> what happened and they offered to mail a free replacement.</li>
            <li> It does add some shine, which is important to keep in mind for use on the face.  </li>
            <li> and I massaged it making him feel relaxed and his scalp was smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazing company really appreciate their customer service.  </li>
            <li> I use this primarily on my skin and it has done wonders.</li>
            <li> And on Amazon it’s free shipping.  </li>
            <li> so much to this company for this great present and the opportunity to try such wonderful products.</li>
            <li> They followed up to see how we were liking the product and then offered to send us free samples.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great</li>
            <li> so smooth..</li>
            <li> It has an earthy, natural smell to it that isn&#x27;t the most appealing to many.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure - free sample provided</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic cosmetic oil ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also supposed to be great for scars -- can&#x27;t speak to that as I don&#x27;t have scars to try it on, but since it&#x27;s so moisturizing I can only think it could help scarred skin.</li>
            <li> Finally, the customer service from InstaNatural has been great.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this works great on recent scars I have caused by acne.</li>
            <li> Personally it does not smell like roses lol.</li>
            <li> I enjoy caring for my skin.</li>
            <li> Two important steps are cleansing &amp; moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Lightly tap for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Would recommend using just a few drops to find out what amount works best for your skin.    </li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free to review, and share my thoughts.</li>
            <li> I also find using it this way during the day is great especially if you want to wear makeup, this way your face is not too oil/greasy</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received a free product for review.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for review.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> serum is so Orange, it looks like you gave yourself a cheap tan out of a can.&lt;br /&gt;After about an hour, I started to itch.</li>
            <li> They also sent me a free bottle of their Rosehip Oil as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I smooth on Hyaluronic acid, then I used about 5 drops of Rosehip.</li>
            <li> I smooth all but my eye cream onto my neck &amp; front of my hands.</li>
            <li> This has made an amazing and very noticeable improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> For the hair, I mixed it up with the coconut oil which is also great as well.</li>
            <li> it free to try out.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from InstaNatural to try and review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is light, and not too greasy and rubs in well with my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Natural is important to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I give the detailed benefits of this oil, I would like to list the components that make it veryeffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yet, it was a great essential oil to have to try.</li>
            <li> My wife said that her cuticles feel great and her scars and stretch marks are actually starting to look lighter.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> I apply this oil at night and my skin feels really smooth in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and light rosacea</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing and moisturize throughout  the whole day.</li>
            <li> My scars don&#x27;t improve much but overall it&#x27;s good!!!</li>
            <li> I was elated because I have heard so may good thing about this natural organic seed.</li>
            <li> It is another good quality product by Insta Natural .</li>
            <li> and it is going good so far.</li>
            <li> It smells good and leaves my skin SO soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> But to me they smells good because it smells natural and earthy.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Beta-Carotene - A good source of pro-Vitamin A, another form of antioxidant&lt;br /&gt;- Natural Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip oil is a natural alternative and the oil form is the most effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Beta-Carotene - A good source of pro-Vitamin A, another form of antioxidant&lt;br /&gt;- Natural Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip oil is a natural alternative and the oil form is the most effective.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks good and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this oil I applied it at bedtime, the next morning my face looked so radiant, smooth and velvety, it was amazing!!</li>
            <li> this is a grat oil, specially it can erase any imperfection of your skin although it&#x27;s an oil it not so oily, because it&#x27;s easily absobed by your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the pleasant summery scent and the protection against drying that it has provided to my skin during this long winter’s end.</li>
            <li> 2 more stars right there</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil is naturally rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega 3, 6 and 9), Vitamin A and C, that&#x27;s what makes it perfect for your face, hair and nails, plus it&#x27;s a skin enhancer.  </li>
            <li> The high beta carotene content gives it a beautiful golden orange that was quite a surprise the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a very nice cobalt blue glass bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li> she does say it does seem to helping and that her skin looks more vibrant and healthy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic , my skin loves it, I love it, natural product easy to read is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I love that it is organic and 100% pure!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product is pretty great, hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems yet (which is saying a lot because I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts)-</li>
            <li> It doesn’t have a very strong odor–it really just smells like what you’d expect oil to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love Rosehip Oil and this brand is just as effective as the more expense direct sales brands and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The instanatural line of products are high quality and nicely packed as well as packaged.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much will continue to buy ,my skin is much better after two weeks of use</li>
            <li> I love all the InstaNatural products--no chemicals, not tested on animals--but I have to say this is my new favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This spring I came to the realization that all my products were loaded with parabens and chemicals, nothing natural or pure and the result was that I was doing my skin and hair more harm than good.  </li>
            <li> bottle is a very generous 4 ounce size with an easy to dispense pump top.</li>
            <li> This would also help mask the smell if it really bothers you but even using the oil on its own, the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in plastic container or travel friendly..</li>
            <li> Rosehip Oil is rich in Vitamin A and has often been referred to as “Mother Nature’s Retin-A” because of its anti-aging benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this - it&#x27;s my first time trying it</li>
            <li> Original order was damaged in transit and InstaNatural contacted me asking why I requested a refund (I did not, Amazon automatically did because of carrier damage).</li>
            <li> have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would love it after the first whiff but the results make me chant vitamins for your face.  </li>
            <li> The preparation is also rich in antioxidants&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> skin is more radiant and it looks so much softer and youthful!</li>
            <li> it seems to moisturize it better than the hot oil I used on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Well a few months later I am happy to say that this product is incredible.</li>
            <li> Still, I was excited to try the product, and did so as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has helped reduce my fine lines and made my skin super</li>
            <li> Just wonderful smooth skin, it&#x27;s even brightened my face which is the only place I&#x27;ve used it so far.</li>
            <li> Though it is more expensive, cold-pressed is best because it has not been altered by heat and therefore retains more nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might try mixing it with other ingredients to give it a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Feels nice, applies smoothly, and leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Most people think I look like I am in my 50s anyway (unless they are being extra kind).  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin super smooth and I have also been using it on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Light and super absorbent.</li>
            <li> I don’t believe you can find a better price for such an amazing product anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive these oils to try, I use the  rosehip seed oil in a rose petal salve and used it on my elbows and they have stayed soft for along time!  </li>
            <li> I have become really self conscious about these marks and am so happy to see them lightening.  </li>
            <li> The product is an oil but feels quite light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is a great skin oil for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more clear and feels more nourished.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels SUPER smooth.  </li>
            <li> The pump is also good because the product is not exposed to light and air like it would be if you were having to open a dropper bottle all the time to use it.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I love a product that has many uses and is all natural, this is it.</li>
            <li> So many uses and such a nice sized bottle.</li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Non, greasy, and super light.</li>
            <li> This product is great for stretch marks and scars, I really can see how this oil has improved the appearance of my old stretch marks from my pregnancy and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find companies nowadays with such great customer service.</li>
            <li> It smells clean, actually.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients</li>
            <li> InstaNatural quickly sent the oil which was securely packaged.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of insta natural&#x27;s products, and I have to say that I am completely impressed.  </li>
            <li> My hair had the clean feeling without the slipperiness that I had become accustomed to from the chemical hair conditioners.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial product I have EVER bought in my life.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quick and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very light and fair skinned, maybe it doesn&#x27;t show on other skin types.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very surprised that the Instanatural&#x27;s rose hip oil is diminishing fines lines and decreasing the size of pores.  </li>
            <li> I’m asked for gift ideas this time of year, I often don’t know what to say, and when I try to think of Mother’s Day gift ideas to give to the special women in my life, I’m stumped too.</li>
            <li> Love the large bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they have the 4 OZ and having it 100% pure</li>
            <li> love that this Rosehip Seed Oil is organic, 100% pure, has no chemicals, additives or added fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a 100% pure and organic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many claims and uses for this oil--from minimizing scars and stretch marks to moisturizing face, skin, hair, and nails.</li>
            <li> And the way it soaks right in with no oily feel!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice almost &#x27;dry&#x27; feeling oil, so you don&#x27;t feel all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was also a great price for such a large bottle of organic RHS oil!</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil has a distinct scent, but it is very mild and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve not had any adverse reactions with this particular brand, which is always great.</li>
            <li> The consistency is great, soaks right in, has tremendously helped my acne scars and current acne.</li>
            <li> All in all, very high quality oil with many benefits.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for 74  year old skin.</li>
            <li> WOW, what an amazing product this is.</li>
            <li> it had a hint of rose essence to make it smell pretty, as it just doesn&#x27;t have much smell at all now.</li>
            <li> Really made my skin look better in  days.</li>
            <li> This product keeps on working for a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and noticed this time around the smell is stronger and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> but I say 3 weeks is good of enough time to see results</li>
            <li> Now, to be fair, I also bought another cream from InstaNatural and began using it at the same time.</li>
            <li> I mix one pump of it with sweet almond oil and put it under my eyes at night for wrinkles.</li>

            <li> Check out my full review here: http://dianareese1.com/2014/09/26/instanatural-100-rosehip-seed-oil-review/</li>
            <li> I really hoped to like this product, since it has received so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li> At night I&#x27;m more inclined to just use it straight up on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is also a good amount that will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only really good for the face, but I&#x27;m using it on my cuticles and nails/very healing.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so good with my morning regime that everyone thinks Im 6-7 years younger than what I am..</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years and nothing ever really helped.</li>
            <li> I tried this Rosehip oil and was surprised at how nice my feet have been staying.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this rosehip oil so much..</li>
            <li> Not even sure if it is the real stuff- it smells like mustard oil.</li>
            <li> Loving the effects so far.</li>
            <li> I’d definitely recommend giving this a try for those looking for more natural solutions for their skincare needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d be happy to answer any questions/</li>
            <li> I am glad to have found a moisture that really works, I use it each morning and night.  </li>
            <li> so it hasn&#x27;t been a full 60 days</li>
            <li> Smells very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; which is not my favorite smell</li>
            <li> As a result, my hair is much softer, more manageable</li>
            <li> Came quickly, it is a true oil, I use it and can feel and see the improvement .</li>
            <li> I love him so much, says I should wear the stretch marks as badges of honor for the pregnancies of our two boys, but I just don&#x27;t think I am cool with that yet.</li>
            <li> It is pure, and so smells more like pleasant garden smells, such as fresh leaves.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just something to keep in mind if you don&#x27;t like products with a distinct fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip seed oil is also slightly dry and works great on the face.</li>
            <li> Rosehip Oil by Instanatural is a wonderful product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with combination (what I have), dry, or generally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t have much of a scent to it.</li>
            <li> The company shipped the product out very quickly with simplified packaging and personally contacted me by email to see how I liked the product.  </li>
            <li> It is POTENT and really doesn&#x27;t go away too quickly either.  </li>
            <li> it soaks right in and makes my skin look and feel fabulous</li>
            <li> I am loving finding new and interesting uses for this goodness and am excited to make some natural beauty/bath/body products including this oil.</li>
            <li> My hair was smooth, had volume, was soft, revitalized and there was a healthy clean sheen.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal though; and the cool temperature helps to make it all the more refreshing to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing after using the Rose Hip for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> So far I used this product for two weeks and my skin is really happy and already feels super soft.  </li>
            <li> This type of oil does not clog pores and absorbs quickly.  </li>

            <li> It is non-greasy, absorbs quickly and gives noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> When I do notice any changes I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and revise this :)</li>
            <li> It goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs so that there is no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural has a really great line of oils and natural skin care products.</li>

            <li> It arrived quick and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> It also helps fade scars [quickly].</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be any better for my skin, but my husband actually noticed.</li>
            <li> If I were pregnant I would never be with out this product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the NUMEROUS skin benefits of a nice concentrated rosehip oil without the overpowering smell of roses.  </li>
            <li> packaged well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month, can&#x27;t say enough how much I love it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and I no longer notice a smell:</li>
            <li> This is great with acne-prone sensitive skin, I have almost no break outs and my old acne scars</li>
            <li> and it goes away rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin</li>
            <li> It feels oily for a minute or two (of course, it IS an oil) but soaks in quickly and leaves skin</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and I like this oil</li>
            <li> and I have them in my quick buy option now with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> As with most things it is accumulative and only gets better with time.</li>
            <li> Within a day of making my purchase, I received an email from the company containing useful tips and more information about this product, which was very helpful since I had not used Rosehip Oil before.</li>
            <li> Luckily it does not linger for longer.</li>
            <li> Oil absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the grime it had picked off on my face after just a quick sweep of the area.</li>
            <li> or I get athletes foot that quickly gets out of control.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly followed by an e-mail from AJ explaining how to use the oil, what it should look like, smell like and how it works.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly, as it should.  </li>
            <li> : After receiving more information from the seller, I think I used more than I needed to the 3rd time.</li>
            <li> I love that I can get results like this from a natural oil - not some over priced, over marketed, chemical filled cream.  </li>
            <li> I think the beauty industry is turning more and more to these healing ingredients as an alternative to the chemicals we have relied on in the recent past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have given this product a five star rating as it is the best deal by far world wide.</li>
            <li> In fact it&#x27;s a bloody marvelous deal and a great product.</li>
            <li> This particular brand has no fillers which is refreshing.</li>
            <li> Overall my skin feels better and looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have very dry under eyes and this is the BEST under eye serum ever, I was using philosophy&#x27;s Miracle worker under eye gel, which was ok but not great, this oil is far more superior in hydrating the under eye area</li>
            <li> Love it,, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The scent dissipates quickly though and is certainly not so unpleasant that I wouldn’t use it at all.</li>
            <li> oil has a mild smell, but it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and I love the applicator, it works very well to dispense just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I then heated the glass jar with the Rosehip in a bowl of very hot water for about 30 seconds, so the oil was very warm but not hot.  </li>
            <li> I want you to know that it feels fantastic when you first  put it</li>
            <li> I also had a great experience with the customer service and will most definitely do business with this company again in the future.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Organic Rosehip Oil and am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> After the very first use (before bed) I woke up that morning and noticed my skin looked dewey and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The oil is somewhat more thicker and greasier than the Trilogy brand I normally use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been very inventive with my use of it up until now, simply using it to moisturize my nails and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that know you can ship to Mexico, and it arrived in only two days.</li>
            <li> I have bought several products from InstaNatural  &amp; have been very, very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Keeps it fresh and feels cool going on.</li>
            <li> but the scent is not totally unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer that these are the foundation of having beautiful skin and preventing premature aging.  </li>
            <li> Rosehip oil also has antioxidant properties which is good for your skin in the long term.</li>
            <li> Pure Rosehip Seed Oil absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on fine lines and wrinkles for about 3 weeks now, and even upon first application, my skin felt replenished, calm, and my skin tone looked healthier.  </li>
            <li> I did receive my product very promptly,  the price was the best for the size, packaging was very protective and the product itself appears to be very beneficial,  although i have only used it for a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a distinct odor, but not unpleasant and it fades fairly quickly after applying, so it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me.  </li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge to keep it nice and fresh since its starting to get real hot.</li>
            <li> THEY contacted me and offered me a new bottle free of charge!  </li>
            <li> So cool, right?</li>
            <li> and I have some still bright and visible small scars as a reminder that I am hoping to fade a bit more.</li>
            <li> It does great for smoothing my skin and making scars less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It smells very earthy and the odor very quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li> It makes all of those dry patches look good.</li>
            <li> This will stay freshest in the fridge which makes it feel nice and cool to put on when it&#x27;s roasting outside.</li>
            <li> The pump is wonderful because I&#x27;m pretty clumsy and always end up spilling dropper bottles.</li>
            <li> It has been prone to bleed easily if I scratch it and is now much healthier looking and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dry oil that help in keeping your skin moisterized.  </li>
            <li> scalp is dry at times and this helps with dryness and makes my hair have a good look and feel.</li>
            <li> love the oil, it makes my skin very soft and easier to put on make up</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my face feel - very soft.  </li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this oil and this brand!!!</li>
            <li> I used to buy the make-up counter face products from Macy&#x27;s until I tried my first product from this company!</li>
            <li> First time in my life!</li>
            <li> First!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> To alleviate this simply add the rosehip oil to your favorite lotion and voila!</li>
            <li> I love all natural and organic skin and makeup products!</li>
            <li> I admit I was one of the many I bet that was surprised that this oil was not like &amp;#34;roses&amp;#34; at all!</li>
            <li> My skin is so much more clear!</li>
            <li> I love my new glow &amp; how its helped my skin look fresh.</li>

            <li> Plus it reminds me of delicious memories of french crepes.&lt;br /&gt;During winter time it appears to Help on preventing dry skin cracking on hands too.</li>
            <li> The bottle suggests to add favorite essential oil which I have done, but I can still smell the strong oil smell.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin leaving it feeling supple, smooth, and very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and is exactly as listed....;)  </li>

            <li> I use it on my face at night before bed and wake up with skin that looks alive and healthy.</li>
            <li> Such a nice company.  </li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Powerful and</li>
            <li> I am glad to have found a natural product I can use on my face as well as anywhere.</li>
            <li> I use it with my makeup remover and after fresh face moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was initially contacted by the company to see how I liked the products.</li>
            <li> but this one does what it says in a natural organic way which is much more preferable.  </li>
            <li> Ive bought many things from amazon but this product really surprised me.</li>
            <li> This goes on and spreads so smoothly, then soaks in and leaves your skin feeling baby booty smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Rose Water toner from the same company.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> If you know anything about oils, some do have a distinct smell which disappears in minutes.  </li>
            <li> I received a bottle complimentary but the opinion expressed is all mine.</li>
            <li> This has no chemicals, is 100% natural, and works better too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprising to see that they are fading slowly but surely.</li>

            <li> Overall I have healed nicely and function close to 100%.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product I&#x27;ve noticed the scar tissue on both my leg and knee is much more pliable and soft.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have been using this AM and PM and so far love the results.</li>
            <li> It is worth literally every penny.</li>
            <li> so I put Rose hip to the test and it worked the next day</li>
            <li> It works in nice and really gives the skin a soft feel and appearance.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing in the email was the need for the rosehip oil to be refrigerated (I missed that initially on the label).  </li>
            <li> I had to laugh because she is 83 and in a nursing home</li>
            <li> It does have a distinct smell to it, but it was not rancid for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their skin to feel soft as rose petals.</li>
            <li> I know now why it has been used for generations and why the people that use it have such beautiful, clear, &#x27;pretty&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> This purchase was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good product, good vendor, you can&#x27;t go wrong with ordering anything from InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> The oil was a vibrant amber just like it is supposed to be and the pump makes it easy (&amp; hygienic) to dispense.</li>
            <li> I have used the rosehip oil now for about 3 weeks and can see a considerable difference in my scars and even though my stretch marks are from pregnancies of more than 20 years ago, I can still see a difference in the color and texture of them.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hands feeling refreshed and worth it.</li>
            <li> that provides natural and safe</li>
            <li> The company has emailed me to check to see how I liked their products and give me proper instructions on how to apply their products.</li>
            <li> I use this oil along with Argan Oil (from the same manufacturer) and coconut oil to make my own face cream</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels..</li>
            <li> I have noticed a smoother, more plump, soft appearance to my skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more luminous and soft.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge to keep it fresh</li>
            <li> Made my nails grow and my skin soft love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can be used directly from the bottle, or mix it into your favorite moisturizer or lotion.</li>
            <li> Love that it is totally natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to love my skin and not be so self conscious anymore.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve received many compliments since I started using it that my skin looks soft (&amp; it is.....</li>
            <li> Love this product so far.</li>
            <li> and I feel much better putting the natural rosehip oil on my face rather than lots of chemicals</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for just that.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is COMPLETELY natural and feels better on my skin than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and performs as I need it to.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking soft and healthy..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, however, and tends to fade away once the product has been absorbed.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is useful for premature aging and skin pigmentation problems.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is useful for premature aging and skin pigmentation problems.  </li>
            <li> It is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I rarely get acne</li>
            <li> Just started using it and see results and love how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m changing my lifestyle to more organic, natural products</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural, organic and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li> I did however add a few drops of vitamin E, which alone is wonderful on the skin, just for a natural preservative .</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the smell of all those healthy Omega 3s that naturally occur in the oil.</li>
            <li> This is highly reputable to organic natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Am still working out my own personal formula</li>
            <li> I have been using this for like only 2 weeks and the result is good so far!!!</li>
            <li> I mix InstaNatural ORGANIC Rosehip Oil 100% Pure &amp; USDA Certified 4OZ with Original Keri Lotion and then put L&#x27;Oreal Visible lift CC Cream over both.  </li>
            <li> It looked dry and flakey but now looks great and normal.</li>
            <li> In my honest opinion, I would look at other brands if you want to buy facial oils, as it looks like Instanatural gives out a lot of free/discounted product for good reviews.</li>
            <li> The color is rich golden and it has an unusual, nutty scent.</li>
            <li> It is a rich feeling oil that can moisturize and make your face feel so incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I just needed a  straight-out moisturizer without any frills (as I said, I have so many other things I layer on my skin that I&#x27;m already doing triple duty in most areas of skin care management.)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really expect to see any results this soon, then the other day my mother asked what I was doing to my skin because it looks great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unrefined rose hip oil has an unusual clean, verdant odor, similar to the leaves and stems of roses.  </li>
            <li> The first time I bought rosehip seed oil, shortly after the purchase I received an email from the seller stating the qualities of a good pure oil.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and I am in love with this!!</li>
            <li> By the way, the customer service is superior and the seller was not aware of my profession.</li>
            <li> Which is a good thing because wearing it could clash with your perfume or other fragranced products that you use.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the other ones I have used.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice, dark glass pump container, which is so much easier than just a twist off top,</li>
            <li> My routine right now is OCM (castor/almond oils),</li>
            <li> I appy it on my face right after the shower and my legs too.</li>
            <li> Right now is too soon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying nightly right after showering, then wrapping the skin while I sleep.</li>
            <li> But we always strive for and want some improvement, right?</li>
            <li> And also try applying it right after taking the shower when the benefits from using beauty products are the highest.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serums are all the rage right now and what’s not to like?</li>
            <li> price makes this oil just right for a Vitamin C serum that can be used all over the body.</li>
            <li> This is quality rosehip oil right here.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference right way.</li>
            <li> Right away, I could tell my skin agreed with it</li>
            <li> nighttime use is recommended, right before bed</li>
            <li> It nourishes your skin and you will see and feel the nutrients right away.</li>
            <li> My friends and family have made unsolicited positive comments!  </li>
            <li> but my main benefit was to look for one that will me smooth out my skin and reduce the appearance of my stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used rose hip seed oil before, so I am aware of the fact that it does not actually smell of roses.</li>
            <li> The color of this oil is pretty much similar to its mountain rose herbs counterpart.</li>
            <li> Its the best $16 bucks I have spent in a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see its positive long term results specially on the damaged parts of my skin :)</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs very quickly and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> However, it may be the exception that proves the rule, ‘a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.’</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to any one with acne scar and dry skin issue!&amp;#34; Thank you Amazon for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Quickly noticed positive signs in my skin.</li>
            <li> There is a distinct odor to this product - it smells earthy and very much like some of the products I use for leather conditioning.  </li>
            <li> but I usually have a pretty good sniffer and it was fine with me.</li>
            <li> but to be fair, i also started using another new  product around the same time i started using this</li>
            <li> So far everyone is loving my new cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product after using it for three weeks, generally in the morning after I wash my face, cleanse with Moroccan Rose and then put a little of this</li>
            <li> this product is really easy to use packaging is fantastic and the bottle is a generous supply that will lat and last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The four ounce glass bottle is tinted blue to protect the oil from light, and the cap has a glass dropper for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stinking and oily, but that&#x27;s expected.&amp;#34; He assured me the oil absorbed quickly but he has been adding a spray lotion after using the rosehip oil because he really didn&#x27;t like the rosehip oil smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after a co worker recommend it, I got a minor rash that seemed like a heat rash on my face, I continued to use it because of the amazing reviews .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently making the transition into using more natural beauty products in my nightly routine to encourage healthy cell growth and keep wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> and my face looks much better more soft, fresher and younger</li>
            <li> It does feel oily when you first put it on,  but it does get absorbed soon after.  </li>
            <li> When I first I applied it went on oily but it quickly absorbed into my skin and the oily sheen vanished</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because the bottle arrived covered in oil which really ticked me off, though the bottle was still full</li>
            <li> My skin also is NOT sensitive, so please adjust what I say to your own situation.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase my organic rose hip seed oil in bulk from mountain rose herbs, so buying it from Amazon was new for me.</li>
            <li> And the price is amazing for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> As far as the fairly noticeable difference in overall color in comparison to my right elbow, well since I&#x27;ve been using this product they are almost a matching pair of elbows once again.</li>
            <li> I have used many rosehip seed oils from different brands, but decided to try this one due to the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is rich in vitamins and this makes it ideal for adding bounce and silkiness back into limp, lifeless</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is rich in vitamins and this makes it ideal for adding bounce and silkiness back into limp, lifeless</li>
            <li> Does anyone else feel like the year is flying by, because I certainly do!</li>
            <li> As pure as it gets!</li>
            <li> could not believe how amazing this oil helped my dry skin on my face but</li>
            <li> Even though goes on very oily, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It also helps to heal super fast too.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks younger, more dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on dry patches on my own skin, and for my son&#x27;s cradle cap and even diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of rosehip oil along my skin care journey and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my skin petal soft and is easily absorbt</li>
            <li> Then I tried this awesome oil in my hair and it left it shiny and bouncy as it air dried.</li>
            <li> For a facial moisturizer it&#x27;s been great, my pores seem smaller and any blackheads I had seem to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> The company even took the time to reach out to me a few weeks after having ordered to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> After using this in various beauty uses for a couple of months, I can say that it is a good all over moisturizer for the winter so far.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a similar consistence to the Vit C serum, but this is very moisturizing and feels amazing on my face.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and makes the skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> but, to my big surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and pretty much a one ingredient product for my face.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Not the kind of natural written on labels of national brands, but REAL natural products that have REAL ingredients, not lab created ones.</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil blend right into my skin instantly.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all, and it is worthwhile for your dry skin.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> This oil absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this has a multitude of uses, it’s been working very, very well to repair my damaged hands</li>
            <li> I very much like this oil, and would recommend it highly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fine lines, small brown spots faded and keeps my face a nice texture.</li>
            <li> The best part is that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this oil is that it’s an all natural product with no fillers, rich in antioxidants, essential fatty acids and on top of all that it’s a multi-purpose moisturizer with healing affects for face, skin, hair, nails, stretchmarks, scars, spots and even psoriasis and eczema.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky but once again after it absorbs the sticky feel will go away and it absorbs nice into the skin especially after a warm bath/ or shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Yes, when it first goes on it will be a bit shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However this helps me so much!</li>
            <li> After one month of using it I have to say I really like it!</li>
            <li> I love this...added some essential oil to cut the smell.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Rosehip Seed Oil I have purchased</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget that glass of wine ;)</li>
            <li> Love using this on my face with essential oils!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, I simply use it for everything, body, face, hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all !</li>
            <li> I love the results enough for put up with the smell.</li>
            <li> first I don&#x27;t like the smell, but now I&#x27;m getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This is a great sized bottle and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working okay, haven&#x27;t been using daily.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> If your bathroom gets hot and steamy then keep it somewhere else</li>
            <li> No one up close and personal will be able to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more</li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference within the first 2 days.  </li>
            <li> have tried so many different products and nothing came close to the results I have from this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really have noticed a difference, which is so rare in my world of skincare product experimentation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told by complete strangers that my skin looks fantastic and that it&#x27;s glowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase more InstaNatural products in the future.</li>
            <li> First it was lupus,</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first experience with using Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> I won’t lie, it’s pretty</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly I didn’t quite like the oil when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> It is a chemical and preservative free formula extracted from (Rosa Mosqueta) that provides natural and safe protection and total skin revitalization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cap cracked and broke the first time I screwed it on.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, but it is very sticky and has a distinct odor.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product, I used it at night.  </li>
            <li> Great product in a 4 ounce bottle that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am definitely continuing use to see how much more improvement</li>
            <li> into your pours- really moisturizing!</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, or if you have acne prone skin, be aware that it can block your pores.</li>
            <li> It is not my favorite smell in the world, but I got used to it after several times of using it.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that they will get even lighter with continued use, and then maybe I won&#x27;t feel so funny</li>
            <li> What I like most is, it keeps my skin looking hydrated all day and actually changes the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> One squirt rubbed into my hands makes my hands soft and smooth and it protects my hands, even in water, until I use soap.</li>
            <li> and it also helps the skin produce more collagen which will make you look younger and make your face or skin</li>
            <li> and so I first looked to InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil for increasing the blood circulation in my face.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this company and will continue to order their products as long as they are around.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> First I must warn you that it smells like vitamins.  </li>
            <li> That is what I kept telling myself when I applied it to my face the first night.</li>
            <li> Even the first morning after applying it I could feel a difference.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I feel like my face is softer and looks clearer and more even-toned.</li>
            <li> But the second I get home and start using it again, it looks better.</li>
            <li> this is my first time using it</li>
            <li> More about the actual product from Instanatural...</li>
            <li> and I will most definitely order another bottle as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> I love how this product improves my overall skin</li>
            <li> well-so much better than not using anything or covering with a bandage only.  </li>
            <li> It is also a very generous size so it is well worth its price.</li>
            <li> However, this one smells exactly like SOY SAUCE.</li>
            <li> Got this for free from Insta Natural</li>
            <li> Like this brand better than the last one I ordered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger and a better value.</li>
            <li> for several weeks, as the bottle runs out, she&#x27;s been asking me to buy more.</li>
            <li> so I will update my review later with any and all results after I have used this more to see if this claim is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the ingredients are stellar.  </li>
            <li> Just want to have more information about this oil, I read about it in difference languages, the benefits about this oil are almost the same as well.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of muscle tightness from my job and this oil makes it much easier to get those knots out!</li>
            <li> No negative reactions and my skin stays moist with one or two moisturizer application and the rose hip oil instead of multiple applications throughout the day before buying this product.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and soft even with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what InstaNatural says it does.  </li>
            <li> I love using essential oils  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft, smooth and helps it look brighter.</li>
            <li> My hair has not only felt healthier, it also seems more voluminous after using the Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I most likely will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate how the Insta Natural Rosehip Oil makes my skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I normally use it after I have used the Moroccan Rose Water Facial Toner.</li>
            <li> The first night I tried it, I didn&#x27;t have makeup on.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and a pretty big bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this Rosehip Oil!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although at first the logo turned me off (first impressions and all), the positives outweighed the logo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it as a carrier with essential oils for my skin serum and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> and when I run out, I will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> The oil at first seems</li>
            <li> Thanks AJ!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in the softness of my skin after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more soon.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Rosehip Seed oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;- use it immediately after your skin is moist, like after taking a hot shower</li>
            <li> It also smells sort of like eggs at first</li>
            <li> Thanks InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> At first the smell didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> so primarily wanted it as an all natural moisturizer that didn&#x27;t burn/sting.  </li>
            <li> love these products from InstaNatural and would definitely recommend them!e</li>
            <li> The smell was pretty off-putting, but after reading a suggestion from another reviewer to use it as an add-in with another moisturizer, I went with four stars.</li>
            <li> I love this oil and have added it to my daily moisturizing regime.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of InstaNatural&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different creams and lotions to help this problem, yet nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Very Pleases!  </li>
            <li> were within the first couple applications.  </li>
            <li> first I tried to apply my moisturizer first, then the oil but</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes I would be interested in trying the vit. C, I have never used vit. C and would like to know how it works on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using oils.</li>
            <li> Okay so I tried a different brand..</li>
            <li> This is the first Rosehip Oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well</li>
            <li> Nice pure amber oil, smells mellow and not odd or unexpected.</li>
            <li> You can mix in the oil in your favorite cream, use it alone or make a refreshing facial mist in just a few easy steps.</li>
            <li> Skin is super soft!!</li>
            <li> wearing my shorts.&lt;br /&gt;IT also works great on extra dry skin like your elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin and does well mixed with Argan oil as an overnight hair treatment--wash out in the morning.</li>
            <li> She tells me it is quick dissolving on the fingertip and that you really don&#x27;t need a napkin or anything like to apply; straight from hand to face.  </li>
            <li> But honestly, it only took about three uses to adjust and once you begin working it into your skin that initial fishy funk turns earthy and pleasant.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed it and my face was super soft.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil in general is really good for your skin (especially if you have scars that need healing) and this one is as good (if not better) than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did - the oil makes my skin soft and younger looking without the harsh chemicals and it was happy to find that the oil is organic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip oil has a high content of essential fatty acids and is a perfect skin hydration tool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip oil has a high content of essential fatty acids and is a perfect skin hydration tool.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again and love that it is unrefined, organic and a large bottle for the price paid.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural products to use on my skin and hair and was excited about trying this organic rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really excited to try Insta Natural&#x27;s Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> The smell of this rose hip seed oil is extremely fishy.</li>
            <li> I love this oil it has so many uses and really softens skin, it also will help get rid of past sun damage and tanning bed damage</li>
            <li> I was using a different brand from the healthfood store but this is half the price and just as good!</li>
            <li> The smell is  kind of like walnuts&#x27;s smell, and only smell strongly in the first few seconds, and quickly loosest the smell.  </li>
            <li> Its a very high quality oil at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing [duh], and great to mix with lotions.</li>
            <li> Lightly pat the oil onto your clean, dry face.</li>
            <li> I am a product whore and test lots of things from drugstore to brand name ... for a decent price I say it&#x27;s worth it, but give it time.</li>
            <li> But it’s only because I had no experience with using any kind of natural oil for skin purposes</li>
            <li> I am now making my own products with totally organic and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Intranatural rosehip seedoil is, according to a female friend, fast absorbing and makes her feel more confident going into her job regarding her facial appearance.  </li>
            <li> The price is more reasonable than Argan oil, especially when you consider this comes in a 4 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They offer a money back guarantee if you aren&#x27;t completely satisfied, so you have absolutely nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> I must say that it has a very fish oil smell and although it fades when it dries, it can come back at the end of the day so it might be better to use it at night</li>
            <li> Better blood circulation mean better cell repair and smoother brighter</li>
            <li> I love that there are no fillers in this, 100% pure + that the seller really believes in their product with the 100% money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to let it dry out first if you are going to use the oil on your feet and put some socks on.</li>
            <li> I hope I will see some positive results soon.</li>
            <li> Was super hesitant to try oil on my sensitive, sometimes break-out prime skin, but I had finally heard enough good things</li>
            <li> i am a first time user of this product, i am the type of girl who doesnt know much about beauty products</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, I have been using everyday and can see the change it has made in my skin.</li>
            <li> At first, I was worried that this oil might not suit my skin type, but it turned out very well.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice much difference with use</li>
            <li> However, I find that I am using it pretty much as a stand alone product every night.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It seems very oily when you first put it on</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant at first my skin being combination and getting blackheads on my T zone.</li>
            <li> Could the secret to beautiful skin lie in roses?</li>
            <li> I have used it for close to a month in place of the retinol and have noticed it works as good as, if not better, than retinol.  </li>
            <li> If you can get past the scent, it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> I usually use about two drops per hand and that is ample to get good</li>
            <li> someone that has used rosehip seed in the past, it&#x27;s a pleasure to pass along some uses and why I feel this is a good brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have older skin, wrinkles and lines;  haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to know if it will help these problems or not, but it leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> They really work on fine lines and wrinkles have seen a huge difference using this product along with their other anti aging face creams.</li>
            <li> My pores were becoming so large it was so gross.</li>
            <li> I have been using their Argan oil daily on my nails and have never before had fingernails that are so strong, long and healthy.</li>
            <li> I use it in my face and my body as a moisturizer, in result my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> By morning my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave shine, is nearly odorless (smells a bit nutty during application but doesn&#x27;t linger), doesn&#x27;t transfer, works well under makeup, and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> It can be used as a moisturizer, an anti-aging agent, to help repair sun damage and scars, to make dry hair healthy and shiny, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so my skin can be a bit more dry.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves my face/hands feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a refreshing lotion for the dry summer skin.</li>
            <li> However, once you apply and it sets it makes your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I also use it in the place of my facial moisturizer, it absorbs easily, and then I apply my sunscreen followed by my cosmetic</li>
            <li> Be sure to store in a cool spot with no light.</li>
            <li> I actually like that it&#x27;s not perfumed and strong</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, spreads easily, and after a little while, my skin feels like silk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily wiped down for a clean feel and even though it&#x27;s oily, it does not aggravate my oily skin in any way.  </li>
            <li> It is an item that certainly I will keep buying over and over again.</li>
            <li> After I use this for a while I will add coconut oil, olive oil or any pure oils I have to my skin routine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is organic and pure.</li>
            <li> Look for 100% Pure on the label.</li>
            <li> Instanatural 100% pure rosehip seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve been using InstaNatural 100% pure Rosehip Seed Oil for a week now</li>
            <li> InstaNatural believes in the earthy scent of pure oil</li>
            <li> oil comes in a fairly large bottle</li>
            <li> 100% pure, certified organic, Rosehip Seed Oil by InstaNaturals contains no fillers and comes in a large 4 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using organic pure rosehip oil for about 5 years for face, neck, chest, and hands.  </li>
            <li> This is a product that is completely pure.  </li>
            <li> Organic rosehip oil 100% pure .</li>
            <li> product appears to be pure as advertised</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 100% pure &amp; organic</li>
            <li> 100% pure, Organic, and</li>
            <li> It comes in a large bottle and dispensed by a spray.  </li>
            <li> pure Rosehip oil on stretch marks, age spots, hyper-pigmentation, burns, and scars</li>
            <li> Massage pure Rosehip oil into the scalp; leave it on for 30 minutes, and then shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pure Rosehip oil on stretch marks, age spots, hyper-pigmentation, burns, and scars</li>
            <li> Massage pure Rosehip oil into the scalp; leave it on for 30 minutes, and then shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, age spots seem to be lighter , and my laugh lines seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> As much as I still have a nice figure, my tiger stripes (stretch marks) really bother me and shot my confidence down.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil keeps my skin smoother longer than the Argon oil-though it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or oily especially when I use it on my face and neck-this makes skin silky smooth where Argon is a little heavier and more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great on skin and hair (wet or dry) and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smoother, gives it an extra glow, seems to be smoothing some fine lines and has not made me break out at all.</li>
            <li> only time will tell if it helps with the fine lines and acne scars.</li>
            <li> I apply this nightly to my face and neck mixed with lavender and carrot seed oil to reduce fine lines, minimize discoloration and rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this regularly, I have noticed a pretty significant change in the condition of my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this exceptional product in the past, without a hitch.  </li>
            <li> very emollient, good for your skin, and definitely something I&#x27;d add to a moisturizing cream or lotion to up the ante against dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry an I love how it feels after I massage my hands and face with it before going to bed....</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smooth and my face isn&#x27;t dry or oily, it is just right.</li>
            <li> I just scrub every night with cetaphil antibacterial soap and put on a little bit of rosehip oil before bed, and just rub my face with really warm water instead of re-washing.</li>
            <li> Works good especially because I have dry patches in my skin!</li>
            <li> Then I appy Insta Natural Toning Rose Water with a clean cotton pad using small upward circles again.</li>
            <li> Nest I have some conflict previous to trying the Rose Hip Oil due to reading that it can have a &amp;#34;Fishy&amp;#34; order and not to expect at all al &amp;#34;Rose&amp;#34; scent like many do.</li>
            <li> This oil made such a huge difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I got my product within 2 days of ordering and that was the free shipping option that stated it would take at least 5-8, so WOW amazing turn around time to start.</li>
            <li> The entire transaction, from start to finish, was smooth and shipping was lightning fast.</li>
            <li> , we&#x27;re talking very fine)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the item was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> Such a smooth texture.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference since I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Seller was very responsive and helpful with questions.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try rosehip because I have always heard so much about it.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate their warning, but this info needs to be presented BEFORE people buy it.</li>
            <li> Since adding this oil, about a month ago, my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li> Now, my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li> My skin really likes this.</li>
            <li> If your skin feels greasy, you&#x27;ve applied too much.</li>
            <li> This product is even better at keeping my limbs moisturized than I expected and has streamlined my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> I have bought every $70 bottle of wrinkle serum out there and this actually is so much nicer.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this product And hightly recomend it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Is really softening my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now I haven&#x27;t invested much time to the Argan Oil</li>
            <li> so I think it might cause break outs if you have oily skin because it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really seen none</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not saying it really was fish oil,</li>
            <li> My Order came on time and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> All natural, fast absorbing, soft and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> The end result is very smooth,radiant skin that stays so all day.</li>
            <li> I have started using it, but don’t see too much difference yet</li>
            <li> I really like that it is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this organic, yes organic rosehip oil!</li>
            <li> so having saying that i didnt notice much changes in my skin with using this product</li>
            <li> but i do enjoy the smoothness and moisterizing that it left of my skin that i do continue to use it</li>
            <li> A real treasure to Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip Oil is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The heat and dryness really takes a toll on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used several products that claim to improve and smooth blah blah blah</li>
            <li> I use the rosehip oil in areas that I need then smooth over a very tiny bit of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it some time before reviewing it and my skin has reacted really well to it.</li>
            <li> i like how it soften my hair not so much and the smell dont realy like it</li>
            <li> really like the benefits of the rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li> Really has softened my hands and skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> has a very funky smell.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really get this oil for all that stuff</li>
            <li> Highly recommand it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very please with the product.</li>
            <li> Haha,</li>
            <li> I also like InstaNatural - very conscientious ....</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people mentioned the smell, but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> using gentle strokes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my partner and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but not oily at all.</li>
            <li> Melissa from InstaNatural responded promptly and was very appreciative.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> thanks..</li>
            <li> I just need a straight out moisturizer, and I thought I&#x27;d give this rosehip oil a try.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> ha it just really smells like soy sauce.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This oil provided so much pain relief and lightened the color of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> oil has a bit of an unusual odor, I can&#x27;t seem to place it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they were very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
            <li> However, I have never used a rosehip seed oil that smelled this much fishy either.</li>
            <li> This made getting the oil much easier than using a dropper.</li>
            <li> and I can say that it works Very</li>
            <li> Unless someone is really close to you they cannot smell it at all.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see any real change in it after using it for just under a month now.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it is very hydrating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> how MUCH would be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oddly enough, Instanatural sends you an email when you order the product with the disclaimer that it&#x27;s not recommended for acne-prone skin, but I&#x27;ve had fabulous luck with this stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair also feels much softer after one application.</li>
            <li> Very versatile and gentle.</li>
            <li> And if you have a question, a real person will respond.  </li>
            <li> But i found it very nourishing to my skin and hair and halfway through</li>
            <li> And by the time the drops have reached your skin, they are room and very soon, body temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so your makeup doesn&#x27;t slip around too much on your face.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well overnight and really does help with skin tone.  </li>
            <li> oil itself has a VERY earthy smell, it didn&#x27;t bother me, but I could see where it would bother some.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped on time and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I like this product as a moisturizer, it moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li> and my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural tends to be very generous with their product, and that&#x27;s always a plus.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my face was in need of too much cleaning.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t do much for me by itself.</li>
            <li> I apply a light layer working it well into the foot then put on white cotton socks before bed.</li>
            <li> Skin is so much softer, healthier, glowing.</li>
            <li> It seems not to clog pores, and has been really miraculous for her.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> It seems fresh, and I put it directly into the fridge to preserve it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d gently massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin smooth without the greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and so I spent more to get this.</li>
            <li> It has a much fresher, earthier scent than what I have purchased in retail stores.</li>
            <li> It was also much cheaper per ounce.</li>
            <li> This Rosehip seed oil is proving to be equally effective at dealing with overall hand moisturizing, and seems to be a bit better (or at least quicker) in dealing with cuticle</li>
            <li> Once absorbed it leaves my skin feeling soft but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very hormonal acne ridden skin and a combination of this (and birth control)</li>
            <li> I find that my legs are definitely so much smoother and softer after using this.</li>
            <li> I really like InstaNatural&#x27;s organic rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> 3 pumps covers my whole face &amp; neck very well....</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have much reason to try the rosehip seed oil</li>
            <li> But it really seems to be working.</li>
            <li> If you have acne and have seem to have tried everything, you really need to try this.</li>
            <li> Very earthy.</li>
            <li> This company really does care about their products and ur satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Money could have been better spent.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> I would go to the dermatologist often and nothing would really work.</li>
            <li> I was prescribed pills, creams but who wants to take pills all their life for acne</li>
            <li> I had purchased a cuticle oil, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing much of anything.</li>
            <li> The oil is very efficient in fighting signs of aging, as well as diminishes photo aging.  </li>
            <li> Rosehip oil to sunburn for an immediate soothing effect, as the oil will also gently aid the healing process and reduce the inflammation.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Rosehip oil to sunburn for an immediate soothing effect, as the oil will also gently aid the healing process and reduce the inflammation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it gets really oily in the summer.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really comment on that</li>
            <li> Thanks to rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it straight</li>
            <li> Came fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product is everything as described.</li>
            <li> It has never bothered me using it straight.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is bigger than I expected but thats good because I will get to use it for all of the things I want to try.</li>
            <li> At least one good thing came out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does have a nice, light, non irritating smell.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural oil is like it is supposed to be: deep yellow color and warm earthy smell.</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin looks more radiant and it definitely feels soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Finally, on the third email, I replied (after having time to truly try out the product and give an honest response).  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I used this in a homemade body balm and it is a much higher quality rose hip oil than I used in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural so that why I feel my pores are smaller &amp; look better.</li>
            <li> There;&#x27;s no need to buy expensive face potions when natural stuff is best!</li>
            <li> I do at nighttime every few days and on any kind of spot or blemish.</li>
            <li> I definitely felt more moisturized after using the oil, and it does leave the skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, you don&#x27;t need a lot and it makes your face soft and even seems to help heal facial imperfections.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to people with  dry  parts of their body, you are going to love this nourishing oil.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Insta Natural!!!</li>
            <li> use Instanatural 100% pure rosehip seed oil for my hands and nails, but it has many other uses too.</li>
            <li> This absorbs well into your skin and leaves you silky and with a nice glow, You only need a small amount which is easily dispensed from  the pump.</li>
            <li> The fruit of the wild rose, or rose hips, have been eaten for centuries for their Vitamin C to ward off scurvy and other ailments when citrus fruits were not available.</li>
            <li> I’ve been a recent convert to using Argan oil to help deal with dry, cracked fingertips, and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing this particular oil as well as purchasing from this particular company.  </li>
            <li> This is worth a try for the skin care conscious out there, also the quality is so much better than other brands that have rosehip oils that are triple the price.</li>
            <li> felt that such a cheap product (rosehip oil) couldn&#x27;t do anything more than the other products Ive tried...</li>
            <li> And the e-mails are so professional, friendly and contain so much useful information that you can only wish that all sellers were like them.</li>
            <li> I could see improvement on my hair, skin and nails even after the first use (no joke) and I am so excited to see how Rosehip Oil would work in a long term use.</li>
            <li> Better than any other rosehip oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands and I don&#x27;t feel they were as concentrated or potent.</li>
            <li> It is definitely DILUTED and does not carry a unique amber color, which is the signature color of rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> (more than a year after the other attempt)&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft like no other moisturizer could ever come close to.  </li>
            <li> I bought two more bottles, one for me and the other for my daughter.</li>
            <li> In two weeks time the scars have smooth flat</li>
            <li> I found that there are not as many uses for Rosehip oil as there are for other oils</li>
            <li> This is high quality, pure, one ingredient oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil to EVERYONE, and this brand is very high quality.</li>
            <li> Just recently I used &amp;#34;Rosehip Seed Oil&amp;#34; on clean skin once a day to help diminish the appearance of my scars.</li>
            <li> That way when you&#x27;re finished using first batch, the second batch is still fresh.</li>
            <li> I am at the &#x60;mature&#x27; age, in my sixties, and I am aware that thinning hair can start at any time, so I do take note of how much hair loss there may be every time I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it a great oil &amp; a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to protect their nails and cuticles or skin for that matter</li>
            <li> Good bye rough, dry and cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> It keeps my mature dry skin hydrated better than</li>
            <li> Smoother skin, lighter brown spots, and less fine wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> I normally have dry, sensitive skin that needs a rich moisturizer on top of a serum, but this has not been necessary with the rosehip oil!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I looked nearly as tired as I would have without using this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Not sure how i would have liked it.  </li>
            <li> My immediate first impression was that the quantity provided for this price is outstanding; Four ounces is a substantial amount that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love that this product comes in a dark bottle plus</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is leaving my skin more moisturized, and is helping diminish the dark spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back after a full 60 days.  </li>
            <li> Using a hot wet clean washcloth</li>
            <li> She also has been getting some mild acne, very sensitive to products in general.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels amazing, especially in weather where it would normally feel dry</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many moisturizers for my dry skin (hot Arizona sun) and have finally found rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to put the bottle in the fridge, decanting only what you need for a few weeks at a time, or mixing with other ingredients that can prolong shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At 31 I&#x27;m getting carded all the time again (not so much before), and new people I meet often assume I&#x27;m in college.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate and it is not too greasy,  it leaves my hair shiny and smooth and for dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is dry with just advanced night repair and this...</li>
            <li> It makes my skin less wrinkled and more radiant.</li>
            <li> and I was able to see a slight change in their appearance.</li>
            <li> With my previous product, my makeup seemed to go on a bit better over the oil.  </li>
            <li> And 4 ounces for the price is better than some people are selling 2 ounces or less.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft, fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> and I have used it on myself and older daughter as a hair oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a super fan  for oils that will help me look younger, help my hair , help my nails and skin.</li>
            <li> As we all know oils do have there particular smells.  </li>
            <li> yes, the smell is &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;, but if you&#x27;ve ever hiked in mossy forests near rivers, you may actually enjoy the scent, I definitely don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> I bought this Rosehip oil after reading it on one of the beauty review website, mainly for the wrinkles under my eye.</li>
            <li> I found this oil on Amazon and the price for it from this particular seller is just unbeatable.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of daily and evening use on my tummy, I am pleased to say I am back in a bikini.</li>
            <li> While I have only been using it for a short time, I have noticed that my skin feels softer and has a more even, glowing appearance.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue to use this product in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I mainly take advantage of the moisturizing aspect of the serum.</li>
            <li> I was able to test out their Rosehip Seed Oil and their Deep Cleansing Facial Oil.  </li>
            <li> face, neck, even on my pregnant belly against potential stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I used Instanaturals Rosehip Oil mainly on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have many scars from surgeries and more unfortunately, stretch marks.</li>
            <li> main thing to remember about this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of all the oils that I have tried, Rosehip and Argan have given me the most favorable results; however, Argan is substantially more expensive, so for me once again InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil will be used</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that the company is VERY responsive if you have any questions at all, which is nearly unheard of these days and very much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> thing with the rosehip oil is that at first it does have a strong smell to it that takes a little time to get used to.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and makes skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I am not sure yet, if I will purchase more RSO from them, but based on their level of customer care, I will certainly consider it—as long as I continue to stay breakout free.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is also great for my hair I have really damage hair because I use to dye my hair and straighten it all the time I apply a small amount after I shower while my hair is still wet</li>
            <li> But once I learned how to use it without a mess, I love it.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try for free Organic  Rosehip Oil from this company, normally I do not post a review</li>
            <li> so I am excited to see how well it works with a continued long term use.</li>
            <li> This type of oil is supposed to help with scars, sunburns and sun damage, thanks to high levels of vitamins A and C, though I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say for sure</li>
            <li> This is high quality stuff.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it too  </li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave it a five star rating and highly recommend it to everyone even if you don&#x27;t have troublesome</li>
            <li> I highly suggest doing some research into Linoleic vs Oleic acids-</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend both the product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I was using high end moisturizers.</li>
            <li> tried this company because of the Amazon ratings on their oil and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend ordering from this company</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I am also using a vitamin C serum very lightly on my feet as well once a week with salasylic acid to help slough the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for skincare.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Rosehip oil, but not this product.</li>
            <li> I added this to my face oil (avocado and almond oil mixture) and within days it made a huge difference in the dry patches I was having!</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin that reacts to any foreign matter like chemicals, stress etc.  </li>
            <li> This is indeed a very decent and professional seller.</li>
            <li> and I have used the oil on its own and mixed in with my other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I personally add it to my daily moisturizers and use it on a daily basis (many report a dewy glow to the skin right after using it as well as improvement in the tone of the skin).</li>
            <li> Insta natural 100% pure rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> Today want to speak to you about Insta Natural&#x27;s 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> I chose InstaNatural because I read that is was 100% Pure, Natural, Organic, and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> It is a pure and natural moisturizer that leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> Makes my face soft !!</li>
            <li> Need a little more time to see if it will help wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is better to smell a little then to have a &amp;#34;pleasant fragrance&amp;#34; that just breaks you out.</li>
            <li> I will definitely look to your company first!</li>
            <li> The little seal on the bottle declared that it was USDA organic, so I felt confident that it was a quality oil.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it is smell-less, absorbs quickly despite of its oily nature and it moisturizes my skin and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a good size bottle and a little bit of this oil can go a long way.</li>
            <li> I attributed it to the fact that I was getting older and told myself that I just needed to “live with it.”</li>
            <li> so far I really like this rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a firming effect which I can definitely use and it has all the great ingredients:  essential fatty acids, vitamins A and</li>
            <li> I ended up not using this too much because it smelled rancid and old.  </li>
            <li> This is my fav skin care oil so far... very hydrating</li>
            <li> Really makes your skin soft and helps to reduce lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> And you have this amazing product in a huge 4oz bottle which will last you for long and long months considering you are going to only need some 2-3 drops with each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and soothing on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Oil is the real thing with</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling really moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil makes my face feel so smooth and the rough spots I have on my face are disapearing.  </li>
            <li> and so far it is doing VERY well.</li>
            <li> Havent used too much of this product, but it does keep my skin soft and hydrated when i do use it.</li>
            <li> 12 year old&#x27;s skin has really responded to this.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal??</li>
            <li> use it everyday and the scent is lovely</li>
            <li> Rather than use my normal pomade, I&#x27;ve been using 4-5 drops of this rubbed in my plams then run through my hair.</li>
            <li> I think it may be too heavy for oily skin but can&#x27;t say for sure because I don&#x27;t have oily skin.</li>
            <li> However, I received a few more follow-up emails letting me know that their product is satisfaction guaranteed and if there were any questions or problems, to contact them.  </li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize well and sink into (not sit on top of) skin after a few min.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just normal..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it, not routinely, on a few of their suggestions, and each timeI was pleased.</li>
            <li> Forget all the spray on remedies from the local drug store - i have tried them all with zero success.  </li>
            <li> It is too early to say much about the effects, but my skin feels very silky and soft on application.  </li>
            <li> You can mix a few drops into your favorite moisturizer and apply it to your skin that way, to get the added benefits from Rosehip Seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin is more even-toned and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I thought they&#x27;d send fresh oil the second time around.</li>
            <li> Past the natural smell, this oil works great on my baby&#x27;s dry skin</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s a fine</li>
            <li> I love the scent, Plus, always prefer natural organic beauty item since there is less chemicals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfoliates and reduces wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Repairs damaged, dry skin by adding back lost moisture, leaving it looking smoother and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip</li>
            <li> My feet get so dry that sometimes my feet are more hooves than anything human.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.feet get so dry that sometimes my feet are more hooves than anything human.</li>
            <li> I used over my entire face, and it interestingly seemed to moisturize the dry parts and not grease up the oily-ish ones.</li>
            <li> It seems to help keep my hair less crunchy and more soft.  </li>
            <li> have oily and dry skin, especially in morning, my husband even made joke said he can make pancake on my oily morning face:)</li>
            <li> As you may know, if you dry out oily skin - that only triggers it to produce even more oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old female with mild acne and severe acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I have literally tried every single salve, soap, oil and prescription medicine to try to get my skin back and nothing worked better than this.</li>
            <li> bottle of Rosehip Seed oil is $23.95 right now and is regularly priced $49.95</li>
            <li> That right there is the only skin care regimen you&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
            <li> VC20 - Potent 20% Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex! ]].</li>
            <li> So I got some for a friend who had knee surgery and was left with a very large scar.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft and smooth... gets rid of my dry patches!</li>
            <li> I should really refrigerate it, as it is such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> (The familiar scent of roses comes from the petals, but this product is made from the seeds, which is why the scent is not as expected).</li>
            <li> It should be kept in a cool dark place or refrigerated to keep it at its full potential.</li>
            <li> However, I mixed a little of my Ole Heniriksen in with it and it took on a nice citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> So my new nighttime routine is toner, serum, rosehip oil, and then moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am having some surgery this year and was not looking forward to having to live with the scars.</li>
            <li> With new scars I know I will not have to live with these scares forever.</li>
            <li> And who wouldn&#x27;t live that?</li>
            <li> Using this new combo has cleared my face and keeps it well moisturized.</li>
            <li> Although I notice they have updated their bottles, so hopefully the new ones don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> This product is a new one for me.  </li>
            <li> I found my new face and hair oil.</li>
            <li> a decided to try a new brand.</li>
            <li> This is yet another product that didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> The dryness is gone &amp; my face looks so much healthier, younger and vibrant!</li>
            <li> The results may not be instant and noticeable right after the first or second use</li>
            <li> I used it on my face this morning just one drop with my wet freshly clean face</li>
            <li> I have tried many (cheap and expensive) face moisturizers and none work as well as Rosehip oil-there is no stinging like I get with the face moisturizers-------great for my lips too</li>
            <li> added organic  therapeutic grade essential oils to boost its effectiveness and enjoy this product immensely</li>
            <li> Immediately followed with Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum and just one squirt of this Insta Natural Rosehip Oil (which is all you really need for your face).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides uses for pre-aging and moisturizing, it also can be used to minimises the size of pores and helps blemishes to go way quicker giving you smoother-looking even toned skin with a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reason I decided to try Rosehip Seed oil is because of</li>
            <li> I believe the reason is because this Organic Rosehip Oil product in particular, made by InstaNatural is truly all natural and no added fragrances or aroma masking chemicals have been added.</li>
            <li> Oil treatments truly help my dry skin out tremendously.</li>
            <li> You really want to find a high-quailty organic oil, because there are major differences in results.</li>
            <li> I use this for my thick straight long hair to keep my hair shiny and smooth frizz free all the time.</li>
            <li> After using it the skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I have had no issues, no break outs, etc.  </li>
            <li> I use after a I shower and it makes my skin very soft (non ashy) all day.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night, and in the morning my face feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Once using it, the skin become very soft.</li>
            <li> Plus my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> And skin is very soft after the oil soaks in.  </li>
            <li> Since using I have not had one single large cyst or pimple (just little, very easily popable ones).</li>
            <li> is a huge bottle, so I have a dark brown 1 OZ bottle that I fill and keep in my bathroom drawer</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this product!</li>
            <li> So far ecxellent!</li>
            <li> Okay so here is why I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I put a small amount of the rosehip seed oil on top.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and I see the fine lines in my face are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to buy another bottle after this first one.</li>
            <li> and I think the Rosehip oil works just as well, if not better for skin than Argon oil which I think works better on hair.</li>
            <li> Most of the other rosehip oil products on amazon are 2 OZ or smaller</li>
            <li> Will come back in month to give you my experience since this is just my first impression.</li>
            <li> More than twice the size of the usual Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot more than usual because I have a baby in the house and have found my hands are a lot drier these days.  </li>
            <li> Pretty helpful and informative, actually.  </li>
            <li> is my first purchase with this company, but not the last!  </li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice when you open the bottle is that there is no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Facial Oil was pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li> first, their was a definite oil feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to add that I credit this product for making my elbow look and feel soft and normal again.</li>
            <li> Even better, add a bit of MSM.&lt;br /&gt;Slather on clean, dry hair, cover with cap (I use a disposable shower cap and over that a thick stretch headband) and leave on for 5 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It has completely saved my face!</li>
            <li> I have tried many rosehip oil brands in the past like trilogy, sukin, and Aubrey organics and none of them smells close to the way this smells.</li>
            <li> Results (glowing soft skin!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and my wrinkles seem to be getting smoother including my neck!  </li>
            <li> I am completely sold!</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes are not dry and wrinkles are less prominent.</li>
            <li> I found the serum works quickly on newly formed scars but is no slouch with old scars and blemishes either.</li>
            <li> I was sent a new bottle at no charge within two days and kept the old bottle as well.  </li>
            <li> Carrot is pretty expensive, but amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Sinks in quickly and can apply makeup soon after without any issues.</li>
            <li> He was extremely responsive and sent me another bottle right away no questions asked!</li>
            <li> I was down in FL recently and really love how my tummy looks even after just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I read countless reviews and knew it would do something positive, but I truly had no idea</li>
            <li> Will report back in six weeks if results are positive.</li>
            <li> It smells a little odd, and at first it was off putting, but after I saw how amazing my skin looked, I could easily look past the scent.</li>
            <li> I look in the mirror and see the face of a 24 yr old - not a 34 yr old!  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my previous oil absorbed a little better.  </li>
            <li> You could buy a cheaper product or more of a product for less money and get the same effects</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle for this product, which means I WAS satisfied with the previous ones.</li>
            <li> She is Asian, if that is important to anyone reading this, and has dry skin.</li>
            <li> elbow on the left is what I call my computer elbow, and that&#x27;s because it get&#x27;s really dry and often lightly discolored from resting it on my desk with my head propped on my fist palm while I&#x27;m at the computer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it to my neck and shoulders after several hours of harsh sunlight [ahh, the first sunburn of the season..], and it speed-heals my skin- pretty much overnight!</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all on face and my dry skin soaks it right up.</li>
            <li> (especially around the eyes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said it is advised to those who have moderate/severe acne to avoid direct application to trouble areas, but rosehip seed oil has a higher percentage of Linoleic acid  (44%) compared to Oleic acid (14%) which is richer and more likely to cause problems for those with acne.</li>
            <li> I have only been using RSO for going on 3 weeks now, so I am excited to see what the long term effects will be.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this product on scars but it has not shown very profound impact.</li>
            <li> For example the fatty acids, Omega 3,6 and 9 and Vitamin A helps prevent and improve fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> That makes it superior for treating dry skin compared to standard heavy duty lotions.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product as a replacement for a very expensive Rose Hip Oil I was using as part of my face regiment</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but it certainly adds another step to the process of using it.</li>
            <li> Pure Rosehip Seed Oil is a moisturizing product that can be used for a variety of different purposes.  </li>
            <li> The glass bottle is large -- 4 oz. -- and will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> bottle is fairly large and will last you for quite some time.</li>
            <li> For me personally, the pure oil makes me break-out.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a fishy smell due to the presence of omega 3, but the smell dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly if used alone, or you can mix it in with your other skin products.  </li>
            <li> I have no seen a significant decrease in the appeared of some scars left from acne as a teenager, but I have not been using this oil very long.</li>
            <li> oil is super rich and you only need a tiny little bit to completely cover your face, or mix it with your regular lotion if you don&#x27;t like putting the straight oil on.  </li>
            <li> eyes helps keep my eyes clear.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few nights before bed and in the morning the texture of  my skin looks and feels smooth, soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> i apply this on my stretch marks and cheeks since that&#x27;s the most common for my scars so far I see improvement.  </li>
            <li> order however, is clear and lacks any smell.</li>
            <li> and my skin is moisturized and clear.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a slight, it has a tint of orange color, this is like what they clean you with before surgery color</li>
            <li> A few drops on my cuticles , makes the area soft and smooth too.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> I am fairly young</li>
            <li> I find it helps keep my cuticles soft too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Surprised how well this absorbs.  </li>
            <li> Check back in another six weeks,  thanks,</li>
            <li> I remember even from when I was young, my grandmother used it for everything.</li>
            <li> You can apply this oil directly to your skin, either face or body.</li>
            <li> but people think early 50&#x27;s  </li>
            <li> and so far no complaints.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Have only been using 2 weeks, but really seems to be helping my skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and not a greasy as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> but wow.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Does everything I need it to as a moisturizer and the plus is that it&#x27;s totally natural.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t see any results like at all my blemishes are still looking the same ....</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s to early to see results</li>
            <li> if I see any change going on maybe it&#x27;s still to early to see results</li>
            <li> Perhaps, I got an old, rancid bottle.</li>
            <li> Years old and have always bated my hair because it was so</li>
            <li> I am soft from my head to my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My face just loves all of this company&#x27;s all natural skin care products.</li>
            <li> it is old?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, the sizing of this bottle is very generous for the price, the bottle came packaged well and sealed properly.</li>
            <li> makes my skin soft and youthful.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft not oily at all.</li>
            <li> so I was really conscious and even concerned over how it may affect my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and smells in beauty products, so maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to using products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like this product, especially for summer</li>
            <li> With all the natural products that are out there</li>
            <li> /&gt;  diminishes the look of old marks and scars&lt;</li>
            <li> Tried some on a old scar, seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I am not as sensitive to some odors as others</li>
            <li> It’s just that it is a natural product with not added chemical fragrances</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fond of the big bottle because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to run out at a moment&#x27;s notice!</li>
            <li> It feels natural and my skin is responding well to it.</li>
            <li> It worked a thousand year ago and it works now, our skin is made to receive natural oil and not stuff</li>
            <li> My 50 year old skin just loves the InstaNatural line apparently….and</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts….not</li>
            <li> a ONE with this natural line.</li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive skin, so I was hesitant to put oil on my face</li>
            <li> I also found the Insta natural Vitamin C Serum which I use at night and the Rosehip oil in the morning.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> He has been complimenting me on it frequently since I began using it.</li>
            <li> It definitely smells very earthy</li>
            <li> it just smells like a natural oil.</li>
            <li> since I got this product, also I&#x27;m using Insta Natural Vitamin C-Serum and the difference with these two products together</li>
            <li> It is made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> so it works well with my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far their products have lived up to the claims made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But skin is so soft..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too early to know if this will help fade my scars</li>
            <li> So far I like this oil.  </li>
            <li> My skin is really appreciating the extra level of moisture that rosehip oil provides.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several suppliers of organic rosehip oil but the folks at InstaNatural really suprised me with their customer service.</li>
            <li> As far as my stretch marks go I haven&#x27;t noticed a dent</li>
            <li> I have been storing the oil in the fridge and used it twice a day so far</li>
            <li> I use this oil after cleansing and applying the Insta natural vit c serum.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural 100%</li>
            <li> Not the nicest smelling for products I&#x27;ll admit, but that is the nature of buying natural products.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and found using this actually balances my face out as It causes me to excrete oil.</li>
            <li> suffer from psoriasis on my scalp that frequently itches and flakes, which in turn causes soreness.</li>
            <li> This organic rosehip oil is a deep orange oil that can make the face oily looking if too much is applied.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed some fading so far.</li>
            <li> Which a lot of these are non natural products have even with the fragrance piled on.</li>
            <li> Nothing so far</li>
            <li> It is a real winter skin saver when mixed into moisturizers and lotions.</li>
            <li> Of all the oils I&#x27;ve used thus far . . .</li>
            <li> I love that my skin soaks it up and doesn&#x27;t feel the least bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I would caution that my eight year old son thought the smell was horrid</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I now prefer to skip the store brand chemicals and go natural..</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil is exactly as described a fe drops go a long way</li>
            <li> I find I&#x27;m frequently adding it to my lips  thru-out the day.</li>
            <li> My face feels cleaner with out stripping away my natural oils in my face.</li>
            <li> My 50 year old skin loves it too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and has been used for generations</li>
            <li> But I do have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip oil contains over 500 natural ingredients that are beneficial to all kinds of skin.</li>
            <li> Keep it away from direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I did both when I was young .</li>
            <li> a vegan, eat healthy, get plenty of exercise, drink lots of water and get at least 9 hours of sleep every day.  </li>
            <li> so I guess it really wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s an all natural product and</li>
            <li> the smell is natural too - not chemical like.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> must for anyone that likes natural DIY skincare.</li>
            <li> This product, for being all natural, has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I then decided to go all natural with my face care.</li>
            <li> It reinforces to me that forms closest their natural state are best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for several months now and really see no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> natural Acne and Eczema Treatment&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leave for about an hour and then wash thoroughly; the result is soft, revitalized</li>
            <li> natural Acne and Eczema Treatment&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leave for about an hour and then wash thoroughly; the result is soft, revitalized</li>
            <li> Now they are about 60% improved, much softer, and the dryness is starting to go away.</li>
            <li> I no longer feel self conscious when wearing sandals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> woke up with soft non greasy loven it 👍😊</li>
            <li> Organic Rosehip Oil by InstaNatural leaves the skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Insta Natural sent me this product for review purposes.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has not made me have a reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The essential fatty acids in rosehip seed make it one of my favorite carrier oils for hair</li>
            <li> It sets an excellent base before foundation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be like me, and be slow to get on the rosehip band wagon, as the sooner you begin to use it the better off</li>
            <li> She tried this on the scars and it slowly, but surely gets rid of them.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal for the most part, but it can get a little dry in some places, and a tad oily in the T-zone.</li>
            <li> Liberal application of InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil right after a soaking bath has made them so soft and baby pink</li>
            <li> Liberal application of InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil right after a soaking bath has made them so soft and baby pink</li>
            <li> The scent that it has does not last long once this product absorbs, and it absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Whenever I try a new product and it doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin, I go straight to rosehip oil - it seems to have healing properties and calms my skin right down instantly.</li>
            <li> I put the Vit. C on first, let it dry, then put the oil over it.  </li>
            <li> it still over half full.</li>
            <li> Dark glass is imperative as this is an oil that can lose it&#x27;s beneficial properties if not stored correctly, and can also go rancid quickly.</li>
            <li> I suffer from hyper pigmentation on my chin &amp; the dark spots have faded tremendously</li>
            <li> As strong as fish oil pills that I have taken in the past.  </li>
            <li> Instead of leaving my skin soft with a subtle glow, this oil seems oily and just sits on the top.</li>
            <li> I use this when I have dry patches on my face and it has been the only thing that has worked so quickly.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product for the first time, I was a little hesitant/skeptical if it&#x27;d really work.</li>
            <li> People have been using Rosehip oil for a long time back when other products were not available its a fantastic staple to have in your home for so many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell at first is a little unusual, almost like a flax seed smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is naturally rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega 6, 3 and 9) and Vitamin A and C that make it a face, hair, nail and skin restorer.</li>
            <li> Seriously, after one application my hands started to look and feel better.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell, but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> Actually so impressed, that I ridded my medicine cabinet of all the ridiculously expensive skincare items I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Plus, it absorbs quickly while still leaving skin hydrated-looking, so it&#x27;s helped a lot with some slight flaking I had.</li>
            <li> Just keep your bottle refrigerated to make it stay fresh and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using rosehip seed oil for several years particularly on my face.</li>
            <li> When a free sample of this was offered for review purposes, I almost turned it down because I personally do not have a use for it.</li>
            <li> I applied a few pumps after I got out of the shower and when my hair dried it was so soft and smooth !!</li>
            <li> Not only is the product highly recommended, so is the seller.</li>
            <li> I have middle age skin and suffer from all the skin issues that come from that, not to mention living in the high altitude and desert of NM.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for this problem and actually like the smell.</li>
            <li> This oil is super rich and you only need a tiny little bit and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This particular brand is different from other rose hip seed oil I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> This oil has helped my skin feel softer and younger and the fine lines around my face seem a little softer as well.</li>
            <li> Finally, I finish up with my moisturizer with a little finely ground L Ascorbic Acid &amp; then eye cream.</li>
            <li> My feet have been staying smooth and none of the usual drying and cracking I have been fighting.</li>
            <li> I am soon to be 34 yrs old, and while I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, per se, I do have the beginnings of fine lines and just generally dull skin.  </li>
            <li> I applied it to my entire scalp each night, let it sit for about 5 minutes and then went forward with normal hair washing.</li>
            <li> The oil delivers almost EXACTLY what I expected it to</li>
            <li> It works well, just different from my normal supplier.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This amazing oil is USDA Certified Pure, Organic, Unrefined, Cold pressed Rosehip Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad because it was a large bottle at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I expected it not to smell like perfume has been added because it clearly states pure, unrefined organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very cautious with new products, I start once every other day</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry due to weather, this made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Initially the fragrance of this oil is earthy but fragrance quickly disappears, as other users have noted.  </li>
            <li> Next, I pumped the oil into my palms, I noticed the color was very different to every other rosehip seed oil I&#x27;ve tried - it was brown, rather than light yellow/orange.</li>
            <li> My bottle had a faulty pump, so I emailed the company, and they had a new bottle in my hands the next day (which was a Sunday.)</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s dark spots is already fading and my complexion is not dull anymore!!!</li>
            <li> I tried 2-3 drops (may have been too much) rubbed on my hands and into my dry hair - being a rainy day</li>
            <li> My skin is much less dry and is much more supple and that is after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Works very well to reduce dry skin and lines.</li>
            <li> I grabbed a dry facecloth, applied the oil and began to gently wipe my face.</li>
            <li> I poured the oil very sparingly around my dry hair and scalp and thoroughly massaged my head for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one leaves less greasy residue on my skin as if it is absorbed immediately.  </li>
            <li> My hands get super dry and cracked during dry weather and it has helped my hands.</li>
            <li> but fortunately it doesn&#x27;t last but a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Luckily the scent dissipates within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Saving the best for last, is the results I had putting it that on an annoying skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> My skin has not only cleared up from the nagging blemishes, irritations and &amp;#34;crankiness&amp;#34;, but it has smoothed out in texture, tone and is really very soft now.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly the same as the red raspberry seed oil I purchased at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have seen a major improvement.</li>
            <li> This product (and other rosehip oil products) have done so much for my skin!</li>
            <li> Four ounces may not sound like much, but it’s actually quite a large size when it comes to something like rosehip seed oil, which tends to come in smaller packages for high prices.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply this oil to my trouble areas on the sides of my forehead, but I&#x27;ve been applying it to minor trouble areas on the sides of my cheeks (note: MINOR) and haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts.</li>
            <li> face and neck seem to be tighter and my freckles brought on naturally but way extremely with sun exposure are fading fast and</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil comes in a long lasting, dark, glass bottle with an easy to use pump.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip seed oil is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s too oily for under makeup, unless you have very dry skin that will absorb this fast.</li>
            <li> The areas around my cuticles get VERY dry - so much so that I have hang nails all the time</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s absorbed so after a little while my skin no longer feels oily from the product.</li>
            <li> The oil is light and it hardly has any scent to it.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain in general about the smell of rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> This is an issue with rosehips products in general, but I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;love\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It has cleared up her facial complexion and now her face is clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts, but I notice my pimples clear faster, and my overall skin tone has improved.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and will last a long time...</li>
            <li> glass is the ONLY way to store this oil, and I have seen brands in clear glass as well as the dreaded plastic.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is barely there.</li>
            <li> Plus, it’s all natural, has only one ingredient</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 2 months and my 10-year old stretch marks are 70% gone</li>
            <li> Organic, natural beauty products that actually work?</li>
            <li> Barely touched my cream since I got the oil.</li>
            <li> I first started using rosehip seed oil to combat the dark circles/bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> She barely had to trim my cuticles, which helps protect my nails.  </li>
            <li> I am  58 years old and have finally found something that will moisturize without clogging my pores and causing problems.</li>
            <li> The skin is already shiny and pink and well on its way to healing thanks to this oil.</li>
            <li> and it left me completely breathless</li>
            <li> I have barely used any of it</li>
            <li> Now that my initial testing period for review is over I might swap to using it on my hands to keep them looking young because I did like it in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> My stretch marks and dark spot on my face have really lightened up!  </li>
            <li> I was recently diagnosed with allergies to multiple preservatives which are commonly used in most products put on our bodies - from toothpaste to body lotions to laundry detergents,</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try Insta Natural’s Rosehip Seed Oil and one thing that I can tell you about this miracle oil</li>
            <li> I have spent SOOOOOOO much money on beauty products, and I sorta</li>
            <li> I developed rosacea last year and have been battling it since.</li>
            <li> keep recommending this product to friends because it&#x27;s the only all natural product that&#x27;s ever helpe my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> My deep forehead wrinkles are almost completely gone and my skin looks brighter and smoother than it has in years.</li>
            <li> Rosehip Seed Oil is 100% organic and cold pressed and is supposed to help reduce the appearance of scars, acne and stretch marks and is a good all around moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that it was packaged in a glass bottle, since I am am wary of the BPA in plastics.</li>
            <li> I break out from thick moisturizers and sometimes so called light ones, but not this.</li>
            <li> growth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to share my recipe for an overnight hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Start with a few tablespoons of avocado oil or mashed fresh avocado, add a tablespoon each of jojoba oil and rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> but it goes away within a few minutes once it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li> Be advised that it has a small odor to it, it&#x27;s not a bad odor, but smells a bit like cooking oil.  </li>
            <li> hip oil is high in Omegas and helps with aging and dry skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this seed oil if you have dry flaky skin like</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve been getting older, I &#x27;ve found that I have to be very careful with what kinds of face products I use, as my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had extremely dry skin since starting menopause and this has really boosted the moisture level of my skin.</li>
            <li> I only use this oil at night after I wash my face very well, I don&#x27;t dry my face, and put 2 drapes</li>
            <li> Now even without moisturizer my heels look normal without that dry cast.</li>
            <li> I have tried other oils in the past and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It dissipates after a few minutes and what is left is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> bottle is huge and a little goes a long way so it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Take a few drops of Insta Natural 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil on to the tips of your fingers.</li>
            <li> I made a gentle face oil for a friend that has a little acne problem and so far it&#x27;s been helping.  </li>
            <li> The rosehip oil is in a spray bottle - so much easier to use as opposed to other products that you have to shake and shake to get out the oil.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the dropper that a lot of the other products come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stuff (other brands included) have really really impacted my skin.</li>
            <li> I change brand often because it is hard to find always the same available.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not being over dramatic for the sake of an interesting review..</li>
            <li> This oil is actually harvested from the tiny rosehip seeds collected on budding.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin please be cautious and test small areas first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge and when so little product goes such as long way, this bottle will last for months.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the sun has really done a number on my face over the last few years.</li>
            <li> When I first used the oil, I was a little overwhelmed by the smell.</li>
            <li> The oil seems a little different, perhaps a little more greasy than what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> You get a huge bottle that will last a long time since you only need a few drops at a time</li>
            <li> I have also read up on rosehip oil and have found again, that this oil is what should be expected of high quality rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin is very delicate and should be taken care of properly with the proper products for your skin type :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few weeks bring in a whole new younger looking beauty!</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks and am currently 13 weeks pregnant and just starting to get bigger.</li>
            <li> Also, it is very refreshing to put this oil on when it is cold.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about the oil other than its benefits and its relatively short shelf-life, 2)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about ingredients that can&#x27;t be pronounced or anything other than all natural oils with a natural scent.</li>
            <li> I use this at night mainly because of the smell- both products smell very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; which is a hard smell for me to get used to.</li>
            <li> I was a tiny bit disappointed with this, it smells much more herbal and is more greasy than other oils I have used.</li>
            <li> Also, adding a few drops to a hot bath is recommended.</li>
            <li> first of all the oil has a rancid smell (like fish) but that&#x27;s because it has omega fatty acids</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is oily when first applied, it soaks in well after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I also had a few days of hardly any sleep, and this oil really did work amazingly to hide those dark circles!</li>
            <li> If you have tough skin with dark spots , this oil is perfect for you as it smoothed your skin tone as well as your dark spots!!!!</li>
            <li> specific bottle of InstaNatural Rosehip oil is all organic, and it should last you a couple of months due to its large size.</li>
            <li> Nourishing oil for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is rich in the essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (or omega-6), as well as linoleic acid (or omega-3).  </li>
            <li> Nourishing oil for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is rich in the essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (or omega-6), as well as linoleic acid (or omega-3).  </li>
            <li> Smells a bit odd, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference with the look of my skin after first few applications but it does seem to leave it feeling softer and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.</li>
            <li> Lately, it&#x27;s been hot and dry where I live and my skin gets super dried out, especially on my legs, but my face needs extra hydration too-so I don&#x27;t get wrinkled up like a prune.</li>
            <li> (not sure if I spelled it right)</li>
            <li> I add a small amount of tea tree oil in about a 1/4 ratio to this, with or without a carrier oil, and apply it right after washing my face.</li>
            <li> have very long natural unmanageable hair that is always freest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I like what it&#x27;s done for my dry skin so far.</li>
            <li> My gildfriend has less than 2 weeks using it in her face,  and has really shown a noticeable change.</li>
            <li> The redness has completely diminished, and the dry patches of skin are about 80% gone.</li>
            <li> After having the opportunity to try the Insta Natural Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, much to my surprise, after only a few weeks, I began to notice my facial pores getting smaller</li>
            <li> It prevents signs of aging (no, it doesn&#x27;t prevent you from actually aging;)) and helps those of us with an uneven skin</li>
            <li> Also, in the hot summer months, I don&#x27;t want to use a facial moisturizer that&#x27;s heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> The oil has a thin texture and absorbs to the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I think that you can find Rosehip oil for a cheaper price, but I really wanted something in a glass bottle that I could reuse for homemade skincare that included essential oils (which eventually break down plastic)</li>
            <li> And I also started recently using it for other parts of my body, in particular my feet and hands.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first because of it&#x27;s unusual natural aroma and amber color.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Rosehip oil and for only just those few nights am amazed at the almost instant results!  </li>
            <li> Since starting to use this oil I have noticed that the dry skin is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have found an unrefined version that isnt diluted, it helps alot with tough to fix dry areas, such as the elbows and knuckles&lt;</li>
            <li> This has helped lubricate my face enough that I am able to continue an aggressive procedure a few minutes longer without the previous irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and chemical color treated hair and my final test was using Rosehip Oil as a deep conditioning hair remedy.  </li>
            <li> I’m definitely going to come back again to them to make another purchase and would highly recommend them to all other buyers.</li>
            <li> I had never previously used a oil on these dry spots (why I don&#x27;t even know).</li>
            <li> I must first say that this oil is a big bottle and a little goes a loooong way!</li>
            <li> and it is absorbed completely and the smell lasts a few seconds, it is not unpleasant dont get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> But I find it less useful to me than a number of the other products that InstaNatural markets.  </li>
            <li> This oil is good only smells bad.</li>
            <li> After using this oil on my face for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how soft my face is and how clear my complexion seems to be.  </li>
            <li> Left our thick hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It has helped my dry skin as no other product has and</li>
            <li> No more dry and rough patches, just smooth,</li>
            <li> This oil sinks right into the skin and leaves my face, hands and hair feeling moisturized without feeling heavy with grease.  </li>
            <li> I get dandruff really bad mainly due to the drying out of my scalp and this product is great for that.</li>
            <li> It was very thin and laid on top the skin</li>
            <li> I am over 40 and live in a very dry climate where we also heat with wood so the air is very dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to &#x27;go organic&#x27; with at least some of my skin care products (since so many of them are uber scientific, and that&#x27;s a lotta science battling around for a small bit of facial skin.)</li>
            <li> She has scars from old bites from ants and other bugs.</li>
            <li> Normally without moisturizing my heels are dry and not pretty.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry facial skin and even have to apply moisture in the  afternoon, but since using this, I have only had to apply my regular moisturizer once in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Only didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the box was wet when arrived from an apparent leak, yet I couldn&#x27;t find where the leak came from.</li>
            <li> When applied, it sort of sinks right into the skin without leaving a slick surface.  </li>
            <li> ; yes, it&#x27;s earthy but it dissipates FAST and the smell out weighs the help I get HANDS DOWN!!  </li>
            <li> it was clear and risehip seed oil is dark</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it</li>
            <li> This is the first negative review I have ever posted on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The price per ounce is much lower than the fancy moisturizers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have even taken small drops and rubbed them into my scalp to stop the itching and it really does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product made any real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It DOES however have a very earthy smell which some people might find a bit strong-I just added a few drops of lavender EO and that took care of that!  </li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming, just gentle and earthy.</li>
            <li> It has not been long enough of a time in using the product.  </li>
            <li> not used long enough to say</li>
            <li> What I like, too, is how long this is going to last.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see any benefits but it does feel oily on my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe the heat of the summer affected it during shipping or the parcel service left it in their truck too long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting down a natural ingredient before the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil is very delicate and the scent, which smells like mild fish oil, disappear soon after applying to the to the skin.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin, monthly breakouts, dark circles under eyes and brow furrow all show marked improvement after less than a month of use.</li>
            <li> I have not had one day of dry skin since starting this product and it last all day long.  </li>
            <li> this will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of picking at my face, but since I started using the rosehip oil, I have been trying to be more conscious of not doing so.</li>
            <li> As noted in my previous review, this should have an earthy, nutty natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> Since having my last baby a year ago I have dry skin patches on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry with some red spots.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned my face, and rubbed someinto my dry spots and my forehead and cheeks where the slightest of lines are starting to appear.</li>
            <li> cuticles have been really dry recently.</li>
            <li> My elbows used to be red, dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> According to her, this oil is the secret behind her gorgeous glow.&lt;br /&gt;After browsing the web</li>
            <li> I mean within 3 days I was really seeing a big improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to try Rosehip oil right after I read about its use by the former Victoria’s Secret model Miranda Kerr.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil instantly relieves dry skin and leaves skin hydrated for a long time.</li>
            <li> A little bit does go a long way and it does make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that the old saying, &amp;#34;A little bit goes a long way,&amp;#34; applies to this product.  </li>
            <li> and i immediately opened it up to smell it because so many reviews said it stinks like fish</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel guilty about putting it anywhere on my body because it is free of chemicals .</li>
            <li> I love the product and even though I do not like winter and the cold weather, I will look forward to the products performance on my skin this winter.  </li>
            <li> Any unadulterated oil can go rancid, but rosehip seed is particularly vulnerable.</li>
            <li> only issue is the malodorous fishy smell, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for this organic, natural goodness in a bottle.</li>
            <li> My routine is I apply Insta Natural Facial Cleanser to my face with a cotton pad using small upward circles.  </li>
            <li> E naturally, not manufactured and added.  </li>
            <li> I’ve been using RSO for a few years, and I swear by it (smoother feeling skin, appearance of old acne scars diminishing, non-greasy, fast-absorbing).</li>
            <li> lasts long.</li>
            <li> and my youngest literally stretched my tummy out beyond recognition.</li>
            <li> but that was a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I also haven&#x27;t been using it that long...</li>
            <li> Plus I think it is harder to notice differences on your self when you stare at yourself in the mirror several times a day every day.</li>
            <li> so I can use it in the mornings under my makeup without having to wait a long time for it to absorb.  </li>
            <li> I use this product at night after I step out of the shower, to take care of minor nicks and scars on my legs from shaving and to help with any discoloration I have all over my face and body.</li>
            <li> I feel it has helped improve some minor acne issues as well.  </li>
            <li> The biggest improvement I noticed was that the rough skin on my legs shows noticeable improvement after I started using the rosehip oil with my regular lotion.  </li>
            <li> However, I truly don&#x27;t care about the smell of a product as long as it works well.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my girl who had broke out on her face, she loves it very and cleared up her face in a few days, only had to use a few drops</li>
            <li> Besides the fatty acid content, rosehip seed oil also has natural vitamin A.</li>
            <li> She mixes a few drops in with her facial moisturizer (Juice Beauty,) as well as applying a few drops out of the shower to whole body.</li>
            <li> and I would take long walks, picking rosehips as we went and often eating them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> I know the zit would leave a scar because it&#x27;d been on my face for so long, but this oil helped to reduce the damage.</li>
            <li> I am just waiting to see what happens after a long while of use.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the fragrance would be overly floral and cause sinus issues, but it instead smells very mildly of a cooking oil similar to sunflower.  </li>
            <li> its less expensive and the quality of the product is much better.</li>
            <li> However, the third bottle is different from the previous two ones.</li>
            <li> I only counted 5 hairs that came out in this wash, which is much less than when I rinse out after using commercial brand conditioners.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my skin feels soothed and the redness has been less apparent.  </li>
            <li> I have been using other brands of rosehip oil for a long time to go under my facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s purity is obvious &amp; it blends well with the other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> am going to give it a try,will blend with some other essential oils to cover the funky smell,it kinda smells like&lt;br /&gt;castor oil,but they both say 100% pure/natural unrefined,so I assume they did not use another carrier oil.</li>
            <li> the other product was organic HDPE Shea Butter by Essential Depot which i ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Unlike other oils I have used this is the only one that didn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> but this one should last awhile due to its 4 oz.</li>
            <li> My skin looks hydrated all day long!  </li>
            <li> it came to my Rosehip Oil, while the bottle gave possible uses, I was wanting to see what other people used it as.</li>
            <li> I had been ordering Rosehip Seed Oil from a different vendor but decided, mostly due to cost, to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip oil helps with dandruff and other similar scalp conditions.  </li>

            <li> I use it &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; or mixed into my other lotions or creams.</li>

            <li> I have been using it on my scalp to help with extremely dry conditions.</li>
            <li> I used this for dry skin, and dandruff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great to find a company that isn&#x27;t trying to cheat its customers by charging outrageous prices for tiny bottles of product.  </li>
            <li> This oil is saving my face from the dry desert air.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using this oil all over my body and not a piece of dry skin in sight.</li>
            <li> But because this is a drying oil I feel like I have to apply it twice a day to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I found that if I put it on after my shower, by the time I was dry and my hair was dry, so was my face.  </li>
            <li> ,I have cracky dry feet, I have dry flaky elbows and cheeks(Yes!!horrible)</li>
            <li> You can use this all over and would recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it for use on my face as it was so dry</li>
            <li> They are still dry in some places, but I&#x27;ve had no cracking or bleeding.</li>

            <li> Apply Rosehip oil to dry and cracked skin to nourish and rehydrate it.  </li>
            <li> Dry hair</li>
            <li> I began using this the day it arrived on these dry spots.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this in winter when your skin gets really dry.</li>
            <li> They can be dry and itchy at times.  </li>
            <li> That is because it is a &#x27;dry&#x27; oil.  </li>
            <li> I just received the product and so far I noticed a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I only use at night and only use a few drops.</li>
            <li> The thin skin near my ankle seems healthier and soft as well.</li>
            <li> While there are some lingering breakouts, there have been no new ones.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re having a limited time sale on this bc</li>
            <li> The label clearly states in the ingredient list that the only ingredient is 100% pure &amp; cold pressed rosehip seed oil (certified organic).  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, a little will go a LONG way and it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This ends my review for Insta Natural Rosehip Oil, but if you would like to continue reading, I have done a little research of the benefits of the oil, along with a few different ways in which Rosehip Oil is utilized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s done anything for my stretch marks, it might have made a small scar of mine less noticeable, and I haven&#x27;t seen any appreciable change in either my hair or nails after using this product.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots have definitely lightened since using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in some dark spots that I have on my face.</li>
            <li> Happy---outstanding product and this bottle will last a long time since you only need a small amount for face coverage.</li>
            <li> I mix a very small amount of this ( the bottle should last a long time as it only takes a couple drops each use) with this same company&#x27;s vitamin C oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing, a little bit goes a long way, so it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Therefore, I made the decision to change, no more chemical laden products, and I discovered the natural world of oils.  </li>
            <li> know a good oil when I use one, and I should know because if a lotion or a oil contains some other chemical crap, my face will start to irritate and feel itchy</li>
            <li> This bottle of oil will last a LONG time -- each little drop of oil goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> My heels especially have a noticeable change and less dry.</li>
            <li> My only down side to this oil is that it kinda smells like vegetable oil but using either my bath and body works lotion or johnson and johnson&#x27;s baby oil covers up the smell of the oil.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this bottle will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural bottle is a thick, dark glass that feels of very high quality.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been using two new products.</li>
            <li> Addi it to your hair conditioner for dry scalp!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others used it on their babies, for dry patches of skin, and even cradle cap!</li>
            <li> They even sent me an extra oil since the one I had lacked that &#x27;slightly&#x27; fishy smell.  </li>
            <li> on you face and body it only takes a small amour to get big results.</li>
            <li> Looks and smells different from a previous brand of rosehip oil I had.</li>
            <li> (other products often have other things mixed in which agitate my skin).  </li>
            <li> Not really what it was intended for, but my scalp is so dry and itchy</li>
            <li> may not like the smell, but I find it smells only slightly fishy</li>
            <li> This product is better than any of the expensive, chemical laden products that I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> skin&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for dry, rough skin&lt;</li>
            <li> On the heels of my feet, they used to be rough, and dry.</li>
            <li> I don’t know, but it is and as much as I wish time would slow down just a bit</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;Right away it makes dull dry skin so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry during the winter</li>
            <li> I also use it on my very dry and unruly hair in between using the Argan Oil Hair Mask.  </li>
            <li> Do you think I used too much (therefore bringing out this normal note that I simply hadn&#x27;t noticed before) or has the oil gone bad?</li>
            <li> (they are dumb and don&#x27;t know much about this</li>
            <li> Again, this is another product that is very inexpensive compared to your usually beauty products, and will last you at least twice as long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have weird patches of dry skin on my face and after just a few applications of the Rosehip oil, I saw HUGE differences in my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 53 and have little moisture left in my hands since they are always in water.</li>
            <li> I have seen a little bit of improvement with my acne scars after only a week</li>
            <li> Spray a little Rosehip oil mixed with water on your skin to rehydrate and lock in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spray a little Rosehip oil mixed with water on your skin to rehydrate and lock in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tough hands and do very rugged hands on work</li>
            <li> After applying it to my face, sometimes I have a very small amount left on my hands, so I have rubbed it into my hair and it leaves my hair soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> essential fatty acids found in rosehip seed oil work for dry scalp and itchiness due to stress and chemicals in shampoo</li>
            <li> essential fatty acids found in rosehip seed oil work for dry scalp and itchiness due to stress and chemicals in shampoo</li>
            <li> which isn&#x27;t a bad thing, just more beauty time I need to squeeze in.  </li>
            <li> The product is cold pressed, fast&lt;br /&gt;absorbing and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Between the Rosehip Oil softening my cuticles, making my hands look great, but it also tastes bad!!</li>
            <li> I had zero negative experiences with this, but then, as I said, my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive.  </li>
            <li> While Rosehip oil I have bought elsewhere (Whole Foods) has vastly improved my complexion, this product was useless.  </li>
            <li> I used it for about 2 weeks on my face and hands, but it does not moisturize well as I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for work, on tons of airplanes and sleep in varied temp world wide</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference in my scarring and sun spots in just the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using the product.  </li>
            <li> I started breaking out in the cystic fashion I had spent months clearing.</li>
            <li> I suffer from melasma and have gotten lots of laser procedures to even out the brown areas and have spent a ton of money doing so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a minimal odor and contrary to what you might think, does not smell like roses at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED, WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I use only a few drops, absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> Only need a few drops and it is not greasy or oily at all.</li>
            <li> Even after just a few days of using this product I can see a difference in my facial tone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on rough patches, like my elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> but ive only been using it for a few weeks,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, I received the bottle in a dented, scuffed up box, which I thought nothing of - perhaps just a rough postal journey.</li>
            <li> I massaged the the head with oil and then combed the hair and left it for few hours before shampooing the hair.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This size bottle will last quite awhile, as I just use a few drops at a time.  </li>
            <li> Also, Instanaturals, the company that distributes this through Amazon, really stands behind their product, and are a pleasure to do business with.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a few drops of Vitamin C serum and use it all over my entire body after my bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and for reasons unknown, although it said it has been shipped, I never received it upon which Amazon issued me a refund.  </li>
            <li> All the rough spots are disappearing.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> , I took my cotton hair turban; I wet it, squeezed out the excess water, heated it in the microwave for 15 seconds, put it over my head tucking my hair up and inside, and then waited an hour.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply a few drops of the oil and dab the affected areas several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Apply a few drops of the oil and dab the affected areas several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> If you are curious....</li>
            <li> I have not really had any wrinkle</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s decreased wrinkles around the eye area but not the nasolabial folds or the deep groves by my mouth.</li>
            <li> but it smelt almost fishy, which I am not sure if that is normal but goes away after a few minutes after I apply it.</li>
            <li> If you eat greasy foods all the time, or hate vegetables or just don&#x27;t get enough sleep--this oil is not going magically get rid of acne/wrinkles/etc.</li>
            <li> Tried everything short of accutane; I&#x27;ve megadosed on vitamins and killed my hair, spent thousands on all kinds of products..</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a very long way; just a few drops is enough to cover my entire face, the coverage is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I poured some out to a smaller dark glass pump bottle (from a previous purchase of a different brand) and have to say that I don&#x27;t see a quality difference even after traveling with it for a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> use very little, and only on the areas that are dry and patchy.</li>
            <li> The 3rd time, however, I noticed a slight sour smell - like stomach bile - that put me off.</li>
            <li> Also, the redness of my face has completely subsided and you can see your face heal itself from any irritation it may have had in the past!</li>
            <li> how old it was, and 3) I&#x27;ve read that when some other oils smell sour or fishy they are usually considered rancid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a strong, somewhat unpleasant smell, but it goes away after it all absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> I started using it on my stretchmarks and my dark dry elbows.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a few other products I will try still, but I think this one is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li> I also used it on a scar and my scar is less raised and less red</li>
            <li> I use).I suppose the reason I used less of the other was the price, so maybe this wouldn’t be an issue in the long run; however, I started to break out.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;To reinvigorate hair and put the shine back, massage in slightly warmed up Rosehip oil before you wash your hair and it will bring back the shine to permed, colored, or dull hair.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;To reinvigorate hair and put the shine back, massage in slightly warmed up Rosehip oil before you wash your hair and it will bring back the shine to permed, colored, or dull hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle looks small in the picture, but when I received the package, it is a lot bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> and I also use it as a make up primer because it goes on so smoothly and soaks into the skin so quickly, no more expensive make up primers!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m probably just really naive in terms of facial care, but the idea of applying oil to my face  seemed a bit strange.</li>
            <li> after a very long and harsh winter in the midwest, my skin was very dry</li>
            <li> I started using the rosehip oil on it and it takes down the inflammation almost instantly and after a few weeks it has treated it as well as the steroid.</li>
            <li> A little (just 3-4 drops) goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This is an oil, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You DO NOT need alot of this oil at all for it to work, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and less likely to spill, expose to the air, or waste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use makeup other than mascara  </li>
            <li> I have ditched all other moisturizers for this oil and my skin has never looked better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now summer is coming around and not sure how this will effect my skins reaction, but I expect to keep this as a part of my daily night routine.</li>
            <li> So, I dumped in out and cleaned the bottle which I will use for mixing other oils.  </li>
            <li> RSO does have a stronger odor than the other I was using, but to me this indicated that it was fresher.</li>
            <li> I bought other products from them, like argan oil, eyes gel, Scar gel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an oil, and of course those of us with some acne prone skin (that I&#x27;ve now found to be from the chemicals in other products) get nervous - trust me, don&#x27;t be nervous.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to add to other ingredients for a face oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than other oils</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite behave like any other oil I have used.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to finding other ways to use this.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for a review.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is possible..</li>
            <li> I have tried other things with no results.  </li>
            <li> they have other oils too</li>
            <li> this product due to the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews</li>
            <li> I also use InstaNatural&#x27;s other products as well for the face, including their eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I like the product and recommend sticking it in your fridge for additional preservation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it due to the smell.</li>
            <li> In the past I used only oil-free moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I like to blend 2 pumps of oil to my moisturizer daily- for those who can&#x27;t get past the smell</li>
            <li> No more red rashy spots.</li>
            <li> I am still trying it on some other scars, and would update my review if It shows results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will reuse it for other oils or tinctures when I have used up the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Also, didn&#x27;t soften my skin as well as other ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> It looks like this is a question that has come up with other buyers.</li>
            <li> In addition to this, the other product I use almost every night is &amp;#34;Acne Stop&amp;#34; (a toner) which I also bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> Knowing this, I wanted to try other products from the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Organic Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> For the past two months I&#x27;ve been using a mixture of this oil along with Moroccan argon oil from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s less oily,  less breakouts, and the dicoloration from previous zits is starting to fade!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It’s also found in a variety of other beauty</li>
            <li> I also use it every other night as a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have acne that I control with other products and this has not caused any breakouts, which I see immediately if a product won&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> and I no longer have to use other styling products.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about oil.</li>
            <li> I use it alone or combine it with other oils.</li>
            <li> No more oily then dry, oily and dry.</li>
            <li> I mix this with pure organic unrefined extra virgin cold pressed pomegranate oil.</li>
            <li> I have had pretty bad cystic acne for several years due to the stress of grad school/working life and lack of sleep, and I had been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap to wash my face and almond oil as moisturizer for a few months prior to purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Terrific product, makes a difference after very few days.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this along with a few drops of other oils as a night time moisturizer several times per week.</li>
            <li> it smelled slightly of roses and oil, as I fully expected- not rancid (thankfully).</li>
            <li> Using the above regiment, my face had calmed itself but left behind scars that I wanted to get rid of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil is recommended for aging, sun-damaged, dry, flaky, uneven, pigmented skin.</li>
            <li> I deal with dry skin all year round.</li>
            <li> After my shower I dry my face and neck and rub a few drops in.</li>
            <li> My acne scars, dark spots, and breakouts (from trying a million other products that just irritated my skin) are vanishing.</li>
            <li> From other reviews I have read, it appears people who have used this product for a while saw scars and dark marks diminish</li>
            <li> I cannot pronounce that come in conventional moisturizers.</li>
            <li> My oil leaked inside the box, half the bottle was empty!</li>
            <li> husband used the oil for both a recent scar from a cut requiring an ER visit and on his cracked hands after a hard day working on a landscaping project.</li>
            <li> you use this remember that a very little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> and it left my arm smooth and hydrated and got rid of all those annoying little bumps.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rosehip Oil for the past few months, and it does make a difference in the overall complexion of your skin and skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I never even complained and they wanted me to have the freshest batch and voluntarily sent me an extra bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it did eliminate my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am not sensitive to smells usually and</li>
            <li> Dark spots lighter.</li>
            <li> Tell you what real oil is like and then send you fake.</li>
            <li> vitamin C is used to hydrate the skin and hoping to lighten the dark patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help with wrinkles, dark spots, and rosacea.  </li>
            <li> My skin does appear to be smoothing out and the dark spots already appear to be getting lighter.  </li>
            <li> Quality rosehip oil should be a dark amber color (like this one is) and not watery (this one is not watery at all).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the pump does not work.  </li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The only negative I had was with one of the bottles I ordered (it broke during shipment)</li>
            <li> I chose this oil because of the pump dispenser, its USDA Organic certification and the dark amber</li>
            <li> Rosehip Seed Oil Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduces appearance of stretch marks, dark spots, scars</li>
            <li> I am hoping to see some lightening of my dark spots to my face over time.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the hassle of returning it</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier, wrinkle are disappearing, scars are disappearing, dark circle are disappearing.</li>
            <li> It does have unpleasant odor, but it is not bad.</li>
            <li> i had some dark  spots on my chest  and its gone after applying the rosehip oil</li>
            <li> and I have noticed my 51 year old skin doesn’t look as “crepey” and thin.  </li>
            <li> a moisturizer I did like it a lot for the scars and my poor marked up belly</li>
            <li> If the smell is what is most problematic, there are workarounds to make it less annoying.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I have to drop the star rating down from a 3-star to a 1-star.  </li>
            <li> It can also be used on the hair and might be preferred if Argan or emu oils weigh down your hair too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would also suggest taking the oil down to the neck &amp; décolletage.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil did NOT weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> apply a small amount to my legs, which tend to be really dry after the winter season.</li>
            <li> The dark spots in my hands are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see how it does through winter as I usually have a lot of itching with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic results as far as diminishing dark spots etc.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t listen to the clueless reviewers saying that it&#x27;s wasted or expire due to the smell</li>
            <li> A very little of this oil goes a long way, I shall continue to use this oil and will write another review in few months time for an update.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, not greasy.</li>
            <li> They are less reddened and all around less noticeable.</li>
            <li> There is a slight odor to this oil, but within seconds it disipates and you will not even notice it.</li>
            <li> These included an amber color and slight odor.</li>
            <li> I also noticed less itchiness on my scalp when I used this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, but this product has helped moisturize my dry post-menopausal skin!</li>
            <li> i usually don&#x27;t use two products around the same time i usually like to try them out by themselves</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a slight nutty or seedy smell which reminds me of the smell of grapes.  </li>
            <li> I have a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and without makeup I have smoother skin with less clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I would recommend storing half in the refrigerator, as this oil can become rancid.</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell, which may be a turn off to some users.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil also has a slight earthy scent.  </li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged and in a timely manner...had a slightly &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; aroma that I wondered about.</li>
            <li> While there is no floral scent, there is a slight fishy scent.</li>
            <li> Mine did have a slight fishy smell (which subsided after application</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s oily or is slightly smelly because I bought it to try to lighten my age spots.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be SLIGHTLY orange as stated.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and have experiened less breakouts.</li>
            <li> having a pump dispenser there is less opportunity for contamination from your hands/</li>
            <li> was much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using it for several weeks on her C-Section scar, an old chicken pox scar as well as her finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my moisturizer for my face and just use it  plain on other areas that need hydrating without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe it is either FAKE or highly DILUTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I add a little lemon oil to cut down on the vitamin e smell.</li>
            <li> are a mess.</li>
            <li> the color is yellow and smell not good.</li>
            <li> be curious no more.</li>
            <li> Upon opening ,I dropped a little onto my fingertips to smell the slightly nutty smell .</li>
            <li> I needed to add I&#x27;ve been using my rosehip for maybe a little less</li>
            <li> I also apply a few squirts of this to my body to moisten my skin, followed by baby oil to cut the smell of this oil down.</li>
            <li> always close tightly after every use&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i can accurately evaluate the results, but i became impatient :-(</li>
            <li> That is exactly what I wanted because I hate the red look of them.</li>
            <li> There is a slight earthy smell as soon as you put it on, but in a few minutes it disappears.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if it smells weird because it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was too late to return it by the time I used up the last of my other RSO, it was outside the return window for this.</li>
            <li> This on has  is a little  nut smell.</li>
            <li> Being an oil it took me a few times to learn how to use it without making a mess.</li>
            <li> If you want to know a little trick which I do to help with the smell (which isnt overbearing)</li>
            <li> It took a little bit to notice any changes—maybe a week or two—but I think it was my skin adjusting to it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> I also put a little in my aloe vera gel that I make along with vitamin e and the cleansing face oil they have</li>
            <li> Has a little of that &amp;#34;old oil&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> All it does is clog my pores and leave me with little pimples all over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while now and have noticed my skin improving.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the subtle &#x27;fishy&#x27; smell which lingers for not too long.  </li>
            <li> My feeling is that because this is a pure cold pressed oil my skin knows what to do with it.</li>
            <li> it smells a little like green tea.</li>
            <li> but this is a down fall!</li>
            <li> I was horrified when I first received it, not having anticipated just how pungent and unpleasant it would be.</li>
            <li> , my pimples are going away,the oil absorbs quickly,and the areas in which I apply the oil to feels relaxing and sort of like this cold gentle breeze (don&#x27;t know how to explain it</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to the smell of the oil, but I don&#x27;t even notice it now.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works well with my everyday makeup over it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for approximately 2 weeks and</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks i feel the strechmarks in my hips are ligther.</li>
            <li> I supplement with a rosewater hydrosol spritz and also have a custom homemade blend that is just this rosehip seed oil with a few drops of lavender, frankincense and chamomile EOs</li>
            <li> Since implementing RSO into my skincare regimen, I have had so few breakouts</li>
            <li> Also, put a few drops with my body lotion</li>
            <li> Oil is affordable and comes in a few varieties and costs around $10.</li>
            <li> wash my face a night, apply my serums and creams and then finish with a few drops of this, massaged into my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a few drops after washing and toning my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried a few drops on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my skin in just a few day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Rosehip Seed Oil a bit heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> It is quite a heavy oil</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with my nails breaking but just from putting this on my face there is some improvement there as well.  </li>
            <li> I blend it in with my moisturizers or a few drops in my hand for my skin.</li>
            <li> So instead, I&#x27;ve been using just a few drops of the Rosehip Seed Oil on my face.</li>
            <li> In have been using this oil for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I add a drop or two of Frankincense oil to a few drops of the Rosehip seed oil and apply it to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Have used it on multiple cuts/skin scars with obvious results - decreased hyperpigmentation, decreased scar visability.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my face,  </li>
            <li> I like to add a few drops to my hair gel.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> At 65 I may be dead tomorrow</li>
            <li> You are to use just a few drops and work it into you face and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The smell can be off putting but the smell does evaporate after a few mins.</li>
            <li> I  put  a few drops into the moisturizer creme that I use for my body.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of Omega 3 fatty acids (from fish) but the smell fades in abotu 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I tested it on a few scars seeing that it claimed to lighten them, however I did not see any results.</li>
            <li> I have shared my cream with a few of my family members.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few things that can help with Hormonal Acne and for that I&#x27;m truly grateful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and have been unable to use products for the scent alone.  </li>
            <li> Like a lot of scar-reducing products, I&#x27;m betting it takes months to notice a difference, rather than weeks, so I&#x27;ll keep using it a few times a week to see if I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> actully all year round.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil for a few years</li>
            <li> I have also tried a few drops of Rosehip Oil on my face before my nightly derma roll session.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to suffer from year round dryness on my elbows and on the heels of my feet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> When it finally dried out, I was in need of something to help it to heal.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I sometimes put a few drops in my hair after shampoo&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks everyday and my skin is improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays on the skin for a few minutes before it soaks in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the rosehip oil for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; waited to do a review after I had given the product time to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The results were almost immediate and after a few weeks the irritation is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> I took a friend&#x27;s advice and added a few drops of lavender to it, problem solved.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are slowly diminishing and I experience less skin problems.</li>
            <li> However, it tricks the skin into producing less oil!</li>
            <li> Could tell an immediate change from my typical roll out of bed and glance in the mirror complexion!  </li>
            <li> I have less clogged pores and my skin look radiant!</li>
            <li> The skin by the scar near my ankle where the bone came through has been very thin since my surgery.</li>
            <li> My stomach skin was hurting very bad in my last trimester of pregnancy from a very large baby.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after I started using consistently I developed a pretty bad rash.</li>
            <li> I would prefer my deep wrinkles,fine lines and dark areas below my eyes would have disappeared but that is an unrealistic expectation.</li>
            <li> even the awful line across my forehead is less prominent already...</li>
            <li> I have gone through a few surgeries over the past 3 years</li>
            <li> It has taken about a month of using the InstaNatural face creams before seeing serious wrinkle improvement, but I would recommend that you give this product and their other products a try.  </li>
            <li> I recently asked my co worker to allow me to smell her bottle as she uses the same oil but mine had a stronger scent, so I might have received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> previously stated the oil is somewhat thick -</li>
            <li> IF you remember to just use a little bit!  </li>
            <li> It is like a little miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> so you put just a very little bit onto your hair and work it throughout all the way to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> but really it isnt that bad.</li>
            <li> All rosehip oil has a somewhat weird earthy scent, some may think it has &#x27;gone bad&#x27; when smelling this, but trust me the smell it will emit when it actually has gone rancid is much stronger, almost fishy.</li>
            <li> I have used Rosehip oil in the past it wasn&#x27;t organic.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a small difference in my acne scars they aren&#x27;t as visible as they use to be.</li>
            <li> and I can usually pinpoint them to excessive stress during the time of the breakout.  </li>
            <li> I’m not sure which one caused the breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was anxious to use it.</li>
            <li> First it came almost open in the box, and the odor was horrible.</li>
            <li> , I use just a small amount and spread it all over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> not sure what I was expecting receiving this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using their Rosehip Seed Oil, Argan Oil &amp; Moroccan Rosewater for the past month</li>
            <li> and I find the pump dispenser helps me to get even amounts for application without going overboard with the product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use it on my forehead since I have oily skin there.</li>
            <li> Had I known this, I would not have invested a small fortune in the &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday!</li>
            <li> since using this product i&#x27;ve noticed small pimples on my face and i am not acne prone nor did i have acne bumps before using this.</li>
            <li> have been applying this Rosehips Oil to the scars on my leg and knee a couple times a day for the past month.  </li>
            <li> I have a genrous ration of stretchmarks from having my babies, scars from surgery, and have less-than-happily welcomed wrinkles in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> I usually add one drop of the oil to the eye-cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like stale cigarette smoke mixed with rancid lake water.</li>
            <li> Though I love this product, the smell to me is awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this company at all - they have lots of marketing and</li>
            <li> Not sure at this point.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or like an oil slick is on my face.</li>
            <li> At a few drops per day, it will be a while before another bottle is needed!</li>
            <li> With that being said, this oil is NOT a magic potion.  </li>
            <li> This prevents them from the usual itchiness that accompanies shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I poured a hefty tablespoon of Rosehip Oil into a small glass jar.</li>
            <li> Needless to say,  It went back..</li>
            <li> and I will say I like it for my face, but I do not love the product for my face.  </li>
            <li> But never the less I am still using it cause it has increased my skin softness and look dramatically!!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about applying cold oil to your face since you only use a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t expect to see results from beauty products for at least 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used the rosehip seed oil on my hair as well, and it calms my poofy tresses into a semblance of defined waves without weighing my hair down or leaving behind a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally addicted to the earthy, slightly fishy smell -</li>
            <li> It sort of smells like a mild toasted sesame oil, which isn&#x27;t bad, but just sort of weird to rub on your face.</li>
            <li> but I have a hard time with the smell of it.</li>
            <li> cause this worked for me, so hard to compare.</li>
            <li> The next morning, no more angry bird talons!</li>
            <li> The next morning, no more angry bird talons!</li>
            <li> I do wish it was dispensed by eyedropper instead because it&#x27;s hard to control oil coming out of a spray.  </li>
            <li> Dull hair</li>
            <li> Dull hair</li>
            <li> and I use a lot of products that are natural and that some people would say smell bad.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible it just didn&#x27;t do anything fantastic.</li>
            <li> duh it does contain omega fish oil.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions to this -</li>
            <li> It has a delicate earthy scent that as a gardener I know well.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my moisturizers to help them last longer in the cold weather.  </li>
            <li> one night it was late</li>
            <li> I understand that it is cold pressed and in natural form, but I am so smell sensitive that I hate the way it smells.</li>
            <li> (2-3 drops should do the job) if you are going to use it as a moisturizer and slowly increase it if needed.</li>
            <li> (I have shoulder length, thick hair).  </li>
            <li> I like the absence of artificial fragrance and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use due to the fact that when i opened the packaging it fell out to the floor and broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to using expensive chemical-laden products ever again!</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a bottle for my daughter and she is anxious to try it too!</li>
            <li> It is fading discolorations on my arms and legs which expensive dark spot removers could not duplicate after continued use for months.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a drag that it really needs to be refrigerated to keep it from going rank because that&#x27;s inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I really hate how my dry hands look and feel though, so I’m forever looking for other options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> will introduce this to my friends who suffers from dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I got tired of feeling like my face was sticking to the sheets and got tired of the odor.  </li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is hard to explain, but it is definitely not a rose smell!</li>
            <li> When I contacted supplier about bad product, was offered second bottle at no charge.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money sadly</li>
            <li> but this is not a good product, it was rancid and smelled like fish oil.</li>
            <li> I also tried it for a couple nights after yard work left my hands cracked and painful.</li>
            <li> 2 years ago I took a nasty fall that resulted in a compound fracture of my right leg that required surgery.  </li>
            <li> I live in Michigan and the winters are brutal on my skin.  </li>
            <li> dumb people.</li>
            <li> Not sure what went wrong, this go around.  </li>
            <li> I guess you understand what I mean!  </li>
            <li> I was  confused because I hadn’t started a refund process for anything.</li>
            <li> Alas, a faulty pump will not deter me from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept it in the refrigerator as directed and have not experienced that fishy smell that some reviews have claimed.</li>
            <li> and this hasn&#x27;t broken me out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the above, I use rosehip seed as a carrier oil, that is as a base that gets added on to.</li>
            <li> Addicted and have recommended it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting it to smell even remotely rosey you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the smell is horrible at least for me.</li>
            <li> I avoid the area around my eyes though because it makes it sting a little but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I thought my bottle had gone bad, but I found out that is the case with this type of oil since it has omega fatty acids.</li>
            <li> It is a delicate oil because it is extracted using a cold pressed manufacturing process which no chemicals or heat are used.</li>
            <li> However, it goes away after 5 minutes and it is honestly not that bad.</li>
            <li> Soon after, there was an email from InstaNatural stating that they were sorry</li>
            <li> so you know you’re not putting weird chemicals on your skin, is Certified Organic and meets USDA Certified</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> either I&#x27;ve gone nose blind, or the tea tree deodorizes it a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has replaced all those expensive moisturizers I have been purchasing over the years.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> WHICH makes them WORSE!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I can&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I put it to the test and it did not prove me wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately  I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in my acne scarring.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell to it, almost like cooking oil -</li>
            <li> so I dilute it 1/2 1/2 with another random toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, what can&#x27;t this amber colored liquid do?!?!?  </li>
            <li> My cuticles are the worst, they are so dry</li>
            <li> Sorry for the bad review.</li>
            <li> In this cold winter, I feel like it shields and protects my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin suffers every winte, but this yr this oil did miracles.  </li>
            <li> That just makes it inconvenient for me.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that since they tell you to refrigerate it</li>
            <li> It also helps to even out my skin tone and that is something I&#x27;m desperately trying to do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These oils are cold pressed, insuring none of the health properties are lost in heating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like me you would be wrong!</li>
            <li> Silly me!</li>
            <li> anyone who suffers from eczema knows how ugly it looks</li>
            <li> Note that it isn&#x27;t an artificially added fragrance, nor do I think it smells bad--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but I even keep it in my fridge and the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> even the scents some find disgusting, like seaweed or vinegar scented products, do not bother me in the least.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t effect me in a bad way or cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t worry that the oil is bad because it is not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of people say that the oil smells bad, to me it smells like tea leaves</li>
            <li> This product smells really bad.  </li>
            <li> No longer do I wake up with redness or painful bumps, If I get anything on my face anymore</li>
            <li> Was SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t know which product broke my skin out! :-(</li>
            <li> Gotta warn you up front, this stuff STINKS!  </li>
            <li> So I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell anything I was sceptic since every review has sad it smells horrible</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate buying products not know what the shelf life is.</li>
            <li> I hate chemical smells.</li>
            <li> I hate the pump.  </li>
            <li> I had very bad painful cystic acne on my chin/jawline/lower cheeks.</li>
            <li> (I hate cold weather!!).</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is a BAD PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> i have bad dandruff and after one use it was gone!</li>
            <li> Smell was so bad that my husband commented on it!</li>
            <li> and it made me break out so bad !</li>
            <li> Hated the smell</li>
            <li> Smells very bad; alla, spoiled olive oil.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.......</li>
            <li> And this winter was terrible.  </li>
            <li> It smelled awful!  </li>
            <li> Still, fish oil on the skin smells disgusting.</li>
            <li> It also has a terrible fish smell.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t awful but it isn&#x27;t pleasant...smells like seaweed to me.</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant !</li>
            <li> and I had one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> Just as BAD!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am very happy with the product.  It has an earthy smell to it but seems to disappear after awhile.  I am noticing the difference in the feel of my skin.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s organic which is a plus and I LOVE that it gives you an expiration date. I hate buying products not know what the shelf life is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using just a tiny squirt as a face moisturizer after washing my face every morning. I can already notice a difference in my complexion after 4 days of application! My pores seem smaller and my skin tone overall has improved.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Really made my skin look better in  days.</li>
            <li> keeps the age spots off my hands.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and smells very nice would buy again def recommend</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have been using it for a week now and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> A list for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, this will smell like veggie oil, because it is veggie oil&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, when it first goes on it will be a bit shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It will make you skin look Fabulous&lt;br /&gt;-It will not burn, cause rashes, or stay shiny&lt;br /&gt;-It will help cuts, acne, and such heal faster and without scars&lt;br /&gt;-It is a life saver during dry weather&lt;br /&gt;-It will make fine wrinkles better (I am just starting to get them, we&#x27;re talking very fine)&lt;br /&gt;-It will not clog pores or cause acne</li>
            <li> I have been using Rosehip Oil for the past few months, and it does make a difference in the overall complexion of your skin and skin tone.  It took me a few days to get used to the smell of the oil, but I don&#x27;t even notice it now.  I use it with a Vitamin C/Retinol serum twice a day and I have noticed a great improvement in my skin texture and appearance.  This type of oil does not clog pores and absorbs quickly.  I apply it after washing and toning.  I let it absorb while I brush teeth, dress, etc., then apply moisturizer.  This is a good quality natural product at a reasonable price.  Delivery was fast and the item was well packaged.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I used this for about six months (I bought several bottles) it&#x27;s just oil. Nothing miraculous, nothing to write home about.  I&#x27;ll try anything once and I&#x27;ll give it time to work, I know these products don&#x27;t work over night. It wasn&#x27;t horrible it just didn&#x27;t do anything fantastic. You could buy a cheaper product or more of a product for less money and get the same effects</li>
            <li> **DISCLOSURE: I received this at no cost to be in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now. Not much is left now, obviously. I&#x27;ve been using this on my face and on my stomach. It has reduced the appearance of my stretch marks on my stomach; and I use it on my face when I get acne. It does have a strong, somewhat unpleasant smell, but it goes away after it all absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> Love Rosehip Oil and this brand is just as effective as the more expense direct sales brands and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I just received the product and so far I noticed a small amount goes a long way.  1-2 tiny drops was great for my hands/cuticles. I tried 2-3 drops (may have been too much) rubbed on my hands and into my dry hair - being a rainy day my curls get frizzy. This application worked well however the scent was &#x27;t too pleasant in the hair. I actually didnt notice a scent on my hands. I will continue to test this product and provide updates.</li>
            <li> I love it. it smells good.I use it on my hair, then my hair is more smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product but I have a hard time with the smell of it. I use it mostly on my hands/nails &amp; stomach (stretch marks). I will only occasionally use it on my face, when it needs some extra moisture, because of the odor.</li>
            <li> so far I really like this rosehip seed oil. I have been told not to use it on acne prone skin so I am avoiding using it on my face but I love how it absorbs and I use it on my cuticles, elbows, any scarring I may have, and my hair. It feels really nice and is almost odorless which I love. I keep mine refrigerated as many people suggest and will be purchasing more when I finish this bottle. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is like a all-in-one beauty product. I use this for my thick straight long hair to keep my hair shiny and smooth frizz free all the time. I have extremely dry hands. The weather in the north make my skin really dry. This oil helps my hands to maintain moisture and stay hydrated. The bottle looks small in the picture, but when I received the package, it is a lot bigger than I expected. I love the scent, Plus, always prefer natural organic beauty item since there is less chemicals.</li>
            <li> This Organic Rosehip Seed Oil is wonderful. I started using it on my stretchmarks and my dark dry elbows.  I want you to know that it feels fantastic when you first  put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Right away it makes dull dry skin so soft and supple. I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  This product keeps on working for a full 24 hours. What a difference it has made for me. The best part is that a little goes a long way. You will love the way it changes the texture of your skin. I have just started using it and I can not wait to see if it works on the discoloration of my stretchmarks and elbows. This product is also meant to be used for your face to treat fine lines and wrinkles.  It leaves your face hydrated, but not oily. I am just loving the many ways you can enjoy using this product. You have to try it to believe it.&lt;br /&gt;LA</li>
            <li> It is ok. But I can not use it on my face. It breaks me out</li>
            <li> This is such great stuff. Such a smooth texture. Makes my face soft !!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this oil</li>
            <li> I have been through olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, hazelnut oil, kukui nut oil, MCT oil, caprylic acid, mustard oil, tea tree oil, neem oil, argan oil, hemp oil, blessed seed oil, peroxide, iodine, gentian violet, aloe, the list goes on. This has replaced my Strivectin. I&#x27;ve been fighting Morgellon&#x27;s, systemic fungus and Candida for 3 years&lt;br /&gt;and this helps heal the lesions and fade them too. There aren&#x27;t many products I can use near my eyes. Rosehip oil with unscented garlic oil on the tissue around&lt;br /&gt;my eyes helps keep my eyes clear. I don&#x27;t know that the manufacturer would recommend that, but that&#x27;s what I do. I&lt;br /&gt;want to give this product ten stars</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! I have adult acne and oily skin. However this helps me so much! I also have scaring which I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in. My dark spots have definitely lightened since using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and do think that it&#x27;s been working as a good addition to my routine. I am fairly young so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles to contend with just yet, but I do think that my skin seems a bit firmer. My routine right now is OCM (castor/almond oils), tone with Dr. Thayer&#x27;s Rosewater, and moisturize with this rosehip oil...it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> The BEST stuff EVER!! Better than any other rosehip oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After one month of using it I have to say I really like it! It makes my skin smooth and well hydrated. First I apply rose water and then oil. It works great! Definitely I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love this oil it is very moisturizing and light.</li>
            <li> Been using this on my face. Feels nice, applies smoothly, and leaves my face feeling soft. Almost no smell - which is good.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference since I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my face. My skin is retaining more moisture but isn&#x27;t greasy. I have also noticed fewer breakouts, and my skin seems to have a glow. I actually like the smell of the oil--it had a kind of nutty, tea smell. It does NOT smell like roses and isn&#x27;t meant to.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using it as a moisturizer and love the results. My hands get very dry during the winter so I use it in the morning and evening. I find it helps keep my cuticles soft too. I love this oil, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t have much of a scent to it. It&#x27;s also versatile, I can use it on my hair and face too!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. Keeps my skin soft, fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Leaves skin feeling amazing - I put in on my entire body after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month.  I had a tummy tuck 3 months ago and it was recommended to me for my tummy tuck scar.  I can see the difference since I started using it.  My scar is starting to fade!  I only gave it 4 stars because of the odor.  I only use it at night after I shower.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love all the InstaNatural products--no chemicals, not tested on animals--but I have to say this is my new favorite moisturizer.  Have used emu oil and argon oil but this one leaves less greasy residue on my skin as if it is absorbed immediately.  There seems to be a firming effect which I can definitely use and it has all the great ingredients:  essential fatty acids, vitamins A and E naturally, not manufactured and added.  Of the two products I can&#x27;t do without, this is one and the other is the InstaNatural rose water which is the best toner in the world.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. The consistency is great, soaks right in, has tremendously helped my acne scars and current acne. It somehow dries out my pimples yet moisturizes the surrounding skin. For me it even works under makeup, it&#x27;s that light. The smell is something to get used to but I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I like it. Yes it does smells like cooking oil but it appears to protect your skin. Plus it reminds me of delicious memories of french crepes.&lt;br /&gt;During winter time it appears to Help on preventing dry skin cracking on hands too.</li>
            <li> I love this...added some essential oil to cut the smell.  Seller was very responsive and helpful with questions.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin on my face, and a friend recommended this product because this is all she uses. I tried it and I love it! My skin is much less dry and is much more supple and that is after only a couple of weeks. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wonder product and excellent customer service.  This company is investing time and effort into making sure the customer is made to feel important.  The oil feels wonderful on my skin. Yes, it does have a fishy smell due to the presence of omega 3, but the smell dissipates quickly.  I put some on at night and during the day I couple with jojoba oil.  I prefer using oil instead of lotion.  It&#x27;s all natural and lightweight.  Many think oil will exacerbate problem skin.  However, it tricks the skin into producing less oil! I plan on purchasing many more products from this company.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It&#x27;s light and non-greasy, works great for your face.</li>
            <li> Surprised how well this absorbs.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> wonderful buying experience, and wonderful product, thank you!</li>
            <li> It is a great product</li>
            <li> It has not been long enough of a time in using the product.  Check back in another six weeks,  thanks,</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try rosehip because I have always heard so much about it. I remember even from when I was young, my grandmother used it for everything. Well now, I have a huge bottle! This bottle is bigger than I expected but thats good because I will get to use it for all of the things I want to try. I am glad to have found an unrefined version that isnt diluted, it helps alot with tough to fix dry areas, such as the elbows and knuckles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Mine was rancid and I had to return it.</li>
            <li> This product has a truly fishy smell and was warned about this AFTER I purchased it. I really appreciate their warning, but this info needs to be presented BEFORE people buy it.</li>
            <li> Great product and well priced!</li>
            <li> Since adding this oil, about a month ago, my skin has improved so much. Before, my skin was dehydrated and flaky. I decided to try rosehip oil and I am so glad I received this for review. Now, my skin is much smoother. It also softer, more plump, and doesnt feel dehydrated. It has also reduced my redness and it helped with scars.</li>
            <li> Great product  - great value. Nice to be able to purchase organic products easily and with a company who guarantees 100%. I use on my face and in my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it but it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li> Good oil, great price and fast service.</li>
            <li> I ended up not using this too much because it smelled rancid and old.  This is the first Rosehip Seed Oil I have purchased so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal??</li>
            <li> Smells funky.  Gave it to my daughter, as she recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> This is high quality stuff. I have used other brands and I don&#x27;t feel they were as concentrated or potent. Add this to your moisturizer and body lotion. I use the hyaluronic acid serum also made by instanatural prior to applying the oil to help my skin retain moisture.</li>
            <li> My skin really likes this. I use it on my face at night before bed and wake up with skin that looks alive and healthy. I avoid the area around my eyes though because it makes it sting a little but not too bad. I have dry skin and so I need to put a moisturizer on top of this. So my new nighttime routine is toner, serum, rosehip oil, and then moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The great product ! Works so good for the skin and for the hair.</li>
            <li> I would prefer my deep wrinkles,fine lines and dark areas below my eyes would have disappeared but that is an unrealistic expectation. It has however improved the overall appearance of my skin and I have only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I already reviewed this product but will do so again.  It did not stink.  It is very nice.  I like the feel of it and my skin after applying.  I am just about 70 so I don&#x27;t expect to necessarily look younger.  Most people think I look like I am in my 50s anyway (unless they are being extra kind).  I was given lots of feedback from the company and also a free bottle of the oil so I am set for awhile.  I keep it in the fridge.  Such a nice company.  You will see if you ever buy from them.</li>
            <li> Review by the wife: &amp;#34;My skin looks and feel amazing, acne scars are lighter, and no breakouts - even while PMSing. If your skin feels greasy, you&#x27;ve applied too much. A little (just 3-4 drops) goes a LONG way. I highly recommend this product to any one with acne scar and dry skin issue!&amp;#34; Thank you Amazon for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> You can apply this oil directly to your skin, either face or body. I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this product! The product itself is package fantastically with an opaque glass bottle and a pump applicator! I mix a pump with my daily lotion after a shower and my skin just glows! The fragrance wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;rosey&amp;#34; as I had hoped (more seedy than I care for) but it does have aroma that is pleasant. I can&#x27;t wait to continuing using this into winter. I&#x27;m sure my skin will love it even more! Also, adding a few drops to a hot bath is recommended. So relaxing! Don&#x27;t forget that glass of wine ;)</li>
            <li> Love using this on my face with essential oils!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great company!</li>
            <li> Not sure how i would have liked it.  I was unable to use due to the fact that when i opened the packaging it fell out to the floor and broke.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in some dark spots that I have on my face.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft and smooth... gets rid of my dry patches! Works well with my everyday makeup over it</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil really helps my skin look great. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it but, to my big surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes and mouth. A friend suggested using with a vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum and I tried .  I have found that combining this mask with [[ASIN:B00NJ9W3XQ VC20 - Potent 20% Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex! ]]. The combination of these products has given me amazing results -- revitalizing my skin and making me look younger!</li>
            <li> I had heard of rosehip seed oil and when given opportunity to buy it at discounted price in order to give my opinion, I jumped at it. I must first say that this oil is a big bottle and a little goes a loooong way! I understand that it is cold pressed and in natural form, but I am so smell sensitive that I hate the way it smells. The bottle suggests to add favorite essential oil which I have done, but I can still smell the strong oil smell. Past the natural smell, this oil works great on my baby&#x27;s dry skin and I have used it on myself and older daughter as a hair oil treatment. We left it on for 20-30 minutes and shampooed out. Left our thick hair very shiny and soft. And all you need is a couple of drops. All in all, very high quality oil with many benefits. I just didn&#x27;t care for the smell. I still think it&#x27;s worth the purchase. I&#x27;m just a smeller.</li>
            <li> not used long enough to say</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this oil and fragrance. It provides moisture without a greasy feel. I have used it on hair and skin for myself and my children.  I even mix it with some tea tree oil for my face. It had lessened acne break outs without clogging pores.</li>
            <li> This is truly wonderful  I appy it on my face right after the shower and my legs too. My face glows. Getting tons of compliments on my skin and I&#x27;m 62 but people think early 50&#x27;s  I don&#x27;t use makeup other than mascara  So I will reorder this and I highly recommend it too  but also a diet based on organic veggies and no sugar helps. Sugar causes wrinkles</li>
            <li> My oil leaked inside the box, half the bottle was empty!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I have ditched all other moisturizers for this oil and my skin has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> use it everyday and the scent is lovely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this oil. Definitely multipurpose, especially on dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> It gave me breakouts, didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I had an expectation of rosehip oil smelling like roses, but it is rosehip &amp;#34;seed&amp;#34; oil.. so it doesn&#x27;t smell that good. I used it for about 2 weeks on my face and hands, but it does not moisturize well as I expected it would be. I applied it on my face before bed and woke up feeling so dry so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Love adding this oil to my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle for this product, which means I WAS satisfied with the previous ones. However, the third bottle is different from the previous two ones. It is definitely DILUTED and does not carry a unique amber color, which is the signature color of rosehip seed oil. I do not know what happened to this company, but I would not go back to this product again.</li>
            <li> Like i&#x27;ve read some customers complain about the odor..duh it does contain omega fish oil. But the smell I&#x27;m not gonna say it&#x27;s wonderful but it&#x27;s bareable. After u massage a couple of drops on ur face like a do..I then rub my moisturizer on top and there! So far ecxellent! I will keep buying! I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Decided to give this oil a try instead of using a product with stuff that I can&#x27;t pronounce or has lots of chemicals.  I&#x27;ve only been using for approximately 2 weeks and it is awesome!  It is fading discolorations on my arms and legs which expensive dark spot removers could not duplicate after continued use for months.  This product is even better at keeping my limbs moisturized than I expected and has streamlined my beauty routine.  I&#x27;ve been a Mary Kay consultant for over 15 years and have been increasingly concerned about the chemicals I&#x27;ve been putting on my body.  Organic Rosehip Seed Oil is an excellent product that does exactly what it claims to do....absolutely LOVE IT :-)</li>
            <li> Package came quickly and met my expectations. Have only been using for a week or so and so far no complaints. Only didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the box was wet when arrived from an apparent leak, yet I couldn&#x27;t find where the leak came from. The seal was unbroken.</li>
            <li> Love it! My skin feels so nourished. I have bought every $70 bottle of wrinkle serum out there and this actually is so much nicer. I feel like I&#x27;m doing something healthy for my skin!</li>
            <li> The scent took a while to get used to but, I love the way it soaks in easily and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. Love it and plan to continue making it part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s decreased wrinkles around the eye area but not the nasolabial folds or the deep groves by my mouth. I&#x27;m still hoping for improvement in these ares.</li>
            <li> Very mosturizing, the smell is kind of strong. After using it the skin is very soft. After using it for a few weeks i feel the strechmarks in my hips are ligther. I REALLY like this product And hightly recomend it.</li>
            <li> good for blending...light weight</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, I simply use it for everything, body, face, hair. It is an item that certainly I will keep buying over and over again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and service. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great ,and works! Just smells.</li>
            <li> I do not like the odor.</li>
            <li> Love the pump mouth. So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it on hair and skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Powerful and my face never looked better.</li>
            <li> Even though goes on very oily, absorbs quickly.  Have only been using 2 weeks, but really seems to be helping my skin.  My skin is very sensitive and I have had no issues, no break outs, etc.  Is really softening my skin.  There is a slight smell, but it goes away quickly.  Need a little more time to see if it will help wrinkles. I am glad to have found a natural product I can use on my face as well as anywhere.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry with just advanced night repair and this...I like coconut oil more!</li>
            <li> Great product! Very moisturizing and makes skin very soft. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> The bottle was leaking through the box. However the product is great and it smell good to me.</li>
            <li> I have used Rosehip oil in the past it wasn&#x27;t organic. I am so happy to find a pure oil. I am having some surgery this year and was not looking forward to having to live with the scars. I am SO relieved to know how well this oil works so well on scars. Thanks to all ! With new scars I know I will not have to live with these scares forever.</li>
            <li> I use it in my face and my body as a moisturizer, in result my skin is super soft. The only downside is that the smell is horrible at least for me. But it can be covered with a body mist. I love the results enough for put up with the smell.</li>
            <li> I put about 10 squirts in my bath with oatmeal and epsom salt. It helps my eczema BIG time.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and quickly absorbs. In this cold winter, I feel like it shields and protects my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will introduce this to my friends who suffers from dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;At first I don&#x27;t like the smell, but now I&#x27;m getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;But most of all, the customer service is fantastic. I will keep using from this company.</li>
            <li> I have been using this rosehip oil on my stretch marks and it is great. My stretch marks looks so much better. They are less reddened and all around less noticeable. It makes my skin so soft and not a greasy as I thought it would. This is a great sized bottle and last a long time. I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now and it still over half full. I received this to review and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The best for redness.</li>
            <li> I waited a while to write this review, cause I wanted to give it time. This is my second purchase and noticed this time around the smell is stronger and not in a good way. Wish it came in plastic container or travel friendly.. cause I do a lot of that and worry about breakage. Anyway, I say I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 4/5 months and I am a happy user. Bought the Argan and Age Serum.. but found myself reaching more for this. I use it with my makeup remover and after fresh face moisturizer at night. By morning my skin is super soft. Ihave combo/oily skin and was worried this would be counterproductive.. but wow. no way. I travel a lot for work, on tons of airplanes and sleep in varied temp world wide and this always goes with me. I only use it at night.. as it&#x27;s too oily for under makeup, unless you have very dry skin that will absorb this fast. I use a daily day moisturizer by another brand w/SPF. worth a try. Fine lines, small brown spots faded and keeps my face a nice texture. Now summer is coming around and not sure how this will effect my skins reaction, but I expect to keep this as a part of my daily night routine. I am a product whore and test lots of things from drugstore to brand name ... for a decent price I say it&#x27;s worth it, but give it time. Now I haven&#x27;t invested much time to the Argan Oil cause this worked for me, so hard to compare.</li>
            <li> Great oil- I love it!! Can already feel and tell a difference after using it a week! Great customer service as well!!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working okay, haven&#x27;t been using daily.</li>
            <li> The smell is not terrible but exactly pleasant either. I have been using over a month now just at night and notice a big difference already. My skin is not oily so I think it might cause break outs if you have oily skin because it is very moisturizing. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and dry damaged hair I apply this oil almost every morning after I wash my face I have combination skin even though this is an oil it doesn&#x27;t make my skin look oily after using this oil for a couple of weeks I have noticed a small difference in my acne scars they aren&#x27;t as visible as they use to be. This rosehip oil is also great for my hair I have really damage hair because I use to dye my hair and straighten it all the time I apply a small amount after I shower while my hair is still wet it makes my hair feel soft and hydrated. The oil is light and it hardly has any scent to it. It&#x27;s a good quality oil I have tried cheaper oils that claim to be 100% pure even though they aren&#x27;t if you compare this oil to a cheaper one you will definitely be able to see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference in my scarring and sun spots in just the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using the product.  It also helps to heal super fast too.  Will continue to buy this! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is so nourishing for the skin - it&#x27;s all I use as a moisturizer, with great results for many years. I supplement with a rosewater hydrosol spritz and also have a custom homemade blend that is just this rosehip seed oil with a few drops of lavender, frankincense and chamomile EOs added for additional therapeutic gain. Getting rid of toxin-laden proprietary mainstream cosmetics and skin care products was the best thing I ever did for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This brand is an excellent price for a good quality product. Be sure to store in a cool spot with no light. If your bathroom gets hot and steamy then keep it somewhere else (this is the case for any oils - heat and light are undesirable).</li>
            <li> (This review is written by my wife who bought this product)  I have been using it for about two months and I had noticed no difference whatsoever . I have been using it on my face to soften wrinkles and to have better skin and the only difference i have noticed is that my skin became oily.  In my opinion it is a BAD PRODUCT! I&#x27;m very disappointed....... Cony de Abril</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I have moderate rosacea, and 2 pumps of this rosehip seed oil either alone or mixed in with my moisturizer (applied day or night) have tremendously improved the texture of my skin, and reduced redness. I actually receive compliments on my skin once again, which hasn&#x27;t happened since I was a teen. The oil absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave shine, is nearly odorless (smells a bit nutty during application but doesn&#x27;t linger), doesn&#x27;t transfer, works well under makeup, and my skin loves it. Will never stop using this Vitamin-C rich oil and am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Does everything I need it to as a moisturizer and the plus is that it&#x27;s totally natural.  The fragrance is barely there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a super fan  for oils that will help me look younger, help my hair , help my nails and skin. This  oil is amazing.  As we all know oils do have there particular smells.  This on has  is a little  nut smell. It&#x27;s a light oil. My face feels good. I&#x27;m in NY. And this winter was terrible.  My skin suffers every winte, but this yr this oil did miracles.  My face did suffer for ice burn I used all over me with coconut oil.  I became a Fan # 1 for rosehip oil. I absolutely love this oil.  Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil. For me, it&#x27;s 100% non comedogenic, which is amazing. The color is rich golden and it has an unusual, nutty scent. The price is amazing for a 4 oz bottle; can&#x27;t imagine higher quality. I keep it with me basically all the time.</li>
            <li> Okay so here is why I&#x27;m not sure yes I&#x27;ve already had it for about 3 weeks and I really don&#x27;t see any results like at all my blemishes are still looking the same .... my fine lines under my eyes are still there no improvement what&#x27;s so ever ..maybe it&#x27;s to early to see results I don&#x27;t know  for sure I&#x27;ll keep you guys to date on this product  if I see any change going on maybe it&#x27;s still to early to see results you never know but I say 3 weeks is good of enough time to see results and I haven&#x27;t really seen none but I&#x27;ll be patient to see if anything good happens otherwise it was a waste of money sadly</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;7/26/17 (more than a year after the other attempt)&lt;br /&gt;When it came time to buy more RSO, the brand I was using was no longer available. So I decided to give this one more go.  Why did I bother? Unfortunately, it was too late to return it by the time I used up the last of my other RSO, it was outside the return window for this. It smelled awful!  Like fish oi! As noted in my previous review, this should have an earthy, nutty natural fragrance. Writing this edit/update, I see that they&#x27;ve changed their packaging. Perhaps, I got an old, rancid bottle. Still, fish oil on the skin smells disgusting. Because of this, I have to drop the star rating down from a 3-star to a 1-star.  Fish oil I tell you. So gross! (I&#x27;m not saying it really was fish oil, just that is smelled like it.) So, I dumped in out and cleaned the bottle which I will use for mixing other oils.  At least one good thing came out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original post:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is more about the brand and their customer service rather than the benefits of RSO (which I love) though the star rating is for the product only. I’ve been using RSO for a few years, and I swear by it (smoother feeling skin, appearance of old acne scars diminishing, non-greasy, fast-absorbing). However, the brand I was using is a bit pricey. I looked around and found InstaNatural and decided to try it. I also thought I liked the idea of a pump and not a dropper for dispensing the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This RSO does have a stronger odor than the other I was using, but to me this indicated that it was fresher. It will NOT smell like roses and it shouldn’t—if it does, someone added fragrance.  It smells very earthy and the odor very quickly dissipates.  No one up close and personal will be able to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that I am not especially fond of the pump. I use about 2-4 drops of RSO in a dime sized amount of Jojoba Oil.  The pump squirts out much more than 2-4 drops (more like the amount of jojoba I use).I suppose the reason I used less of the other was the price, so maybe this wouldn’t be an issue in the long run; however, I started to break out. Since implementing RSO into my skincare regimen, I have had so few breakouts and I can usually pinpoint them to excessive stress during the time of the breakout.  Now, to be fair, I also bought another cream from InstaNatural and began using it at the same time. I’m not sure which one caused the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me break here and mention InstaNatural SUPERLATIVE costumer care.  I was initially contacted by the company to see how I liked the products. I hesitated to review them because I couldn’t pinpoint which one was causing the breakouts. I didn’t respond to their email, and then some time later got another one. I did respond and explained what I was experiencing in as objective a way as possible. This was on Friday. On SATURDAY, I got an email about processing my refund through Amazon. I was  confused because I hadn’t started a refund process for anything. I opened the email and saw that it was for both InstaNatural products. Soon after, there was an email from InstaNatural stating that they were sorry my expectations weren’t met and that they were refunding my money. WHAT!!?? A company that cares? Say what?  (This alone deserves 5 stars.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After continued use of the RSO and DIScontinued use of the Retinol Moisturizer (I use it on my hands now), I now believe it was the Retinol. While there are some lingering breakouts, there have been no new ones.  I am not sure yet, if I will purchase more RSO from them, but based on their level of customer care, I will certainly consider it—as long as I continue to stay breakout free.</li>
            <li> Great product, so far it&#x27;s working for me, leaves the skin soft~</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin well hydrated and silky</li>
            <li> Great product and costumer service. Great value for the money</li>
            <li> I love the oil! It makes my skin less wrinkled and more radiant. I also love the smell of it which is earthy and nutty. I use it on my face under my regular cream and on my nails and cuticles. Trying out on some stretch marks too...hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, it works great!!</li>
            <li> This the product I have been waiting for......I am IN LOVE with this product already. This rosehip oil softens my skin, clears up blemishes and is all around fabulous!! Highly, highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received at discount for honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> It does give your skin a even tone appearance however it enlarges the pores on the face.Not going to use it on my face anymore</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I do love it.  It is non-greasy, absorbs quickly and gives noticeable results.  There is no miracle product out there but this one does what it says in a natural organic way which is much more preferable.  I use it on my face, my hands and body and lightly on my hair.  Great product.  Customer service is very good too.</li>
            <li> order was exceptional, stuff works as reputed!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be wonderful!! I use after a I shower and it makes my skin very soft (non ashy) all day.  I will definitely order more</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after a co worker recommend it, I got a minor rash that seemed like a heat rash on my face, I continued to use it because of the amazing reviews . I did notice the strong. Smell so I stopped using it. I recently asked my co worker to allow me to smell her bottle as she uses the same oil but mine had a stronger scent, so I might have received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for over 2 weeks and I noticed a difference within the first 2 days.  My skin is softer and more youthful.  My skin was so dry due to weather, this made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Great product, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I had used another &#x27;&#x27;organic Rosehip oil&#x27;&#x27; and I haven&#x27;t had the same effect. This oil is really amazing. I bought other products from them, like argan oil, eyes gel, Scar gel so, I hope to have the same experience.</li>
            <li> I just love this oil.  I use it at night, and in the morning my face feels very soft.  My skin just absorbs this oil.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin that reacts to any foreign matter like chemicals, stress etc.  This Organic Rosehip Seed oil goes on very smoothly and gives my skin a youthful look. I mix it with the Meadowfoam, since my skin type likes variety.  After I use this for a while I will add coconut oil, olive oil or any pure oils I have to my skin routine.  The change seems to agree with my skin.  So far I used this product for two weeks and my skin is really happy and already feels super soft.  This will make a great addition to my massage oils as well since I am a Licensed Massage Therapist. By the way, the customer service is superior and the seller was not aware of my profession. They send a follow up email, reminding me to give them feedback.  They even sent me an extra oil since the one I had lacked that &#x27;slightly&#x27; fishy smell.  I never even complained and they wanted me to have the freshest batch and voluntarily sent me an extra bottle.  Not only is the product highly recommended, so is the seller. Thank you for a great Rose hip Seed Oil and exceptional customer service.  Alice H LMT</li>
            <li> This is my fav skin care oil so far... very hydrating and my skin is glowing :)  Cons : strong odor but it doesn&#x27;t  bother me..</li>
            <li> This oil made such a huge difference to my skin.The oil a  is very light and does not break me out at all and it did eliminate my dark spots. I will definitely purchase this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third jar and I love it! I used it all through my pregnancy &amp; didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. Now I&#x27;m using it postpartem to help my skin go back. I&#x27;m hooked. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Do you have this product..thank you</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long natural unmanageable hair that is always freest.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many different products and nothing came close to the results I have from this.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for giving my unbiased honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I am 52. Years old and have always bated my hair because it was so freest.&lt;br /&gt;Well not any more. I have never been so thrilled about a product like I am this Rosehip Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my face ares and legs.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am soft from my head to my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a five star rating and highly recommend it to everyone even if you don&#x27;t have troublesome hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply because it has a pump top so you put just a very little bit onto your hair and work it throughout all the way to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;And on you face and body it only takes a small amour to get big results.</li>
            <li> Great product - quick delivery. Huge bottle and I love the applicator, it works very well to dispense just the right amount. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Fresh smelling and feels really good.</li>
            <li> One of the best oil I have used ever. My face just loves all of this company&#x27;s all natural skin care products. They really work on fine lines and wrinkles have seen a huge difference using this product along with their other anti aging face creams. Love them all.</li>
            <li> I just rec&#x27;d this yesterday. I was anxious to use it. I opened the bottle and it smells rancid. I wonder if that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re having a limited time sale on this bc it is old? I will be returning it and trying a different brand. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My Order came on time and very well packaged.  I have been using it for a few nights before bed and in the morning the texture of  my skin looks and feels smooth, soft and supple.  I don&#x27;t mind the subtle &#x27;fishy&#x27; smell which lingers for not too long.  This is my first time using Rosehip oil and for only just those few nights am amazed at the almost instant results!  Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> ORGANIC Rosehip Oil 100% Pure ★ HUGE 4oz ★ | USDA Certified For Face and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to moisturize my face in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, very soft, good</li>
            <li> This Rosehip oil is great for nails, hair and skin. It makes my skin super smooth and I have also been using it on my cuticles. I love that it is organic and 100% pure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently making the transition into using more natural beauty products in my nightly routine to encourage healthy cell growth and keep wrinkles at bay. I may only be 21, but I&#x27;ve come to fully understand that prevention is key!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the sizing of this bottle is very generous for the price, the bottle came packaged well and sealed properly. 1 star there.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was fine- it smelled slightly of roses and oil, as I fully expected- not rancid (thankfully). I&#x27;m not in love with the smell but it smells as it should. +1 star.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to note that the product does not irritate my acne prone skin, nor does it cause break outs- it absorbs into my skin quickly and goes on very lightly (yay!). It&#x27;s still an oil so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying it in the morning, but it works wonderfully as a night-time wrinkle/moisturizing treatment. (especially around the eyes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said it is advised to those who have moderate/severe acne to avoid direct application to trouble areas, but rosehip seed oil has a higher percentage of Linoleic acid  (44%) compared to Oleic acid (14%) which is richer and more likely to cause problems for those with acne. I don&#x27;t apply this oil to my trouble areas on the sides of my forehead, but I&#x27;ve been applying it to minor trouble areas on the sides of my cheeks (note: MINOR) and haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts. 2 more stars right there baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is pretty great, hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems yet (which is saying a lot because I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts)- but I haven&#x27;t seen any results either so until then I&#x27;ll leave off the 1 star. When I do notice any changes I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and revise this :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. if you have acne prone skin I highly suggest doing some research into Linoleic vs Oleic acids- skin is very delicate and should be taken care of properly with the proper products for your skin type :)</li>
            <li> Love it. The only product  I use it on my face and around my eyes.  People ask me what I use and I just say rosehip oil!! Also, put a few drops with my body lotion makes my skin soft and youthful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my skin glows! Great company and fast shipping:)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great i apply this on my stretch marks and cheeks since that&#x27;s the most common for my scars so far I see improvement.  What I love about insta naturals I can use a variety of them brand and it doesn&#x27;t effect me in a bad way or cause any irritation. Thanks to being so natural :) the all target what they&#x27;re suppose to target!  This rose seed oil is the next big thing when it comes to healthier looking skin ♡</li>
            <li> Great product , really quick delevery . Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product! Really makes your skin soft and helps to reduce lines and wrinkles. And who wouldn&#x27;t live that? Definitely buying this again</li>
            <li> After reading all the wonderful reviews I wanted to really like this product. This is the first negative review I have ever posted on Amazon. I have had pretty bad cystic acne for several years due to the stress of grad school/working life and lack of sleep, and I had been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap to wash my face and almond oil as moisturizer for a few months prior to purchasing this item. I wanted something else with a little more oompf and read the many fantastic reviews. I have always had acne prone skin, even in my mid twenties. Using the above regiment, my face had calmed itself but left behind scars that I wanted to get rid of. Within one day using the Rosehip Seed Oil I started breaking out in the cystic fashion I had spent months clearing. I tried to give it several weeks to see if possibly it was the type of product that draws impurities before it heals, but the condition only worsened. It also has a terrible fish smell. I am not sensitive to smells usually and even the scents some find disgusting, like seaweed or vinegar scented products, do not bother me in the least. But the rosehip oil made me feel like gagging every time I used it. The smell does fade after a bit.</li>
            <li> This oil is good only smells bad.</li>
            <li> My go-to winter moisturizer! All natural, fast absorbing, soft and smooth on the skin. Can&#x27;t rave about it enough!</li>
            <li> Was super hesitant to try oil on my sensitive, sometimes break-out prime skin, but I had finally heard enough good things and I had to test it out for myself. I&#x27;ve been using the rosehip seed oil for close to a month now and I am loving it. It makes my skin smoother, gives it an extra glow, seems to be smoothing some fine lines and has not made me break out at all. I really have noticed a difference, which is so rare in my world of skincare product experimentation.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the Rosehip Oil, the Vitamin C Serum or the Jojoba oil that I started using or maybe a combo of all, but my face looks amazing. I suffer from melasma and have gotten lots of laser procedures to even out the brown areas and have spent a ton of money doing so. Using this new combo has cleared my face and keeps it well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was using a different brand from the healthfood store but this is half the price and just as good!</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil recently with great results and was given an opportunity to also try this organic Rosehip Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has similar benefits to the Argan Oil. I have used this on my hands, face, nails and hair. For hands and nails it has moisturized and help rejuvinate my really dry cracked cuticles. It softens the skin on my hands and although I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles on my face, it is supposed to help diminish fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this on my hair which in the winter can get really dry. Rather than use my normal pomade, I&#x27;ve been using 4-5 drops of this rubbed in my plams then run through my hair. Although it doesn&#x27;t control my hair like a pomade does, it gives my hair a healthy look and helps control the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a minimal odor and contrary to what you might think, does not smell like roses at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is organic and pure. The only downside and the reason I don&#x27;t use it as often as I&#x27;d like is that it is recommended that this be refrigerated. That just makes it inconvenient for me. But other than that, it&#x27;s a fine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I use various skincare lines and this product has to be the best finishing product ever! I use whatever skincare line and when I&#x27;m done applying cleanser,toner serum and moisturizer I put a small amount of the rosehip seed oil on top. The skin absorbs it so there&#x27;s nogreasy afterfeel. The end result is very smooth,radiant skin that stays so all day. Who knew? I use it in the evening as well so when Iwakeup I still have smooth, radiant skin.It sets an excellent base before foundation. Happy---outstanding product and this bottle will last a long time since you only need a small amount for face coverage.</li>
            <li> Was SO disappointed. First it came almost open in the box, and the odor was horrible. But then when I used it for over a month I saw NO results. My pores were becoming so large it was so gross. Just like olive oil, no difference. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Ive bought many things from amazon but this product really surprised me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this!  It&#x27;s an oil, and of course those of us with some acne prone skin (that I&#x27;ve now found to be from the chemicals in other products) get nervous - trust me, don&#x27;t be nervous.  This goes on and spreads so smoothly, then soaks in and leaves your skin feeling baby booty smooth and soft. So many wonderful benefits of this - I&#x27;m developing a sun spot (WHAT?!) on my temple area, I&#x27;m very excited to see if this will help reduce the appearance of it. I haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions to this - yes, the smell is &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;, but if you&#x27;ve ever hiked in mossy forests near rivers, you may actually enjoy the scent, I definitely don&#x27;t mind it. Great product, CLEAN organic product - no reason anymore to put synthetic chemicals on your skin!  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this Rosehip oil after reading it on one of the beauty review website, mainly for the wrinkles under my eye. I have started using it, but don’t see too much difference yet, it has been 2 weeks. I love that this comes with a pump, which dispenses the perfect amount. A little goes a long way. I love that it is not oily and doesn’t leave a residue on my face, it absorbs quickly into the skin. I use two pumps at night and put it over my face and neck. I mix one pump of it with sweet almond oil and put it under my eyes at night for wrinkles. I hope I will see some positive results soon.</li>
            <li> it has a horrid smell to it. Do not like the smell&lt;br /&gt;The dripper top leaks. Maybe this company needs to fix their issues before I would buy again. Sorry for the bad review.</li>
            <li> Bottle was in good condition. Rosehip oil has a nice rich&lt;br /&gt;consistency. A little goes a long way.  Skin is super soft!! Not the best smell&lt;br /&gt;but doesn&#x27;t linger.. overall great product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Organic Rosehip Seed Oil for several weeks now.  I wanted to wait until I&#x27;ve used for some time to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil.  It moisturizes my skin without looking overly oily.  I use this in conjunction with the Rose Water toner from the same company.  I feel like, at 39, my skin has never looked better.  I&#x27;ve been told by complete strangers that my skin looks fantastic and that it&#x27;s glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per instructions, I do store it in the refrigerator and use 3 pumps on my face and neck every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a bit of a fishy smell, but not enough to deter me from using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant with twins and love this oil! It keeps my skin moisturized and I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll keep the stretch marks away!!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil &amp; smell. Great customer service. I bought this oil to help with hyper pigmentation &amp; looks like it is working .</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that leaves the skin nourished and supple. This product has even reduced the apparition of pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to add to other ingredients for a face oil.  It&#x27;s purity is obvious &amp; it blends well with the other ingredients.  This is my third InstaNatural product &amp; I cannot praise them enough.  In my opinion, the quality &amp; price are wonderful.  I will continue to purchase more InstaNatural products in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week with te vitamin C an I love it.  My skin is softer and I see the fine lines in my face are less noticeable.  this is a great product.  I keep it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh, so its a nice cool treatment after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with rosacea recently. First it was lupus, then dermatitis and finally rosacea was the answer. I have literally tried every single salve, soap, oil and prescription medicine to try to get my skin back and nothing worked better than this. I don&#x27;t know that others will experience the same results, but for myself, this has totally been a saving grace for my face and it&#x27;s worth a try. I am so very happy with my purchase and grateful for the find.</li>
            <li> This product was used by my wife, and this review reflects her comments on the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first experience with using Rosehip Oil. The bottle was received well packaged for safe transport. My immediate first impression was that the quantity provided for this price is outstanding; Four ounces is a substantial amount that will last for a long time. The InstaNatural bottle is a thick, dark glass that feels of very high quality. The bottle top is a dropper that makes the product very easy to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with the moisturizing abilities of the Rosehip Oil. I really like that it is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil; my face never feels greasy when using it, and it seems to absorb very quickly into my skin. A small amount goes a very long way; just a few drops is enough to cover my entire face, the coverage is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would mention to potential purchasers of this product, is that it is recommended to keep the bottle in the refrigerator between uses. Not a big deal, but it certainly adds another step to the process of using it. Not a big deal though; and the cool temperature helps to make it all the more refreshing to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very happy with the product and the moisturizing properties of the Rosehip Oil. This is my second InstaNatural product (also have used their Rose Water), and my experience has been great on both counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for purposes of writing a review. This reflects my unbiased commentary.</li>
            <li> NICE QUALITY, WORKS AS EXPECTED, WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs well.  Love all the goodness of its Vitamin C content on my skin.  Will buy this product again for sure.</li>
            <li> THIS is what should be called liquid gold! If you know anything about oils, some do have a distinct smell which disappears in minutes.  This absorbs well into your skin and leaves you silky and with a nice glow, You only need a small amount which is easily dispensed from  the pump. I highly recommend this organic, yes organic rosehip oil!</li>
            <li> It makes skin look smoother. Dark spots lighter. Great product to try. Good price for 4 ounce bottle. lasts long.</li>
            <li> Got both argan oil and this oil and prefer this one. My skin just likes it more. Excellent and will order again.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my body.I didn&#x27;t use it on my face</li>
            <li> This is the best Rosehip oil I&#x27;ve ever order, it&#x27;s very pure and concentrated. Could the secret to beautiful skin lie in roses? The Ancient Mayans think so because they have been using it for years to treat dry skin and that is why Dr. Oz is sharing it with you today. He says Rosehip Oil has been found effective in treating issues including Eczema and Psoriasis, but is it right for you? Rosehip Oil is rich in Vitamin A and has often been referred to as “Mother Nature’s Retin-A” because of its anti-aging benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliates and reduces wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Repairs damaged, dry skin by adding back lost moisture, leaving it looking smoother and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is affordable and comes in a few varieties and costs around $10. Look for 100% Pure on the label.</li>
            <li> Does anyone else feel like the year is flying by, because I certainly do! How can it be almost May already? I don’t know, but it is and as much as I wish time would slow down just a bit, I am looking forward to the month of May. Not only is the weather beautiful, my birthday and Mother’s Day are in May. My birthday is just one week after Mother’s Day, so I get two weekends of celebrating and being spoiled in a row. I won’t lie, it’s pretty awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I’m asked for gift ideas this time of year, I often don’t know what to say, and when I try to think of Mother’s Day gift ideas to give to the special women in my life, I’m stumped too. This year though, I have a really great suggestion: Instanatural 100% pure rosehip seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always struggle with dry hands, nails, and cuticles. I feel like lotions just don’t work for me unless I put them on a dozen times a day, and who has time for that! I really hate how my dry hands look and feel though, so I’m forever looking for other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using InstaNatural 100% pure Rosehip Seed Oil for a week now and it is amazing. Seriously, after one application my hands started to look and feel better. I love how it absorbs and works so quickly. Plus, it’s all natural, has only one ingredient so you know you’re not putting weird chemicals on your skin, is Certified Organic and meets USDA Certified requirements.&lt;br /&gt;I use Instanatural 100% pure rosehip seed oil for my hands and nails, but it has many other uses too. It can be used as a moisturizer, an anti-aging agent, to help repair sun damage and scars, to make dry hair healthy and shiny, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as you are thinking about what to get the special women in your life for Mother’s Day, (or maybe treat yourself!) you might want to add this amazing Rosehip oil to your list</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t immediately love this product. Being an oil it took me a few times to learn how to use it without making a mess. But once I learned how to use it without a mess, I love it. My face feels amazing after using the Rose Hip for a few weeks. It goes on and absorbs quickly.Wears great under makeup with no pealing or flaking. My face isn&#x27;t oily or greasy after use. I also used it on a scar and my scar is less raised and less red so it is helping get rid of the scar. You can read my full review here [...] I would purchase this item once I run out. I received a bottle complimentary but the opinion expressed is all mine.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! I just love it. I have been using rose hip oil combine with my body lotion for stretch marks</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! It smells a little odd, and at first it was off putting, but after I saw how amazing my skin looked, I could easily look past the scent. It sort of smells like a mild toasted sesame oil, which isn&#x27;t bad, but just sort of weird to rub on your face. Luckily the scent dissipates within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how much I am in love with this product. The sample I received was fantastic and I have been raving to everyone since I got it! My skin looks younger, more dewy and fresh. Even my friends asked me what I&#x27;ve been doing! No more dry and rough patches, just smooth, beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face a night, apply my serums and creams and then finish with a few drops of this, massaged into my face and neck. It&#x27;s a very easy routine, and it feels wonderful! Great product! Must try!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on dry patches on my own skin, and for my son&#x27;s cradle cap and even diaper rash. It has worked wonders! My dry patches are gone and my son&#x27;s cradle cap is almost non-existent. I absolutely love this Rosehip oil. The best part is it&#x27;s organic, so I can use it for just about anything and know I&#x27;m using only the best on myself and my children.</li>
            <li> This is the best oil I&#x27;ve used as a facial moisturizer. It&#x27;s light and soaks in quickly. It has a delicate earthy scent that as a gardener I know well. The price per ounce is much lower than the fancy moisturizers I have used in the past. This has no chemicals, is 100% natural, and works better too. I will order more of this before this bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> I just gave 1 star this product. Nevertheless the final results can be seen after several months of use. At that time I will be pleased to re evaluate it.&lt;br /&gt;I believe it will deserve a full 5 star, so no worry for my ACTUAL opinion !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your follow up. Right now is too soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this - it&#x27;s my first time trying it and I love the results. Very good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great for healing acne scars &amp; preventing pimples. Works as a great moisturizer as well. Happy I got it</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  I am over 40 and live in a very dry climate where we also heat with wood so the air is very dry in the winter.  I am over 40 and so my skin can be a bit more dry.  I am always looking for natural products to use on my skin and hair and was excited about trying this organic rosehip seed oil.  I have been using this on my face after washing and before moisturizer.  I noticed a difference after just one day.  My skin looks much more hydrated and I am very happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this remember that a very little bit goes a long way, I use just a small amount and spread it all over my face and neck.  I have also used this on the ends of my hair when it is dry or flyaway and it works great IF you remember to just use a little bit!  Otherwise your hair will look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with this oil and will continue to use it and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have the benefits of using a face oil without it breaking my face out. Well I found it. Love everything about this oil. My skin feels so soft not oily at all. My complexion  is smoother. My skin has a nice glow in the mornings. I even use it under my makeup now as well. I also use the vitamins C serum with the Rosehip oil. And the price is amazing for such a large bottle. Love both products. Looking forward to trying the Retina A serum when I can.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described.</li>
            <li> it soaks right in and makes my skin look and feel fabulous, I add a little lemon oil to cut down on the vitamin e smell.</li>
            <li> Light and super absorbent. Using to correct some skin discoloration. It&#x27;s only been about a week, and I&#x27;m already seeing more progress than I did with expensive peels and scrubs. Woo hoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying nightly right after showering, then wrapping the skin while I sleep. During the day, I also try to protect the areas that I&#x27;m working on as much as possible.</li>
            <li> i am a first time user of this product, i am the type of girl who doesnt know much about beauty products cause im more of a tomboy type of girl so having saying that i didnt notice much changes in my skin with using this product but i do enjoy the smoothness and moisterizing that it left of my skin that i do continue to use it</li>
            <li> I was wondering why this was on sale. As soon as I opened it I knew. It smells rancid and like cod liver oil!! I am so disappointed. Of course I immediately returned it. The hunt continues for a good rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality oil at a great price. I like the absence of artificial fragrance and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, I have been using everyday and can see the change it has made in my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the stopper was shattered in transport and most of the oil was lost.I kept what I could. The company was wonderful and sent me a new bottle quickly. The rose hip oil is fantastic. I love this product and I am very happy with how this order turned out.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks yet 21 weeks, not sure what I was expecting receiving this but it smelt almost fishy, which I am not sure if that is normal but goes away after a few minutes after I apply it. Seems to work well for now :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to try Rosehip oil right after I read about its use by the former Victoria’s Secret model Miranda Kerr. According to her, this oil is the secret behind her gorgeous glow.&lt;br /&gt;After browsing the web I found this oil on Amazon and the price for it from this particular seller is just unbeatable. I don’t believe you can find a better price for such an amazing product anywhere else. And I’m really glad I did buy it. What I love most about this oil is that it’s an all natural product with no fillers, rich in antioxidants, essential fatty acids and on top of all that it’s a multi-purpose moisturizer with healing affects for face, skin, hair, nails, stretchmarks, scars, spots and even psoriasis and eczema. And you have this amazing product in a huge 4oz bottle which will last you for long and long months considering you are going to only need some 2-3 drops with each use.&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I didn’t quite like the oil when I first started using it. But it’s only because I had no experience with using any kind of natural oil for skin purposes so I was really conscious and even concerned over how it may affect my skin. Besides I have a normal skin which is naturally in a good condition so I don’t even need that much for it to look good and healthy. But we always strive for and want some improvement, right? So after reading all those wonderful reviews about this goodness I have been patiently using it gradually incorporating it into my daily beauty regime and I’m really happy I didn’t give up! The results may not be instant and noticeable right after the first or second use but you’ll get them eventually.&lt;br /&gt;I just love the fact that there are so many uses for this oil and you can be really creative when making your own natural beauty/bath/body products including it. I would just recommend to start with a really tiny amount of it (2-3 drops should do the job) if you are going to use it as a moisturizer and slowly increase it if needed. Always listen to your body! It never lies. I personally add it to my daily moisturizers and use it on a daily basis (many report a dewy glow to the skin right after using it as well as improvement in the tone of the skin). And I also started recently using it for other parts of my body, in particular my feet and hands. The results are practically instant. Just make sure to let it dry out first if you are going to use the oil on your feet and put some socks on. It is believed to help lock in the moisture better on the skin. And also try applying it right after taking the shower when the benefits from using beauty products are the highest. It is recommended to store it in the fridge so I guess that would be my last advice to whoever is going to read my review. So I highly recommend both the product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I shop a lot and had to deal with different kinds of sellers but can honestly say that InstaNatural is one of the best sellers I’ve ever had to deal with. They immediately send you follow up e-mails to check how it works for you and answer you right away if you happen to have any kind of questions. And the e-mails are so professional, friendly and contain so much useful information that you can only wish that all sellers were like them. I’m definitely going to come back again to them to make another purchase and would highly recommend them to all other buyers. This is indeed a very decent and professional seller. A real treasure to Amazon. A++++++++</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both so happy and pleased with it. It makes all of those dry patches look good. My husband uses it on his elbows and it leaves them looking nice and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been using this for a while now and we are both very pleased anyone who suffers from eczema knows how ugly it looks and we tend to want to hide them away, being its summer or almost summer I want to have them not looking so red and scales.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing oil. Sinks in quickly and can apply makeup soon after without any issues. I apply it both morning and evening before moisturizer and sunscreen. Also use it on hands, arms, legs etc. There is a slight odor to this oil, but within seconds it disipates and you will not even notice it. Original order was damaged in transit and InstaNatural contacted me asking why I requested a refund (I did not, Amazon automatically did because of carrier damage). I explained to instaNatural what happened and they offered to mail a free replacement. I had it in my hands within 2 days and have loved it ever since. I don&#x27;t notice any extraordinary benefits, but it is a superb moisturizer that I will keep in my routine.</li>
            <li> The results from using Insta Natural rosehip oil are wonderful!  Smoother skin, lighter brown spots, and less fine wrinkles!  I am ordering this for my friend!  Thank-you!&lt;br /&gt;Christine Barr</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this oil on my acne scars. It&#x27;s surprising to see that they are fading slowly but surely. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought rosehip seed oil, shortly after the purchase I received an email from the seller stating the qualities of a good pure oil. These included an amber color and slight odor. The oil I received then did have those qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS order however, is clear and lacks any smell. This leads me to believe it is either FAKE or highly DILUTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What dumb people. Tell you what real oil is like and then send you fake.</li>
            <li> It is a rich feeling oil that can moisturize and make your face feel so incredibly soft and smooth. This amazing oil is USDA Certified Pure, Organic, Unrefined, Cold pressed Rosehip Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is naturally rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega 6, 3 and 9) and Vitamin A and C that make it a face, hair, nail and skin restorer. It is a chemical and preservative free formula extracted from (Rosa Mosqueta) that provides natural and safe protection and total skin revitalization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe how amazing this oil helped my dry skin on my face but where I got the most benefit was on my elbows, heels and hands.  I have extremely dry skin due to Hypothyroid and RA, so I am constantly on the lookout for products that can alleviate the itching dry skin that I suffer with. I have even taken small drops and rubbed them into my scalp to stop the itching and it really does work. I do have dry hair also so it does not make my hair oily. I am not sure what it would do to someone who has oily hair, so I caution those who have oily hair to double check first before using in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil is recommended for aging, sun-damaged, dry, flaky, uneven, pigmented skin. It can be used to fight aging, reduce scars and marks, provide nourishment/hydration to skin, give protection and care to hair and nails. I do have to tell you that it does not have a rose like scent like the Moroccan Rose Water. InstaNatural believes in the earthy scent of pure oil so you won&#x27;t see the rose scent in this oil. Which is a good thing because wearing it could clash with your perfume or other fragranced products that you use. Sometimes, it&#x27;s best not to have a scent and this is one of those times.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip Oil is very moisturizing. A little bit goes a long way. It quickly absorbs so that there is no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I liked the oil - it was used in an oil blend.  The cap cracked and broke the first time I screwed it on.  The oil bottle was fine - no problem with oil or bottle.  Only had problem with the cap.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but it is very sticky and has a distinct odor.  When I first purchased this product, I used it at night.  After a few uses, I got tired of feeling like my face was sticking to the sheets and got tired of the odor.  I&#x27;ve kept in in the refrigerator, so I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
            <li> Smells funky. Weleda brand is much better</li>
            <li> Great oil. Highly recommend it. Make sure to refrigerate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product made any real difference in my skin. It&#x27;s lighter than other oils but I would prefer others such as vitamin E, coconut, olive, etc. The smell isn&#x27;t awful but it isn&#x27;t pleasant...smells like seaweed to me.</li>
            <li> Everything you&#x27;v heard about Rosehip Oil is true. It makes your skin glow, fine lines disappear, and acne scars lighten. I&#x27;ve been using a few drops after washing and toning my face twice a day. It&#x27;s non-greasy and seems to visually even out my skin tone. You really want to find a high-quailty organic oil, because there are major differences in results. I&#x27;ve found cheaper, adulterated oils make me break out (I have acne-prone skin with scars) but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I deal with dry skin all year round. I bought this along with the vitamin c serum and I like what it&#x27;s done for my dry skin so far. I read reviews about the smell and that it&#x27;s strong for some people, but the smell didn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and smells in beauty products, so maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to using products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a small amount to my legs, which tend to be really dry after the winter season. A tiny dab on my frizzy hair, and I use this at night on the back of my thighs for stretch marks. It&#x27;s been one month and I&#x27;ve seen improvement already. Usually I don&#x27;t expect to see results from beauty products for at least 8 weeks. The rosehip oil is organic and certified, so that&#x27;s always a plus. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy another bottle after this first one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really excited to try Insta Natural&#x27;s Rosehip oil. Lately, it&#x27;s been hot and dry where I live and my skin gets super dried out, especially on my legs, but my face needs extra hydration too-so I don&#x27;t get wrinkled up like a prune. This rosehip oil instantly relieves dry skin and leaves skin hydrated for a long time. You can use it all over and it works as good on your face as it does on your legs. I&#x27;ve even tried a few drops on the ends of my hair. The heat and dryness really takes a toll on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Organic (big plus) Rosehip oil comes in a long lasting, dark, glass bottle with an easy to use pump. It&#x27;s huge and when so little product goes such as long way, this bottle will last for months. I&#x27;ve been wanting to see how the Rosehip oil stands up to Argon oil which I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of years and I think the Rosehip oil works just as well, if not better for skin than Argon oil which I think works better on hair. The Rosehip oil keeps my skin smoother longer than the Argon oil-though it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or oily especially when I use it on my face and neck-this makes skin silky smooth where Argon is a little heavier and more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose hip oil is high in Omegas and helps with aging and dry skin. It&#x27;s also good for scars and stretch marks. This will stay freshest in the fridge which makes it feel nice and cool to put on when it&#x27;s roasting outside. I was sent Insta Natural Rose Hip oil to try and I really like this product, especially for summer but I am sure when winter hits and the heaters come on, it will be just as useful. Great product in a 4 ounce bottle that will last a long time. Insta Natural has a really great line of oils and natural skin care products.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is an interesting product.  It doesn&#x27;t quite behave like any other oil I have used.  I was afraid that the fragrance would be overly floral and cause sinus issues, but it instead smells very mildly of a cooking oil similar to sunflower.  When applied, it sort of sinks right into the skin without leaving a slick surface.  That makes it superior for treating dry skin compared to standard heavy duty lotions.  It does add some shine, which is important to keep in mind for use on the face.  It can also be used on the hair and might be preferred if Argan or emu oils weigh down your hair too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This InstaNaturals version seems to be very high quality, and the price is great for such a large amount.  If you are interested in trying rosehip oil, this is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the company for providing a review sample.</li>
            <li> I just received this product.&lt;br /&gt;Love what it does already!&lt;br /&gt;Has no offensive smell I read about reviewing this oil and feels like silk on skin, healthy glow a radiant result.&lt;br /&gt; I use only a few drops, absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Has lessened lines around my eyes and neck overnight!&lt;br /&gt;Sold</li>
            <li> Love the large bottle.  Too soon to tell how it works.</li>
            <li> It really penetrate well into the skin but not greasy to the touch, if they can improve the packaging to be not leaking, then it will be a very good product.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and I am in love with this!! I can see a difference in my skin in just a few day. I put it on twice a day because I love it.  I had company that came over and they couldn&#x27;t get over my skin.  My friend replied to me, &amp;#34;Your skin is glowing&amp;#34; what do you use?? I than told her.  I am also going to give this to my two best friends for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I ordered the rosehip oil after reading so many great reviews about it and have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am in LOVE with it!! Can totally tell a difference in my skin and it helps my makeup go on so much better.  I also had a great experience with the customer service and will most definitely do business with this company again in the future.</li>
            <li> I did alot of research about rosehip oil and different brands of rosehip oil before ordering InstaNatural organic rosehip seed oil. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this! after a very long and harsh winter in the midwest, my skin was very dry and I was using high end moisturizers. The first time I used this oil I applied it at bedtime, the next morning my face looked so radiant, smooth and velvety, it was amazing!! I never thought anything could work like that. I also have very dry under eyes and this is the BEST under eye serum ever, I was using philosophy&#x27;s Miracle worker under eye gel, which was ok but not great, this oil is far more superior in hydrating the under eye area and I also use it as a make up primer because it goes on so smoothly and soaks into the skin so quickly, no more expensive make up primers!!!&lt;br /&gt;I now use this oil every night after cleansing my face, I apply 5 drops and start with under eyes and work out towards the rest of my face. some times I apply my Philosophy Miracle worker night cream on top of the oil, and my face has never looked better!!! I will never be without this oil!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a huge bottle, so I have a dark brown 1 OZ bottle that I fill and keep in my bathroom drawer and I store the big bottle in the fridge, this ensures it&#x27;s freshness.</li>
            <li> With all the natural products that are out there but my main benefit was to look for one that will me smooth out my skin and reduce the appearance of my stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 kids 3 1/2 years apart and my youngest literally stretched my tummy out beyond recognition. I have used several products that claim to improve and smooth blah blah blah but none has shown any consistency. I got to review this Organic Rosehip Oil and just said hey why not because nothing else has worked. After 2 weeks of daily and evening use on my tummy, I am pleased to say I am back in a bikini. As much as I still have a nice figure, my tiger stripes (stretch marks) really bother me and shot my confidence down. I was down in FL recently and really love how my tummy looks even after just 2 weeks. I am definitely continuing use to see how much more improvement I can get.&lt;br /&gt;Now I know that the smell isnt the best but really it isnt that bad. I expected it not to smell like perfume has been added because it clearly states pure, unrefined organic rosehip oil. If you want to know a little trick which I do to help with the smell (which isnt overbearing) I use the rosehip oil in areas that I need then smooth over a very tiny bit of coconut oil. The texture isnt sticky or greasy and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> Did not like this brand! Do not recommend... It was very thin and laid on top the skin it was clear and risehip seed oil is dark</li>
            <li> I gave this product this score because I tried it on my stretch marks and I was able to see a slight change in their appearance. I also noticed less itchiness on my scalp when I used this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil in conjunction with the Vitamin C serum.  I put the Vit. C on first, let it dry, then put the oil over it.  It may take a while for the oil to soak into your skin, but my skin looks radiant!</li>
            <li> I love the stuff. However, you do  have to wash off excess each night.&lt;br /&gt;Gets into your pours- really moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive these oils to try, I use the  rosehip seed oil in a rose petal salve and used it on my elbows and they have stayed soft for along time!  vitamin C is used to hydrate the skin and hoping to lighten the dark patches on my face. And using the argan oil for shinier hair!!</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many moisturizers for my dry skin (hot Arizona sun) and have finally found rosehip oil.  I use it all over my body and after 2 weeks see the difference-WOW-----------there is no smell to this oil and it absorbs quickly.  I put in on in the morning and at night------no greasy feeling after rubbing it in.  I have use it on my face and it is great.  I have tried many (cheap and expensive) face moisturizers and none work as well as Rosehip oil-there is no stinging like I get with the face moisturizers-------great for my lips too and I use it on my nails!  It arrived quick and well packaged.  I need an 8oz or more bottle!!!!!!  Great Product.</li>
            <li> So I put a couple drops of this in to my conditioner and I have noticed an improvement. My hair is shiner and softer. I have also noticed an improvement in my dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I also started using this in place of my face cream. After my shower I dry my face and neck and rub a few drops in. Since having my last baby a year ago I have dry skin patches on my face. Since starting to use this oil I have noticed that the dry skin is almost completely gone. Looking forward to finding other ways to use this.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for a review.</li>
            <li> Yes!  Finally, a rosehip seed oil that passes the test.  The label clearly states in the ingredient list that the only ingredient is 100% pure &amp; cold pressed rosehip seed oil (certified organic).  It is stamped with the USDA organic symbol, as well as EcoCert. They state Latin name of the plant from which it is extracted (bonus points).  The color is also telling.  Rosehip oil that is unrefined, should be reddish is color.  This one definitely had a reddish hue to it. What&#x27;s the Hype About? *It&#x27;s only vegetable with Vitamin A (Retinol, a.k.a wrinkle reducer) *It has been shown in studies to reduce the appearance of scars, wrinkles, and UV damage. *It prevents signs of aging (no, it doesn&#x27;t prevent you from actually aging;)) and helps those of us with an uneven skin tone---- BUT!! *If you have oily skin, or if you have acne prone skin, be aware that it can block your pores. Yikes! *Rosehip seeds contain vitamin C, but a lot of it is lost in the extraction process. *It has a short life, 6 months for the cold-pressed, and must be refrigerated.  Use this great oil!  Don&#x27;t let it be like the good towels your mom only pulled out when you had company.  I received this product at a discount, in return for my honest review and feedback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using their Rosehip Seed Oil, Argan Oil &amp; Moroccan Rosewater for the past month and I am extremely happy with the results. I wanted to give it some time before reviewing it and my skin has reacted really well to it. I use the Argan Oil in the morning as a day moisturizer, the Moroccan Rosewater as a toner at night &amp; the Rosehip Seed Oil as my night moisturizer. I&#x27;ve also used the oils in my hair, nails &amp; neck to great results. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer &amp; would recommend their products.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is possible..but I actually noticed difference in the texture of the skin in just a week!</li>
            <li> My skin, at 71 is begAinning to look better than it has in probably 30 years.  I wish I could bathe in it.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered the potency of essential oils for skin care. I&#x27;ve been mixing rosehip with helichrysum oil for my face and puberty stretch marks. It&#x27;s only been 2 months and my 10-year old stretch marks are 70% gone (I&#x27;M NOT EXAGGERATING!!). I also noticed the micro lines on my forehead fading drastically. I&#x27;m never going back to using expensive chemical-laden products ever again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, but this product has helped moisturize my dry post-menopausal skin! It appears to soften the lines around my lips &amp; eyes and has started to make my skin glow again! Good bargain&amp; fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> The rosehip seed oil is amazing for sunburns. I&#x27;ve been applying it to my neck and shoulders after several hours of harsh sunlight [ahh, the first sunburn of the season..], and it speed-heals my skin- pretty much overnight! It also helps fade scars [quickly]. It&#x27;s very moisturizing [duh], and great to mix with lotions. Awesome stuff to have!</li>
            <li> When I first used the oil, I was a little overwhelmed by the smell. Rosehip seed oil is hard to explain, but it is definitely not a rose smell! It is a mixture between a musky, woody, and nutty smell. It is not my favorite smell in the world, but I got used to it after several times of using it. Just don&#x27;t worry that the oil is bad because it is not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil definitely helped my scars. After a week of using the oil, I could tell that my stretch mark scars looked fainter. That is exactly what I wanted because I hate the red look of them. Also, the rosehip oil helped moisturize my dry patches of skin on my body. It was nice to see my heels and my elbows become soft again. With all my yard work, my skin dries out fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil comes in a fairly large bottle and I only use 1-3 drops. This bottle will last about 6 months unrefrigerated and 1 year refrigerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> i like how it soften my hair not so much and the smell dont realy like it but is ok.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip Seed Oil is 100% organic.  You can use this moisturizer on your hair, skin and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  moisturizes dry and damaged skin&lt;br /&gt;  reduces stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;  diminishes the look of old marks and scars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the benefits of the rosehip seed oil.  I have been using it on various scars and marks that I have on my legs.  I have become really self conscious about these marks and am so happy to see them lightening.  I am hoping that they will get even lighter with continued use, and then maybe I won&#x27;t feel so funny wearing my shorts.&lt;br /&gt;IT also works great on extra dry skin like your elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using this oil for it&#x27;s many uses.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> After having tried Argan Oil with really great results, I was really excited to try this [[ASIN:B00IP42FBA Organic Rosehip Seed Oil by InstaNatural]].  The benefits of Rosehip Seed Oil are somewhat similar Argan Oil, but I don&#x27;t mind the over lapping and use them both together but on separate part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use Argan Oil on my hair, so I have been using this product on my face and hands.  What I have most enjoyed about this product is the moisturizing nature it has.  I have tough hands and do very rugged hands on work and I like that this product almost rolls back time on the roughness I expose my hands to.  Really has softened my hands and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a 4oz (120ml) bottle with a pump top. Using only a couple drops per application, this product size seems to last forever and I find the pump dispenser helps me to get even amounts for application without going overboard with the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this [[ASIN:B00IP42FBA Organic Rosehip Seed Oil by InstaNatural]].  One tip that is mentioned on the bottle is to keep the product refrigerated to extend the usable life of the product.  I would have never thought so I&#x27;m glad they mention that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Love it!  Was using another brand that cost more but I feel is the se quality.  I use this oil for everything.  Out it in my conditioner as an extra treatment esp after a day at the pool or beach.  Great company very attentive to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This item is wonderful!  While I have only been using it for a short time, I have noticed that my skin feels softer and has a more even, glowing appearance.  I bought it to help with wrinkles, dark spots, and rosacea.  My skin does appear to be smoothing out and the dark spots already appear to be getting lighter.  My rosacea has not been irritated by this product at all.  In fact, my skin feels soothed and the redness has been less apparent.  The product is an oil but feels quite light and absorbs quickly.  I am very pleased with this product and am excited to see even more wonderful results as I use it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> has a very funky smell.Smells exactly the same as the red raspberry seed oil I purchased at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give it a try,will blend with some other essential oils to cover the funky smell,it kinda smells like&lt;br /&gt;castor oil,but they both say 100% pure/natural unrefined,so I assume they did not use another carrier oil. If they&lt;br /&gt;did it is not listed.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I made a gentle face oil for a friend that has a little acne problem and so far it&#x27;s been helping.  I recommend the Argan oil as well!</li>
            <li> Now you can have skin like a rose petal- literally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My SO helped me review this product: Insta natural 100% pure rosehip seed oil. A little bit does go a long way and it does make my skin feel soft. I was hoping for a bit more of a floral fragrance but it does have a nice, light, non irritating smell. This is nice for deeper moisturizing than regular lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smell myself. Tried some on a old scar, seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rcvd a sample for review.</li>
            <li> This product is great because of the size. Most of the other rosehip oil products on amazon are 2 OZ or smaller so it&#x27;s definitely worth getting this one for convenience. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I do like the Rosehip Seed Oil.  I like the way it makes my skin feel and have noticed a more even tone to my face.  It does have the earthly scent but that is gone by the time I have finished putting it on my face.  I will recommend InstaNatural&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you InstaNatursl for offering such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I add one pump of this to one pump of my regular moisturizer and it just makes my skin glow! I&#x27;ve had extremely dry skin since starting menopause and this has really boosted the moisture level of my skin. I don&#x27;t feel like an alligator anymore!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Organic Rosehip Oil and am very pleased with this product. It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves my face/hands feeling soft.  It does not leave an oily residue. I am prone to occasional breakouts, but have not had one while using this product. Rosehip oil has a distinct scent, but it is very mild and fades quickly. Another bonus is that a little bit goes a long way.  This is a 4 oz. bottle and will last quite a while. Excellent customer service, as well.</li>
            <li> I am using this on my nails, hands and feet. It is a great skin oil for dry skin. The smell is not bad at all, and it is worthwhile for your dry skin. Maybe I am not as sensitive to some odors as others but I usually have a pretty good sniffer and it was fine with me.</li>
            <li> Great product-I use it every day.  Quick shipping and price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about rosehip seed oil, so I decided to give it a try.  At first, I was worried that this oil might not suit my skin type, but it turned out very well.  The smell is quite fishy, but the product is very effective.  My skin looks more clear and feels more nourished.</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I use this as soon as I get out of the shower to &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; the moisture. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be any better for my skin, but my husband actually noticed. If he noticed, it&#x27;s making a difference. What I like most is, it keeps my skin looking hydrated all day and actually changes the texture of my skin. I am 53 and have little moisture left in my hands since they are always in water. One squirt rubbed into my hands makes my hands soft and smooth and it protects my hands, even in water, until I use soap. One awesome side effect...I have great cuticles now.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product!  Find out what your awesome side effect is...</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product, very satisfied &amp; the customer service was awesome.</li>
            <li> I have bought a lot of pricey skin care and the rose hip oil makes my skin softer than any of the big name products with ingredients I cannot begin to pronounce!</li>
            <li> This company is great they really follow up with you and send you all the information you need. I used it last night on my husband&#x27;s scalp just one  drop and I massaged it making him feel relaxed and his scalp was smooth. It does not smell like flowers (Rose) to me it smells a little like green tea. I used it on my face this morning just one drop with my wet freshly clean face and it was a great a experience. Will come back in month to give you my experience since this is just my first impression.</li>
            <li> first of all the oil has a rancid smell (like fish) but that&#x27;s because it has omega fatty acids so don&#x27;t listen to the clueless reviewers saying that it&#x27;s wasted or expire due to the smell (they are dumb and don&#x27;t know much about this oil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip seed oil contains Vitamin c which helps combat acne,broken capillaries (not sure if I spelled it right) and it also helps the skin produce more collagen which will make you look younger and make your face or skin glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really get this oil for all that stuff (but it&#x27;s a bonus) I got it for my rosacea which has been minimized by the use of this oil daily twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a good oil when I use one, and I should know because if a lotion or a oil contains some other chemical crap, my face will start to irritate and feel itchy and I will also get pimples, but not with this oil, my pimples are going away,the oil absorbs quickly,and the areas in which I apply the oil to feels relaxing and sort of like this cold gentle breeze (don&#x27;t know how to explain it but it feels good).</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serums are all the rage right now and what’s not to like? Organic, natural beauty products that actually work? Yes, please! But if you are like me you think mostly in terms of citrus fruits as prime sources of Vitamin C. Like me you would be wrong! The fruit of the wild rose, or rose hips, have been eaten for centuries for their Vitamin C to ward off scurvy and other ailments when citrus fruits were not available. Rosehip oil is particularly good for circulatory problems and so I first looked to InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil for increasing the blood circulation in my face. Better blood circulation mean better cell repair and smoother brighter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 100% pure, certified organic, Rosehip Seed Oil by InstaNaturals contains no fillers and comes in a large 4 ounce bottle. More than twice the size of the usual Vitamin C serum.  Just 2 or 3 drops massaged into the face and neck will hydrate, reinvigorate and even skin tone. However, it may be the exception that proves the rule, ‘a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.’ It does not. Rosehip Seed Oil smells, well, kind of yucky. The scent dissipates quickly though and is certainly not so unpleasant that I wouldn’t use it at all. It’s just that it is a natural product with not added chemical fragrances so it doesn’t smell they way we have too often come to expect beauty products to smell. Fake. And to our detriment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price makes this oil just right for a Vitamin C serum that can be used all over the body. InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil works well on scars and stretch marks, and trust me, I had plenty to test the theory. I found the serum works quickly on newly formed scars but is no slouch with old scars and blemishes either. If I were pregnant I would never be with out this product. Not just to get belly rubs but to help prevent stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Rosehip Seed Oil a bit heavy for my hair but it worked miracles on my cuticles and the heels of my feet. My feet get so dry that sometimes my feet are more hooves than anything human. Liberal application of InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil right after a soaking bath has made them so soft and baby pink I almost want to show you a picture. (Almost.) I just rub the oil into my feet after soaking and exfoliating, pull on some cotton socks, and hit the bed. The next morning, no more angry bird talons! That’s a product worth its weight in gold during sandal season.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.feet get so dry that sometimes my feet are more hooves than anything human.

            <li> This is a huge bottle of rosehip oil. Refrigeration after opening is suggested. This 100% organic, natural oil has many uses. Only need a few drops and it is not greasy or oily at all. 110% satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love the size! And the way it soaks right in with no oily feel! I will definitely keep using this! My skin feels smoother already! Now I hope it helps the wrinkles too!</li>
            <li> This will NOT smell like roses.  Enjoy the NUMEROUS skin benefits of a nice concentrated rosehip oil without the overpowering smell of roses.  Great bottle, great price, packaged well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! Rosehip oil in general is really good for your skin (especially if you have scars that need healing) and this one is as good (if not better) than all the others I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m very fond of the big bottle because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to run out at a moment&#x27;s notice!</li>
            <li> This is my second review. Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month, can&#x27;t say enough how much I love it. Barely touched my cream since I got the oil. I use it on my face, my arms, and legs. Feels very light on and does magic to my skin. I don&#x27;t usually use it on my forehead since I have oily skin there. It smells like freshly cut tree branch. Very refreshing. Highly recommand it!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that the old saying, &amp;#34;A little bit goes a long way,&amp;#34; applies to this product.  Two drops is all I need to do my entire neck and face.  I have had this for a couple of weeks and found that this product--for me, anyways--works best at night.  I wash my face, shave, and apply the rose hips before I hit the sack.  It&#x27;s a bit oily, but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my pillow. There is a slight earthy smell as soon as you put it on, but in a few minutes it disappears.  I tend to have dry facial skin and even have to apply moisture in the  afternoon, but since using this, I have only had to apply my regular moisturizer once in the morning.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The rose oil arrived super quickly and in perfect condition.  I appreciate that there are no additives and that it is organic and of good quality. It feels natural and my skin is responding well to it. I love the followup email with tips for usage and the great customer service. A great product and company.</li>
            <li> I love it will buy more</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic , my skin loves it, I love it, natural product easy to read is the way to go! It worked a thousand year ago and it works now, our skin is made to receive natural oil and not stuff you cannot pronounce  great product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Began using product upon arrival. It is a light oil that goes on evenly and feels wonderful. I will provide more feedback after I have used the the oil for an extended period.</li>
            <li> I use this when I have dry patches on my face and it has been the only thing that has worked so quickly. I have had some stubborn spots, and as soon as I use this, it&#x27;s all good :)</li>
            <li> So, I received this in conjunction with the rose hip seed oil from InstaNatural as a trial. I have to say….I am VERY impressed with their natural skincare line. Actually so impressed, that I ridded my medicine cabinet of all the ridiculously expensive skincare items I have used in the past. Goodby Strivectin! Goodby Skinceuticals! Goodby Cellex! My 50 year old skin just loves the InstaNatural line apparently….and what a pleasant surprise! I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts….not a ONE with this natural line. Had I known this, I would not have invested a small fortune in the &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; revolutionary skin care &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34; touted by Drs &amp;#34;so and so&amp;#34;. With that said…I will continue using InstaNatural…my skin just loves it AND I love it too! I currently use the Morrocan Rose Water, Rosehip Oil and the B3 serum. I think I am going to try their Argan oil for my hair next. I cannot say enough great things about this company and will continue to order their products as long as they are around. (I was not paid to review, nor coaxed into writing a review by the way) Best Regards.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry skin</li>
            <li> The rosehip seed oil has a darker amber color and a very strong, earthy scent; it makes me think of freshly brewed tea. I personally like this type of scent (I call them &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; scents), but if you prefer unfragranced products, it probably isn&#x27;t for you, just because it&#x27;s so strong. Note that it isn&#x27;t an artificially added fragrance, nor do I think it smells bad--it&#x27;s just something to keep in mind if you don&#x27;t like products with a distinct fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip seed oil is also slightly dry and works great on the face. It can also be used on hands, nails, feet, and body. This type of oil is supposed to help with scars, sunburns and sun damage, thanks to high levels of vitamins A and C, though I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say for sure if that&#x27;s the case. I do know that it&#x27;s an excellent day or night moisturizer, layers well under makeup, and leaves my face very soft and glowy without any shininess or grease. I felt like my face looked more refreshed after using this as an overnight moisturizer, like I&#x27;d gotten more sleep than I really had.</li>
            <li> Amazing company really appreciate their customer service.  love the oil, it makes my skin very soft and easier to put on make up and I think it&#x27;s gotten rid of my blackheads on my nose.  No luck with discoloration but that was a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned to them that I was going to buy a bottle for my boss and they offered to send me one for free!&lt;br /&gt;Pls. Try this stuff.  I have very sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had a problem.  I&#x27;m usually very cautious with new products, I start once every other day but I took a chance and I&#x27;ve been using this stuff 3 times a day and no side affects.</li>
            <li> I use this every night as a moisturizer and it has made a big difference in the way my skin looks every day. I have combination, sensitive skin, so I was hesitant to put oil on my face but it turns out a little oil does wonderful things.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is a great moisturizer for my face that doesn&#x27;t make my face oily. I like it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Rosehip oil about a month and I&#x27;m very please with the product. I was using another oil that I could no longer find and was hesitate to switch to another brand. I&#x27;m glad I did - the oil makes my skin soft and younger looking without the harsh chemicals and it was happy to find that the oil is organic. I also found the Insta natural Vitamin C Serum which I use at night and the Rosehip oil in the morning. The combination has resulted in a noticeably smoother and clearer complexion. I would recommend both of these products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I first started using rosehip seed oil to combat the dark circles/bags under my eyes.The smell to me was a bit off-putting, not really bad, but kind of nutty. At first I didn&#x27;t notice much difference with use but I kept up with using it in my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; About 2 months in, I looked noticeably more well-rested. After 8, I&#x27;m in love with this stuff. At 31 I&#x27;m getting carded all the time again (not so much before), and new people I meet often assume I&#x27;m in college. Haha, suckers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I add a small amount of tea tree oil in about a 1/4 ratio to this, with or without a carrier oil, and apply it right after washing my face. It absorbs quickly and I no longer notice a smell: either I&#x27;ve gone nose blind, or the tea tree deodorizes it a bit.&lt;br /&gt; This is great with acne-prone sensitive skin, I have almost no break outs and my old acne scars have diminished significantly. I&#x27;ve even got in the habit of adding this after my shaving routine to effectively combat razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A bottle lasts me about 6 months, so it&#x27;s way more cost effective than even store-brand creams that are mostly fillers.</li>
            <li> Love that this product comes in a dark bottle plus it is so easy to disperse.  The rosehip oil is in a spray bottle - so much easier to use as opposed to other products that you have to shake and shake to get out the oil.  Only takes a couple sprays to evenly spread the oil over your face and neck.  Love the way it makes my face feel - very soft.  Even after just a few days of using this product I can see a difference in my facial tone.  I also like InstaNatural - very conscientious .... they contacted me to be sure I had all the info on this product.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Works good especially because I have dry patches in my skin! My face can be problematic which this does a good job of keeping moisturizer without breaking out my face! I haven&#x27;t seen it take care of dis colored spots but I also haven&#x27;t been using it that long... I don&#x27;t use it everyday! But I love it</li>
            <li> First I must warn you that it smells like vitamins.  That is what I kept telling myself when I applied it to my face the first night. I call it my skin vitamins. It is quite a heavy oil but my skin drinks it.  Even the first morning after applying it I could feel a difference.  My skin was so soft. I have been having trouble with my nails breaking but just from putting this on my face there is some improvement there as well.  Didn&#x27;t think I would love it after the first whiff but the results make me chant vitamins for your face.  The best part is this one is really organic.... not like some others.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit to notice any changes—maybe a week or two—but I think it was my skin adjusting to it. Plus I think it is harder to notice differences on your self when you stare at yourself in the mirror several times a day every day. My husband started noticing my skin clearing up before I did. He has been complimenting me on it frequently since I began using it. I put it on every night before I go to bed. Overall, I feel like my face is softer and looks clearer and more even-toned. I have a bad habit of picking at my face, but since I started using the rosehip oil, I have been trying to be more conscious of not doing so. I figure if I am using a quality product, I should treat my face with the same quality. I also notice if I go a couple days without using the oil. A couple times I have gone out of town for the weekend and did not bring the oil along. I notice those couple days, my face starts to break out and flare up again. But the second I get home and start using it again, it looks better. I definitely think I will have to purchase a second bottle for travel. I know a lot of people mentioned the smell, but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me. It definitely smells very earthy but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering or anything and it goes away rather quickly. I actually like that it&#x27;s not perfumed and strong and I have to smell it all night.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have to say that I am truly satisfied with this product. I use this primarily on my skin and it has done wonders. This is the only thing that I use on my face now, apart from soap, and I don&#x27;t remember my skin looking so even toned and youthful. I am only in my twenties, but I swear it looks like it took years off my skin. I will most definitely continue to use this product in my daily routine. I sincerely thank you for the wonderful product. 5/5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed. I was hoping it had a rose tint smell. Nothing. I will need to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have so enjoyed using the organic rosehip seed oil.  It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin so I can use it in the mornings under my makeup without having to wait a long time for it to absorb.  My skin feels SUPER smooth.  I use it on my cuticles and when I told my manicurist about it she said KEEP USING IT.  She barely had to trim my cuticles, which helps protect my nails.  I use it on my hands and I have noticed my 51 year old skin doesn’t look as “crepey” and thin.  I also use it on my lower arms and elbows, and I have noticed my arm skin just looks smoother and my elbows are noticeably softer.  To me it smells like amber, which smells healthy to me, but the scent does not linger.  I love that I can pronounce the ingredient in it…  I love that it is organic…  and I love the price.  And on Amazon it’s free shipping.  I love that too.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Well, been using it faithfully twice a day since I received it about a week ago.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic results as far as diminishing dark spots etc.  I will update my results as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, very fast absorbing and love the smell. will buy again!</li>
            <li> i just got it today and i immediately opened it up to smell it because so many reviews said it stinks like fish but it doesn&#x27;t stink to me it just smells like a natural oil. i can&#x27;t give a fair rating yet, because i just got it and this is my first time using it but when i put it on my face it felt fine and not too oily.  UPDATE: since using this product i&#x27;ve noticed small pimples on my face and i am not acne prone nor did i have acne bumps before using this. but to be fair, i also started using another new  product around the same time i started using this so i don&#x27;t know which one broke me out. the other product was organic HDPE Shea Butter by Essential Depot which i ordered from Amazon. i usually don&#x27;t use two products around the same time i usually like to try them out by themselves so i can accurately evaluate the results, but i became impatient :-( and now I don&#x27;t know which product broke my skin out! :-(</li>
            <li> I have been using organic pure rosehip oil for about 5 years for face, neck, chest, and hands.  I change brand often because it is hard to find always the same available.  The InstaNatural oil is like it is supposed to be: deep yellow color and warm earthy smell.</li>
            <li> I mix a very small amount of this ( the bottle should last a long time as it only takes a couple drops each use) with this same company&#x27;s vitamin C oil and that is all I need on my combination skin. My skin is smoother and just looks healthier. This has replaced all those expensive moisturizers I have been purchasing over the years. I am  58 years old and have finally found something that will moisturize without clogging my pores and causing problems. I will being buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and I noticed no difference.  I have been using it on my face to soften wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This bottle of oil will last a LONG time -- each little drop of oil goes a very long way. I was hesitant to use it on my face because I have oily skin and break out, but I didn&#x27;t notice any increase in break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a mild smell, but it is not unpleasant. It is a very nice almost &#x27;dry&#x27; feeling oil, so you don&#x27;t feel all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use very little, and only on the areas that are dry and patchy. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product after using it for three weeks, generally in the morning after I wash my face, cleanse with Moroccan Rose and then put a little of this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample to try and review.</li>
            <li> This is quality rosehip oil right here. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of rosehip oil along my skin care journey and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried. Quality rosehip oil should be a dark amber color (like this one is) and not watery (this one is not watery at all). All rosehip oil has a somewhat weird earthy scent, some may think it has &#x27;gone bad&#x27; when smelling this, but trust me the smell it will emit when it actually has gone rancid is much stronger, almost fishy. More about the actual product from Instanatural...&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that it comes in a large bottle and is such a great value!  The pump is wonderful because I&#x27;m pretty clumsy and always end up spilling dropper bottles. The pump is also good because the product is not exposed to light and air like it would be if you were having to open a dropper bottle all the time to use it.&lt;br /&gt;As previously stated the oil is somewhat thick - I find one pump is enough to cover my face, or two pumps if applying to neck and décolleté also. It feels oily for a minute or two (of course, it IS an oil) but soaks in quickly and leaves skin glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I personally can not use rosehip oil on a daily basis because my pores start to clog, so I like using it 3-4 times a week. It is very moisturizing and soothing on sensitive skin. Whenever I try a new product and it doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin, I go straight to rosehip oil - it seems to have healing properties and calms my skin right down instantly. I also love using it under and around my eyes as it helps with fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;This Rosehip Oil by Instanatural is a wonderful product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with combination (what I have), dry, or generally sensitive skin. I think it may be too heavy for oily skin but can&#x27;t say for sure because I don&#x27;t have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love the InstaNatural Rosehip Oil.  I use it on my face and It leaves it very hydrated without leaving it oily which I love.  I love the fact that it comes in a spray or pump bottle which eliminates wasting of the oil.  BTW it comes in a big bottle so you get a lot for the money.  The oil has helped my normally dry complexion immensly  and I will most definitely order another bottle as soon as I run out. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> Love the glow after 1day and my skin continued to improve each day.  Pretty good for 74  year old skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I blend it in with my moisturizers or a few drops in my hand for my skin. Haven&#x27;t yet to try on my hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for a variety of purposes. I mainly take advantage of the moisturizing aspect of the serum. I&#x27;ve been using this on rough patches, like my elbows and feet. They instantly feel smoother and healthier. Also, in the hot summer months, I don&#x27;t want to use a facial moisturizer that&#x27;s heavy or greasy. So instead, I&#x27;ve been using just a few drops of the Rosehip Seed Oil on my face. It&#x27;s light and pleasant feeling. Plus, I&#x27;ve found that it works great as a makeup base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is huge and a little goes a long way so it will last forever. Also, the dropper makes things easy and mess-free. Lastly, the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s a organic type of smell and goes away after 2 minutes. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Oil is the real thing with&lt;br /&gt;powerful organic rosehip seedoil, linolenic, oleic acid,&lt;br /&gt;vitamins A and C. The preparation is also rich in antioxidants&lt;br /&gt;and beta carotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The preparation may be used to massage the face, neck and&lt;br /&gt;scalp using gentle strokes. The product is cold pressed, fast&lt;br /&gt;absorbing and fragrance free. Always check with your health&lt;br /&gt;care provider for potential allergic reactions, if applicable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a moisturizer on my face for about a month.  I notice that my skin looks more radiant and it definitely feels soft and silky.  I love that it is all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> this item is great o hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it smells? It makes my skin smell burnt!! It smells nothing like roses</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try for free Organic  Rosehip Oil from this company, normally I do not post a review but I need to say I&amp;#34;m very satisfied, it&#x27;s almost six weeks since I have been using this product day and night and my face looks much better more soft, fresher and younger and my husband has noticed the difference too. I have not used any commercial face creams anymore since I got this product, also I&#x27;m using Insta Natural Vitamin C-Serum and the difference with these two products together is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much to this company for this great present and the opportunity to try such wonderful products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my partner and she absolutely loves it.  It has cleared up her facial complexion and now her face is clear and glowing. InstaNatural also has amazing customer service.  They followed up to see how we were liking the product and then offered to send us free samples.  Can&#x27;t beat that :)</li>
            <li> In have been using this oil for a few weeks and I really like it.The rosehip seed oil is very good as a moisturizer and skin protector for wind and salt air, I live beside the ocean.This product more than meets my expectations...great results!!!</li>
            <li> HG!  My &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; hormonal skin is loving this oil.  I keep it in the fridge as recommended which feels amazing since it is hot now.  Wonderfully moisturizing,  but tet, not greasy.  Smoothes fine lines around eyes,  A+ InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Saw the results immediately. My skin feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for like only 2 weeks and the result is good so far!!! My hyperpigmentations are faded... My scars don&#x27;t improve much but overall it&#x27;s good!!! It&#x27;s been only 2 weeks so I do recommend it!!! I use at night after I apply my acne treatment cream.... Sometimes in the morning!!! Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product already!!! My skin&#x27;s dark spots is already fading and my complexion is not dull anymore!!! This rosehip seed oil is truly a miracle product and I wish I had known about it sooner!!! If you have tough skin with dark spots , this oil is perfect for you as it smoothed your skin tone as well as your dark spots!!!! I highly highly recommend this oil and this brand!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff ! Very moisturizing, but not oily at all. I have seen some lightening of some scars and its only been about two weeks. Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great so I recommend using it at night.</li>
            <li> absorbs well. Skin feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankks</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I put it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh longer. Also, it is very refreshing to put this oil on when it is cold. I mix this with pure organic unrefined extra virgin cold pressed pomegranate oil. The combination is amazing and makes my face very smooth and moisturized. It is non-greasy and it blends perfectly!! Also, the redness of my face has completely subsided and you can see your face heal itself from any irritation it may have had in the past! I use this every morning and evening!!! Some people have a problem with the smell of this. However, it goes away after 5 minutes and it is honestly not that bad. It is better to smell a little then to have a &amp;#34;pleasant fragrance&amp;#34; that just breaks you out.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night after I step out of the shower, to take care of minor nicks and scars on my legs from shaving and to help with any discoloration I have all over my face and body. It is made with all natural ingredients so it works well with my highly sensitive skin. The smell of this product is an acquired taste...but I use it at night, so the benefits of using it outweighs everything else.I love how this product improves my overall skin quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.

            <li> I recently discovered InstaNatural; a company that makes skincare products. I was able to test out their Rosehip Seed Oil and their Deep Cleansing Facial Oil.  It seems like InstaNatural is having an aggressive sale on their products on Amazon.  A 4 oz. bottle of Rosehip Seed oil is $23.95 right now and is regularly priced $49.95&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rosehip Seed Oil is 100% organic and cold pressed and is supposed to help reduce the appearance of scars, acne and stretch marks and is a good all around moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight nutty or seedy smell which reminds me of the smell of grapes.  The oil is a bright orange and seems to soak into my skin rather easily without leaving a greasy residue.  This is great because I have been using it on my hands and feet overnight.  I wash my hands a lot more than usual because I have a baby in the house and have found my hands are a lot drier these days.  I like that the Rosehip Seed Oil makes my skin feel moisturized even after a hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recently burned my arm on the oven rack.  I didn&#x27;t want to scar so I tested the Rosehip Seed Oil on my burn once the blister opened.  Every night I apply a drop of rosehip seed oil and cover with a bandage.  In one week I feel my burn is healing well-so much better than not using anything or covering with a bandage only.  The skin is already shiny and pink and well on its way to healing thanks to this oil.</li>
            <li> this oil works very good for your hair and skin. It is one of the best beauty oils if you ask me. although the smell is not too pleasant it goes away. I still use everday</li>
            <li> The rose oil feels really good on my skin.  I heard that it is good for rosacea and it has helped the redness a lot.  I have tried other things with no results.  I use it twice a day and will continue.  I got an Email from the seller telling me tips for using the oil, which I was very thoughtful.  I recommend rose oil and this seller.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing this particular oil as well as purchasing from this particular company.  After using this oil on my face for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how soft my face is and how clear my complexion seems to be.  I feel it has helped improve some minor acne issues as well.  Almost immediately I received an email from InstaNatural inquiring about the satisfaction of my purchase and giving me specifics on how the oil is made, uses for the oil, etc.  Pretty helpful and informative, actually.  It was nice to have all the info right there at my fingertips to review.  Honestly, I was going to disregard the first email because, frankly, who has time?  However, I received a few more follow-up emails letting me know that their product is satisfaction guaranteed and if there were any questions or problems, to contact them.  Finally, on the third email, I replied (after having time to truly try out the product and give an honest response).  Melissa from InstaNatural responded promptly and was very appreciative.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first purchase with this company, but not the last!  Their customer service and attention is top-notch, as is their product!&lt;br /&gt;I tried this company because of the Amazon ratings on their oil and would highly recommend.  I don&#x27;t see many results this quickly with products - nor do I encounter customer service as good as InstaNatural&#x27;s.  I encourage you to give them both a try!  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  Looking forward to trying their Argan oil next!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Melissa!</li>
            <li> I love it..so smooth..my skin better..brighter and moisture..thanks.. I will use this product again..they have other oils too so I will ise them too later</li>
            <li> I love a product that has many uses and is all natural, this is it. So many uses and such a nice sized bottle. I keep it in the fridge to keep it nice and fresh since its starting to get real hot. I am loving finding new and interesting uses for this goodness and am excited to make some natural beauty/bath/body products including this oil. So loving this!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I am worry about some scars and cicatrix on my skin. Just recently I used &amp;#34;Rosehip Seed Oil&amp;#34; on clean skin once a day to help diminish the appearance of my scars. Actually, it is smell-less, absorbs quickly despite of its oily nature and it moisturizes my skin and makes my skin very soft. It didn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation. I am excited to see its positive long term results specially on the damaged parts of my skin :)</li>
            <li> Rose hip has a beautiful sweet smelling fragrance to it that i just adore this was my first time ever trying this product and it left me completely breathless i have bad dandruff and after one use it was gone! i was more than surprised sample provided for review</li>
            <li> This product is amazing after 1 week I seen improvements to my fine lines around the mouth and forehead area...I used it morning and night and just 1 to 2 drops is all you need.</li>
            <li> I love that there are no fillers in this, 100% pure + that the seller really believes in their product with the 100% money back guarantee.  Plus 4 oz is a HUGE bottle, at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;It is leaving my skin more moisturized, and is helping diminish the dark spots on my skin. Plus my stretch marks seems to be fading. My skin looks and feels healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I not only used it on my skin, I have used it on my scalp, on my hair, on my nails.  It absorbs quickly, and I like this oil, it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, a little bit goes a long way, so it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Organic Rosehip Seed Oil multiple benefits!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more radiant and it looks so much softer and youthful! My scars are lighter and my ages spots are diminishing. Great stuff! Cant wait to use it on my hair!</li>
            <li> This is a marvelous product. I did as suggested on Dr. Oz and mixed several sprays with another generic body lotion. I&#x27;ve used this several times on my body and on my face and can&#x27;t believe the instant silky softness of my skin. My skin has never felt so good and because it&#x27;s kept refrigerated (for longer life) it&#x27;s a refreshing lotion for the dry summer skin. I&#x27;m lovin it!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty impressive moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been trying to &#x27;go organic&#x27; with at least some of my skin care products (since so many of them are uber scientific, and that&#x27;s a lotta science battling around for a small bit of facial skin.) I just need a straight out moisturizer, and I thought I&#x27;d give this rosehip oil a try. My skin is normal for the most part, but it can get a little dry in some places, and a tad oily in the T-zone. My skin also is NOT sensitive, so please adjust what I say to your own situation.  I just needed a  straight-out moisturizer without any frills (as I said, I have so many other things I layer on my skin that I&#x27;m already doing triple duty in most areas of skin care management.) This oil absorbs easily and it&#x27;s incredibly non greasy. I used over my entire face, and it interestingly seemed to moisturize the dry parts and not grease up the oily-ish ones. That&#x27;s quite a thing for a facial oil!  I adore that it has a pump. It just makes it so easy to use, and when you&#x27;re doin gall these things in the morning to get ready for work, it&#x27;s great that the manufacturer makes it so easy to use their product without a huge hassle. I had zero negative experiences with this, but then, as I said, my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive.  What I like, too, is how long this is going to last. A pump or two and your face, neck and cleavage are all taken care of. Great moisturizer; I thoroughly recommend it. (I received this item at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> Love this! Still yet to see a change in my fine lines but ive only been using it for a few weeks, best moisturiser ive ever used! Also seen a big improvement in my nails (the length) which is great :)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very impressed and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great so far - my friend is a biochemist and she says rosehip oil is the best in preventing stretch marks so I got this to help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. Have been using for a few weeks and am currently 13 weeks pregnant and just starting to get bigger. Working so far and my skin looks great! Seems to moisturize well and sink into (not sit on top of) skin after a few min. Will continue to use it!!!</li>
            <li> It seems to be transforming my skin for the better.</li>
            <li> I love this rosehip oil and use it everywhere- face, neck, even on my pregnant belly against potential stretchmarks. I haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks yet so I can&#x27;t tell you if it works but I like that it is organic and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greesy. It is also a very generous size so it is well worth its price. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great as a moisturizer..my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Unlike most reviewers here, I purchased this product with my own money. I have used many rosehip seed oils from different brands, but decided to try this one due to the good reviews. However, this one by Instanatural is nothing like the rosehip seed oil I know and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I received the bottle in a dented, scuffed up box, which I thought nothing of - perhaps just a rough postal journey. Next, I pumped the oil into my palms, I noticed the color was very different to every other rosehip seed oil I&#x27;ve tried - it was brown, rather than light yellow/orange. And lastly, the smell of the product hit me. A lot of people complain in general about the smell of rosehip seed oil. It has an earthy, natural smell to it that isn&#x27;t the most appealing to many. However, this one smells exactly like SOY SAUCE. I&#x27;m not being over dramatic for the sake of an interesting review..ha it just really smells like soy sauce. Either this product isn&#x27;t rosehip seed oil or it is rancid. In my honest opinion, I would look at other brands if you want to buy facial oils, as it looks like Instanatural gives out a lot of free/discounted product for good reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil after reading that it was good for your skin. I like to make my own skin care products and bought it to use in a recipe. However, I find that I am using it pretty much as a stand alone product every night. I add a drop or two of Frankincense oil to a few drops of the Rosehip seed oil and apply it to my face and neck. My skin feels soooo good the next morning. Loving it!</li>
            <li> Got this for free from Insta Natural and I love it, it does wonder. It is like a little miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> Like this brand better than the last one I ordered. It&#x27;s bigger and a better value. Quality is great.</li>
            <li> Smell was so bad that my husband commented on it! Smells like fish.  Very unpleasant !</li>
            <li> All in one beauty elixir!!  Seriously, what can&#x27;t this amber colored liquid do?!?!?  Addi it to your hair conditioner for dry scalp! One of my favorite’s; cuticles! My cuticles are the worst, they are so dry I chew on them! WHICH makes them WORSE! So, I bite them more, it’s a never ending battle. Between the Rosehip Oil softening my cuticles, making my hands look great, but it also tastes bad!! Which means I’m not chewing on them! It’s a win win!!&lt;br /&gt;It’s an awesome acne treatment, but DO A PATCH TEST FIRST! You don’t want to make the condition worse!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant oil, not to mention it helps to decrease environmental damage and soothe the skin. Rosehip Oil has skin rejuvenating properties like vitamin C and lycopene which repair the skin’s surface and restores elasticity!!&lt;br /&gt;BIG four ounce bottle! LOVE that!&lt;br /&gt;The scent; yes, it&#x27;s earthy but it dissipates FAST and the smell out weighs the help I get HANDS DOWN!!  I use it before bed on the back of my hands.... my age spots are FADING!!</li>
            <li> 2 years ago I took a nasty fall that resulted in a compound fracture of my right leg that required surgery.  I now have a titanium rod, screws and pins in that leg.  Overall I have healed nicely and function close to 100%.  The only real lasting damage is the scars on my leg and knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying this Rosehips Oil to the scars on my leg and knee a couple times a day for the past month.  The skin by the scar near my ankle where the bone came through has been very thin since my surgery. There is an indentation/divot on my leg and no muscle between the skin and bone. It is basically just scar tissue on top of bone. Since using this product I&#x27;ve noticed the scar tissue on both my leg and knee is much more pliable and soft. The thin skin near my ankle seems healthier and soft as well. It has been prone to bleed easily if I scratch it and is now much healthier looking and no longer bleeds when scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are my scars gone? No. But they do both feel and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue to use this product daily.  A little bit of this product goes a long way.  I have barely used any of it so it should last for months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the smell.  The smell is just not that great. I&#x27;ve grown used to it but with the word \\&quot;rose\\&quot; in the name of this product you would hope this would smell good, it doesn&#x27;t. This is an issue with rosehips products in general, but I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;love\\&quot; this product due to the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed with InstaNatrual&#x27;s line of products.  I have been using their Argan oil daily on my nails and have never before had fingernails that are so strong, long and healthy. So far their products have lived up to the claims made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have been using this AM and PM and so far love the results. My age spots do look lighter.  After applying it to my face, sometimes I have a very small amount left on my hands, so I have rubbed it into my hair and it leaves my hair soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have oily skin and rosehip  actually helped. I noticed when I wear makeup now I have a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and without makeup I have smoother skin with less clogged pores. I only use at night and only use a few drops. I have tried other oils in the past and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> When a free sample of this was offered for review purposes, I almost turned it down because I personally do not have a use for it. However, a family member wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using it, she&#x27;s said that it has been very effective making stretch marks fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for several weeks, as the bottle runs out, she&#x27;s been asking me to buy more. No need for a list of features and benefits when somebody simply tells me \\&quot;it works.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are ordering more today.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  My stomach skin was hurting very bad in my last trimester of pregnancy from a very large baby.  This oil provided so much pain relief and lightened the color of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!! Really makes my skin soft. It glows but isn&#x27;t oily. Keep it in the fridge. Keeps it fresh and feels cool going on. I put it on my face neck and upper chest. This company also offers a wonderful Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Wonderful ..  I love it..  It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but that goes away..  But skin is so soft..</li>
            <li> I was contacted by the manufacturer and asked if I would like to sample their 100% Organic Rosehip Oil and give my fair and honest opinion on what I thought about their product. I love to try different products to see what works for my skin and to see what I like best. If I find I product that works well for me I become a repeat customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this rosehip oil claims to help diminish the appearance of scars and stretch marks. I have gone through a few surgeries over the past 3 years and I have some still bright and visible small scars as a reminder that I am hoping to fade a bit more. This rosehip oil felt nice when I applied it. It&#x27;s a bit too early to know if this will help fade my scars so I will update my review later with any and all results after I have used this more to see if this claim is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a bit of an unusual odor, I can&#x27;t seem to place it. My husband seems to think it smells a bit like vitamins. It dissipates after a few minutes and what is left is not unpleasant. You can always mix this with a bit of lotion or scented oil if the odor bothers you. It absorbs quickly into my skin leaving it feeling supple, smooth, and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a very generous 4 ounce size with an easy to dispense pump top. A little goes a long way so this bottle will last for quite a while. I can see how this would help the appearance of fine lines, it moisturizes very well. I like this rosehip oil and feel like this is a product I can incorporate into my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended using rosehip oil for my pregnancy belly. Hopefully preventing strech mark. I bought this brand and im very satisfied with it. I use it on my belly and around my eyes before i go to sleep. This oil has the same feel of coconut oil. I recommend it 100%!</li>
            <li> Miracle stuff.  Have used it on multiple cuts/skin scars with obvious results - decreased hyperpigmentation, decreased scar visability.  My skin looks I&#x27;ve had a chemical peel.  I would highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil is a moisturizing product that can be used for a variety of different purposes.  It is also said to help with scarring and stretch marks.  This product can be used on your skin, hair and nails.  This is a product that is completely pure.  It has nothing else added to it.  It leaves my skin feeling really moisturized and soft.  I like to add a tiny bit to my hair and comb it through.  It leaves my hair looking extra shiny.  I also like to use this on dry areas like my feet, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - free sample provided</li>
            <li> My face feels and looks so much better.This oil is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Love this it reduces scars n darkspots, and most of all makes my eye lashes longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this oil.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the InstaNatural 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil. I could see improvement on my hair, skin and nails even after the first use (no joke) and I am so excited to see how Rosehip Oil would work in a long term use. I highly recommend it to people with  dry  parts of their body, you are going to love this nourishing oil. Check out my full review here: http://dianareese1.com/2014/09/26/instanatural-100-rosehip-seed-oil-review/</li>
            <li> So far I like this oil.  My only complaint is the pump does not work.  It would be much easier/less messy to use if the pump worked.    ***EDITED 12/9/2014***  I contacted the seller and they were very helpful.  I was sent a new bottle at no charge within two days and kept the old bottle as well.  Will definitely order from Instanatural again!</li>
            <li> So the smell is fishy, but you get use to it. I use this everyday on my face,  it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and evens out my skin complexion. I would recommend storing half in the refrigerator, as this oil can become rancid. That way when you&#x27;re finished using first batch, the second batch is still fresh.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. This is good for my split ends.  it seems to moisturize it better than the hot oil I used on my hair.  I like to add a few drops to my hair gel.  It seems to help keep my hair less crunchy and more soft.  Worked well on my cuticles too.  I&#x27;m going to use it on dandruff, sunburn, and to help my scars diminish.  HUGE bottle just like they say.  The best part is that it is ORGANIC!  There is nothing not to love about this.  Thank you for providing me with this bottle to review and send my honest feedback.  All the ingredients are stellar.  Love this company!</li>
            <li> Arrived early; as advertised; feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil makes my face feel so smooth and the rough spots I have on my face are disapearing.  I honestly don&#x27;t use it everyday but if I did I probably will be totally amazed.  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Having read lots of good stuff about Rosehip oil I decided to give it a go within my beauty routine. I have a genrous ration of stretchmarks from having my babies, scars from surgery, and have less-than-happily welcomed wrinkles in the past couple of years. It sounded like I might have found a cure for that trio but I&#x27;ll admit my experience didn&#x27;t leave me wowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, you&#x27;ve got to get used to the smell. I was horrified when I first received it, not having anticipated just how pungent and unpleasant it would be. But honestly, it only took about three uses to adjust and once you begin working it into your skin that initial fishy funk turns earthy and pleasant. I&#x27;ve actually grown fond of it. Unfortunately for me, I can&#x27;t use it on my face. Just a couple of days and I had one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve had in years. Reading other reviews I&#x27;m wondering why I hit the pimple jackpot with it and may go ahead and suck it up to try it again on my face but yeesh it was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturizer I did like it a lot for the scars and my poor marked up belly but I noticed no reduction in either in the month I&#x27;ve used it. Now that my initial testing period for review is over I might swap to using it on my hands to keep them looking young because I did like it in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! After the very first use (before bed) I woke up that morning and noticed my skin looked dewey and refreshed. Could tell an immediate change from my typical roll out of bed and glance in the mirror complexion!  I have used this prodict twice and have already recommended it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Amazing oil, fantastic on my skin. Try in tiny amounts and before bed is best for your skin to drink it up. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Really wonderful product. It absorbs very quickly into skin. Once using it, the skin become very soft. I usually add one drop of the oil to the eye-cream.</li>
            <li> I added this to my face oil (avocado and almond oil mixture) and within days it made a huge difference in the dry patches I was having! Love it! And it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this purchase</li>
            <li> I did receive my product very promptly,  the price was the best for the size, packaging was very protective and the product itself appears to be very beneficial,  although i have only used it for a week. Will definitely recommend</li>
            <li> My skin is really appreciating the extra level of moisture that rosehip oil provides.  It absorbs quickly if used alone, or you can mix it in with your other skin products.  My scalp, which tends to be dry, also seems to be benefiting from having a bit of it massaged in.  The biggest improvement I noticed was that the rough skin on my legs shows noticeable improvement after I started using the rosehip oil with my regular lotion.  I think I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This oil leaves my skin petal soft and is easily absorbt and I don&#x27;t feel guilty about putting it anywhere on my body because it is free of chemicals .</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic cosmetic oil ever.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily and dry skin, especially in morning, my husband even made joke said he can make pancake on my oily morning face:) As soon as I started using this organic Rose hip oil I could feel the difference right way. I only use this oil at night after I wash my face very well, I don&#x27;t dry my face, and put 2 drapes rose hip oil  on my hand then put it on my face until it  absorbs. Then I use the serum and night cream. This oil absorbs very fast. Some people say they don&#x27;t like the smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much. The smell is  kind of like walnuts&#x27;s smell, and only smell strongly in the first few seconds, and quickly loosest the smell.  Since I started using this oil at night, the big difference is my skin is not oily in the morning anymore. wow, how amazing!  Just want to have more information about this oil, I read about it in difference languages, the benefits about this oil are almost the same as well. 2 things I learned are only use is oil are only use it at night, and keep it in the refrigerator . Another thing I want to mention is this seller give a great customer service. I will keep to using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know from this, but the wife swears by it, so...  At least it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product for the first time, I was a little hesitant/skeptical if it&#x27;d really work. I had never used oils like this before on my face and was concerned my face would break out from it. Plus my skin is very sensitive. Well a few months later I am happy to say that this product is incredible. I noticed benefits on my skin almost immediately. I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t started using this stuff earlier! If you are on the fence about purchasing, DO IT. It is worth literally every penny. Another positive about this product (aside from the zillion already listed) is that it works perfectly as a massage oil. I have a lot of muscle tightness from my job and this oil makes it much easier to get those knots out! The only negative I had was with one of the bottles I ordered (it broke during shipment) so I contacted the owner of the company about a replacement. He was extremely responsive and sent me another bottle right away no questions asked! I wish more companies were this quick about responding to their customers.</li>
            <li> Has a different smell than I&#x27;m accustomed to but is working well.</li>
            <li> I have never tried Rose Hip Oil but when I was given this oil for review purposes I was elated because I have heard so may good thing about this natural organic seed. I put it to the test and it did not prove me wrong. This oil has many purposes for hair and skin Ect. I tried it on my son because has really dry skin, so when he came out of the shower his skin was flared up with a rash so I put Rose hip to the test and it worked the next day his rash was gone. I was so happy because I now know that this oil is great for dry skin and eczema. Then I tried this awesome oil in my hair and it left it shiny and bouncy as it air dried. All I needed was 2 drops , rubbed it through my fingers and ran it through my damp hair. Rose Hip is great!</li>
            <li> Organic rosehip oil 100% pure . It is another good quality product by Insta Natural . Can be used as a moisturizer for skin , hair and nails . All benefics , in  4 oz bottle . I used after applied my vit. C Serum as a moisturizer .  My skin love it .</li>
            <li> I really hoped to like this product, since it has received so many rave reviews. I bought this oil after reading the Amazon reviews. I have used rose hip seed oil before, so I am aware of the fact that it does not actually smell of roses. In fact quite the opposite. It has an odd smell, which may be a turn off to some users. However, I truly don&#x27;t care about the smell of a product as long as it works well. I usually purchase my organic rose hip seed oil in bulk from mountain rose herbs, so buying it from Amazon was new for me. The smell of this rose hip seed oil is extremely fishy. As I said, I know that rosehip seed oil does not smell of blooming roses. However, I have never used a rosehip seed oil that smelled this much fishy either. The color of this oil is pretty much similar to its mountain rose herbs counterpart. However, I feel it just doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin as well. Instead of leaving my skin soft with a subtle glow, this oil seems oily and just sits on the top. However, I really liked the fact that it was packaged in a pump glass bottle. This made getting the oil much easier than using a dropper. I also liked the fact that it was packaged in a glass bottle, since I am am wary of the BPA in plastics. I hope more rosehip seed oil providers adopt this easy to use pump-glass-bottle method of packaging. I find this oil to be a bit of inferior quality than what I am used to. So, I suppose I will finish it off by using it on different parts of my body. But, for my face and neck I prefer to rely on the rose hip seed oil I was buying before.</li>
            <li> Looks and smells different from a previous brand of rosehip oil I had. Smells a lot more like olive oil.</li>
            <li> This does not smell or feel like Rosehip oil.It is thicker and has an olive oil smell. I will never buy again!</li>
            <li> This works great with the InstaNatural Night Cream as well as with the day cream.  Instead of slathering this on separately, the InstaNatural Company encouraged putting their organic rosehip oil together by mixing on palm of hand with either their night or day cream.  It works in nice and really gives the skin a soft feel and appearance.  Initially the fragrance of this oil is earthy but fragrance quickly disappears, as other users have noted.  This is a great natural product to replace the use of chemical retinol creams, something I purposely wanted to get away from.  I have used it for close to a month in place of the retinol and have noticed it works as good as, if not better, than retinol.  Note:  I also use InstaNatural&#x27;s other products as well for the face, including their eye cream.  It has taken about a month of using the InstaNatural face creams before seeing serious wrinkle improvement, but I would recommend that you give this product and their other products a try.  I use the products faithfully every day morning and night.  In fairness, I must tell you that I also use a 22% Vitamin C serum as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see any benefits but it does feel oily on my skin. I like something liter that absorbs and leaves my skin feeling &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, hydrated, not oily. But if it benefits my skin, I&#x27;ll go with it.</li>
            <li> I love the product and even though I do not like winter and the cold weather, I will look forward to the products performance on my skin this winter.  The information that was sent was the best...it was more than I could have asked for....it contained information I never possibly have thought to ask.....Thank you again for providing such wonderful products!  I will definitely look to your company first!</li>
            <li> I had to come back to the site to read the reviews because I was sure I had a bad bottle. This stuff smells like stale cigarette smoke mixed with rancid lake water. My boyfriend won&#x27;t kiss me when I have it on, it&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil.  It does feel oily when you first put it on,  but it does get absorbed soon after.  It feels great on the skin.  Great product!</li>
            <li> love the size. great for your skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery! I have just started using the product and look forward to good results! Using this product for skincare!</li>
            <li> since i&#x27;m using this oil 2 weeks,&lt;br /&gt;i feel already my skin is getting brighter and healthier than before.&lt;br /&gt;definately i&#x27;m satisfying with this product 100%.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I can say that it works Very Well!  I mix it with my moisturizers to help them last longer in the cold weather.  No negative reactions and my skin stays moist with one or two moisturizer application and the rose hip oil instead of multiple applications throughout the day before buying this product.  The company shipped the product out very quickly with simplified packaging and personally contacted me by email to see how I liked the product.  The most important thing in the email was the need for the rosehip oil to be refrigerated (I missed that initially on the label).  The rosehip oil container is brown an the top is a dropper.  I use about 4-7 drops with my moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product appears to be pure as advertised given I have had no allergic reactions to it (other products often have other things mixed in which agitate my skin).  I highly recommend ordering from this company and I have them in my quick buy option now with Amazon.  The rosehip oil also has a slight earthy scent.  Unless someone is really close to you they cannot smell it at all.</li>
            <li> Not BAD at all but not even that good. )</li>
            <li> used couple of times .... good effect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and so my skin has been through alot.  I am very happy to report that this Rosehip Oil has even worked for me.  At 65 I may be dead tomorrow but my skin will look good!  My friends and family have made unsolicited positive comments!  And now they are using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smeade in Davis, Ca.</li>
            <li> I read an article where a London model talked about her most important beauty tips and the nightly use of organic rosehip oil was her number one treatment. Now of course this model is at the most 25 years of age and I am over 50 but I thought I would give it a try. You are to use just a few drops and work it into you face and wrinkles. It does a great job moisturing my skin without making it feel oily but I can&#x27;t see any real change in it after using it for just under a month now. Didn&#x27;t really expect to see any results this soon, then the other day my mother asked what I was doing to my skin because it looks great. I told her about it and she asked me to order her a bottle immediately. I had to laugh because she is 83 and in a nursing home but she has always been diligent about caring for her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several suppliers of organic rosehip oil but the folks at InstaNatural really suprised me with their customer service. The day after I orderd the product online I received and email from them tell me that they had shipped it and giving me instructions on how to use the product, what to expect, and what to do should I experience any irritation. Great way to create loyal customers.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, it does have an odor that is not awful but its not odorless is what I am saying.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my scalp to help with extremely dry conditions. It works well and prevents constant itching. Not really what it was intended for, but my scalp is so dry and itchy I have tried just about everything​. I use it at night and massage on my scalp. I will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a carrier oil for my essential oil face moisturizer!!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This rosehip seed oil is a winner. It moisturizes well (I&#x27;ve used it on facial lines and on my heels). It&#x27;s also supposed to be great for scars -- can&#x27;t speak to that as I don&#x27;t have scars to try it on, but since it&#x27;s so moisturizing I can only think it could help scarred skin. The glass bottle is large -- 4 oz. -- and will last you quite a while. The pump top dispenses easily. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but I don&#x27;t mind that as it just tells me that they didn&#x27;t add additional scents. I use this regularly and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the rose hip oil for two reasons. One, for a facial moisturizer and two, for post pregnancy stretch marks. For a facial moisturizer it&#x27;s been great, my pores seem smaller and any blackheads I had seem to be disappearing. As far as my stretch marks go I haven&#x27;t noticed a dent but I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a month so I&#x27;ll give it sometime. A lot of people say that the oil smells bad, to me it smells like tea leaves and it isn&#x27;t putrid at all. Finally, the customer service from InstaNatural has been great. They&#x27;ve contacted my via email to see how the product has been working.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  I used to buy the make-up counter face products from Macy&#x27;s until I tried my first product from this company! I will never go back... I have six InstaNatural products that I use daily now. They are fabulous!</li>
            <li> Received quickly, nicely packaged, and exactly as advertised. I&#x27;ve used on face, hands, body and hair and love it. Not greasy at all on face and my dry skin soaks it right up.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a little over a week now and so far it is doing VERY well. The smell can be off putting but the smell does evaporate after a few mins. I love that this comes in a glass bottle with a pump so no need to have to worry about putting a lid back on with oily fingers haha. It is a little sticky but once again after it absorbs the sticky feel will go away and it absorbs nice into the skin especially after a warm bath/ or shower.I have seen a little bit of improvement with my acne scars after only a week so I am excited to see how well it works with a continued long term use.</li>
            <li> First let me say that the timing on getting the product is wonderful. I ordered my oil and in 2 days I had it and was using it. About the product....I liked it. I am not super impressed but it is improving my skin. I have had it for a couple weeks and I like the fact that it is very hydrating and moisturizing. Unfortunately  I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in my acne scarring. Though I love this product, the smell to me is awful. It smells like fish oil. Other than that I like the product and recommend sticking it in your fridge for additional preservation. I am going to continue to use and hopefully see more improvements.</li>
            <li> High quality product. I used this in a homemade body balm and it is a much higher quality rose hip oil than I used in the past. Very happy with speed of delivery. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I love this product by InstaNatural.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft like no other moisturizer could ever come close to.  I would definitely buy again and love that it is unrefined, organic and a large bottle for the price paid.  Give this one a try for sure....you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this works great on recent scars I have caused by acne. Unlike other oils I have used this is the only one that didn&#x27;t make my skin break out. Like others have said, a little will go a LONG way and it will last for a long time. I keep it in the fridge after I opened it. Personally it does not smell like roses lol. It does have a distinct smell to it, but it was not rancid for me. It absorbs quickly. I also use it on my hair and all over my skin. Over all works great for me. Will order again. I just hope that they will make something for hyperpigmentation, that is my HUGEST concern.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their skin to feel soft as rose petals. Going to order more.</li>
            <li> With winter fast upon us on the Midwest I decided to boost my  face moisturizer with this product and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Oil smelled like it was starting to turn rancid</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  Makes my skin smooth and soft even with my oily skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I mix InstaNatural ORGANIC Rosehip Oil 100% Pure &amp; USDA Certified 4OZ with Original Keri Lotion and then put L&#x27;Oreal Visible lift CC Cream over both.  Any lines I have diminish instantly.  It does exactly what InstaNatural says it does.  I don&#x27;t expect it to improve my lines over time, but it improves them instantly when I use it and that&#x27;s good enough.  All products like this are a bit pricey but this one should last awhile due to its 4 oz. size.  There&#x27;s a few other products I will try still, but I think this one is definitely a keeper.  I recommend this product enough to buy it also as a gift for all of the women in our family!</li>
            <li> Works very well to reduce dry skin and lines.</li>
            <li> All that comes to my mind is...WOW, what an amazing product this is. I read countless reviews and knew it would do something positive, but I truly had no idea how MUCH would be. I have middle age skin and suffer from all the skin issues that come from that, not to mention living in the high altitude and desert of NM. I just wanted to find something to calm, soothe and help to clear up my skin, and I certainly found it with this wonderful Rosehip Seed Oil. I mean within 3 days I was really seeing a big improvement. I believe in the power of serums over creams (although I use one I make myself) because it is the best way for products to get into the skin, so I made a serum using this oil, and it is really benefiting my skin health. Don&#x27;t be like me, and be slow to get on the rosehip band wagon, as the sooner you begin to use it the better off you&#x27;ll be. My skin has not only cleared up from the nagging blemishes, irritations and &amp;#34;crankiness&amp;#34;, but it has smoothed out in texture, tone and is really very soft now.  I have only been using RSO for going on 3 weeks now, so I am excited to see what the long term effects will be. As with most things it is accumulative and only gets better with time. I heard so many raving things about RSO that I had the mindset that...all this hype?...it can&#x27;t be all that.  WELL, it is and more. I know now why it has been used for generations and why the people that use it have such beautiful, clear, &#x27;pretty&#x27; skin. It is light and absorbs quickly. The scent is very light and dissipates within a few minutes. I highly recommend this oil to EVERYONE, and this brand is very high quality. Its the best $16 bucks I have spent in a LONG time.</li>
            <li> This is a great bedtime moisturizer I have been using it for about 2 weeks and it is going good so far. It smells a bit like mustard oil but I use it for it&#x27;s beneficial value. It absorbs well and does not make the face look oily. A good compliment to Argan oil. should know more after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Very nice, high quality rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my girl who had broke out on her face, she loves it very and cleared up her face in a few days, only had to use a few drops</li>
            <li> Love it,, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite moisturizer. I&#x27;m in my 20s, and have combination skin with a couple of pimples cropping up regularly. Almond oil wasn&#x27;t enough for my face in the winter, so I switched to this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts, but I notice my pimples clear faster, and my overall skin tone has improved. Plus, it absorbs quickly while still leaving skin hydrated-looking, so it&#x27;s helped a lot with some slight flaking I had. I love the glass pump bottle it comes in. I was afraid that since they tell you to refrigerate it I&#x27;d forget to use it after washing my face, but I&#x27;m hooked and definitely use this religiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may not like the smell, but I find it smells only slightly fishy (it comes from the seeds/stems, not the rose petals), but mostly like black tea... almost like an fish oil pill flavored Lipton tea. While I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, it disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, Instanatural sends you an email when you order the product with the disclaimer that it&#x27;s not recommended for acne-prone skin, but I&#x27;ve had fabulous luck with this stuff.</li>
            <li> When I started using the Rose hip oil my skin looks instantly replenished and revitalized, and it looks immediately brighter and radiant. This is a great product that I’m using in face and hands.The dark spots in my hands are less noticeable.Great</li>
            <li> Havent used too much of this product, but it does keep my skin soft and hydrated when i do use it.</li>
            <li> This Is a great.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily.</li>
            <li> I am most pleased with my order which arrived beautifully packaged a week ago. I have been storing the oil in the fridge and used it twice a day so far, I have also used it on my hair once. The oil is very delicate and the scent, which smells like mild fish oil, disappear soon after applying to the to the skin. The oil absorbs very quickly and leaves your skin very soft. My hair also feels much softer after one application. I massaged the the head with oil and then combed the hair and left it for few hours before shampooing the hair. A very little of this oil goes a long way, I shall continue to use this oil and will write another review in few months time for an update.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is good.. I want to return it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Rosehip Seed Oil before and was a bit nervous when I opened the bottle as the oil has an orange tint. It&#x27;s very nice. Once you apply it, there&#x27;s no color on your skin. It smells good and leaves my skin SO soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Very versatile and gentle. The company even took the time to reach out to me a few weeks after having ordered to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out...or for gifts!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product but had read about rosehip oil being great for diminishing scars. So I got some for a friend who had knee surgery and was left with a very large scar. A drop or two goes a very long way so dont try to use a lot. My friend has been using it daily and her scar has faded quite a bit, and the scar is starting to blend in with her skin tone. I would recommend it to anyone with scars. This purchase was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really like rose water and rose tea, so I thought I would like this. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but I even keep it in my fridge and the smell is awful. I can&#x27;t use it due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I love using essential oils  and I was very happy with this product.  I  put  a few drops into the moisturizer creme that I use for my body.  I also put  it along my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks. So far so good. Although I have not seen any change in spots or wrinkles, my skin has balanced itself. No more oily then dry, oily and dry. Now it&#x27;s just normal..First time in my life! So i will continue using this product to see if there are anymore improvements.</li>
            <li> I love the rose hip oil . I use it twice a day on my face neck and hands and then run my hands through my hair. I have only been using it gif about two weeks but I&#x27;m already noticing changes. My skin tone is more even, age spots seem to be lighter , and my laugh lines seem less noticeable. I have also had no breakouts. I use this oil after cleansing and applying the Insta natural vit c serum. I love them both.</li>
            <li> Great! Saw a change from day 1!</li>
            <li> This oil is a great moisturizer. It is not too oily and it leaves your complexion glowing. But, what has really sold me on this product, is the great customer service. This company cares about its customers!!</li>
            <li> Sent this fishy smelling oil back with the quickness! YUCK. I&#x27;m not sure about this company at all - they have lots of marketing and seemingly great reviews (which got me to purchase!) but this is not a good product, it was rancid and smelled like fish oil.</li>
            <li> Only use it for the last couple of weeks and I can already see that my skin looks better on scars !&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell also, very light and this is not too oily, it penetrate very easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> I enjoy caring for my skin. Two important steps are cleansing &amp; moisturizing.  Lately I have been using two new products. Today want to speak to you about Insta Natural&#x27;s 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil. This is a great multipurpose product. This oil can be used on your face, body, hair, &amp; nails! Like having one product that do many jobs.    My skin type is combination. In the past I used only oil-free moisturizers. Take a few drops of Insta Natural 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil on to the tips of your fingers. Lightly pat the oil onto your clean, dry face. Lightly tap for a minute or two. Would also suggest taking the oil down to the neck &amp; décolletage. Please note that this oil does not have an oil scent. This oil is also USDA Organic certified product. It&#x27;s not tested on animals which is very important to me. This oil can also diminish scars &amp; stretch marks.    Insta Natural 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil absorbs very quickly. Quickly noticed positive signs in my skin. I am no skin care expert, and I&#x27;m only sharing my feelings. My feeling is that because this is a pure cold pressed oil my skin knows what to do with it. Often products have dyes, synthetic chemicals that your body does not know how to respond to. I feel my skin says this is good. It&#x27;s natural so that why I feel my pores are smaller &amp; look better. My skin looks hydrated all day long!  Would recommend using just a few drops to find out what amount works best for your skin.    I was sent this product for free to review, and share my thoughts. These are my thoughts, and feelings only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this exceptional product in the past, without a hitch.  Not sure what went wrong, this go around.  I received a taped up, battered box with an unsealed, conspicuously used bottle.  As an Esthetician, I&#x27;ve recommended this product numerous times; leery in doing so, now.</li>
            <li> This very large bottle of organic rose hip oil is the best thing i have put on my skin ever!  After using the clarisonic to clean my face, i apply this oil and my skin looks better than ever.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> First! Don&#x27;t be thrown off by the smell! There&#x27;s a lot of Omega 3 fatty acids (from fish) but the smell fades in abotu 10-20 minutes. I love ordering from instanatural because they help you along the way, like they sent me an email basically going over everything this oil can do, how to use it and any helpful facts which I think was great. Before applying this all over your body do a spot test on you arm or somewhere inconspicuous on your body to see if you&#x27;re allergic, I would wait 24hours before using it after the spot test. The color is like between an orange and red it&#x27;s pretty. I used this for dry skin, and dandruff I left it in for 1 hour on my scalp then rinsed it off and it did help soothe my scalp. I also put a little in my aloe vera gel that I make along with vitamin e and the cleansing face oil they have and it works wonders for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with InstaNatural Organic Rosehip Oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it on fine lines and wrinkles for about 3 weeks now, and even upon first application, my skin felt replenished, calm, and my skin tone looked healthier.  This size bottle will last quite awhile, as I just use a few drops at a time.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic, unrefined, and contains no chemicals. As I&#x27;ve been getting older, I &#x27;ve found that I have to be very careful with what kinds of face products I use, as my skin is sensitive. Right away, I could tell my skin agreed with it and it felt soothing.  Another great asset to this product is that InstaNatural is a fantastic company to purchase from.  Within a day of making my purchase, I received an email from the company containing useful tips and more information about this product, which was very helpful since I had not used Rosehip Oil before. And if you have a question, a real person will respond.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged and in a timely manner...had a slightly &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; aroma that I wondered about. But i found it very nourishing to my skin and hair and halfway through it&#x27;s use i happily ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I added organic  therapeutic grade essential oils to boost its effectiveness and enjoy this product immensely</li>
            <li> We purchased this oil to incorporate into our homemade skin care products. It&#x27;s a great product, InstaNatural offers great service and fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice when you open the bottle is that there is no fragrance. This oil is actually harvested from the tiny rosehip seeds collected on budding. While there is no floral scent, there is a slight fishy scent. I thought my bottle had gone bad, but I found out that is the case with this type of oil since it has omega fatty acids. No worries. Just keep your bottle refrigerated to make it stay fresh and last a long time. You don&#x27;t have to worry about applying cold oil to your face since you only use a few drops at a time. And by the time the drops have reached your skin, they are room and very soon, body temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this a greatly effective beauty oil? Besides the fatty acid content, rosehip seed oil also has natural vitamin A. No toxic face creams with retinol are needed when you have this bottle in your skincare arsenal. You can mix in the oil in your favorite cream, use it alone or make a refreshing facial mist in just a few easy steps. You can also use it on nails, cuticles, and in hair treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you didn&#x27;t think oils could be in your beauty regimen because they cause breakouts or clog pores, think again. Naturally harvested, pure oils are in fact the perfect beauty solution.</li>
            <li> Outstanding result, great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Not the nicest smelling for products I&#x27;ll admit, but that is the nature of buying natural products.  They don&#x27;t have added fragrances to make the product smell great (and irritate your skin), they are just 100% pure and sometimes that doesn&#x27;t smell so great. But rosehip oil has so many benefits for your skin that I can get over the smell factor.  Also, the smell only lasts for a minute and soon wears off.  I like to blend 2 pumps of oil to my moisturizer daily- for those who can&#x27;t get past the smell, this helps to mask it. I also find using it this way during the day is great especially if you want to wear makeup, this way your face is not too oil/greasy so your makeup doesn&#x27;t slip around too much on your face. At night I&#x27;m more inclined to just use it straight up on my face and neck.  It absorbs well overnight and really does help with skin tone.  Great product and great value for money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use if you have acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin, monthly breakouts, dark circles under eyes and brow furrow all show marked improvement after less than a month of use. Impressive results at a fair price; better than most premium-priced products could hope to offer. Customer service top-notch.</li>
            <li> Love to use on my face and neck!</li>
            <li> This oil works great on your skin.  Leaves it soft, smooth and helps it look brighter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for face and hair. You can squirt and mix with water and put in a squirt bottle for a refreshing face spray. I have very oily skin and found using this actually balances my face out as It causes me to excrete oil. There;&#x27;s no need to buy expensive face potions when natural stuff is best!</li>
            <li> I used Instanaturals Rosehip Oil mainly on my hair. I tested it on a few scars seeing that it claimed to lighten them, however I did not see any results. However, using it on my hair was probably the best decision I made!&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself has a VERY earthy smell, it didn&#x27;t bother me, but I could see where it would bother some. The oil itself is very light and easy to apply to hair. I applied it to my entire scalp each night, let it sit for about 5 minutes and then went forward with normal hair washing. It rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. My hair has not only felt healthier, it also seems more voluminous after using the Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from psoriasis on my scalp that frequently itches and flakes, which in turn causes soreness. After using the Rosehip oil, the itch has lessened and so has the flaking, which in turn alleviated my soreness. I was not expecting it to actually help with my psoriasis!&lt;br /&gt;I am elated to have been able to use this product and can&#x27;t wait to buy more. The only issue I encountered was that my bottle leaked, and a lot, causing loss in about 1/5th of the product. I don&#x27;t know what was the issue with the pump, but I would come home to find a puddle of oil under the bottle. Although I notice they have updated their bottles, so hopefully the new ones don&#x27;t leak. Alas, a faulty pump will not deter me from this product. It is wonderful and has done so much for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free product for review. Opinions are solely my own and I am in no way obligated to leave a positive review.*</li>
            <li> amazing it can give you great skin and revive hair. its has a earthy smell. The oil very light and easy to apply to hair. I received a free product for review. Opinions are solely my own and I am in no way obligated to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> This product is the best. My skin was dry with some red spots.  I was looking for products that could possibly help when I came across this rosehip seed oil. I tell you this stuff is great. I have been using it for about 6 weeks twice a day and my skin is moisturized and clear.  No more red rashy spots. I bought two more bottles, one for me and the other for my daughter. This is the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> This organic rosehip oil is a deep orange oil that can make the face oily looking if too much is applied. Mine did have a slight fishy smell (which subsided after application and I got used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s oily or is slightly smelly because I bought it to try to lighten my age spots. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 weeks, 2-3 times a day and I have noticed some fading so far. I love that it is natural and pretty much a one ingredient product for my face. The bottle is also a good amount that will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best thing about this oil is that I&#x27;ve been using it under my eyes like an eye cream and it has made a difference. The skin under my eyes are not dry and wrinkles are less prominent. This did not happen instantaneously, but it did happen. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am not a finicky person. I actually like herbal smells and I use a lot of products that are natural and that some people would say smell bad. But to me they smells good because it smells natural and earthy. I hate chemical smells. Which a lot of these are non natural products have even with the fragrance piled on. But this product here smells like fish oil. Luckily it does not linger for longer. But I read somewhere that that is a sign that it is rancid and oxidized.  I will use all oil but I most likely will not purchase again. Back to the drawing board to find Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Nothing so far but as will all products it takes time.</li>
            <li> Nice pure amber oil, smells mellow and not odd or unexpected. It is a real winter skin saver when mixed into moisturizers and lotions.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped on time and it was packaged very well. I like this product as a moisturizer, it moisturizes my skin very well. But I moderately like it as scar remover. I have been applying this product on scars but it has not shown very profound impact.It has bit strong smell. I am still trying it on some other scars, and would update my review if It shows results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I like this product as a moisturizer. I apply it on my hands before going to sleep and my skin remains hydrated.</li>
            <li> Used up 2 bottles already and just started using my third. If I was stranded on an island and only got to take five skin care products, this would be one without a doubt. I don&#x27;t care if it smells weird because it doesn&#x27;t last long and my skin has improved so much. My acne scars, dark spots, and breakouts (from trying a million other products that just irritated my skin) are vanishing. Loveeee!</li>
            <li> Of all the oils I&#x27;ve used thus far . . . my facial skin loves to absorb this moisturizing oil.  I keep mine in the refrigerator and especially enjoy how the coolness feels so refreshing to my Florida skin.  My mother loves this oil also, in fact she is the one who told me about it.  *smiles*</li>
            <li> My second bottle.Not only really good for the face, but I&#x27;m using it on my cuticles and nails/very healing.</li>
            <li> i use this on my neck area that is almost always inflamed and have melasma that is called poikiloderma of cavette.  This product is beginning to heal that area and feels wonderful, no stinging.  I use it twice a day and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great price excellent quality</li>
            <li> Like the product.But not the scent.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted! I use it for skin care and I can already see the differences.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural tends to be very generous with their product, and that&#x27;s always a plus.  It&#x27;s so great to find a company that isn&#x27;t trying to cheat its customers by charging outrageous prices for tiny bottles of product.  That said, I wish I could be more enthusiastic about the rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very emollient, good for your skin, and definitely something I&#x27;d add to a moisturizing cream or lotion to up the ante against dry skin.  But I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s done anything for my stretch marks, it might have made a small scar of mine less noticeable, and I haven&#x27;t seen any appreciable change in either my hair or nails after using this product.  That isn&#x27;t to say that I dislike it, not at all.  But I find it less useful to me than a number of the other products that InstaNatural markets.  Also?  I hate the pump.  It squirts the oil everywhere.  I much prefer the dropper that a lot of the other products come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So points for being very good for my skin, but a star off for the presentation, and because I can&#x27;t honestly see some of the benefits I should be seeing.  It&#x27;s still a darn good product!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I use this as a moisturizer over my dermatitis and there&#x27;s no extra irritation.  Works well and now using to help with stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my review here: http://kinkykinetik.blogspot.com/2014/09/product-review-instanatural-facial-oil.html</li>
            <li> This particular brand is different from other rose hip seed oil I have used in the past.  Yes I like it for hands, body and hair, but too greasy for face.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My skin is glowing.  Have been using product for three weeks and already seeing results.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Great product. It has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  I love that my skin soaks it up and doesn&#x27;t feel the least bit greasy.  I could use it morning and night.  Def&lt;br /&gt;a keeper!  I would caution that my eight year old son thought the smell was horrid but I am still giving it five stars because I think it&#x27;s earthy and soothing.  I break out from thick moisturizers and sometimes so called light ones, but not this.</li>
            <li> Good quality. I like it and it&#x27;s great for the price!</li>
            <li> Until I got this bottle to try out I honestly had never heard of rosehip oil or any of it&#x27;s uses. So of course I did what mot these days do, I googled it. I turned up more information then I thought I would. All the benefits that the oils has and what it&#x27;s used for. Mostly anti-aging. And at 30+ that is just what I am looking for. I have fine lines and some wrinkles started and I would like to head them off as soon as possible. This oil has helped my skin feel softer and younger and the fine lines around my face seem a little softer as well. I was worried about my face breaking out but this doesn&#x27;t seem the case at all, I have had some pimples but nothing like I thought I would have. And even my make up seems to go on more even and smoother as well. If you want great skin, this is a great product to get it with!</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the odor. Should have returned it.😣</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all of the reviews and product details. I thought about the comments of it has an orange tint to it. Silly me! I thought it would be SLIGHTLY orange as stated.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is so Orange, it looks like you gave yourself a cheap tan out of a can.&lt;br /&gt;After about an hour, I started to itch. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I could&#x27;ve probably handled the itch, but not that deep orange color.&lt;br /&gt;I look to the reviews in hopes that people are being honest. I&#x27;m honest in my reviews. This isn&#x27;t a slight, it has a tint of orange color, this is like what they clean you with before surgery color orange!&lt;br /&gt;I did contact Instranatural, asking for a refund, which they promptly provided.&lt;br /&gt;The product came in record time, so I&#x27;ll give them 2 stars for that.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you looking to try this, just beware, this is a very deep red orange color! I&#x27;m very light and fair skinned, maybe it doesn&#x27;t show on other skin types. Good luck to you!</li>
            <li> I work outdoors and I appreciate how the Insta Natural Rosehip Oil makes my skin feel smooth and silky. I normally use it after I have used the Moroccan Rose Water Facial Toner.</li>
            <li> Good product but the smell is a lil strong, but it does not bother me because i only use one drop with two drops of my organ oil perfect for my face, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for many things but mostly to keep my scalp moist. With a organic shampoo and the rose hip oil I am hoping to rejuvenate some of my hair follicles into growing.</li>
            <li> This oil is saving my face from the dry desert air.  Oil absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> My gildfriend has less than 2 weeks using it in her face,  and has really shown a noticeable change. Her skin looks very clean and pimples have been disappearing. their skin is more clean and smooth now. 100% works in the skin&#x27;s face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to me respect,  I&#x27;m using it to correct a recent scar of circumcision, for this purpose the process is slower to perceive change, Later on I&#x27;ll talk about the results. But changes has began, and the scar has begun to flatten or decrease.</li>
            <li> This product is better than any of the expensive, chemical laden products that I have tried in the past.  In fact, it works so well, I&#x27;ve ordered more to ensure I never run out of this product.  Good product, good vendor, you can&#x27;t go wrong with ordering anything from InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> I applied for the promotion this company was doing, and was super happy to be able to try out their facial oil. They also sent me a free bottle of their Rosehip Oil as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably just really naive in terms of facial care, but the idea of applying oil to my face  seemed a bit strange. For me, I try to keep my face NOT oily. Still, I was excited to try the product, and did so as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Facial Oil was pretty self explanatory. It cleansed. It says on the front of the bottle that it can be used as a makeup remover. The first night I tried it, I didn&#x27;t have makeup on. I&#x27;d used another cleanser earlier that morning, and has basically sat inside all day, so I didn&#x27;t think my face was in need of too much cleaning. I grabbed a dry facecloth, applied the oil and began to gently wipe my face. I was mildly horrified, and weirdly impressed when my white facecloth turned brown. I couldn&#x27;t believe the grime it had picked off on my face after just a quick sweep of the area. Since then, it has become my go to cleaner, makeup or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, their was a definite oil feel and I was worried for the impending breakout. It didn&#x27;t happen. My skin absorbed it and my face was super soft. No residue and no acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to my Rosehip Oil, while the bottle gave possible uses, I was wanting to see what other people used it as. I turned to two of my groups on Facebook. They are both for varying levels of &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; moms. I asked them if Rosehip was in any of their daily routines. A lot of them used it for a facial cleanse and moisturizer every night. (I tried this later on and found that it was interchangeable with the facial oil and provided similar results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others used it on their babies, for dry patches of skin, and even cradle cap! They used it in their hair, and as the bottle suggested on their scars, even their stretchmarks! I&#x27;ve tried it, not routinely, on a few of their suggestions, and each timeI was pleased.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend bought this on the recommendation of a friend. she doesn&#x27;t love the smell (it smells like an oil -- think olive oil or canola oil) but she doesn&#x27;t mind it either. she does say it does seem to helping and that her skin looks more vibrant and healthy. only time will tell if it helps with the fine lines and acne scars. (from all the research she has done this is supposed to help with everything!) The oil was a vibrant amber just like it is supposed to be and the pump makes it easy (&amp; hygienic) to dispense.</li>
            <li> Great item, fast service, awesome transaction. A+</li>
            <li> Love this as an all purpose oil for my skin and face</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother. This is the only product that keeps her skin hydrated. She loves it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about two weeks, so there&#x27;s been no chance for it to diminish any of my scars or stretch marks. I use it after dry-brushing and showering, and my skin is instantly radiant! I am far more impressed by this oil than by coconut oil-- coconut oil just didn&#x27;t do much for me by itself. I used the rosehip seed oil on my hair as well, and it calms my poofy tresses into a semblance of defined waves without weighing my hair down or leaving behind a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the malodorous fishy smell, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for this organic, natural goodness in a bottle. I might try mixing it with other ingredients to give it a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin and does well mixed with Argan oil as an overnight hair treatment--wash out in the morning. Smells like french fries.  If you can get past the scent, it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and received argan oil instead ?!</li>
            <li> Perfection.  My skin looks so good with my morning regime that everyone thinks Im 6-7 years younger than what I am.. I now prefer to skip the store brand chemicals and go natural.. its less expensive and the quality of the product is much better. Would def continue using this and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The organic rosehip oil is a Heaven sent treasure! I have many scars from surgeries and more unfortunately, stretch marks. I have tried many products over the years and nothing ever really helped. I have used the rosehip oil now for about 3 weeks and can see a considerable difference in my scars and even though my stretch marks are from pregnancies of more than 20 years ago, I can still see a difference in the color and texture of them.  This is one item that will now be a staple in my home.&lt;br /&gt;Any time I can find a product that is not only organic but works well, I make sure I always have it on hand!&lt;br /&gt;One thing with the rosehip oil is that at first it does have a strong smell to it that takes a little time to get used to. Once it&#x27;s on the skin  the scent goes away so no worries there. To alleviate this simply add the rosehip oil to your favorite lotion and voila! Problem solved.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and a pretty big bottle. I hope it works and love the feeling of it.</li>
            <li> I like this Rosehip oil because it is so easy to use and great for many things including nails and the cuticles. It is easy to use and comes with a lot. There is no awful smell to it and it easy to apply. It leaves my hands feeling refreshed and worth it. I highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to protect their nails and cuticles or skin for that matter</li>
            <li> SETAF Organic Rosehip Seed Oil - I love this oil! I got it on a promotion and on a whim decided to try it on my feet which let me tell you are a mess. I have to stay constantly on top of foot care or I get athletes foot that quickly gets out of control. Forget all the spray on remedies from the local drug store - i have tried them all with zero success.  The best results I have had is with grade a pure African undiluted Shea butter which is antibacterial and I use twice a week but was still needing to apply a moisturizer nightly before bed.  I tried this Rosehip oil and was surprised at how nice my feet have been staying.  I apply a light layer working it well into the foot then put on white cotton socks before bed. My feet have been staying smooth and none of the usual drying and cracking I have been fighting. I am also using a vitamin C serum very lightly on my feet as well once a week with salasylic acid to help slough the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I like this oil, it is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling &#x27;oily&#x27;.  I have older skin, wrinkles and lines;  haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to know if it will help these problems or not, but it leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife. She is Asian, if that is important to anyone reading this, and has dry skin. She also has been getting some mild acne, very sensitive to products in general. I ordered this oil based on reviews, and I wanted Organic ingredients. The oil has a very mild scent, which basically disappears soon after applying. It has done wonders for my wife. Skin is so much softer, healthier, glowing. She mixes a few drops in with her facial moisturizer (Juice Beauty,) as well as applying a few drops out of the shower to whole body. She is very discerning, and has been thrilled with this Rose oil. It seems not to clog pores, and has been really miraculous for her. Also, Instanaturals, the company that distributes this through Amazon, really stands behind their product, and are a pleasure to do business with. I order exclusively through this particular seller, and would recommend the same for anyone interested in great products, and great customer service.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly followed by an e-mail from AJ explaining how to use the oil, what it should look like, smell like and how it works.  That is what I call EXCELLENT Service.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is exactly as described a fe drops go a long way and it is absorbed completely and the smell lasts a few seconds, it is not unpleasant dont get me wrong.  It is too early to say much about the effects, but my skin feels very silky and soft on application.  I use it on my face and neck, add it to my body lotion as well as my leave in conditioner, and alone on my scalp.  i will definitely keep ordering this oil.</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil to review!  I just can&#x27;t say enough about Rosehip Oil, it&#x27;s the best product that I have tried and I would highly recommend it!  I have been putting it on my face for quite awhile and it has made my skin look better than it ever has!  It has helped reduce my fine lines and made my skin super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil is naturally rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega 3, 6 and 9), Vitamin A and C, that&#x27;s what makes it perfect for your face, hair and nails, plus it&#x27;s a skin enhancer.  I love that it&#x27;s a chemical and preservative free formula!  It&#x27;s extracted from (Rosa Mosqueta) that provides natural and safe protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it as a toner. It is refreshing and smells great! I will buy this again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is good rosehip oil. It seems fresh, and I put it directly into the fridge to preserve it. My bottle had a faulty pump, so I emailed the company, and they had a new bottle in my hands the next day (which was a Sunday.)</li>
            <li> Love it!  The product is great quality at a good price.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil. It makes my skin feel so smooth and moisturized and has a nice, warm, earthy smell. I haven&#x27;t used it on my face yet because my skin is prone to breakouts but I&#x27;ve been using it on my body and hair.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this rosehip oil so much..My skin is very dry an I love how it feels after I massage my hands and face with it before going to bed....I also like the fact that it is organic ..meaning all of it is good for me.....Yes I will be buying this in the future to have in my daily arsenal!</li>
            <li> The oil delivers almost EXACTLY what I expected it to</li>
            <li> The fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s 100% pure &amp; organic is the reason I purchased it. In addition it&#x27;s offered at a fair price. It&#x27;s a beautiful &amp;#34;goldish&amp;#34; color &amp; smells as it should (remember, there are no additives such as a floral scent). I use Rosehip seed oil morning and night and it absorbs. into my skin wonderfully. After washing my face, I smooth on Hyaluronic acid, then I used about 5 drops of Rosehip. Finally, I finish up with my moisturizer with a little finely ground L Ascorbic Acid &amp; then eye cream. I smooth all but my eye cream onto my neck &amp; front of my hands. I find I&#x27;m frequently adding it to my lips  thru-out the day. Remember to keep this in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> This has made an amazing and very noticeable improvement in my skin.  I mix it with a few drops of Vitamin C serum and use it all over my entire body after my bath or shower.  Waiting to see how it does through winter as I usually have a lot of itching with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this Rosehip Oil! My face feels cleaner with out stripping away my natural oils in my face. I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and have experiened less breakouts. I only use eyeshadow, mascara, and Eyeliner. My routine is I apply Insta Natural Facial Cleanser to my face with a cotton pad using small upward circles.  Using a hot wet clean washcloth I wipe away the cleanser. Then I appy Insta Natural Toning Rose Water with a clean cotton pad using small upward circles again. Immediately followed with Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum and just one squirt of this Insta Natural Rosehip Oil (which is all you really need for your face). I also apply a few squirts of this to my body to moisten my skin, followed by baby oil to cut the smell of this oil down. My only down side to this oil is that it kinda smells like vegetable oil but using either my bath and body works lotion or johnson and johnson&#x27;s baby oil covers up the smell of the oil. My stretch marks and dark spot on my face have really lightened up!  The company has emailed me to check to see how I liked their products and give me proper instructions on how to apply their products. All in all it has been a great experience :)</li>
            <li> I love this Rosehip Oil. I use this oil along with Argan Oil (from the same manufacturer) and coconut oil to make my own face cream and I love the results I am getting. I have shared my cream with a few of my family members. So far everyone is loving my new cream. This bottle is huge so I will have some for awhile but if I keep sharing my cream I will be buying more sooner than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my skin!!! I have less clogged pores and my skin look radiant! Its even prevented breakouts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now to help heal some scars and they seem to be lightening.  It doesn&#x27;t smell very nice but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> The oil is somewhat more thicker and greasier than the Trilogy brand I normally use. I use it more as a body oil now..</li>
            <li> the color is yellow and smell not good.</li>
            <li> My acne prone 12 year old&#x27;s skin has really responded to this.  My 50 year old skin loves it too.  We keep in the fridge to extend the life.</li>
            <li> I had been ordering Rosehip Seed Oil from a different vendor but decided, mostly due to cost, to give this a try.  It works well, just different from my normal supplier.  The oil seems a little different, perhaps a little more greasy than what I&#x27;m used to.  With my previous product, my makeup seemed to go on a bit better over the oil.  Perhaps my previous oil absorbed a little better.  Order this again?  Not sure at this point.</li>
            <li> Love how it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day! I&#x27;ve kept it in the refrigerator as directed and have not experienced that fishy smell that some reviews have claimed. All and all I am very satisfied with this product! Thank you again</li>
            <li> I chose this oil because of the pump dispenser, its USDA Organic certification and the dark amber bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By having a pump dispenser there is less opportunity for contamination from your hands/fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rich in color and has a wonderful nutty aroma.  It soaks in quickly, as it should.  I wear it as a daytime and nighttime moisturizer and have started using it as a body moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although at first the logo turned me off (first impressions and all), the positives outweighed the logo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels.. Ive been using this oil all over my body and not a piece of dry skin in sight. Good bye rough, dry and cracked cuticles. :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product makes my skin feel moisturized and light.</li>
            <li> Great product! I mix this with my moisturizer and I just love how it feels on my skin the day after. I&#x27;m glad they have the 4 OZ and having it 100% pure just make it better.</li>
            <li> Large bottle for a great price.  Very moisturizing and will last a long time... seller sent instructions on how to use/store which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I use it as a carrier with essential oils for my skin serum and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I use this at night as my &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;. After I cleanse at night, then I tone with the InstaNatural Rose Water, then I follow it with about 7 drops of this. I have noticed a smoother, more plump, soft appearance to my skin in the morning. This is a product I would absolutely recommend for a night moisturizer for its amazing anti-aging benefits!</li>
            <li> This oil is super rich and you only need a tiny little bit and it goes a long way. 1-2 drops is plenty to cover your face and neck. Again, this is another product that is very inexpensive compared to your usually beauty products, and will last you at least twice as long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the feel of oil on your skin? You can mix a few drops into your favorite moisturizer and apply it to your skin that way, to get the added benefits from Rosehip Seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip seed oil is also great for promoting nail and hair growth too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved using this as a moisturizer. I found I only needed 1 drop for my face and I&#x27;d gently massage it into my skin. It was incredibly moisturizing without ever making my skin feel oily or greasy. It is actually a really great moisturizer. I used it both day and night for maximum benefits and loved how my skin felt immediately after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and have been very happy with the results. My skin feels more luminous and soft. I also had a few days of hardly any sleep, and this oil really did work amazingly to hide those dark circles! I don&#x27;t think I looked nearly as tired as I would have without using this amazing product!</li>
            <li> This product is a new one for me.  I was recently diagnosed with allergies to multiple preservatives which are commonly used in most products put on our bodies - from toothpaste to body lotions to laundry detergents, etc.  I am now making my own products with totally organic and natural ingredients.  After doing research, I purchased this product to add to these homemade products. The service was prompt and I also received follow-up inquiries to be sure that I had indeed received and was satisfied with the item - great customer service.</li>
            <li> Non, greasy, and super light. Great for acne and excema. It&#x27;s natural and has been used for generations so I trust it. A lot of celebrities swear by it. I put it on my skin at night and awake up glowing!</li>
            <li> I have weird patches of dry skin on my face and after just a few applications of the Rosehip oil, I saw HUGE differences in my skin. It was not only moisturized, but it also stayed that way all day. I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or like an oil slick is on my face. I love this and when I run out, I will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try Insta Natural’s Rosehip Seed Oil and one thing that I can tell you about this miracle oil is that it did wonders for my enlarged facial pores and skin damaged by UVA/UVB rays! I have very sensitive skin and the sun has really done a number on my face over the last few years. I was beginning to accept the fact that the pores on my face were beginning to expand. I attributed it to the fact that I was getting older and told myself that I just needed to “live with it.” After having the opportunity to try the Insta Natural Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, much to my surprise, after only a few weeks, I began to notice my facial pores getting smaller and my skin began looking more rejuvenated and supple. I would totally recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> I love all natural and organic skin and makeup products! This product is great for stretch marks and scars, I really can see how this oil has improved the appearance of my old stretch marks from my pregnancy and the scars on my legs are beginning to fade. This is worth a try for the skin care conscious out there, also the quality is so much better than other brands that have rosehip oils that are triple the price. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Can I say I LOVE THIS? The oil at first seems like oh my is this greasy? However, once you apply and it sets it makes your skin super soft. I do NOT break out from this. I use it under my eyes and forehead. I mixed with Frank/Purification Essential Oils. It is my after shower nighttime serum.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and for reasons unknown, although it said it has been shipped, I never received it upon which Amazon issued me a refund.  When the seller saw this (this was an Amazon Marketplace seller with amazon fulfillment) THEY contacted me and offered me a new bottle free of charge!  I received the product 2 days later!  This oil sinks right into the skin and leaves my face, hands and hair feeling moisturized without feeling heavy with grease.  It DOES however have a very earthy smell which some people might find a bit strong-I just added a few drops of lavender EO and that took care of that!  This ended up being a lovely transaction with a company that still believes in outstanding customer service in a day and age when ANY customer service seems to have all but disappeared.  I will order from this company in the future! Thanks AJ!</li>
            <li> This oil is lovely. I saw a difference in the softness of my skin after the first time I used it. I use it on both my hands and my face and I have seen such a big difference in my skin. I am very pleased and I will never be without it. I keep it in the fridge to keep it fresh and I love the scent. It is not overwhelming, just gentle and earthy. Thank you InstaNatural! Your wonderful products and amazing follow up and customer service have made me a customer for life!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in excellent  conditions and I have been using it for a 2 weeks period and certainly seems to help.</li>
            <li> This is a Huge bottle.  Most come in a 1oz size.  The 1st night I received it, I added it to my bath water.  It left my skin smooth without the greasy feeling.  The next day I mixed it with my lotion and it was wonderful.  My current temperatures are freezing or below and adding Foxbrim definitely was a plus.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit odd, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference with the look of my skin after first few applications but it does seem to leave it feeling softer and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Made my nails grow and my skin soft love it so I would recommend</li>
            <li> I loved the results the first couple days and then I started breaking out. If you have sensitive skin please be cautious and test small areas first. It works amazingly but this is a down fall!</li>
            <li> After using this in various beauty uses for a couple of months, I can say that it is a good all over moisturizer for the winter so far. Thanks for an outstanding customer service and please keep maintaining the good quality product of this oil I will be back for more soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this a few weeks ago so I can&#x27;t speak about the benefits overall. But I do have extremely sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t broken me out and my complexion is looking great. I use it twice a day. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily. But because this is a drying oil I feel like I have to apply it twice a day to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The good thing about this oil is that it doesn&#x27;t break  me skin out.  At the same time, it hasn&#x27;t made any improvement either.</li>
            <li> This is the best rose hip seed oil I&#x27;ve tried. And 4 ounces for the price is better than some people are selling 2 ounces or less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for sometime now and I really like it. I don&#x27;t use it on my face but I do use it on my hair and nails. The areas around my cuticles get VERY dry - so much so that I have hang nails all the time and sometimes my cuticles crack. This product has helped soften my skin in those areas as well as alleviated lots of the dryness that I&#x27;ve previously experienced. As far as my hair, its so awesome! I get dandruff really bad mainly due to the drying out of my scalp and this product is great for that. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about the product is the smell. It has a weird smell to it, almost like cooking oil - so whenever I do use it, I make sure that I&#x27;m not going anywhere that day.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Rosehip Seed oil and I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first because of it&#x27;s unusual natural aroma and amber color. When I first I applied it went on oily but it quickly absorbed into my skin and the oily sheen vanished, It reminds me of a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil contains over 500 natural ingredients that are beneficial to all kinds of skin. For example the fatty acids, Omega 3,6 and 9 and Vitamin A helps prevent and improve fine lines and wrinkles. People who suffer from psoriasis or eczema can see and feel immediate results because Rosehip oil goes deep into the skin to moisturize the driest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides uses for pre-aging and moisturizing, it also can be used to minimises the size of pores and helps blemishes to go way quicker giving you smoother-looking even toned skin with a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reason I decided to try Rosehip Seed oil is because of it&#x27;s ability to help reduce scarring and the appearance of stretchmarks. I have acne scars and using this oil for only a couple of weeks I have seen a major improvement. In two weeks time the scars have smooth flat and I know with continued use they being to fade more and more. Rosehip Seed oil is also great to treat skin burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be used directly from the bottle, or mix it into your favorite moisturizer or lotion. How about adding it to a massaging oil and giving your significant other the best massage they ever had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The origin of Rosehip Seed oil is from Chile and it is actually considered a vegetable oil. It is a delicate oil because it is extracted using a cold pressed manufacturing process which no chemicals or heat are used. It should be kept in a cool dark place or refrigerated to keep it at its full potential. Keep it away from direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I love this oil it has so many uses and really softens skin, it also will help get rid of past sun damage and tanning bed damage I did both when I was young . this product is really easy to use packaging is fantastic and the bottle is a generous supply that will lat and last. People have been using Rosehip oil for a long time back when other products were not available its a fantastic staple to have in your home for so many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a low cost sample to try it so I could make an informed review for it , you cant beat it for price and purity and with so many uses its a great value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using InsatNatural organic Rosehip Oil for about a 3 weeks now. This oil is amazing, my face glows and my darks spots are clearing up. I use it morning and at night before I sleep. The Rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t leave my face oil. Thats a plus</li>
            <li> This product works great ! I applied a few pumps after I got out of the shower and when my hair dried it was so soft and smooth !! Works great on conditioning nail cuticles as well !! However I tried this on my face and it broke me out. So those with sensitive skin be careful if applying to your skin 😊</li>
            <li> need time to see if it works</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love this product! Can already see a difference in skin tone and has diminished the number of blemishes.  It&#x27;s not as fragrant as you would think but the scent is not totally unpleasant. Love that it is totally natural.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! My skin is always dry due to hypothyroidism especially my feet. I use this daily and they are getting softer and smoother. All the rough spots are disappearing. Very happy, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great size for a great price</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my hands and love it! My hands get super dry and cracked during dry weather and it has helped my hands. I plan on using this on my face and will definitely re-review the product.</li>
            <li> I found my new face and hair oil.</li>
            <li> I like it. I apply once a day before going to bedand keeps my skin hydrated all day. Has amild pleasant earthy sent that quickly fades. I have acne prone skin and hasn&#x27;t had any adverse affects in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think that you can find Rosehip oil for a cheaper price, but I really wanted something in a glass bottle that I could reuse for homemade skincare that included essential oils (which eventually break down plastic) and so I spent more to get this. I love the bottle, the dispenser is perfect and doesn&#x27;t pump out too much. Great value for the price if you reuse the bottle like I am.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this rosehip seed oil. It has a much fresher, earthier scent than what I have purchased in retail stores. It was also much cheaper per ounce. ($10/oz retail vs $20/4oz here) I highly recommend for skincare. The cobalt glass dropper bottle is very nice, too- I will reuse it for other oils or tinctures when I have used up the rosehip oil. I am glad that the description recommends to keep it refrigerated. It will keep longer that way.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Best customer service ever!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. It&#x27;s soothing qualities and wonderful fragrance are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Instanatural rose hip oil is organic, cold-pressed, and unrefined oil from the fruit or hip of the sweetbrier, also known in the Andes as rosa mosqueta, or scientifically as Rosa rubiginosa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrefined rose hip oil has an unusual clean, verdant odor, similar to the leaves and stems of roses.  The high beta carotene content gives it a beautiful golden orange that was quite a surprise the first time I used it.  It is quickly absorbed by the skin and, remarkably, leaves no oiliness or sheen.  It is a pleasure to use on the skin and cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four ounce glass bottle is tinted blue to protect the oil from light, and the cap has a glass dropper for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.  I have enjoyed the pleasant summery scent and the protection against drying that it has provided to my skin during this long winter’s end.</li>
            <li> Intranatural rosehip seedoil is, according to a female friend, fast absorbing and makes her feel more confident going into her job regarding her facial appearance.  (She has no delusions that this product is going to reverse her age.)  She tells me it is quick dissolving on the fingertip and that you really don&#x27;t need a napkin or anything like to apply; straight from hand to face.  I&#x27;m happy that she&#x27;s happy, and would recommend this product to anyone with a skin condition or a desire for a healthy product.</li>
            <li> I’ve been a recent convert to using Argan oil to help deal with dry, cracked fingertips, and have been very pleased with the results. This Rosehip seed oil is proving to be equally effective at dealing with overall hand moisturizing, and seems to be a bit better (or at least quicker) in dealing with cuticle damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a very nice cobalt blue glass bottle with a dropper. The dropper is essential since you really only need a couple of drops. This is an oil, so a little goes a long way. I usually use about two drops per hand and that is ample to get good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an earthy scent, which was surprising to me since I assumed it would smell like roses. The fact that it does not is a big plus. The scent, which is quite nice and unique, dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is oily when first applied, it soaks in well after a few minutes. It seems to absorb into my skin quicker than Argan oil. Once absorbed it leaves my skin feeling soft but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this has a multitude of uses, it’s been working very, very well to repair my damaged hands (I hate cold weather!!). The price is more reasonable than Argan oil, especially when you consider this comes in a 4 ounce bottle. At a few drops per day, it will be a while before another bottle is needed! I very much like this oil, and would recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 of these bottles and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a vegan, eat healthy, get plenty of exercise, drink lots of water and get at least 9 hours of sleep every day.  I&#x27;m a firm believer that these are the foundation of having beautiful skin and preventing premature aging.  With that being said, this oil is NOT a magic potion.  If you eat greasy foods all the time, or hate vegetables or just don&#x27;t get enough sleep--this oil is not going magically get rid of acne/wrinkles/etc. overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing to remember about this product:&lt;br /&gt;- use it immediately after your skin is moist, like after taking a hot shower&lt;br /&gt;- nighttime use is recommended, right before bed&lt;br /&gt;- take the time to massage the oil into your skin---3 minutes tops&lt;br /&gt;- always close tightly after every use&lt;br /&gt;- read the email the seller sends you about what you can expect (the fact that they actually send you an intro email is impressive, btw)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on:&lt;br /&gt;Face - I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference on the texture of the skin on my face--it&#x27;s softer, more supple.&lt;br /&gt;Legs - the scars from my mosquito bites from last summer are fading--yay!  and my leg hair have thinned&lt;br /&gt;Underarms - scars from razor irritation are fading too&lt;br /&gt;Hands - and because I use my hands to apply this oil to basically everywhere on my body, when it&#x27;s all said and done, my hands are glowing!!</li>
            <li> Just the item I needed to makke mmy eye cream. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery  of order but, the consistency and odor I found to more agreeable to pop corn with than to slather on face and body.  Still going to give it a chance.  Will report back in six weeks if results are positive.</li>
            <li> I apply this nightly to my face and neck mixed with lavender and carrot seed oil to reduce fine lines, minimize discoloration and rejuvenate my skin. After 2 weeks I can confirm that I love it and will continue the regime.</li>
            <li> This product was a miracle worker for my skin. I have very hormonal acne ridden skin and a combination of this (and birth control) has finally solved this problem for me. I&#x27;m beginning to love my skin and not be so self conscious anymore. I just scrub every night with cetaphil antibacterial soap and put on a little bit of rosehip oil before bed, and just rub my face with really warm water instead of re-washing. My makeup goes on smooth and my face isn&#x27;t dry or oily, it is just right. I gave 4 stars because the bottle arrived covered in oil which really ticked me off, though the bottle was still full so I guess it really wasn&#x27;t a big deal. It also smells sort of like eggs at first but that literally goes away almost immediately. Overall I am very happy with this product and will not go without it :)</li>
            <li> I really love this oil, i wear it at night before i sleep. It is a great moisturizer, keeps my skin hydrated. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this! It goes on smooth, spreads easily, and after a little while, my skin feels like silk. Very very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in my skin since I started using Rosehip oil. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and absorbs into your skin nicely. I love the dispenser on this bottle. The company has been great. I received an email with the various uses for Rosehip oil as well as a follow up to see how I like the product. It&#x27;s rare to find companies nowadays with such great customer service.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the other ones I have used. Not even sure if it is the real stuff- it smells like mustard oil. Also, didn&#x27;t soften my skin as well as other ones I have tried. I will go through this for this time, however, will not be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> After I take a shower (and shave my legs in the shower) I immediately slather this rosehip oil over my legs. This prevents them from the usual itchiness that accompanies shaving. I also apply it to my abdomen because of stretch marks received from 2 pregnancies. My husband, and I love him so much, says I should wear the stretch marks as badges of honor for the pregnancies of our two boys, but I just don&#x27;t think I am cool with that yet. So I am trying to reduce these  Momma Tiger stripes as best I can. I like the feeling that I am feeding my skin in some way. I think the best way to use this product is mixed in with one&#x27;s favorite lotion or cream. It is simple, only contains one ingredient, and I like simple. I find that my legs are definitely so much smoother and softer after using this. It comes in a nice, dark glass pump container, which is so much easier than just a twist off top, and less likely to spill, expose to the air, or waste. I have read that rosehip oil can smell like fish. I was raised in the country and my siblings and I would take long walks, picking rosehips as we went and often eating them. This oil is reminiscent of that flavor/smell. Doesn&#x27;t smell like fish to me, -so don&#x27;t be deterred. It smells clean, actually.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 100% Pure Certified Organic Rosehip Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Extracted from wild rose \\&quot;Rosa Mosqueta\\&quot;. 100% pure, Organic, and unrefined.&lt;br /&gt;Use, once opened, within 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;Not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;Keep refrigerated to extend life.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance-free, chemical-free.&lt;br /&gt;Cold-pressed.&lt;br /&gt;4 fl. oz.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and is exactly as listed....;)  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase*</li>
            <li> This is very nice, organic rosehip oil.  I use it on my face and neck every day and love how it moisturizes.  The price is great, too.</li>
            <li> This is oil is amazing!! I use it along with the InstaNatural Argan oil as my face &amp; neck moisturizers &amp; they both have done wonders for my skin! You DO NOT need alot of this oil at all for it to work, a little goes a long way. I use one or two drops of this alone, or mix it with one pump of the Argan oil &amp; my skin is radiant!! InstaNatural makes great quality products so if you&#x27;re contemplating whether you should by from them, trust me as an honest consumer who loves good quality products, yes you should! Thanks InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> I really like InstaNatural&#x27;s organic rosehip seed oil. It&#x27;s effective and is working great for me. I use it as a daily facial and body moisturizer.  InstaNatural quickly sent the oil which was securely packaged. The company provides exceptional customer service and followed up to make certain I was happy with the product and that it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a week. I have used it on my face, hands, and nails at night three times. At first the smell didn&#x27;t bother me. I thought it smelled like brewed tea leaves. It wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and I was happy. The 3rd time, however, I noticed a slight sour smell - like stomach bile - that put me off. Is this normal? Do you think I used too much (therefore bringing out this normal note that I simply hadn&#x27;t noticed before) or has the oil gone bad? I&#x27;m trying to research more, but thought I&#x27;d post my question here as well. There is no manufacture or expiry date on my bottle and I obviously don&#x27;t know the environment(s) it has been exposed to. It looks like this is a question that has come up with other buyers. I will update the review when/if I find out more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit: After receiving more information from the seller, I think I used more than I needed to the 3rd time. I was concerned because 1) I didn&#x27;t know much about the oil other than its benefits and its relatively short shelf-life, 2) there wasn&#x27;t a date of manufacture or expiry on the bottle, so I had no idea how old it was, and 3) I&#x27;ve read that when some other oils smell sour or fishy they are usually considered rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again for your quick response!</li>
            <li> Gotta warn you up front, this stuff STINKS!  If you are expecting it to smell even remotely rosey you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  If you grew up in the south &amp; know what tobacco leaves drying in a barn smells like, this will take you back to your childhood.  It is POTENT and really doesn&#x27;t go away too quickly either.  I mostly use it at night because of the smell.  It has not left any residue or smell on my sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty-wise, I have normal-to-dry skin (fair w/freckles) so primarily wanted it as an all natural moisturizer that didn&#x27;t burn/sting.  It delivers!  And I&#x27;ve received many compliments since I started using it that my skin looks soft (&amp; it is.....a co-worker asked to touch my cheek!).  I do feel like I have to exfoliate more often which isn&#x27;t a bad thing, just more beauty time I need to squeeze in.  I have not noticed any increase in blackheads or breakouts (I get a pimple maybe 2x a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I will continue to use it as my night cream for sure!  3 pumps covers my whole face &amp; neck very well....this will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I ordered it about 3 weeks ago and have been using it morning and night.  I see a difference.  My skin is a lot smoother.  The fragrance is not overpowering at all.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of insta natural&#x27;s products, and I have to say that I am completely impressed.  My Grandma used to keep rose hip oil around, I never knew why, now I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is super rich and you only need a tiny little bit to completely cover your face, or mix it with your regular lotion if you don&#x27;t like putting the straight oil on.  I found that if I put it on after my shower, by the time I was dry and my hair was dry, so was my face.  I am using it under my makeup, and I like the way it makes my skin feel, and I like that I&#x27;m putting down a natural ingredient before the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They offer a money back guarantee if you aren&#x27;t completely satisfied, so you have absolutely nothing to lose.  Try it, I think you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback. I choose to review this product  in order to inform others of my experience.</li>
            <li> Love this product so far. I mix it with my moisturizer for my face and just use it  plain on other areas that need hydrating without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for Adult/Hormonal Acne.  I never really had a problem with acne until I turned around 32 years old.  This product is one of the few things that can help with Hormonal Acne and for that I&#x27;m truly grateful.  You get a huge bottle that will last a long time since you only need a few drops at a time so it&#x27;s a great value.  There is a distinct odor to this product - it smells earthy and very much like some of the products I use for leather conditioning.  It&#x27;s a distinct odor, but not unpleasant and it fades fairly quickly after applying, so it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me.  I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and have been unable to use products for the scent alone.  This is not one of them.  I like that it&#x27;s an all natural product and the smell is natural too - not chemical like.  It is an oil and I have oily skin, so my skin care regime is to wash my face with Clarisonic and Proactive +, Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Serum from InstaNatural, then this Rosehip Oil at night only.  It&#x27;s oily so I don&#x27;t use it at day time under makeup.  It&#x27;s oily and hydrophobic - meaning when you have this on your fingers, water will bead off of it.  It&#x27;s easily wiped down for a clean feel and even though it&#x27;s oily, it does not aggravate my oily skin in any way.  It&#x27;s a good oily that locks in moisture onto my skin and keeps it from getting even oilier.  As you may know, if you dry out oily skin - that only triggers it to produce even more oil.  So this does the opposite and helps control my oily skin.  It does help to nourish and moisturize my skin in a very gentle and effective manner.  It also helps to even out my skin tone and that is something I&#x27;m desperately trying to do.  It&#x27;s very easy to incorporate this into any skin care regime as well.  It comes in a large bottle and dispensed by a spray.  I do wish it was dispensed by eyedropper instead because it&#x27;s hard to control oil coming out of a spray.  I do 1 spray onto my hand and spread onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these products from InstaNatural and would definitely recommend them!e these products from InstaNatural and would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> I put a few pumps on my face before going to bed at night and wake up with super soft, perfectly moisturized skin. I&#x27;m 25 so I don&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles yet and can&#x27;t comment on whether this oil helps with that but I do think I saw an improvement with hormonal acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I travel a lot and initially I was worried that I couldn&#x27;t take the rosehip oil with me for my nightly regimen when I don&#x27;t refrigerator access as it may go rancid. However, after an email exchange about this with AJ, the head of the seller company, it seems that refrigeration isn&#x27;t required and the oil will last for months without it. I poured some out to a smaller dark glass pump bottle (from a previous purchase of a different brand) and have to say that I don&#x27;t see a quality difference even after traveling with it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is fairly large and will last you for quite some time. I think it&#x27;s a great buy for the value and I feel much better putting the natural rosehip oil on my face rather than lots of chemicals I cannot pronounce that come in conventional moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Here is the reason why I am loving it- It&#x27;s a multi-purpose oil for face,skin,hair,nails,stretchmarks, Scars, Spots, Psoriasis, Eczema!!! So cool, right?♥ I few drops works great for me. It is not like serum rather than it&#x27;s a oil based seed oil!☺ I guess you understand what I mean!  I use it almost everywhere. I have stretchmarks on my body,I have cracky dry feet, I have dry flaky elbows and cheeks(Yes!!horrible) After the shower, I immediately apply the rosehip seed oil and then use my regular moisturizer.Sometimes just mix both of it together and then apply well.Then apply all over my body! It makes my skin really smooth and soft! A few drops on my cuticles , makes the area soft and smooth too. For the hair, I mixed it up with the coconut oil which is also great as well. I am not yet see the result about how it removes the stretch marks, but I hope it&#x27;ll do the magic!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this seed oil if you have dry flaky skin like me!☺&lt;br /&gt;got it free to try out.</li>
            <li> my wife likes the product and uses it every day</li>
            <li> *I received a free sample from InstaNatural to try and review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have much reason to try the rosehip seed oil but I have a visible scar from a port used during chemo, so I tried it on that. Like a lot of scar-reducing products, I&#x27;m betting it takes months to notice a difference, rather than weeks, so I&#x27;ll keep using it a few times a week to see if I notice a difference. I also tried it for a couple nights after yard work left my hands cracked and painful. Even just a couple drops seemed a bit greasy but it didn&#x27;t burn like a regular lotion would on cracked and bleeding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband used the oil for both a recent scar from a cut requiring an ER visit and on his cracked hands after a hard day working on a landscaping project. He said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s stinking and oily, but that&#x27;s expected.&amp;#34; He assured me the oil absorbed quickly but he has been adding a spray lotion after using the rosehip oil because he really didn&#x27;t like the rosehip oil smell. He isn&#x27;t sure if the rosehip oil is helping but feels like the scar is healing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on the fence on whether to give this oil 3 or 4 stars. The smell was pretty off-putting, but after reading a suggestion from another reviewer to use it as an add-in with another moisturizer, I went with four stars. If the smell is what is most problematic, there are workarounds to make it less annoying.</li>
            <li> I would definitely give this product and the company that sells it 5 STARS AND MORE IF I COULD!!!&lt;br /&gt;First I got my product within 2 days of ordering and that was the free shipping option that stated it would take at least 5-8, so WOW amazing turn around time to start. Nest I have some conflict previous to trying the Rose Hip Oil due to reading that it can have a &amp;#34;Fishy&amp;#34; order and not to expect at all al &amp;#34;Rose&amp;#34; scent like many do. My Instanatural ORGANIC Rosehip Oil ...HAD NO FISHY SMELL AT ALL in my opinion! It also DID NOT leave my face oily as I had worried it may after seeing the consistency of it upon opening. I started this Rose Hip Oil review just 2 days ago and I cant believe i am actually saying this but I ALREADY SEE AND FEEL RESULTS AND HAVE HAD A COMPLIMENT FROM A TOTAL STRANGER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My face and neck seem to be tighter and my freckles brought on naturally but way extremely with sun exposure are fading fast and even the awful line across my forehead is less prominent already...Thank you Instanatural for such Fast shipping, Great Product and Amazing results!!!! Will be a repeat user for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and like it so far. It makes my skin feel soft. I have not yet noticed any improvements in skin tone or scar fading.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!!!  This oil is AMAZING!  I am soon to be 34 yrs old, and while I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, per se, I do have the beginnings of fine lines and just generally dull skin.  I have been using this oil as well as the rose water toner from InstaNatural for one week.  I mix the oil into my daytime moisturizer/sunscreen, and I use the oil by itself at night.  My skin has never looked better!  I have a youthful glow again!  I look in the mirror and see the face of a 24 yr old - not a 34 yr old!  I love that I can get results like this from a natural oil - not some over priced, over marketed, chemical filled cream.  I&#x27;m hooked on InstaNatural for life!</li>
            <li> When I was offered the chance to try out this amazing, organic rosehip oil for the first time. I didnt know anything about it. Now, I believe in its powers of making skin, hair and nails strong and bright. Upon opening ,I dropped a little onto my fingertips to smell the slightly nutty smell . It is light, and not too greasy and rubs in well with my skin.I cleaned my face, and rubbed someinto my dry spots and my forehead and cheeks where the slightest of lines are starting to appear.Any leftover oil, I rubbed into my nail beds, and onto my hands.  I love that this oil is 100% pure and organic , as are most skin products that I use. As I head towards 40 yo, I am pickier and  pickier with what I ingest and the products that I use on my skin. I love this oil and have added it to my daily moisturizing regime. The instanatural line of products are high quality and nicely packed as well as packaged.</li>
            <li> I use this liberally on my face, neck, chest, and even hair. I would love it it it had a hint of rose essence to make it smell pretty, as it just doesn&#x27;t have much smell at all now. And it&#x27;s a drag that it really needs to be refrigerated to keep it from going rank because that&#x27;s inconvenient. I have been keeping mine on my dresser, and it&#x27;s about 80 degrees in my bedroom and I think the quality is degrading. Has a little of that &amp;#34;old oil&amp;#34; smell. I should really refrigerate it, as it is such a large bottle. But it really seems to be working. Gives a lovely sheen and glow.</li>
            <li> Rosehip Seed Oil Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduces appearance of stretch marks, dark spots, scars&lt;br /&gt;Great for relief of eczema and psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes skin&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for dry, rough skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this Rosehip Seed Oil is organic, 100% pure, has no chemicals, additives or added fragrance. As pure as it gets! My dark spots are slowly diminishing and I experience less skin problems.</li>
            <li> Okay, I will start off by saying that this product doesn&#x27;t smell the best in my experience as far as these types of products go, it&#x27;s smell is earthy and indeed, well, natural. I believe the reason is because this Organic Rosehip Oil product in particular, made by InstaNatural is truly all natural and no added fragrances or aroma masking chemicals have been added. The scent that it has does not last long once this product absorbs, and it absorbs rather quickly. This product was great for everything from head to toe for me.&lt;br /&gt;My elbow on the left is what I call my computer elbow, and that&#x27;s because it get&#x27;s really dry and often lightly discolored from resting it on my desk with my head propped on my fist palm while I&#x27;m at the computer. I&#x27;m going to add that I credit this product for making my elbow look and feel soft and normal again. As far as the fairly noticeable difference in overall color in comparison to my right elbow, well since I&#x27;ve been using this product they are almost a matching pair of elbows once again.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone that has used rosehip seed in the past, it&#x27;s a pleasure to pass along some uses and why I feel this is a good brand.&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s organic. Second, the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Dark glass is the ONLY way to store this oil, and I have seen brands in clear glass as well as the dreaded plastic. Dark glass is imperative as this is an oil that can lose it&#x27;s beneficial properties if not stored correctly, and can also go rancid quickly. Any unadulterated oil can go rancid, but rosehip seed is particularly vulnerable. It&#x27;s best to put the bottle in the fridge, decanting only what you need for a few weeks at a time, or mixing with other ingredients that can prolong shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the above, I use rosehip seed as a carrier oil, that is as a base that gets added on to. If you are reading this you probably searched for rosehip seed oil because you do the same. The essential fatty acids in rosehip seed make it one of my favorite carrier oils for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to share my recipe for an overnight hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Start with a few tablespoons of avocado oil or mashed fresh avocado, add a tablespoon each of jojoba oil and rosehip seed oil. Mix in 5-10 drops each of rosemary, lavender, and carrot essential oil. Carrot is pretty expensive, but amazing stuff. If you need to skip it, open a vitamin E gel cap and squeeze it in. Even better, add a bit of MSM.&lt;br /&gt;Slather on clean, dry hair, cover with cap (I use a disposable shower cap and over that a thick stretch headband) and leave on for 5 hours or overnight. Rinse and air or blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people use rosehip seed oil as a facial skincare product. Amp up your regular night cream by adding up to 50% of this to it, especially if you are over 40 and/or a sun worshiper.&lt;br /&gt;A must for anyone that likes natural DIY skincare. When you DIY, you avoid all the chemicals that are used as preservatives in your products.</li>
            <li> WOW! This bottle is huge. It is fragrance free and makes the skin feel very soft. If you are using it as a facial product, you only need three to four drops and just pat it over your face. I received an e-mail from the company the day I ordered it with directions for the best way to use and store this product. It should be refrigerated but that just makes it all the more refreshing when using.</li>
            <li> I did some research on rosehip oil, and found that InstaNatural&#x27;s oil got 5 star ratings from over 100 purchasers.  I&#x27;m not surprised.  It is a great product of highest quality.  And, the price is great for the quantity.  I love that it is available through Amazon Prime so that I can get it within 2 days.  I will definitely be buying more of InstaNatural&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and great product</li>
            <li> I say 4 stars because comparatively, this oil is darker in color and has a more potent smell, with that said. This product (and other rosehip oil products) have done so much for my skin! I have had acne since I was like.. 12 or something. Tried everything short of accutane; I&#x27;ve megadosed on vitamins and killed my hair, spent thousands on all kinds of products.. This product, for being all natural, has done wonders for my skin. Since using I have not had one single large cyst or pimple (just little, very easily popable ones). This product has helped to even the skin tone, and helps things heal quicker. In addition to this, the other product I use almost every night is &amp;#34;Acne Stop&amp;#34; (a toner) which I also bought on amazon. It is very strong so I dilute it 1/2 1/2 with another random toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/22/15  4 to 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;This stuff (other brands included) have really really impacted my skin. No longer do I wake up with redness or painful bumps, If I get anything on my face anymore it&#x27;s because I have picked in an area at a blackhead or something, or sometimes I will get a tiny bump around my period. Even if I do pick at my face, I know that this stuff drastically lessens the severity of resulting damage. I still sometimes use a &amp;#34;acne specific&amp;#34; product like BP, but if I had to chose just ONE essential, rosehip seed oil would be it! If you have acne and have seem to have tried everything, you really need to try this. I have spent SOOOOOOO much money on beauty products, and I sorta felt that such a cheap product (rosehip oil) couldn&#x27;t do anything more than the other products Ive tried...wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. I had very bad painful cystic acne on my chin/jawline/lower cheeks. I tried laser treatments, chemical peels, and every prescription topical you could think of. I then decided to go all natural with my face care. I stopped using all products and bought this oil. I used it for both oil cleansing and moisturizing. It has completely saved my face! All the cysts are gone and I can even see the scars beginning to improve now. I could not be happier or more grateful.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchace of this product.  Great for the face in winter months- actully all year round.  Not greassy or oily.  would highly recommend</li>
            <li> This Rosehip oil seems to be of nice quality. I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil for a few years a decided to try a new brand. So far I&#x27;ve not had any adverse reactions with this particular brand, which is always great. I will admit that when I opened the bottle the smell was a bit pungent, but once I had it on my skin and the oil had time to absorb the scent was much less noticeable. The entire transaction, from start to finish, was smooth and shipping was lightning fast. thank you!</li>
            <li> This is actually a great product I ordered it for myself and when I first got it didn&#x27;t care much for the smell (I though it smell like omega oils) but after I applied on my body after a shower I noticed it absorbed very nicely and did not feel greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;My teenager son has been using it every day on his back for stretch marks and I&#x27;m starting to see the difference, they don&#x27;t look as reddish and his back feels smother, he took the bottle to his bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizer. Seems as though it would b oily but it&#x27;s awesome. It has really made my skin feel so smooth and moisturized and I get lots of compliments on my skin. It&#x27;s worth it for just that.</li>
            <li> I developed rosacea last year and have been battling it since. That is until I discovered Instanatural Rose Hip Seed Oil. It is the only product (prescription or otherwise) that helps. I highly recommend it for this problem and actually like the smell. Very earthy.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at using a oil on my face since I have oily skin but let me tell u it&#x27;s been lovely.  I&#x27;ve used it now for 2 weeks and to my surprise no breakouts! Just wonderful smooth skin, it&#x27;s even brightened my face which is the only place I&#x27;ve used it so far. This company really does care about their products and ur satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a similar consistence to the Vit C serum, but this is very moisturizing and feels amazing on my face. I also use it on my elbows and heels. My heels especially have a noticeable change and less dry. Normally without moisturizing my heels are dry and not pretty. Now even without moisturizer my heels look normal without that dry cast. Loving the effects so far. I have even used it to the ends of my damp hair. You can use this all over and would recommend for dry skin. I am hoping to see some lightening of my dark spots to my face over time. This was sent for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions</li>
            <li> After trying InstaNatural&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil, I fell in love. I did lots of reading into what pure argan oil should be and how best to use it. This is high quality, pure, one ingredient oil. I use it daily with wonderful results. Knowing this, I wanted to try other products from the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Organic Rosehip Oil. Again, love. I have also read up on rosehip oil and have found again, that this oil is what should be expected of high quality rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I use the argan oil daily after shower as I would any moisturizer. The rosehip oil, I use as a treatment for my skin. I do at nighttime every few days and on any kind of spot or blemish. I also get an occasional rash on my forearm that requires a steroidal creme from the doctor. I started using the rosehip oil on it and it takes down the inflammation almost instantly and after a few weeks it has treated it as well as the steroid. This makes me happy because it is completely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural is important to me. Not the kind of natural written on labels of national brands, but REAL natural products that have REAL ingredients, not lab created ones. I want to know that what I put onto my skin, I could also ingest. InstaNatural is COMPLETELY natural and feels better on my skin than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and performs as I need it to. It reinforces to me that forms closest their natural state are best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These oils are cold pressed, insuring none of the health properties are lost in heating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have tried many, many, many skin care products - many of them good. Never have I felt that I have found the perfect products for me. Until now - InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> My wife is from the Philippines. She has scars from old bites from ants and other bugs. She tried this on the scars and it slowly, but surely gets rid of them. She has been looking for something to help her with this problem for years. This one does the trick.</li>
            <li> I love the rosehip oil except for the smell. It smells fishy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old female with mild acne and severe acne scars.  For the past two months I&#x27;ve been using a mixture of this oil along with Moroccan argon oil from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the morning and and night as my moisturizer.  My skin looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s less oily,  less breakouts, and the dicoloration from previous zits is starting to fade!&lt;br /&gt;I keep recommending this product to friends because it&#x27;s the only all natural product that&#x27;s ever helpe my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;No more proactiv or salicitic acid!!</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  My skin is looking soft and healthy..</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for several months now and really see no difference in my skin. Before and after is the same.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Money could have been better spent.</li>
            <li> I had my hopes up about this product but it smells a bit rancid.  Was not worth the hassle of returning it so would just not purchase it again.  Maybe the heat of the summer affected it during shipping or the parcel service left it in their truck too long.  So I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. It has helped my dry skin as no other product has and I like that it&#x27;s absorbed so after a little while my skin no longer feels oily from the product. I bought it for use on my face as it was so dry and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would correct the problem! It looked dry and flakey but now looks great and normal.</li>
            <li> Four ounces may not sound like much, but it’s actually quite a large size when it comes to something like rosehip seed oil, which tends to come in smaller packages for high prices. For those unfamiliar with what this is, it’s basically the oil obtained from cold-pressing a special type of rose seed, and it contains a variety of antioxidants, vitamins, and fatty-acids which are good for the skin. It’s also found in a variety of other beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its uses, it can be used practically anywhere, from your hair to your face to your nails. It might feel a bit strange putting oil on your face/hair, since you’re usually using cleansers to get the oil out of your hair/face, but this oil actually gets absorbed into your skin after an hour, and it doesn’t leave that dreaded greasy feeling. It hasn’t clogged my pores either, nor did I experience any acne breakouts while using it. I definitely felt more moisturized after using the oil, and it does leave the skin feeling really soft. I find that it’s best to use it right after a shower, as that’s when your skin is soft and absorbent. It doesn’t have a very strong odor–it really just smells like what you’d expect oil to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific bottle of InstaNatural Rosehip oil is all organic, and it should last you a couple of months due to its large size. It’s cold-pressed so that it doesn’t lose any of its nutrients, and I’ve started seeing some of my scars fade after around 3 weeks of using it. I’d definitely recommend giving this a try for those looking for more natural solutions for their skincare needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d be happy to answer any questions/comments below!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was given a review sample</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have had acne for over twenty years and within one week of using this product it has reduced my hormonal acne on my chin. I would go to the dermatologist often and nothing would really work. I was prescribed pills, creams but who wants to take pills all their life for acne eventually I would become immune to them. Instanatural Thank you for a product that works. I use this oil along with the instanatural Vitamin C serum and I am super pleased.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to smell like roses, but it actually has a bit of a musty smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering, however, and tends to fade away once the product has been absorbed. (The familiar scent of roses comes from the petals, but this product is made from the seeds, which is why the scent is not as expected). This is a 100% pure and organic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many claims and uses for this oil--from minimizing scars and stretch marks to moisturizing face, skin, hair, and nails. I haven&#x27;t been very inventive with my use of it up until now, simply using it to moisturize my nails and cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cuticles have been really dry recently. I had purchased a cuticle oil, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing much of anything. I was still seeing cracking and bleeding, along with redness and peeling skin. Since I started using this regularly, I have noticed a pretty significant change in the condition of my cuticles. They are still dry in some places, but I&#x27;ve had no cracking or bleeding. I think that with continued use, the dryness will also go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> This spring I came to the realization that all my products were loaded with parabens and chemicals, nothing natural or pure and the result was that I was doing my skin and hair more harm than good.  Therefore, I made the decision to change, no more chemical laden products, and I discovered the natural world of oils.  I think the beauty industry is turning more and more to these healing ingredients as an alternative to the chemicals we have relied on in the recent past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest discovery for myself is Rosehip Seed Oil, and the one I tried was from InstaNatural.  I chose InstaNatural because I read that is was 100% Pure, Natural, Organic, and unrefined.  The little seal on the bottle declared that it was USDA organic, so I felt confident that it was a quality oil.  Though it is more expensive, cold-pressed is best because it has not been altered by heat and therefore retains more nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip seed oil is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed was that Rosehip oil is not greasy, it is very light, and it absorbs easily.  Furthermore, it has both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, which helps to decrease environmental damage and soothe the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a body oil moisturizer after showering and before toweling dry.  I also use it in the place of my facial moisturizer, it absorbs easily, and then I apply my sunscreen followed by my cosmetic make up.  It keeps my mature dry skin hydrated better than the chemical store bought moisturizers that I used to use, and it is healthier for my skin.  I have also tried a few drops of Rosehip Oil on my face before my nightly derma roll session.  This has helped lubricate my face enough that I am able to continue an aggressive procedure a few minutes longer without the previous irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and chemical color treated hair and my final test was using Rosehip Oil as a deep conditioning hair remedy.  The results were as perfect as using Argan Oil, which is substantially more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I poured a hefty tablespoon of Rosehip Oil into a small glass jar. (I have shoulder length, thick hair).  I then heated the glass jar with the Rosehip in a bowl of very hot water for about 30 seconds, so the oil was very warm but not hot.  I poured the oil very sparingly around my dry hair and scalp and thoroughly massaged my head for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I took my cotton hair turban; I wet it, squeezed out the excess water, heated it in the microwave for 15 seconds, put it over my head tucking my hair up and inside, and then waited an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am at the &#x60;mature&#x27; age, in my sixties, and I am aware that thinning hair can start at any time, so I do take note of how much hair loss there may be every time I wash my hair.  I only counted 5 hairs that came out in this wash, which is much less than when I rinse out after using commercial brand conditioners.  My hair had the clean feeling without the slipperiness that I had become accustomed to from the chemical hair conditioners.  I proceeded to blow-dry my hair and I was very pleased with the results.  The Rosehip oil did NOT weigh down my hair.  My hair was smooth, had volume, was soft, revitalized and there was a healthy clean sheen.  Of all the oils that I have tried, Rosehip and Argan have given me the most favorable results; however, Argan is substantially more expensive, so for me once again InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil will be used more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ends my review for Insta Natural Rosehip Oil, but if you would like to continue reading, I have done a little research of the benefits of the oil, along with a few different ways in which Rosehip Oil is utilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I give the detailed benefits of this oil, I would like to list the components that make it veryeffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil Contents&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil contains several nutrients which include:&lt;br /&gt;- Vitamin A or Retinol&lt;br /&gt;- Omega 6 or Linoleic Acid&lt;br /&gt;- Omega 9 or Oleic Acid&lt;br /&gt;- Lycopene - A highly-effective antioxidant&lt;br /&gt;- Beta-Carotene - A good source of pro-Vitamin A, another form of antioxidant&lt;br /&gt;- Natural Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil Rosehip Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  A natural Acne and Eczema Treatment&lt;br /&gt;The essential fatty acids found in rosehip seed oil work for dry scalp and itchiness due to stress and chemicals in shampoo, It&#x27;s what the skin needs for hydration and skin sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;With skin rejuvenating properties like vitamin C and lycopene, rosehip seed oil is a safer solution to repair the skin&#x27;s surface, restore elasticity and protects against sun and pollution stressors that can lead to wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Scar treatment&lt;br /&gt;Use pure Rosehip oil on stretch marks, age spots, hyper-pigmentation, burns, and scars; its astringent and skin nourishing properties will help to speed up the healing process, as well as hydrate and moisturize the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Premature aging&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is useful for premature aging and skin pigmentation problems.

            <li> I admit I was one of the many I bet that was surprised that this oil was not like &amp;#34;roses&amp;#34; at all! Yet, it was a great essential oil to have to try. I found that there are not as many uses for Rosehip oil as there are for other oils but you can still do a lot. I used it as a treatment for my Keratosis Pilaris  and it left my arm smooth and hydrated and got rid of all those annoying little bumps. I received the product complimentary for review purposes and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using rosehip seed oil for several years particularly on my face. My skin feels and looks wonderful! Your rosehip oil is the purest I&#x27;ve used yet. I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The Insta Natural Pure Rosehip Seed Oil is an awesome product. My wife has been using it for several weeks on her C-Section scar, an old chicken pox scar as well as her finger and toe nails. It adds a great amount of moisture into the area, has a great pump for optimal usage, diminishes scars and gives an overall better feeling to the person using it. My wife said that her cuticles feel great and her scars and stretch marks are actually starting to look lighter. It is a great product that can be recommended to anyone because it natural. You don&#x27;t have to worry about ingredients that can&#x27;t be pronounced or anything other than all natural oils with a natural scent. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Terrific product, makes a difference after very few days. Love it! Love it! Love it! Addicted and have recommended it to all of my friends. A MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Rosehip Oil has so many uses, from your hair, to your nails, it has a beneficial use. I have tried it on my hair, scalp, nails, and skin and I love it. Oil treatments truly help my dry skin out tremendously. With this Rosehip Oil I found my best, and favorite way to use this is on my dry elbows and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to suffer from year round dryness on my elbows and on the heels of my feet. I have tried many different creams and lotions to help this problem, yet nothing worked. After getting this, I decided to give it a try and see how it would work. I had never previously used a oil on these dry spots (why I don&#x27;t even know). I began using this the day it arrived on these dry spots. Before bed I would apply, then again in the morning after my shower. The results after about a month of twice daily use is amazing. My elbows used to be red, dry and flaky. The redness has completely diminished, and the dry patches of skin are about 80% gone. On the heels of my feet, they used to be rough, and dry. Now they are about 60% improved, much softer, and the dryness is starting to go away. I no longer feel self conscious when wearing sandals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still currently using this, and it is still apart of my daily routine. I have seen great results since using this, and I plan to continue my twice daily application until I get the results I am happy with. Then I will probably use this as a once a day treatment to maintain the results achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this totally, especially if you suffer from similar issues such as I did. It is worth a try. And with InstaNatural, you get a great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I bought this cuz I heard it helps with hyper pigmentation. The oil has a thin texture and absorbs to the skin very quickly. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin is more even-toned and moisturized. Rosehip oil also has antioxidant properties which is good for your skin in the long term.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any one. After using this product, I feels a big difference on my face. My skin looks healthier, wrinkle are disappearing, scars are disappearing, dark circle are disappearing. OMG, who ever made this product, ILYSM &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This product smells really bad.  I used it for about a week and started to break out after I used it.  I rarely get acne but I could not get rid of it until I stopped using this product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> THE STENCH WAS OVERBEARING. I had to throw it away. It smelled like cod liver oil.</li>
            <li> The fish smell that some reviewers posted is VERY strong.  As strong as fish oil pills that I have taken in the past.  I still used it as I&#x27;d heard great things about it.  Unfortunately, after I started using consistently I developed a pretty bad rash.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t take the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li> I do love this product, but it does have a pungent smell almost like a strong paint. But never the less I am still using it cause it has increased my skin softness and look dramatically!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s fabulous. It is indeed a multi-use oil! If you are curious....be curious no more. Try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dry oil that help in keeping your skin moisterized.  The oil feels refreshing when you keep it in the refrigerator the only downside is the fishy smell but fortunately it doesn&#x27;t last but a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Rosehip Oil purchased from InstaNatural.  I use it in my DIY Vitamin C serum. I also use it every other night as a night time moisturizer. In the morning my face looks refreshed and glowing.  This is a very nice product.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this along with a few drops of other oils as a night time moisturizer several times per week. I enjoy it because it offers a great light weight moisture and a brightening affect  to the skin. Also, the company followed up with me to ensure satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I have been using other brands of rosehip oil for a long time to go under my facial moisturizer. I have given this product a five star rating as it is the best deal by far world wide. I travel a lot. In fact it&#x27;s a bloody marvelous deal and a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for scars, stretch marks &amp; more. This stuff works great to make skin and face beautiful, soft and feel younger. It moisturizes as it heals. Just started using it and see results and love how soft my skin is.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few weeks bring in a whole new younger looking beauty!</li>
            <li> The smell of this is migraine-inducing. I have tried many rosehip oil brands in the past like trilogy, sukin, and Aubrey organics and none of them smells close to the way this smells. Like rancid olive oil.</li>
            <li> Very Pleases!  Thank u!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get rosehip seed oil. But when I finally did, it&#x27;s a miracle in a jar!! I love this stuff. I had a huge zit that wouldn&#x27;t go away for 3 months. When it finally dried out, I was in need of something to help it to heal. This rosehip seed oil definitely helped the healing process. I know the zit would leave a scar because it&#x27;d been on my face for so long, but this oil helped to reduce the damage. Moreover, it helped to fade the acne scar. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is one of the best most affordable affective things in the world to put on your face. - For me personally, the pure oil makes me break-out. I use other organic rosehip seed oil brands and they are perfect, but I still recommend this one if your skin can tolerate its power. I use it for my hair, works great.</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell is earthy so if you are expecting a bouquet of roses, that&#x27;s not happening.  What is fabulous about it is that is seals in moisture and leaves your skin with a lovely glow.  And skin is very soft after the oil soaks in.  I only got this a couple days ago and I have used the oil on its own and mixed in with my other moisturizers.  I prefer mixing it in with my products only because it is easier to pat on and I only have to use a couple drops.  This would also help mask the smell if it really bothers you but even using the oil on its own, the smell dissipates quickly. You want to leave a couple minutes after application before applying makeup, etc as it will it on top of your skin for a few minutes; don&#x27;t think that you will remain feeling oily as it does sink after about 10 minutes, at least for me.  I have acne that I control with other products and this has not caused any breakouts, which I see immediately if a product won&#x27;t work for me.  Results (glowing soft skin!) were within the first couple applications.  I use morning and night. As someone who really wants to limit the chemicals in my products but doesn&#x27;t want to sacrifice potency and effectiveness, I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this nourishing oil!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this oil. It is authentic, but do not expect it smell like roses. It is pure, and so smells more like pleasant garden smells, such as fresh leaves.  Use this regularly, and you will see a change.</li>
            <li> This is yet another product that didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. All it does is clog my pores and leave me with little pimples all over my face. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I never used oil on my face before since my skin is combo and it gets really oily in the summer. I&#x27;m changing my lifestyle to more organic, natural products so I gave it a try. I have not really had any wrinkle so I can&#x27;t really comment on that but I&#x27;m using it as prevention. I apply this oil at night and my skin feels really smooth in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;At first I tried to apply my moisturizer first, then the oil but one night it was late so I just applied the oil. My skin soaked the oil a lot better. Now I apply it right after my rose water. It does have unpleasant odor, but it is not bad. After a couple uses, I get used to the odor so it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Excited with my experiment with oil, I ordered two bottles of argan oil and jojoba oil also from Instanatural. I mixed three oils together and I can feel my skin absorb the mixture more quickly. None of the oils makes me break out.&lt;br /&gt;I give this four stars because my skin did not have a lot of problems to start with, I&#x27;m using it with the hope it will pay off in the future. So far I am satisfied with what this and the others have done to my skin and also the great customer service from Instanatural.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial product I have EVER bought in my life. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now &amp; I see a huge difference on my skin (face). The dryness is gone &amp; my face looks so much healthier, younger and vibrant! I mix a couple of tiny drops to my moisturizer in the morning &amp; put it on by it self at night. This stuff is awesome! I love it &amp; highly recommend it. I love my new glow &amp; how its helped my skin look fresh.</li>
            <li> I have been using Insta naural Rosehip oil for about a month. I noticed the change after I used it for a week. My skin is very sensitive and I have to pick the face products very carefully. Thanks to rosehip oil. After using it, I forgot all my night creams. I just put rosehip oil at night. It is a great product. My skin is glowing and I see a change in my under eye wrinkles. Thanks, Insta Natural!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of rosehip oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while now and have noticed my skin improving.  It&#x27;s soft and my wrinkles seem to be getting smoother including my neck!  I use it in lotion so I don&#x27;t use it straight but the job is getting done.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have found a moisture that really works, I use it each morning and night.  My skin looks good and feels so soft.  I would recommend this product to any person who needs moisture in their skin.  I sometimes put a few drops in my hair after shampoo&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is dry at times and this helps with dryness and makes my hair have a good look and feel. Most of all the results I get with this rosehip oil does not leave an oily feel but my skin feels like lite silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would be interested in trying the vit. C, I have never used vit. C and would like to know how it works on the skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is off putting but if you mix it with a fragrant moisturizer, you won&#x27;t be to able to tell.  I think it&#x27;s working... I&#x27;ll report back after a full 60 days.  EDIT: so it hasn&#x27;t been a full 60 days but I have seen amazing results after adding this product and a vitamin c serum to my skincare regimen. My deep forehead wrinkles are almost completely gone and my skin looks brighter and smoother than it has in years. I am completely sold!</li>
            <li> Great product and they have excellent customer service! Pump is very useful! I love how it absorbs into skin and moisturizes it so well. I use this for face and body.</li>
            <li> This is a good size bottle and a little bit of this oil can go a long way. I must say that it has a very fish oil smell and although it fades when it dries, it can come back at the end of the day so it might be better to use it at night (maybe it&#x27;s only me). It seems very oily when you first put it on but after it absorbs your skin feels very smooth and you know you&#x27;ve been moisturized.  I would give it 5 star if not for the smell.</li>
            <li> this is a grat oil, specially it can erase any imperfection of your skin although it&#x27;s an oil it not so oily, because it&#x27;s easily absobed by your skin.  I&#x27;m very glad that know you can ship to Mexico, and it arrived in only two days.</li>
            <li> Came fast I don&#x27;t smell anything I was sceptic since every review has sad it smells horrible but mine has a very light earthy smell dosent bother me at all seems like it works well applied last night on my hand for patch test woke up with soft non greasy loven it 👍😊😍I needed to add I&#x27;ve been using my rosehip for maybe a little less than a week omg I&#x27;ve never seen my skin look this nice Thank you again</li>
            <li> The smell is a tad funky but the product itself does wonders for my face! I apply at night and my face looks significantly brighter!</li>
            <li> Rancid! Fishy smell, darkened color. When I contacted supplier about bad product, was offered second bottle at no charge. I thought they&#x27;d send fresh oil the second time around. Just as BAD!!!</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very surprised that the Instanatural&#x27;s rose hip oil is diminishing fines lines and decreasing the size of pores.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks everyday and my skin is improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.  That being said, I was wondering if you can send me the &amp;#34;rose water ultimate facial toner&amp;#34; so I can try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m very glad that I purchased the rose hip oil and certainly will leave a positive review on Amazon regarding the rose hip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henrick Parre</li>
            <li> I love this oil, you don&#x27;t need a lot and it makes your face soft and even seems to help heal facial imperfections. I like to use it before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> While Rosehip oil I have bought elsewhere (Whole Foods) has vastly improved my complexion, this product was useless.  Too bad because it was a large bottle at a good price.  I highly recommend Rosehip oil, but not this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been a MIRACLE for my red, splotchy complexion. My skin is so much more clear! It has evened out my skin tone, helped reduce redness and flakiness and has not made me break out.  I have psoriasis and light rosacea and I can not recommend this product enough.  Great price, too!</li>
            <li> I was a tiny bit disappointed with this, it smells much more herbal and is more greasy than other oils I have used. It stays on the skin for a few minutes before it soaks in. It left my skin feeling very soft and moisturized. I would recommend using this in winter when your skin gets really dry. ( I am not a dermatologist)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using oils. I was really hesitant at first my skin being combination and getting blackheads on my T zone. But have been extremely pleased by the results! My skin is glowing and nourished! I&#x27;ll keep using oils in my beauty regimen from now on!</li>
            <li> Love this product for both hair and skin.  I live in a very humid climate and it is not too greasy,  it leaves my hair shiny and smooth and for dry skin it&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would buy again, I combine this Niancimide vitamin B serum... Has helped greatly in reduce my pigmentated skin...</li>
            <li> I like this product very much will continue to buy ,my skin is much better after two weeks of use I am just waiting to see what happens after a long while of use.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quick and leaves the skin feeling smooth. I like it</li>
            <li> Organic Rosehip Oil by InstaNatural leaves the skin soft without feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve used it on my face, neck, and feet with satisfying results.  This particular brand has no fillers which is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I purchased it to make my own anti-aging serum, but ended up using it by itself. It has a wonderful, nutty fragrance and absorbs quickly into my skin. I normally have dry, sensitive skin that needs a rich moisturizer on top of a serum, but this has not been necessary with the rosehip oil! This is all I use at night! I actually think it has helped balance the moisture on my face.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!! Great skin care product.</li>
            <li> I mix in 5-6 drops of this Rosehip Oil with the Instanatural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturzier and massage it into my face on a nightly basis. I use this at night mainly because of the smell- both products smell very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; which is a hard smell for me to get used to. However, since using these products together in combination, I feel that my skin has improved. My skin feels more moisturized and glows when I put this on. I have no seen a significant decrease in the appeared of some scars left from acne as a teenager, but I have not been using this oil very long. From other reviews I have read, it appears people who have used this product for a while saw scars and dark marks diminish so I am hoping the same will happen to me. I am impressed with the few products I have used from the Instanatural line and look forward to trying out more of them in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Works great in conjunction with a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;2. Large amount for a great price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; which is not my favorite smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the rosehip oil for a few weeks now.  I suffer from psoriasis on my face, arms and knees.  It has always been a challenge to find a moisturizer that feels good on those areas.  They can be dry and itchy at times.  Since using the Insta Naturals&#x27; Rosehip oil I&#x27;ve been itch-free.  I love the way this oil blend right into my skin instantly.  That is because it is a &#x27;dry&#x27; oil.  Overall my skin feels better and looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta Natural sent me this product for review purposes.  As always my opinion is genuine and my own.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I love that it is all natural, organic and not too greasy.  I like the earthy smell of Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product is everything as described. Great on skin and hair (wet or dry) and absorbs fast. It is a light oil but very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; waited to do a review after I had given the product time to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;. I suffer from hyper pigmentation on my chin &amp; the dark spots have faded tremendously, I use it at night because it makes my face shiny but it a great oil &amp; a little goes a long way! I was sent this product to review, but I will definitely be purchasing a bottle.</li>
            <li> This was amazing on my face! I also have been using it on my hands and feet, I have psoriasis and it is helping. I have tried so my products but this is by far the best! I ended up buying a bottle for my daughter and she is anxious to try it too!</li>
            <li> !st time trying Rosehip Oil... I love it! Great product!</li>
            <li> I adore rose hip seed oil and after trying it for the 1st time I&#x27;m sold.  I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin,but do love to moisturizer.  It is a pure and natural moisturizer that leaves my skin glowing. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.  I did however add a few drops of vitamin E, which alone is wonderful on the skin, just for a natural preservative . I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all. I make soap so have smelled MANY oils and it&#x27;s a rather pleasant smelling one at that..Okay so I tried a different brand.. Curiosity maybe ? Needless to say,  It went back.. just didn&#x27;t have the same quality or texture as this one...It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used ((:</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  This is the first Rosehip Oil I&#x27;ve used.  It has a pleasant scent.  It absorbs very quickly.  I was using it without dilution until  I read you should mix it with another oil.  It has never bothered me using it straight.  I recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. I use this twice a day as moisturizer after toning my skin with an apple cider vinegar solution. That right there is the only skin care regimen you&#x27;ll ever need! The oil is so light and absorbs into my skin really well without feeling greasy. I&#x27;m totally addicted to the earthy, slightly fishy smell - that&#x27;s the smell of all those healthy Omega 3s that naturally occur in the oil. Plus, the bottle is enormous and will last a while.</li>
            <li> OMG!! I am so astonished how good this works! I use this at night before I go to sleep. &amp; I have not seen my face as bright ! It evens out my skin tone and help with the bags under my eyes. I have sensitive skin and this has not made me have a reaction. I tried Olay anti-wrinkle or something like that and it made me break out so bad ! This is highly reputable to organic natural ingredients. Try &amp; you will not regret.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!  I have bought several products from InstaNatural  &amp; have been very, very pleased with the results.  Thus, I thought I would try their Rosehip Seed Oil and all can I say is that I am thrilled.  I use this twice a day on my face and have noticed my face is more moisturized and my skin tone is more even and brighter.  I also use it on my very dry and unruly hair in between using the Argan Oil Hair Mask.  After I treat my face, I pat my hair with the oil left on my hands.  As a result, my hair is much softer, more manageable and I no longer have to use other styling products.  A great plus, in addition to saving money, is that it does not leave an oily or sticky film on my hair.  Saving the best for last, is the results I had putting it that on an annoying skin irritation.  The results were almost immediate and after a few weeks the irritation is almost gone.  Having tried numerous ointments for months with no results, I am very happy!!!</li>
            <li> This is some amazing stuff. Great for all the skin all over your body. I use it &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; or mixed into my other lotions or creams. It is excellent for smoothing the feet, especially the skin around corns and calluses. I don&#x27;t think that I will ever be without this product :D</li>
            <li> I use Rosehip Seed oil in various skin care oils/ lotions that I have made. It does great for smoothing my skin and making scars less noticeable.  I bought this after having bought InstaNatural rose water before, so I knew it would be good quality.  This was also a great price for such a large bottle of organic RHS oil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a wonderful experience with the Rosehip oil.  Be advised that it has a small odor to it, it&#x27;s not a bad odor, but smells a bit like cooking oil.  I took a friend&#x27;s advice and added a few drops of lavender to it, problem solved.  I&#x27;ve been using the rosehip oil on my face the last 2 weeks and my skin feels amazing, especially in weather where it would normally feel dry (it&#x27;s 3degrees F today where I am), it feels hydrated but not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that the company is VERY responsive if you have any questions at all, which is nearly unheard of these days and very much appreciated.  If you&#x27;re thinking about ordering this and on the fence, give it a try!</li>
            <li> very nice product. Came quickly, it is a true oil, I use it and can feel and see the improvement . This product is time in a bottle. It nourishes your skin and you will see and feel the nutrients right away. Great add to your beauty routine.Its amazing</li>
            <li> I have received this product for free, in return for my HONEST review. Its a very high quality oil at a very reasonable price. I have seen amazing results and the product does not leave my skin oily and does not clog my pores. This product has given my skin tone a more even radiant look. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product as a replacement for a very expensive Rose Hip Oil I was using as part of my face regiment and I will say I like it for my face, but I do not love the product for my face.  I still gave it 5 stars because I have decided to use the product as a body lotion/oil instead and its amazing.  I live in Michigan and the winters are brutal on my skin.  I have not had one day of dry skin since starting this product and it last all day long.  I tend to use more natural/organic skincare products but others that I have used had to be reapplied throughout the day.  I also have found this beneficial on my babies skin as well.  Great product, despite not using it for the original purchase intent.  This is my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> Hated the smell so I returned it.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about oil. But now it has become a part of my morning and evening routine. I almost look forward to my daily ritual. The smell at first is a little unusual, almost like a flax seed smell but it goes away within a few minutes once it&#x27;s absorbed. My skin feels amazing and moisturize throughout  the whole day.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, timely delivery, all as expected. Made some amazing face, beard, hair oils out of it! Recommended!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Hydrates and moisturizes the skin of my face perfectly . I recommend this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It works pretty well but my face feels oily after use so I have to wash it off</li>
            <li> I love this Rosehip Seed oil. I use it alone or combine it with other oils. Customer service here is very good and shipping times are fast.</li>
            <li> I love this for my hands and hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t tangle as easily and brushes out smoothly and shiny. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Smells very bad; alla, spoiled olive oil.  Returning.  Never once used on my face because of the odor.  Sorry, was excited for this because of the price to quantity ratio but did not suit my needs.  Good luck to others.</li>
            <li> i love it i had some dark  spots on my chest  and its gone after applying the rosehip oil</li>
            <li> Great stuff, but I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  However, I mixed a little of my Ole Heniriksen in with it and it took on a nice citrus smell.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to be making my own skin care products.  Am still working out my own personal formula but this rose hip oil is a definite ingredient.</li>
