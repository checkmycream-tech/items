            <li>This toner has a refreshing raspberry scent, and the pads have one side that&#x27;s smooth and one textured, scrubby side.</li>
            <li>They smell AMAZING and they do a good job of getting off any excess makeup that was left after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I was using tabula rasa for my sensitive-prone to hormonal breakout- skin but these work much better and leave my skin clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Strong.</li>
            <li>I feel good supporting a company that makes natural, organic, effective products without any fillers, parabens or sodium laurel sulfate.</li>
            <li>They make your skin feel refreshed and super clean.</li>
            <li>Face feels fresh clean and not drying</li>
            <li>all of these arcona products are very luxurious and worth the penny :)</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and do not break out often, but I just love how it feels after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed even more improvements in my moderate/severe adult cystic acne with these toner pads.</li>
            <li>These make your skin feel so fresh...  </li>
            <li>pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I can use it right after I was my face</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for with ARCONA:</li>
            <li>MY first time teying Arcona products and I will continue from now on.</li>
            <li>I still get some stubborn acne, but if i put it right away as soon as i notice it, it really stops the pimples.</li>
            <li>They are drying, but I find that products that dry tend to help my acne the most.</li>
            <li>They definatly work to keep the dirt and oil away &amp; have a wonderful natural fruity smell (not like a fake fragrancy smell).  </li>
            <li>I really recommend all off the Arcona brand products-</li>
            <li>These really work</li>
            <li>coz anyway the whole pad is too much for my face</li>
            <li>there great if you feel hot &amp; muggy and just want a fresh feeling on your face.  </li>
            <li>so the half is good enough for 1 application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that less is more with ARCONA.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean, without feeling dry or tight, and my skin seems to drink up my serums and moisturizers better after using this toner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Arcona facial line for a little over  year now and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>These help my cystic adult acne very well without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>For the first time since I was a child (I&#x27;m 38), I actually like my skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone with adult acne.</li>
            <li>ARCONA products have been the only thing to clear my skin and keep it clear, naturally, with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always surprised at how much extra dirt this toner lifts up even after I wash thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend on every Arcona products, especially you are sensitive skin type like me</li>
            <li>I ordered from the main advertised seller, when I took the lid off for the first time the protective part underneath that you usually peel off was already peeled off and loose.  </li>
            <li>I cut the pads in half since they are very saturated with toner.</li>
            <li>They have actualy made my skin softer, lessened redness and acne scars, made my pores smaller, and improved the overall texture and health of my skin in general.</li>
            <li>This pads really helped to stop my breakouts and prevents  adult/cystic acne if i put it when i feel like they&#x27;re about to come and leave it overnight, it also made me less oily and the tiny bumps on my forehead disappears whenever i put this product.</li>

            <li> Again, it dries them out and they are clear within a few days.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time....</li>
            <li> so I only use them every other day.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, and worth it.</li>
            <li> it is still wet after i apply it on my face</li>
            <li> and I still think it works really well without irritating my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a few other products from arcona.  </li>
            <li> I can use one half pad for my face, neck, and chest, morning and night.</li>
            <li> It is a mess.</li>
            <li> i dont need to use them everyday,</li>
            <li> Though, they also make my face feel a bit oily if I use them everyday or twice a day as suggested</li>
            <li> i also use a little behind my ears to keep dirt &amp; oil from spreading.  </li>
            <li> This made me very wary and I almost demanded a refund.  </li>
            <li> What i hate about this pads is the smell i kinda hate it, its like a cranberry with grandma perfume and alcohol (keep it away from your eyes).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these pads!!!!</li>
            <li> however they smell awful and the smell lingers for a while</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these toner pads for a while now and I love them. They smell AMAZING and they do a good job of getting off any excess makeup that was left after cleansing. They make your skin feel refreshed and super clean. I really recommend all off the Arcona brand products- I haven&#x27;t found one that I don&#x27;t like!</li>
            <li> These make your skin feel so fresh...  I use them after cleansing with the Toner Tea soap...</li>
            <li> These are the best face pads I have ever used. I have acne prone skin. Its oily. It is a mess. But if I feel a blemish coming on, I wipe with these and its gone! They are drying, but I find that products that dry tend to help my acne the most. And on existing spots... this is also great. Again, it dries them out and they are clear within a few days.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;m obsessed with these pads!!!! The best!</li>

This made me very wary and I almost demanded a refund.  I have used these for 2 months and I think they do help my acne fade some.  Though, they also make my face feel a bit oily if I use them everyday or twice a day as suggested so I only use them every other day.  I have combination skin mostly with hormonal acne.

            <li> Love, love this product. MY first time teying Arcona products and I will continue from now on. Bought thos and Cranberry Toner</li>
            <li> I read about this product in Style and ordered it. I have never done that before but will again. Cleared and reduced the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> These help my cystic adult acne very well without drying out my skin. I would recommend them to anyone with adult acne.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT for traveling, when I don&#x27;t want to carry my special cleansers, toners, etc.  love it.</li>
            <li> Stinky. Strong. Like alcohol rubs</li>
            <li> These really work however they smell awful and the smell lingers for a while</li>
            <li> Terrific product!! Face feels fresh clean and not drying</li>
            <li> Great production. Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I gave it a try since ive used the toner before and i loved it. This pads really helped to stop my breakouts and prevents  adult/cystic acne if i put it when i feel like they&#x27;re about to come and leave it overnight, it also made me less oily and the tiny bumps on my forehead disappears whenever i put this product. i just find it a bit pricey so i would cut the pads in the middle so i could use it more. coz anyway the whole pad is too much for my face it is still wet after i apply it on my face so the half is good enough for 1 application. What i hate about this pads is the smell i kinda hate it, its like a cranberry with grandma perfume and alcohol (keep it away from your eyes).  I hope it smells like the cranbery toner. I still get some stubborn acne, but if i put it right away as soon as i notice it, it really stops the pimples.</li>
            <li> Great for after yoga, running, workouts or just before bed when all you want to do is hit the mattress. Smell amazing,</li>
            <li> I buy almost everything from Arcona, they have the best ingredients to put into their products as always!&lt;br /&gt;This is my 10th Raspberry Clarifying Pads and I still think it works really well without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend on every Arcona products, especially you are sensitive skin type like me</li>
            <li> I love this product...I have used it for a long time....great scent</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, and easy on my skin. I have normal skin and do not break out often, but I just love how it feels after. Very soft. This is the brand that a high end spa in town uses, so I always feel a little pampered before bed using it!</li>
