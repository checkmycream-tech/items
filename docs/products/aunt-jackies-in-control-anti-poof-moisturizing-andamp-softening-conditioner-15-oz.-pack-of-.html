            <li>Great conditioner for natural hair.  </li>
            <li>My twists and my twist outs looked smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Great especially after you wash your hair!</li>
            <li>Everyone raved about how moisturized their hair was after, and I was excited because I was looking for a staple in my hair care.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It did an ok job of moisturizing but as that new growth came in it started to lose its luster.</li>
            <li>(There is a similar company that required a CREDIT CARD for a FREE sample!!</li>
            <li>I am a new transitioner and I struggle a lot to find good deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>love this... especially for the price...</li>
            <li>After rinsing out this deep conditioner my hair felt OK.</li>
            <li>I needed a good conditioner for my dry 4c natural hair and this product did not fail me.</li>
            <li>I liked it, it left my hair very very soft.</li>

            <li>&quot; anything I wasn&#x27;t looking for much..</li>
            <li>I really did not like it</li>
            <li>so this product isn&#x27;t just over saturated with silicones like many other conditioners out here on the market.</li>
            <li>my twist out looked better than using my more expensive product.</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you&#x27;re looking for a great deep conditioner, try this mixed with ORS replenishing conditioner and a little peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>I received soft and sassy very disappointed...was also not sealed.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this.</li>
            <li>My hair is super dry.</li>
            <li>I wish it was silicon free like my other products I use, but I noticed the silicones are near the bottom of list</li>
            <li>It restores the moisture and eliminates the poof and wait time to regain your natural styling!</li>
            <li>Especially since said product is just friggin Vaseline in pretty wrapping for $60..</li>
            <li>I made a mistake and used it as a leave in and it keep my hair pretty moisturized till my next wash day which I do weekly...</li>
            <li>Not only was my hair very soft, it was very well moisturized and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m only supposed to use a certain brand of shampoo and conditioner, although I can use any leave-in.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>Makes it soft and tangle-free.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Leaves a soft feel to your hair.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products for my natural hair and honestly I got very tired of going broke for products.</li>

            <li> I deep conditioned with this for 30 minutes under a dryer, rinsed, roller set and flat ironed without adding any addition product and my hair</li>
            <li> Obviously for my thick 4a hair, it wasn&#x27;t enough to really \\&quot;do\\</li>
            <li> For me, it did nothing but dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> My natural hair journey has been long and frustrating, especially when comes to finding products that work on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair hard (it was soft before using this product)</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t soft like I&#x27;d expected it to be, but my hair wasn&#x27;t hard either.</li>
            <li> I did however decide to texturize my hair and use this after a protein treatment left my hair unusually hard and dry.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with other conditioners, oils, and water but nothing helped.</li>
            <li> My hair was softer and I could actually have detangled with just this small amount!</li>
            <li> I can buy some royal crown for WAY less than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was noticably less frizzy than usual.</li>
            <li> But I think sometimes a little silicon in a product is alright for my hair cause my hair texture is hard to get shine.</li>

            <li> I ordered anti poof I received soft and sassy very disappointed...was also not sealed. Smh</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best conditioner I have used since I went team natural. It softens on contact. I keep back up jars on hand. I can&#x27;t run out of it or there would be a problem!</li>
            <li> love this... especially for the price...</li>
            <li> I just purchased/used this product from my local dollar store. I am in luv with this conditioner. I needed a good conditioner for my dry 4c natural hair and this product did not fail me. I did however decide to texturize my hair and use this after a protein treatment left my hair unusually hard and dry. I used mines as a leave in conditioner followed by a twist out. It turned out to be the best for my hair. Not only was my hair very soft, it was very well moisturized and my twist out looked better than using my more expensive product. And it was not greasy at all. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products for my natural hair and honestly I got very tired of going broke for products. This was a great product for my hair and I will continue to use and try the shampoo. Oh and I also commented on their curl la la. So if you want to try any of these products, try shopping around for the smaller jars and if you like them, then order the larger sizes here unless you know where to find those sizes outside of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have very thick 4c hair that just sucks up moisture. I have to spritz with water and add a moisturizer several times a week. I used In Control 4 days ago in my regular regimen, except  that I ran out of my moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t had to add any water or moisturizer since. My hair is soft and touchable. There is no flaky white stuff. This is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s great for my texlaxed hair! Makes it soft and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner! I had not straightened my had in over three months. I deep conditioned with this for 30 minutes under a dryer, rinsed, roller set and flat ironed without adding any addition product and my hair came out soooo nice. Love and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> i have relaxed hair (4b new growth), and unfortunately this product wasn&#x27;t anything special for me. It did an ok job of moisturizing but as that new growth came in it started to lose its luster. HOWEVER, my daughter is biracial with lose curly/wavy hair (around a 3A) and this works amazingly in her hair. I now use it as her daily conditioner and it keeps her hair nice and smooth and minimizes frizz (along with other products of course). So i give it 2 stars for me but 4 stars for her. Glad we tried it out!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair hard (it was soft before using this product) I trashed it, yes it was that bad for me.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product in a discount store. It cost about $7 or $8 and I figured it was trying to be a no-frills version of Miss Jessie&#x27;s (judging by the name). Frills or no, I got better results from this than from the Miss Jessie&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried. I didn&#x27;t read the directions when I got this so I didn&#x27;t realize I was supposed to rinse it out. I used it as a smoother and leave-in conditioner when twisting my hair. My twists and my twist outs looked smooth and shiny. No stickiness or build up even though the product was not meant to be left in the hair. My hair is super dry. This gave me great moisture. I still haven&#x27;t used this product as directed though, because I have a keratin treatment now and I&#x27;m only supposed to use a certain brand of shampoo and conditioner, although I can use any leave-in. My natural hair journey has been long and frustrating, especially when comes to finding products that work on my hair. This works. And it works instantly.</li>
            <li> For me, it did nothing but dry my hair out. I have 3c hair and I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair soft and manageable. I have curly 3c hair and i use it as a cowash.</li>
            <li> Pretty good conditioner honestly .. It gave my natural 4b-4c hair texture great results. I wish it was silicon free like my other products I use, but I noticed the silicones are near the bottom of list so this product isn&#x27;t just over saturated with silicones like many other conditioners out here on the market. But I think sometimes a little silicon in a product is alright for my hair cause my hair texture is hard to get shine. This product helped add shine to my hair and I was happy about that cause my organic products don&#x27;t give my hair shine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of several different people. Everyone raved about how moisturized their hair was after, and I was excited because I was looking for a staple in my hair care. After rinsing out this deep conditioner my hair felt OK. It wasn&#x27;t soft like I&#x27;d expected it to be, but my hair wasn&#x27;t hard either. So, I had that going for me, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice consistency, and the smell vaguely reminds me of plastic.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for natural hair.  Leaves a soft feel to your hair.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product, adds moisture to my daughters hair and keeps it neat.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this. This a staple in the future for me.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. Leaves my hair soft, smells amazing. I also love the minty feeling when its on my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked it, it left my hair very very soft. Ladies, if you&#x27;re looking for a great deep conditioner, try this mixed with ORS replenishing conditioner and a little peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Great especially after you wash your hair! It restores the moisture and eliminates the poof and wait time to regain your natural styling!</li>
            <li> My daughther was very pleased with this product.  It did wonders to her hair.  I will be buying this again in the future.</li>
            <li> But I already see potential!! I contacted the company for a sample and they sent it with no strings or credit card numbers attatched! (There is a similar company that required a CREDIT CARD for a FREE sample!! No thanks! Especially since said product is just friggin Vaseline in pretty wrapping for $60.. I can buy some royal crown for WAY less than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. The company sent me a sample of the entire line and I tried this after the shampoo.. Obviously for my thick 4a hair, it wasn&#x27;t enough to really \\&quot;do\\&quot; anything I wasn&#x27;t looking for much.. But though it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;enough\\&quot;, I could already see this product was a HIT!! My hair was softer and I could actually have detangled with just this small amount! I mean I DIDN&#x27;T because I didn&#x27;t want to risk it, but I can see I COULD have. I do plan to purchase this product. I think it has potential. :)I would recommend a friend to give it a try. :)</li>
            <li> I made a mistake and used it as a leave in and it keep my hair pretty moisturized till my next wash day which I do weekly...</li>
            <li> I have not used product as of yet and I may not use it product came unsealed.  No product should be sold unsealed.  Smells good</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so good. It made my hair soft. My hair was noticably less frizzy than usual. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am a new transitioner and I struggle a lot to find good deep conditioners. This product is excellent for deep conditioning my hair. It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and easy to detangle. I absolutely love it. The smell is great as well. The only problem is that my hair is sponge like, it takes a lot of product, so this jar only lasts me about 4 uses. However, I love it so much I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> my hair was so crunchy and hard rafter using this product. I tried mixing it with other conditioners, oils, and water but nothing helped. I really did not like it</li>
