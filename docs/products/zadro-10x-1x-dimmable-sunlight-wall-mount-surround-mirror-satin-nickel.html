            <li>I bought this and really loved it.  </li>

            <li>Adjustable light switch is the best feature</li>

            <li>Arrived quickly and in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;The fluorescent dimming works well and does not hum.</li>

            <li>The quality is great and was easy to mount.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to install too.</li>

            <li>The light is bright and has no shadows.  </li>
            <li>The light around the edge is good.</li>
            <li>Great product and worked the first time.</li>
            <li>We would have kept it if the 10X side of the mirror had been more optically correct</li>
            <li>If you buy one, expect to have to buy many more.....    </li>
            <li>Maybe the LED model would be better?  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I have to stand up while looking into the mirror on the 10X magnification instead of being able to sit on my stool.</li>
            <li>If you can not determine the answers about the mirror you are buying, be sure to call their customer service or email them to get your answers and save you from returning something that doesn&#x27;t work for your situation.</li>
            <li>Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has hit my face many times.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>we are quite pleased with the mirror.</li>
            <li>worked perfectly for about a year and then same issues as reported occurred.  </li>
            <li>I have a friend that I love dearly</li>
            <li>but I love her.</li>
            <li>then used this one and found a lot more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>and then you must lock the tabs into the slots by twisting the top plastic cover.  </li>
            <li>Latest issue, the mirror no longer lights up.</li>
            <li>Can someone suggest a better mirror?</li>
            <li>Wow is this thing bright!</li>
            <li>I could see clearly &amp; it was nice &amp; bright.</li>
            <li>So this $129.95 light will be costing me alot more to save.</li>
            <li>So far it works great (about two months).  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for makeup application, just love it.  </li>
            <li>At first I loved this light.  </li>
            <li>The light has worked well and, actually better than the incandescent which we replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great so far.</li>
            <li>Good product with quality glass and dimmer, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Easy installation.</li>
            <li>Instructions are easy to follow and mounts to wall well.</li>
            <li>Cannot fine a replacement ballast, but found something that might work.  </li>
            <li>This light is pretty and looks nice on the wall.  </li>
            <li>Have had one in the past, very nice, good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I love my wall mirror, it is awesome and it wasn&#x27;t hard for a girl to put on the wall.</li>
            <li>My mirror doesn&#x27;t light anymore.</li>
            <li>The light works but the mirror just flops around with no way to stabilize it.  </li>
            <li>After about 9 months light stopped working.</li>
            <li>so the light amount is sufficient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this light for a couple of months (the return period just expired) and now the switch doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>so I have a mirror without light.</li>
            <li>and the light stopped working</li>
            <li>Now, I want my guest to enjoy the goodness too.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for about a momth and so far I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>i am really happy with product and price bought it first at target 150.00 returned it when saw amazon was half the price its nice and slim and</li>
            <li>It works best if you turn it all the way up and then dim it back.  </li>
            <li>That was the only bright side -- that the bulb fell into the bathtub rather than onto the floor, making my glass cleanup job easier.    </li>
            <li>It has great magnification, a clear image, a greater variety of possible positions than I need and, although it is dimmable, I always have it at the brightest setting for applying my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>Nice light and upper middling metal work.</li>
            <li>Mount it to a stud, and it will feel adequately sturdy despite all the plastic bits.</li>
            <li>Also, when turning it on, if I turn it on quickly, it will not work.</li>
            <li>Overall it is great mirror with too much maintainance.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is awesome, the 10x size it really  a little much, could have got by with 5x but really like it.</li>
            <li>This mirror is great but could use a few improvements.  </li>
            <li>The dimmable light works very well.</li>
            <li>Fun House Mirror optics on the magnifying side.</li>
            <li>No support, can&#x27;t imagine what the warranty would be worth.</li>
            <li>I took it apart thinking it might be the light only, but found many pinched wires with a burned out ballast as well.</li>
            <li>I sent it back and did not reorder because the style wasnt what I was looking for , but it was a nice mirror.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite addition to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It should swivel easily allowing you to turn the mirror forward and back easily.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be a project in finding the right size.</li>
            <li>After searching the web for a while and not finding the right model anywhere I called Zadro company and they will be sending replacement ballast for $10.</li>
            <li>and we were able to open it and order right bulbs.</li>
            <li>This mirror has clean white light.  </li>
            <li>The first one stopped working after 13 months (switch / electronics).  </li>
            <li>overall pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this higher priced version of a mirror for my spouse</li>
            <li>First, I did&#x27;t know how to get inside and look up the bulb number.</li>
            <li>I had used this mirror at a hotel once and had to find the exact one for the bathroom I was re-doing.  </li>
            <li>People will be concentrating on how funny I look rather than what I am saying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has protective plastic on it so remove that first before viewing.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it the bulb burned out within the first month.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only replaced it once more myself in the 10 years</li>
            <li>I can get really carried away while using this mirror!  </li>
            <li>girlfriend uses it pretty much every day and loves it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror and it is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>This little gem casts the most realistic Sunshine light.  </li>
            <li>The cord is unsightly but can easily be shortened for those with basic electrical wiring skills.  </li>
            <li>Materials are solid and easy to install.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to install but for the price I would look for a different model or brand.</li>
            <li>I used better ones because of the swing arm, I was affraid it would work loose.</li>
            <li>First one, it seems like after a few months, when I would turn the knob for the light to come on, if I turned it too fast, the light would immediately turn off.</li>
            <li>The first one had a problem with the piece that holds the mirror steady and in place.</li>
            <li>I opened the box, took the wrapping off the mirror and as I was about to hold it up to the wall to ask her where to position it permanently, the cheap, brittle plastic lens caps fell out of the not-really-circular metal band that holds them in by pressure only.  </li>
            <li>3 months later after purchasing this product the light &amp; ballast burns out.</li>
            <li>if so, do you want a white or an off-white light?</li>
            <li>But you can get your face really close to it</li>
            <li>The 10x is great for me as I have poor vision and applying makeup can be a challenge.  </li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t stop saying how much she loves it.</li>
            <li>so really needed something like this and didn&#x27;t want another thing cluttering up the counter</li>
            <li>Also, replacing the bulb takes some dexterity as you have to balance the light in the fixture with one hand while aligning the slots of the back cover while pushing it into place</li>
            <li>The real issue (and why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it) is to replace the bulb</li>
            <li>This makes applying makeup much easier for any woman.</li>
            <li>Product works very well.</li>
            <li>My husband said he would try to take it apart and put in a new switch, but for the price, I expected it to hold up better.</li>
            <li>I had contacted Zadro and the part is not fixable, so if it breaks you have to buy a whole new fixture.  </li>
            <li>3) when it folds back into its space, is there adequate space for the now bent arm?</li>
            <li>It is a decent mirror, but found it cumbersome.</li>
            <li>High quality and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Flimsy plastic parts, screws that don&#x27;t fit properly and overall cheap, Chinese quality.</li>
            <li>Most of the makeup mirrors have a blue or flesh colored light, which makes it difficult to see clearly and does not give accurate outdoor lighting.  </li>
            <li>Normal household voltage is 120V.  </li>
            <li>However right after installation it lost its grip so the mirror would flip forward and back with no support.</li>
            <li>As a result, the light bulb fell out and crashed into our bathtub in hundreds of sharp pieces.  </li>
            <li>That said, when it came to ordering a wall mounted mirror many things had to be considered that I would advise others to be aware of such as: 1) Shape - Oval or round?</li>
            <li>The new one arrived yesterday.</li>
            <li>We bought this mirror for our new bathroom.</li>
            <li>We bought a new bulb for $26 and that did not fix it.</li>
            <li>AND THE SWITCH BROKE, SO I ALREADY NEED A NEW MIRROR.  </li>
            <li>Used wire nuts and spliced the old connector in with the new.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer replaced it with a new one with no trouble, and now I just leave it turned on, but plug it in and out of the wall, rather than using the switch.  </li>
            <li>The articulation joints are a little stiff, but it&#x27;s solid, has good mirrors and the right magnification for my wife.</li>
            <li>The light bulb itself is supposed to be a 100 watt, but seems about half of that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We found the 10x magnifying mirror was too high powered for general use.  </li>
            <li>So far I have owned 3 of these mirrors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check the wiring too, just in case a wire broke inside near the joints.</li>
            <li>I oredered two and none of them fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>but so far no answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast forward several months</li>
            <li>I just ordered a new one, same model, and it seems to function normally.</li>
            <li>So when I do sit down to apply the paint, I have some serious catching up to do!</li>
            <li>This was replaced by the third one that stopped working after 9 months, with the same issue as the first one.      </li>
            <li>Unless you need to work on individual hairs or skin pores be aware that the standard 10x mirror is way, way</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t much like the weight of it and have some concerns as to how long my anchors will hold it.</li>
            <li>After searching all over the internet for hours for some kind of replacement I cannot find one that will fit in the base.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, the unit cannot be repaired, and will not be replaced at no cost by the manufacturerer.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised, as I had read that in other reviews, and could tell the mechanism was a little cheap.  </li>
            <li>The internal electrics died less than a year after purchase and it would cost too much to ship it back and have it repaired for it to be worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>The adjustable arm is pretty stiff and can take some &amp;#34;man handling&amp;#34; to get it moved around sometimes...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as easy to turn it on that way, and it seems none the worse for the wear.  </li>

            <li> Instructions are easy to follow and mounts to wall well.</li>
            <li> Cannot fine a replacement ballast, but found something that might work.  </li>
            <li> This light is pretty and looks nice on the wall.  </li>
            <li> Have had one in the past, very nice, good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love my wall mirror, it is awesome and it wasn&#x27;t hard for a girl to put on the wall.</li>
            <li> My mirror doesn&#x27;t light anymore.</li>
            <li> The light works but the mirror just flops around with no way to stabilize it.  </li>
            <li> After about 9 months light stopped working.</li>
            <li> so the light amount is sufficient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this light for a couple of months (the return period just expired) and now the switch doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> so I have a mirror without light.</li>
            <li> and the light stopped working</li>
            <li> Now, I want my guest to enjoy the goodness too.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for about a momth and so far I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> i am really happy with product and price bought it first at target 150.00 returned it when saw amazon was half the price its nice and slim and</li>
            <li> It works best if you turn it all the way up and then dim it back.  </li>
            <li> That was the only bright side -- that the bulb fell into the bathtub rather than onto the floor, making my glass cleanup job easier.    </li>
            <li> It has great magnification, a clear image, a greater variety of possible positions than I need and, although it is dimmable, I always have it at the brightest setting for applying my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> Nice light and upper middling metal work.</li>
            <li> Mount it to a stud, and it will feel adequately sturdy despite all the plastic bits.</li>
            <li> Also, when turning it on, if I turn it on quickly, it will not work.</li>
            <li> Overall it is great mirror with too much maintainance.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is awesome, the 10x size it really  a little much, could have got by with 5x but really like it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great but could use a few improvements.  </li>
            <li> The dimmable light works very well.</li>
            <li> Fun House Mirror optics on the magnifying side.</li>
            <li> No support, can&#x27;t imagine what the warranty would be worth.</li>
            <li> I took it apart thinking it might be the light only, but found many pinched wires with a burned out ballast as well.</li>
            <li> I sent it back and did not reorder because the style wasnt what I was looking for , but it was a nice mirror.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite addition to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> It should swivel easily allowing you to turn the mirror forward and back easily.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be a project in finding the right size.</li>
            <li> After searching the web for a while and not finding the right model anywhere I called Zadro company and they will be sending replacement ballast for $10.</li>
            <li> and we were able to open it and order right bulbs.</li>
            <li> This mirror has clean white light.  </li>
            <li> The first one stopped working after 13 months (switch / electronics).  </li>
            <li> overall pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this higher priced version of a mirror for my spouse</li>
            <li> First, I did&#x27;t know how to get inside and look up the bulb number.</li>
            <li> I had used this mirror at a hotel once and had to find the exact one for the bathroom I was re-doing.  </li>
            <li> People will be concentrating on how funny I look rather than what I am saying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has protective plastic on it so remove that first before viewing.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it the bulb burned out within the first month.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only replaced it once more myself in the 10 years</li>
            <li> I can get really carried away while using this mirror!  </li>
            <li> girlfriend uses it pretty much every day and loves it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror and it is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> This little gem casts the most realistic Sunshine light.  </li>
            <li> The cord is unsightly but can easily be shortened for those with basic electrical wiring skills.  </li>
            <li> Materials are solid and easy to install.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to install but for the price I would look for a different model or brand.</li>
            <li> I used better ones because of the swing arm, I was affraid it would work loose.</li>
            <li> First one, it seems like after a few months, when I would turn the knob for the light to come on, if I turned it too fast, the light would immediately turn off.</li>
            <li> The first one had a problem with the piece that holds the mirror steady and in place.</li>
            <li> I opened the box, took the wrapping off the mirror and as I was about to hold it up to the wall to ask her where to position it permanently, the cheap, brittle plastic lens caps fell out of the not-really-circular metal band that holds them in by pressure only.  </li>
            <li> 3 months later after purchasing this product the light &amp; ballast burns out.</li>
            <li> if so, do you want a white or an off-white light?</li>
            <li> But you can get your face really close to it</li>
            <li> The 10x is great for me as I have poor vision and applying makeup can be a challenge.  </li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t stop saying how much she loves it.</li>
            <li> so really needed something like this and didn&#x27;t want another thing cluttering up the counter</li>
            <li> Also, replacing the bulb takes some dexterity as you have to balance the light in the fixture with one hand while aligning the slots of the back cover while pushing it into place</li>
            <li> The real issue (and why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it) is to replace the bulb</li>
            <li> This makes applying makeup much easier for any woman.</li>
            <li> Product works very well.</li>
            <li> My husband said he would try to take it apart and put in a new switch, but for the price, I expected it to hold up better.</li>
            <li> I had contacted Zadro and the part is not fixable, so if it breaks you have to buy a whole new fixture.  </li>
            <li> 3) when it folds back into its space, is there adequate space for the now bent arm?</li>
            <li> It is a decent mirror, but found it cumbersome.</li>
            <li> High quality and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Flimsy plastic parts, screws that don&#x27;t fit properly and overall cheap, Chinese quality.</li>
            <li> Most of the makeup mirrors have a blue or flesh colored light, which makes it difficult to see clearly and does not give accurate outdoor lighting.  </li>
            <li> Normal household voltage is 120V.  </li>
            <li> However right after installation it lost its grip so the mirror would flip forward and back with no support.</li>
            <li> As a result, the light bulb fell out and crashed into our bathtub in hundreds of sharp pieces.  </li>
            <li> That said, when it came to ordering a wall mounted mirror many things had to be considered that I would advise others to be aware of such as: 1) Shape - Oval or round?</li>
            <li> The new one arrived yesterday.</li>
            <li> We bought this mirror for our new bathroom.</li>
            <li> We bought a new bulb for $26 and that did not fix it.</li>
            <li> AND THE SWITCH BROKE, SO I ALREADY NEED A NEW MIRROR.  </li>
            <li> Used wire nuts and spliced the old connector in with the new.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer replaced it with a new one with no trouble, and now I just leave it turned on, but plug it in and out of the wall, rather than using the switch.  </li>
            <li> The articulation joints are a little stiff, but it&#x27;s solid, has good mirrors and the right magnification for my wife.</li>
            <li> The light bulb itself is supposed to be a 100 watt, but seems about half of that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We found the 10x magnifying mirror was too high powered for general use.  </li>
            <li> So far I have owned 3 of these mirrors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll check the wiring too, just in case a wire broke inside near the joints.</li>
            <li> I oredered two and none of them fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> but so far no answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast forward several months</li>
            <li> I just ordered a new one, same model, and it seems to function normally.</li>
            <li> So when I do sit down to apply the paint, I have some serious catching up to do!</li>
            <li> This was replaced by the third one that stopped working after 9 months, with the same issue as the first one.      </li>
            <li> Unless you need to work on individual hairs or skin pores be aware that the standard 10x mirror is way, way</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t much like the weight of it and have some concerns as to how long my anchors will hold it.</li>
            <li> After searching all over the internet for hours for some kind of replacement I cannot find one that will fit in the base.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, the unit cannot be repaired, and will not be replaced at no cost by the manufacturerer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t surprised, as I had read that in other reviews, and could tell the mechanism was a little cheap.  </li>
            <li> The internal electrics died less than a year after purchase and it would cost too much to ship it back and have it repaired for it to be worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> The adjustable arm is pretty stiff and can take some &amp;#34;man handling&amp;#34; to get it moved around sometimes...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as easy to turn it on that way, and it seems none the worse for the wear.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have to turn the knob very slowly until it&#x27;s at full brightness.  </li>
            <li> Install was not hard, but you should know a little about electricity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at least once a day for about 6 months and so far, it&#x27;s in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> The arm isn&#x27;t long enough to reach the end of my vanity.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered two just in case this ballast won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Also Zadro will sent you replacement bulbs for $10 flat.</li>
            <li> The only problem I ave with this product is the plastic locking ring which holds the entire assembly together slides easly and the entire light assembly can fall apart, also the plastic locking part is not very strong and one ot the three has already broken.</li>
            <li> I am further amazed that the plastic used on the lenses is of the variety used in cheap plastic toys and the egg-shaped containers that come with Silly Putty.    </li>
            <li> This is a drag when trying to pluck various hairs from the facial area!   </li>
            <li> We hope it will hold out for the long run.</li>
            <li> , I find myself sitting at my vanity, in front of this mirror on the magnified side, picking, plucking and pinching for way too long.  </li>
            <li> On the 10X side the image was not clear.  </li>
            <li> Just like several other people reported here.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner crooked, eyeshadow on one eye and not the other.</li>
            <li> easy install, VERY BRIGHT, only mentionable is that the extra power outlet on the side of the mirror base is facing the wrong way (fat side of plug on the wrong side)</li>
            <li> It does not lay flat to one side as it does to the other and given my limited space, it did not work out.</li>
            <li> The first one was broken in a move.  </li>
            <li> the screw that holds the mirror up comes loose all the time.</li>
            <li> One became loose (mirror part) and to their credit they sent me a replacement part.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, why is there no company that makes a lighted wall mount mirror, with 10X magnification, that is of high quality?</li>
            <li> She is such a mess</li>
            <li> It is a tight design and, while it seems sturdy enough, you don&#x27;t want to force the issue with the plastic parts.  </li>
            <li> So, be careful and don&#x27;t try to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very Bad workmanship, while it was working my other half loved it, for 3 months only.</li>
            <li> NOT A VERY GOOD OR LONG LASTING PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of plastic on this device that&#x27;s not evident in the photos.</li>
            <li> I wish Zadro made this in other finishes like Chrome.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than getting it through other sites.</li>
            <li> No more crooked eyeliner for me either</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find it on other lights.</li>
            <li> If someone pulls or twists the mirror the wrong way (beyond its&#x27; stop) the action will break the upper swivel bracket.  </li>
            <li> so the only problem I have with it is the base is light.  </li>
            <li> 2)  will you need to hang it as intended or upside down due to space constraints?</li>
            <li> I am amazed that this device was not designed with at least one of these covers affixed to the metal band by some type of fastener other than pressure, and that the mirror itself is only held by pressure and the slight protusion of two tiny screws -- at least it did not break when it hit the floor.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> (I have an electronics degree) because they are too darned expensive to buy another one unless I absolutely have to.  </li>
            <li> Took me 20 minutes just to get it put back together without the bulb so at least we&#x27;d have a mirror....  </li>
            <li> When it arrived last week, we opened the box to find a few pieces broken, so we shipped it back to the seller.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the on off switch became unpredictable.</li>
            <li> For such an expensive product the bulb went so quickly it was disappointing.</li>
            <li> As I was showing her how poorly this device was made, one of the fragile little snaps on the brittle plastic cover broke off.</li>
            <li> I work from home and have the luxury of not having to put makeup on everyday.</li>
            <li> What makes it worse is that it was a gift to my husband &amp; now he is back to square one with a mirror that has no light.</li>
            <li> However, the on/off switch failed after only a few months.</li>
            <li> is nearly impossible - the two white covers and the center mirror are sooooo frustrating to put back together.  </li>
            <li> And again, another small plastic piece chipped and was found floating around the box.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Lesson learned the hard way... 😉</li>
            <li> I recommend getting beefier screws/wall plugs and use at least 4.</li>
            <li> I want a mirror that is wall mounted and enlarges at least 10X or</li>
            <li> I use the countertop version and seriously don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!  </li>
            <li> this one arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> this arrived with a broken mirror.</li>
            <li> I wont be missing anything unless I go blind!</li>
            <li> I have to turn the switch on real slow in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post an update if I find something else wrong...  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor don&#x27;t spend the money on this expensive mirror</li>
            <li> However,  the plastic covering that holds the bulb in place is terribly designed and falls apart regularly eventually causing the bulb to crash to the floor.</li>
            <li> It is very poor quality</li>
            <li> Very irritating that you cannot buy the part here in the USA.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product quality, especially for how expensive it is!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife for Christmas -- what a disappointment.     </li>
            <li> The quality and design of this product is outrageously bad.  </li>
            <li> This is a bad buy, Save your money.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> I just thought it was one bad part and dealt with it for 2 years.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I now know that this product is worthless.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible mirror</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fun House Mirror optics on the magnifying side. Nice light and upper middling metal work. We would have kept it if the 10X side of the mirror had been more optically correct but it was just not acceptable. Seriously, why is there no company that makes a lighted wall mount mirror, with 10X magnification, that is of high quality? I would pay whatever the asking price if I could only find one that was optically correct and well built!</li>
            <li> Do not buy it  It is very poor quality</li>
            <li> I really loved this mirror until the light bulb went out.  What a hassle to find a replacement.  I still haven&#x27;t found one.</li>
            <li> So far I have owned 3 of these mirrors.  The first one stopped working after 13 months (switch / electronics).  Was out of warranty, so I purchased a second....this one arrived broken.  This was replaced by the third one that stopped working after 9 months, with the same issue as the first one.      If you buy one, expect to have to buy many more.....    I did not buy this product from Amazon or their vendors</li>
            <li> I shopped around at all of the home improvement stores and could not find anything close to this mirror.  Even shopping online but when I saw it, I knew it was the one I was looking for! Wow is this thing bright! And it dims, and the 10X mirror shows pores on your face you didn&#x27;t even know you had!  Great product!!! Great service and everything.  UPDATE 11/18/2011...  My mirror doesn&#x27;t light anymore. I figured it was the bulb, so I ordered 2 (comes in a 2 pack) and it still doesn&#x27;t work! Just like several other people reported here. So it is probably the electronic ballast.  Cannot fine a replacement ballast, but found something that might work.  So don&#x27;t purchase the Fluorescent Ballast model. Won&#x27;t last. Maybe the LED model would be better?  I&#x27;ll check the wiring too, just in case a wire broke inside near the joints. I&#x27;ll post an update if I find something else wrong...  Update. 12/12/2011  I bought a replacement ballast. Install was not hard, but you should know a little about electricity.  Used wire nuts and spliced the old connector in with the new.  Works great, but no dimming...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife for Christmas -- what a disappointment.     The quality and design of this product is outrageously bad.  I opened the box, took the wrapping off the mirror and as I was about to hold it up to the wall to ask her where to position it permanently, the cheap, brittle plastic lens caps fell out of the not-really-circular metal band that holds them in by pressure only.  As a result, the light bulb fell out and crashed into our bathtub in hundreds of sharp pieces.  That was the only bright side -- that the bulb fell into the bathtub rather than onto the floor, making my glass cleanup job easier.    As I was showing her how poorly this device was made, one of the fragile little snaps on the brittle plastic cover broke off. I am amazed that this device was not designed with at least one of these covers affixed to the metal band by some type of fastener other than pressure, and that the mirror itself is only held by pressure and the slight protusion of two tiny screws -- at least it did not break when it hit the floor.  I am further amazed that the plastic used on the lenses is of the variety used in cheap plastic toys and the egg-shaped containers that come with Silly Putty.    Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift from my husband and I could not be happier with this mirror.  I can see everything weather I like it or not. By choice, mine is not mounted. It fits beautifully with the decor, is adjustable in many directions and the light is perfect.</li>
            <li> The pressed hinge next to the plate would not move. Zadro Customer support just gave the run around. Poor quality product. Finally had to return to Amazon. Avoid Zadro.. No support, can&#x27;t imagine what the warranty would be worth.</li>
            <li> 3 months later after purchasing this product the light &amp; ballast burns out. I took it apart thinking it might be the light only, but found many pinched wires with a burned out ballast as well. Very Bad workmanship, while it was working my other half loved it, for 3 months only. So this $129.95 light will be costing me alot more to save. This is a bad buy, Save your money.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing.  It&#x27;s the best designed wall-mount mirror I have found.  However, it is tricky.  Flourescent bulbs don&#x27;t lend themselves to dimming.  It works best if you turn it all the way up and then dim it back.  Replacing the bulb takes some patience, so don&#x27;t do it when you&#x27;re cranky. (I took it apart and reassembled it just for \\&quot;fun.\\&quot;) It is a tight design and, while it seems sturdy enough, you don&#x27;t want to force the issue with the plastic parts.  The cord is unsightly but can easily be shortened for those with basic electrical wiring skills.  So far it works great (about two months).  We hope it will hold out for the long run.</li>
            <li> Very low quality \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; product.  On the 10X side the image was not clear.  When you looked closer you could see the silver reflective background of the mirror had wrinkles in it.</li>
            <li> The magnification is so great that I cannot apply my makeup as I have to be so close to it that there is no room to do anything.</li>
            <li> This mirror has clean white light.  Most of the makeup mirrors have a blue or flesh colored light, which makes it difficult to see clearly and does not give accurate outdoor lighting.  I am very happy with my mirror.</li>
            <li> Got for my wife.  Works well and she seems to like it.  The adjustable arm is pretty stiff and can take some &amp;#34;man handling&amp;#34; to get it moved around sometimes...overall pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I give this 3 stars because when it did work it was great. I could see clearly &amp; it was nice &amp; bright. However, just after about 3 months the bulb no longer worked.  For such an expensive product the bulb went so quickly it was disappointing. What makes it worse is that it was a gift to my husband &amp; now he is back to square one with a mirror that has no light. Please improve your product. After going through the motion of making holes in the wall to screw it in we are stuck with it. Still working on getting a replacement bulb but it seems to be a project in finding the right size.</li>
            <li> Works as advertized. There&#x27;s a lot of plastic on this device that&#x27;s not evident in the photos. Mount it to a stud, and it will feel adequately sturdy despite all the plastic bits. I wish Zadro made this in other finishes like Chrome.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great but could use a few improvements.  The arm isn&#x27;t long enough to reach the end of my vanity.  Therefore, I have to stand up while looking into the mirror on the 10X magnification instead of being able to sit on my stool. This is a drag when trying to pluck various hairs from the facial area!   Also, when turning it on, if I turn it on quickly, it will not work. I have to turn the switch on real slow in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this higher priced version of a mirror for my spouse and I assumed that it would exceed my expectations.  The light works but the mirror just flops around with no way to stabilize it.  You have to attempt to use it while holding it still.  Not good.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Mirror seems to be good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The mounting hardware is NOT sturdy enough to support it though. I recommend getting beefier screws/wall plugs and use at least 4.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this mirror for me as a gift. When it arrived last week, we opened the box to find a few pieces broken, so we shipped it back to the seller. The new one arrived yesterday. When my husband tried to install it, we found that the screws which hold on the backing plate are both stripped and cannot be removed for installation. The plastic piece which surrounds the bulb popped out immediately and will not go back in. And again, another small plastic piece chipped and was found floating around the box. I can only hope that the seller agrees to refund not only the cost of the product, but also the $20 we&#x27;ve put into shipping it back to them twice! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The only problem I ave with this product is the plastic locking ring which holds the entire assembly together slides easly and the entire light assembly can fall apart, also the plastic locking part is not very strong and one ot the three has already broken.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for makeup application, just love it.  Bought the same one 2 years ago and we are moving so had to have another one as I cannot go without it !</li>
            <li> this arrived with a broken mirror. I sent it back and did not reorder because the style wasnt what I was looking for , but it was a nice mirror.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, the 10x size it really  a little much, could have got by with 5x but really like it.</li>
            <li> I like the mirror&#x27;s magnification and ease of handling. I didn&#x27;t much like the weight of it and have some concerns as to how long my anchors will hold it. That said, when it came to ordering a wall mounted mirror many things had to be considered that I would advise others to be aware of such as: 1) Shape - Oval or round? 2)  will you need to hang it as intended or upside down due to space constraints? 3) when it folds back into its space, is there adequate space for the now bent arm? 4) if it is replacing an existing mirror, with the same anchor holes work even if it is the same manufacturer? 5) Do you want it to be lit and if so, do you want a white or an off-white light? 6) be sure as to the best magnification for your eyes.  7) Do you plan on hardwiring it to the wall or having a cord hanging that you can plug in? If you can not determine the answers about the mirror you are buying, be sure to call their customer service or email them to get your answers and save you from returning something that doesn&#x27;t work for your situation.</li>
            <li> easy install, VERY BRIGHT, only mentionable is that the extra power outlet on the side of the mirror base is facing the wrong way (fat side of plug on the wrong side) so you can&#x27;t plug in a blow dryer...other than that, i&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this light.  The dimmable feature is great.  But, you need to teach guest and children on how to use it.  If someone pulls or twists the mirror the wrong way (beyond its&#x27; stop) the action will break the upper swivel bracket.  I had contacted Zadro and the part is not fixable, so if it breaks you have to buy a whole new fixture.  Too bad.  I won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror couple of years ago. Good quality, no problems with using it. After about 9 months light stopped working. I didn&#x27;t get to fixing it untill now. First, I did&#x27;t know how to get inside and look up the bulb number. Then finally when my husband figured that out and we were able to open it and order right bulbs. I oredered two and none of them fixed the problem. My husband decided that problem must be with ballast. After searching the web for a while and not finding the right model anywhere I called Zadro company and they will be sending replacement ballast for $10. I just ordered two just in case this ballast won&#x27;t last long. Also Zadro will sent you replacement bulbs for $10 flat. No shipping fee. A lot cheaper than getting it through other sites. Overall it is great mirror with too much maintainance.</li>
            <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to have it setting on the counter so the only problem I have with it is the base is light.  Depending on the position of the mirror, it sometimes will tip over.</li>
            <li> We bought this mirror for our new bathroom. It suddenly went out.  We bought a new bulb for $26 and that did not fix it. After reading the reviews, I now know that this product is worthless. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> For what this cost, such a defect is inexcusable.  Apparently, the unit cannot be repaired, and will not be replaced at no cost by the manufacturerer.</li>
            <li> Arrived with the mirror cracked</li>
            <li> This light is pretty and looks nice on the wall.  The light bulb itself is supposed to be a 100 watt, but seems about half of that.  But you can get your face really close to it so the light amount is sufficient.  I&#x27;ve had this light for a couple of months (the return period just expired) and now the switch doesn&#x27;t work.  Just won&#x27;t turn all the way off.  My husband said he would try to take it apart and put in a new switch, but for the price, I expected it to hold up better.</li>
            <li> I chose the wall mount so that I could manipulate the mirror to where I wanted it. However, the attachment between the mirror and the arm doesn&#x27;t swivel so I have to move my face to it rather than vice versa.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible mirror the screw that holds the mirror up comes loose all the time. It has hit my face many times. The power button no longer works so I have a mirror without light. Do yourself a favor don&#x27;t spend the money on this expensive mirror it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  The light is bright and has no shadows.  The 10x is great for me as I have poor vision and applying makeup can be a challenge.  Also Zadro does sell parts should I need them.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t stop saying how much she loves it. It was easy to install and it looks great to.&lt;br /&gt;Success feels good</li>
            <li> Great product and worked the first time. Materials are solid and easy to install. It looks like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> The light has worked well and, actually better than the incandescent which we replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found the 10x magnifying mirror was too high powered for general use.  We subsequently went to the Zadro web site and found they make replacement mirrors in 8x and 5x powers for $20 each.  We purchased the 5x and the replacement was a breeze taking about two minutes per mirror.  Unless you need to work on individual hairs or skin pores be aware that the standard 10x mirror is way, way overpowered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that exception we are quite pleased with the mirror.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mirror for 7 months now and am very pleased. It has great magnification, a clear image, a greater variety of possible positions than I need and, although it is dimmable, I always have it at the brightest setting for applying my makeup in the morning. It&#x27;s working great so far.</li>
            <li> we purchased the SWL410 wall mirror.  worked perfectly for about a year and then same issues as reported occurred.  balast problem.  replacement price for the balast from Zadro is now $20 instead of $10 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> The articulation joints are a little stiff, but it&#x27;s solid, has good mirrors and the right magnification for my wife.</li>
            <li> I bought this and really loved it.  The lighting is excellent and the clarity of the mirror is perfect.  However, the on/off switch failed after only a few months. I wasn&#x27;t surprised, as I had read that in other reviews, and could tell the mechanism was a little cheap.  The manufacturer replaced it with a new one with no trouble, and now I just leave it turned on, but plug it in and out of the wall, rather than using the switch.  It&#x27;s just as easy to turn it on that way, and it seems none the worse for the wear.  I&#x27;ve been using this at least once a day for about 6 months and so far, it&#x27;s in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;The fluorescent dimming works well and does not hum.</li>
            <li> I had used this mirror at a hotel once and had to find the exact one for the bathroom I was re-doing.  This is by far my favorite addition to the bathroom. It is the perfect magnification for tweezing your eyebrows and the light is great for putting makeup on.</li>
            <li> I have a friend that I love dearly but I always want to tell her to go check her makeup. Eyeliner crooked, eyeshadow on one eye and not the other. She is such a mess but I love her. I thought, now that I cannot see close up, (middle age presbiopia) I dont want to go around with the same crooked eyeliner. People will be concentrating on how funny I look rather than what I am saying.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this mirror and what a difference! It has protective plastic on it so remove that first before viewing. No more crooked eyeliner for me either and I tweeze with my 5X mag mirror then used this one and found a lot more. You can see everything! I highly recommend this mirror and it is totally worth the price. I wont be missing anything unless I go blind! It was very easy to install too.</li>
            <li> I bought this item 10 yrs or so ago (not from Amazon).  I absolutely love it.  Can&#x27;t see a thing without my glasses so really needed something like this and didn&#x27;t want another thing cluttering up the counter plus I stand up when I put my makeup on.  When I first bought it the bulb burned out within the first month.  Zadro mailed me another one and I&#x27;ve only replaced it once more myself in the 10 years I&#x27;ve owned it (always turned it to the brightest setting).  Now it looks like the ballast has gone.  Took it apart and it is an electronic ballast made in China.  After searching all over the internet for hours for some kind of replacement I cannot find one that will fit in the base.  Soooo.  It looks like I will have to take the ballast apart to see if I can repair it (I have an electronics degree) because they are too darned expensive to buy another one unless I absolutely have to.  Very irritating that you cannot buy the part here in the USA.  I sent off an email to the sales department in China about buying one but so far no answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, it&#x27;s a great lighted mirror and they can last quite a while.  Just realize that they are not repairable here in the USA if the ballast burns out. Also, replacing the bulb takes some dexterity as you have to balance the light in the fixture with one hand while aligning the slots of the back cover while pushing it into place and then you have to align the front slots/tabs with the back slots and then you must lock the tabs into the slots by twisting the top plastic cover.  Having an extra hand around helps if you get frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a call to Zadro Inc they put the replacement ballast for the model I have onto their website under \\&quot;replacement parts\\&quot; (link located at bottom of page).</li>
            <li> Bought two and had them mounted and hardwired by an electrician...  One became loose (mirror part) and to their credit they sent me a replacement part.  Fast forward several months and the light stopped working so I tried to replace it and it must be something else since it still doesn&#x27;t work.  The real issue (and why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it) is to replace the bulb is nearly impossible - the two white covers and the center mirror are sooooo frustrating to put back together.  Took me 20 minutes just to get it put back together without the bulb so at least we&#x27;d have a mirror....  It is bright when it worked.</li>
            <li> My husband installed one of these in our guest bathroom.  I use the countertop version and seriously don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it.  Now, I want my guest to enjoy the goodness too.  Lighting is EVERYTHING when applying makeup.  This little gem casts the most realistic Sunshine light.  My makeup looks flawless for the first time in years.  There are a couple of negitives, if you could call them that. First one, it seems like after a few months, when I would turn the knob for the light to come on, if I turned it too fast, the light would immediately turn off. Now, I have to turn the knob very slowly until it&#x27;s at full brightness.  Second negitive, I find myself sitting at my vanity, in front of this mirror on the magnified side, picking, plucking and pinching for way too long.  I work from home and have the luxury of not having to put makeup on everyday. So when I do sit down to apply the paint, I have some serious catching up to do! I can get really carried away while using this mirror!  It sometimes looks like I&#x27;ve been shot with bird shot!  So, be careful and don&#x27;t try to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; everything all at once. Lesson learned the hard way... 😉</li>
            <li> Four months after purchasing this mirror I went to reach for the faucet handles and got zapped.  I turned the power off to the circuit that the mirror was on and called an electrician.  Normal household voltage is 120V.  My electrician said that the mirror was putting out 137V +.  And yes it was installed properly on a GFCI, and mounted on the wall.</li>
            <li> I have had it for about a momth and so far I am very pleased with it. I managed to install it over an existing outlet and it looks very nice. The dimmable light works very well. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror!! My wife loves it. This makes applying makeup much easier for any woman. Product works very well. Easy installation.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased my second mirror from Zadro.  The first one had a problem with the piece that holds the mirror steady and in place. It should swivel easily allowing you to turn the mirror forward and back easily. However right after installation it lost its grip so the mirror would flip forward and back with no support. The contractor I had working in the house installed it and tried to fix it but couldn&#x27;t. I just thought it was one bad part and dealt with it for 2 years. I just ordered a new one, same model, and it seems to function normally. However the 10x mirror side is wavy so my face looks distorted in some spots. It&#x27;s easy to install but for the price I would look for a different model or brand.</li>
            <li> This is our second mirror. The first one was broken in a move.  I would buy it again. I like the size and the lighting.</li>
            <li> Good product with quality glass and dimmer, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> WELL, ITS 10 MONTHS SINCE I ORDERED THIS MIRROR AND THE SWITCH BROKE, SO I ALREADY NEED A NEW MIRROR.  NOT A VERY GOOD OR LONG LASTING PRODUCT.  I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!  After a few months, the on off switch became unpredictable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. Have to tighten the arm for every use. It flops over. Latest issue, the mirror no longer lights up. Had this mirror 1 year. Just purchased another brand for $200. Hope the quality is better!</li>
            <li> I love my wall mirror, it is awesome and it wasn&#x27;t hard for a girl to put on the wall.</li>
            <li> No instructions to hang, but once up its great!</li>
            <li> Have had one in the past, very nice, good value for the price. Instructions are easy to follow and mounts to wall well.</li>
            <li> The light is very bright and the magnification very good. I did not use the wall anchors supplied  I used better ones because of the swing arm, I was affraid it would work loose. The quality is great and was easy to mount.</li>
            <li> i am really happy with product and price bought it first at target 150.00 returned it when saw amazon was half the price its nice and slim and u can see every flaw in your face great for plucking the eyebrows</li>
            <li> High quality and sturdy. It has options for using a battery OR being plugged in, which I think is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend uses it pretty much every day and loves it!</li>
            <li> It is a decent mirror, but found it cumbersome. It does not lay flat to one side as it does to the other and given my limited space, it did not work out. I also received a defective one so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Eactly what I ordered &amp; needed as well as fair price. The bulb send with a Zadro mirror was not in working order &amp; while requesting a replacement from Zadro they never sent one.</li>
            <li> Installation instructions can be misleading.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use once installed. Adjustable light switch is the best feature and I couldn&#x27;t find it on other lights.</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife for Christmas, 2013.  She loves it, so I&#x27;m a very happy camper!</li>
            <li> Horrible product quality, especially for how expensive it is! The internal electrics died less than a year after purchase and it would cost too much to ship it back and have it repaired for it to be worth the trouble. Flimsy plastic parts, screws that don&#x27;t fit properly and overall cheap, Chinese quality. Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> I want a mirror that is wall mounted and enlarges at least 10X or 15X. This is all I can find. The light around the edge is good. However,  the plastic covering that holds the bulb in place is terribly designed and falls apart regularly eventually causing the bulb to crash to the floor. Can someone suggest a better mirror?</li>
