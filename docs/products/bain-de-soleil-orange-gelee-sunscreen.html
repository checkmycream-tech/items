            <li>Thanks for such a great sunscreen, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the tropical scent and the result is always positive.  </li>
            <li>a healthy, deep bronze glow and skin feels wonderful long after tanning.</li>
            <li>Item came quickly by seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sun worshiper, love the pool, there is no better product, and smells good also.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t really that fantastic</li>
            <li>I used this in my early 20&#x27;s then could never find it for many years.  </li>
            <li>Best used when a base tan has been established, this gel goes on smoothly and has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>since the early 80&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li>areas, and a stronger SPF for your more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>and YOU WILL get that golden tan that you want.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel absolutely amazing and your skin will not be dry at all for the summer.</li>
            <li>You do have to be somewhat careful as the color can stain light clothes...just be sure you rub it in well.</li>
            <li>, however do not use this on your first day of vacation.</li>
            <li>Smells great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I totally love this tanning lotion and Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the best time to apply is after the tube is set out next to me in the sun as it is easier to put onto my body and a small amount covers my body.</li>
            <li>Have applied at the beach and the heat helps spread the gel pretty well.  </li>
            <li>it is only spf4...this could be a problem for many...</li>
            <li>It gives you a rich tan and smells devine, not to mention it leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>If you want a beautiful, dark, deep tan this is the product you need.  </li>
            <li>It is a low SPF, if you have skin that tans easily</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd sun screen product by bain de soleil that I purchased for my son and daughter-in-law who live in Florida and love the beach.  </li>
            <li>You will tan very easily and substantially dark.</li>
            <li>it really holds a tan my grandmother use to use product</li>
            <li>but it is very oily.</li>
            <li>Thanks goodness amazon had it.</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH...</li>
            <li>Recently I had time to play around on the computer and was suprised to see that it is still available.</li>
            <li>I bough another for the summer months since you don&#x27;t need to use too much for each application.&lt;br /&gt;Great to find this product again on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product in college in the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It only has mild sun protection as it is a #4.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the money as I can&#x27;t find is locally.</li>
            <li>I love this and its getting hard to find where I live!!...</li>
            <li>Live out in the country</li>
            <li>Bain de Soleil is the first sun screen I used as a kid, and it is still the standard.  </li>
            <li>I should be a little more hesitant to write this review, actually...</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and remember using this product when I was 18 years old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bain de Soleil at least fourteen years and love their sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all time..promotes deep dark tan if you have the skin type to endure the low SPF</li>
            <li>This is not true of other products who promise more.</li>
            <li>Deep tan, soft skin.</li>
            <li>gives  me a nice bronzy tan after I carefully acquire a base tan with more protective lotions.</li>
            <li>A little bit greasy at first but not like suntan oil.  </li>
            <li>Looks a little greasy at first but keeps skin moist all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the only thing that I&#x27;ve gotten a tan with, the other stuff stops me from burning, but I get no color</li>
            <li>So if you want a nice dark tan with amazing looking and feeling skin, this is the product for you and you will not be disappointed !!!</li>
            <li>but this stuff gives me a very crisp tan, so I try to buy at least 4 of these a year</li>
            <li>even has a little spf which you really should use a 15</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Item came quickly by seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sun worshiper, love the pool, there is no better product, and smells good also.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t really that fantastic</li>
            <li> I used this in my early 20&#x27;s then could never find it for many years.  </li>
            <li> Best used when a base tan has been established, this gel goes on smoothly and has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> since the early 80&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> areas, and a stronger SPF for your more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> and YOU WILL get that golden tan that you want.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel absolutely amazing and your skin will not be dry at all for the summer.</li>
            <li> You do have to be somewhat careful as the color can stain light clothes...just be sure you rub it in well.</li>
            <li> , however do not use this on your first day of vacation.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I totally love this tanning lotion and Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the best time to apply is after the tube is set out next to me in the sun as it is easier to put onto my body and a small amount covers my body.</li>
            <li> Have applied at the beach and the heat helps spread the gel pretty well.  </li>
            <li> it is only spf4...this could be a problem for many...</li>
            <li> It gives you a rich tan and smells devine, not to mention it leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> If you want a beautiful, dark, deep tan this is the product you need.  </li>
            <li> It is a low SPF, if you have skin that tans easily</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd sun screen product by bain de soleil that I purchased for my son and daughter-in-law who live in Florida and love the beach.  </li>
            <li> You will tan very easily and substantially dark.</li>
            <li> it really holds a tan my grandmother use to use product</li>
            <li> but it is very oily.</li>
            <li> Thanks goodness amazon had it.</li>
            <li> TOO MUCH...</li>
            <li> Recently I had time to play around on the computer and was suprised to see that it is still available.</li>
            <li> I bough another for the summer months since you don&#x27;t need to use too much for each application.&lt;br /&gt;Great to find this product again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product in college in the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It only has mild sun protection as it is a #4.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the money as I can&#x27;t find is locally.</li>
            <li> I love this and its getting hard to find where I live!!...</li>
            <li> Live out in the country</li>
            <li> Bain de Soleil is the first sun screen I used as a kid, and it is still the standard.  </li>
            <li> I should be a little more hesitant to write this review, actually...</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and remember using this product when I was 18 years old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bain de Soleil at least fourteen years and love their sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all time..promotes deep dark tan if you have the skin type to endure the low SPF</li>
            <li> This is not true of other products who promise more.</li>
            <li> Deep tan, soft skin.</li>
            <li> gives  me a nice bronzy tan after I carefully acquire a base tan with more protective lotions.</li>
            <li> A little bit greasy at first but not like suntan oil.  </li>
            <li> Looks a little greasy at first but keeps skin moist all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the only thing that I&#x27;ve gotten a tan with, the other stuff stops me from burning, but I get no color</li>
            <li> So if you want a nice dark tan with amazing looking and feeling skin, this is the product for you and you will not be disappointed !!!</li>
            <li> but this stuff gives me a very crisp tan, so I try to buy at least 4 of these a year</li>
            <li> even has a little spf which you really should use a 15</li>
            <li> Searched high and low and got a few of these for myself and some friends.</li>
            <li> The one downside is that sand really sticks to it, but that&#x27;s the price one pays for an unbelievable tan.</li>
            <li> but it worked so well as a long lasting moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s how long it;s been around</li>
            <li> Be careful it&#x27;s only spy 4.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> If you want a deep, dark tan this is the sunscreen of choice for pro tanners like myself.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning gel other products make me look dirty.</li>
            <li> It helps to limit sun exposure when spending long days in the sun on the beach or ski slopes to avoid skin aging, wrinkling and other harmful effects of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Judith Land, Author of Adoption Detective</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have had trouble locating it locally.  </li>
            <li> and so do the other biting bugs.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find at local retail stores but thankfully Amazon has it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find product (I can only find on-line).</li>
            <li> Old lil secret for a goddess Sun tan.</li>
            <li> ugh a little too greasy for me</li>
            <li> Not easy to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Not easy to get in our place, her problems ended with amazon.</li>
            <li> Luxurious and not easy to find on shelves.</li>
            <li> I should keep this my little secret.</li>
            <li> Go thru at least 2 tubes a summer.</li>
            <li> Oh, how I remember this from the late 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It used to be found on any drug store shelf, although expensive you at least could find it.  </li>
            <li> You are unable to buy this tanning gel in stores .</li>
            <li> IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HERE IN NY.  </li>
            <li> I used Bain De Soleil in my youth and was disappointed when i could not find it anymore in drug</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I would say, to use it after you get a base tan, since the SPF is low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I use it while mowing grass the deer flies hate it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> ugh a little too greasy for me,,, it&#x27;s kind if like lotion and oil combinded , it feels like oil although you do get a good tan with this and it will stay on you for awhile.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product years ago and had forgotten how really great it is.  I have extremely dry skin and this is just the best for making it feel good, look  good and lets you get a great tan all in one.  I love the smell and I sometimes use  it just because it feels so good on your skin.  Not easy to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> love this stuff have to have it to lay in the sun it really holds a tan my grandmother use to use product and she passed away in 1979 so that&#x27;s how long it;s been around</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product for years and could not find it in any stores. This was, and still remains my all time favorite suntan lotion. My twenty year old daughter had never heard of it but used it once at the beach and came home raving about the wonderful smell and the great tan she achieved. While at the beach yesterday five different women came up to me and asked me where I had purchased the Bain de Soleil Gelee. They all used it in their younger years and all had been looking to buy it. Please keep this product available. The tan you get is beautiful and the smell can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY HAPPY I FOUND THE BAIN DE SOLEIL GELEE.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HERE IN NY.  MY GIRLFRIENDS AND I GREW UP WITH THIS STUFF, SINCE WE WERE ALWAYS POOLSIDE. THE PACKAGE CAME WITHIN 7 DAYS JUST IN TIME FOR MY VACATION.</li>
            <li> Have LOVED it since i was a teen, i am so glad i found it again, and i plan on buying more. (stocking up)</li>
            <li> Yes it does give you a nice tan but it is very oily. The smell isn&#x27;t really that fantastic and I got sunburned every time I use it under the afternoon sun (it&#x27;s like frying myself with oil :D and I already have fairly tanned skin). Buy and use it if you don&#x27;t mind getting your towel and swimming costume greasy. I would recommend using this product on a partly cloudy day so you don&#x27;t end up like a boiled lobster.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer and I LOVE the way it smells.  Like Summer.&lt;br /&gt;Not,  not not a sunscreen but it worked so well as a long lasting moisturizer.  You do have to be somewhat careful as the color can stain light clothes...just be sure you rub it in well.</li>
            <li> I used this in my early 20&#x27;s then could never find it for many years.  Once I discovered I could purchase it on Amazon, I never stopped buying it.  It is a great moisturizer too.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel and the smell is delightful.  You can only get it in SPF 4 so be careful, I wouldn&#x27;t use this at the beach or anywhere the sun is really strong, but for outside by my pool it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have loved this stuff forever- smells amazing- conditions your skin- you can even use it on top of a higher SPF...</li>
            <li> If you want a deep, dark tan this is the sunscreen of choice for pro tanners like myself. Rookies and amateurs should not use this product. Best used when a base tan has been established, this gel goes on smoothly and has a nice smell to it. The one downside is that sand really sticks to it, but that&#x27;s the price one pays for an unbelievable tan.</li>
            <li> I love it! great product</li>
            <li> Love this tanning gel other products make me look dirty. This gives you a beautiful color. Be careful it&#x27;s only spy 4.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY sunscreen my wife uses. Not easy to get in our place, her problems ended with amazon.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product in college in the early 90&#x27;s.  It is hard to find at local retail stores but thankfully Amazon has it.  This tans you to a beautiful color, however do not use this on your first day of vacation. I recommend that you use it once there is color on your skin so that you do not burn.  The smell is also a bit strong, but you get used to it.  Try it if you are looking for a great tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have had trouble locating it locally.  Thanks goodness amazon had it. I bought it in bulk!  It gives me the best tan, nothing compares.</li>
            <li> So happy to find this on Amazon ! My favorite of all time..promotes deep dark tan if you have the skin type to endure the low SPF and I do.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly good product</li>
            <li> The most awesome suntan lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to see I could still find Bain de Soliel Orange Gelee Sunscreen!!!  I have used this since I was a teenager and that was many a moon ago!!!  I love this and its getting hard to find where I live!!... Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> best stuff out there! since the early 80&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  It is my favorite sun lotion product.  It gives you a rich tan and smells devine, not to mention it leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome products. I will buy again leave the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years. Always delights. Tan is a healthy, deep bronze glow and skin feels wonderful long after tanning.</li>
            <li> Bain de Soleil is the first sun screen I used as a kid, and it is still the standard.  Best fragrance by far, and texture also.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS FANTASTIC AND I WILL NEVER AGAIN USE ANYTHING ELSE.  THE ONLY DRAW BACK WITH THIS ITEM IS  TRYING TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE FAMILY WHEN ON VACATION... YIKES THEY SEEM TO LIKE IT TOO MUCH... OH HUM, I GUESS THAT IS WHAT MOMMY&#x27;S ARE HERE FOR...</li>
            <li> Hard to find product (I can only find on-line). The best as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Smells great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as scheduled</li>
            <li> This product been around for yeaaaars! Through generations in my family!! Old lil secret for a goddess Sun tan. Love it</li>
            <li> I used Bain De Soleil in my youth and was disappointed when i could not find it anymore in drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;It gives  me a nice bronzy tan after I carefully acquire a base tan with more protective lotions.</li>
            <li> This product is the best...have used for over 20 years and you truly do get that tropics bronze tan.......even has a little spf which you really should use a 15 at least....love...love...love</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and remember using this product when I was 18 years old.  I could never find it anywhere.  Gave up.  Recently I had time to play around on the computer and was suprised to see that it is still available. It is a low SPF, if you have skin that tans easily and you rarely burn, you will love it.  A little bit greasy at first but not like suntan oil.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I can use this because my skin has been going to Jamaica for 27 years.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I would say, to use it after you get a base tan, since the SPF is low.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a rocking tan, and it smells fantastic, and keeps you moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good deal buying the pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this duo all over again. Winter is sneaking in, so time to plan a trip to the Caribbean.&lt;br /&gt;My skin adores this orange drink after being in the salty sea.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for carrying this, and hope it never ends!</li>
            <li> Got to say, Bain de Soleil is better than ever!  This is the most beautiful, longest lasting tan I&#x27;ve had in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When friends saw what I was using, they could not believe I found it.  The fragrance alone takes me back to the late-70s.</li>
            <li> using this product for many years and it is perfect for dry skin ..also helps \ protecing and  tanning safely</li>
            <li> It was great. Just in time for summer . You are unable to buy this tanning gel in stores . I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, always have, always will. Give you the best color ever. Go thru at least 2 tubes a summer.</li>
            <li> I totally love this tanning lotion and Amazon is the only place I can find it. It&#x27;s a summer must have !!  You will tan very easily and substantially dark. Your skin will feel absolutely amazing and your skin will not be dry at all for the summer. So if you want a nice dark tan with amazing looking and feeling skin, this is the product for you and you will not be disappointed !!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have fair skin and using this I can get some tan without burning. This is not true of other products who promise more.</li>
            <li> Best oil to start out your summer time tan. I&#x27;m a sun worshiper, love the pool, there is no better product, and smells good also.</li>
            <li> The orange gelee is my favorite. I love it and have bn using it for years. Live out in the country and I use it while mowing grass the deer flies hate it and so do the other biting bugs. It gives you a wonderful tan and soft skin. love it love it.</li>
            <li> Went to the beach for a week. Never burned and got a great tan!</li>
            <li> For the best and most beautiful golden tan,  I always use Ban DE Sowell!!!</li>
            <li> For the San Tropez tan!!! Still the gold standard.  With SPF!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I loveeee this product ... gives me a beautiful topical tan and it lasts for a longggg time too. I brought two and gave one to my sister she&#x27;s the one who introduce me to this product.  Its great for skin gives it a beautiful glow.  I will continue to buy this product I just hope they don&#x27;t stop advertising it.</li>
            <li> Just great stuff. Deep tan, soft skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bain de Soleil at least fourteen years and love their sunscreen. The product stays on when I get into the pool many times.  I&#x27;ve found the best time to apply is after the tube is set out next to me in the sun as it is easier to put onto my body and a small amount covers my body.</li>
            <li> I had to have this....as a child of the eighties, this was the product to have way back when. And it still rocks!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many many years and it has always provided the best tanned skin. It keeps your skin moist and stays on for a good amount of time, does not wash off easily. It has just enough sunscreen (4) to create an awesome tan.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes your skin as well as protects it from the sun!  I would only use this on your &amp;#34;hard to tan&amp;#34; areas, and a stronger SPF for your more sensitive areas.  I love this product! ! !</li>
            <li> I have been using Bain de Soleil for years.  If you want a beautiful, dark, deep tan this is the product you need.  Makes my skin feel wonderful too. Great price for two.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the color you get is really a rich bronzy tan.  I don&#x27;t like applying the geg but I do it after I shower and before the beach.  Have applied at the beach and the heat helps spread the gel pretty well.  Adds a lot of moisture to your skin.  Water beads up on your skin for awhile after application.  I bough another for the summer months since you don&#x27;t need to use too much for each application.&lt;br /&gt;Great to find this product again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen feels so wonderful on your skin - so moisturizing and has a nice texture.  I will certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd sun screen product by bain de soleil that I purchased for my son and daughter-in-law who live in Florida and love the beach.  They are so very happy with their very favorite sun screen.</li>
            <li> Best suntan lotion.  EVER</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  I love the tropical scent and the result is always positive.  Granted it is only spf4...this could be a problem for many...</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for me.  I have been using and loving this product for 50 years.  It gives me a deep beautiful tan.  It only has mild sun protection as it is a #4.  I buy it more than one at a time so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING BAIN de SOLEIL ORANGE GELEE FOR YEARS...LOVE IT, LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;KEEPS YOUR SKIN MOISTURIZED AND THE SCENT IS LOVELY!</li>
            <li> Have used this for a long time. I like the gelee because it is also moisturizing and a lovely tint. Only downside is it can stain your bathing suit.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen that I have EVER used.  It&#x27;s so worth the money as I can&#x27;t find is locally.</li>
            <li> This is the best suntan lotion. It is a rich gelee that smells amazing and moisturizing for your skin. Been using this for years. Amazon is the only place I van still find it and for a great price.</li>
            <li> For those of us over 45 already know, this is NOT a  sunscreen but a lovely emollient that absorbs the sun, browns the skin, and brings back great beach memories!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the only thing that I&#x27;ve gotten a tan with, the other stuff stops me from burning, but I get no color but this stuff gives me a very crisp tan, so I try to buy at least 4 of these a year so I don&#x27;t run out, thanks for another great product.</li>
            <li> The most luxurious sunscreen. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Looks a little greasy at first but keeps skin moist all day. It helps to limit sun exposure when spending long days in the sun on the beach or ski slopes to avoid skin aging, wrinkling and other harmful effects of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Judith Land, Author of Adoption Detective</li>
            <li> Been a favorite for years!</li>
            <li> I have used the same Bain de Soleil for all my trips to the beach. Smells great and YOU WILL get that golden tan that you want. Thanks for such a great sunscreen, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do better than this.....</li>
            <li> Love this gelee, but be warned that it is quite messy/oily. Still get a great tan!</li>
            <li> got it quickly!  Very Very Happy</li>
            <li> This scent is heavenly. Anytime I smell it, it reminds me of vacation. Luxurious and not easy to find on shelves. I should be a little more hesitant to write this review, actually... I should keep this my little secret.</li>
            <li> Very good product Thank you and excellent delivery time.</li>
            <li> Oh, how I remember this from the late 70&#x27;s. Love that orangy color and smell. Searched high and low and got a few of these for myself and some friends. Not a lot of sunscreen protection but it works for us.</li>
            <li> This is a great item to help give a golden tan.  To my surprise it&#x27;s a low percentage sunscreen.  However I notice when I use it I&#x27;m always complimented on my color.  It used to be found on any drug store shelf, although expensive you at least could find it.  Chains stopped selling it, so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  Item came quickly by seller.</li>
