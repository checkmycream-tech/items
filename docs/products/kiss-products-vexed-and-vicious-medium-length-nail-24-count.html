            <li> A few came off and I used a little glue to put them back on.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, while cleaning house with my gloves on this morning when I took the gloves off 3 of my nails were gone.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, they don&#x27;t stay on at all, they are way too long and need trimming which is a bad idea</li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>

            <li> Terrible, they don&#x27;t stay on at all, they are way too long and need trimming which is a bad idea becuase they&#x27;ll bust off!</li>
            <li> use these often and love them.</li>
            <li> WHAT I EXPECTED.  I HAVE USED THEM BEFORE.</li>
            <li> Kiss nails are the best.  They are pre polished, they come&lt;br /&gt;in different lengths, short for sports or work and medium for&lt;br /&gt;dress or work.  They fit all  nail beds even flat and apply quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The little bottle is great for storage.  Plus they come is a great&lt;br /&gt;variety of colors and designs.</li>
            <li> I purchased Kiss press on nails at my local drugstore.  They were wonderful, stayed on over a week.  Ordered these, put them on last night and loved the look.  Unfortunately, while cleaning house with my gloves on this morning when I took the gloves off 3 of my nails were gone.  I will be returning these and will purchase something else.  Either they are of poor quality or they are old and the sticky part won&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> Wore these for over a week.  A few came off and I used a little glue to put them back on.  I had many good comments on these.  They are cheaper than a manicure. Buying these through Amazon, they were only $4.00.  What a wonderful temporary fix for your nails especially for special occasions.  They were medium length which were just right for me as you were able to do everything you do with your natural nails.  If you like very long nails, these will not do for you.Bought additional ones for future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered some in the off white.  When I put them on, they were short but the box didn&#x27;t indicate either way whether they were short or medium.  I wore them for a week and the finish dulled on them.</li>
            <li> I love these nails.They are very easy to put on and they stay on really well.I won&#x27;t buy any other brand.I wish they had more colors in medium length!</li>
            <li> I wore this set for two weeks and finally had to soak them off with nail polish remover.  They were great, but I thought I&#x27;d take them off since the new growth on my nails was starting to show.</li>
            <li> These nails are great for special occasions.  They are easy to put on and lasted me the whole weekend.  I don&#x27;t think they will work for long periods of more than a week but perfect for a special weekend or short get-away.</li>
            <li> Will not buy these again. These looked horrible like something a 6 year old would wear for dress up. Disappointing</li>
            <li> I bought these not having high expectations as I remember those &#x27;press ons&#x27; from the 90s that were awful.  Well these are a totally different story.  I was looking for something to cover up a few nails that were cracking and peeling that I want to get better.  I didn&#x27;t want to damage my nails even further by doing gels or acrylic so I thought i&#x27;d give these a try.  I am so glad that I did!  They fit really well with a large assortment of sizes.  They are the right length and in some cases I clipped them and filed them a bit further.  After I stuck them on I painted over them and the French tips covered up nicely with two coats.  Thusfar they have lasted a really long time!  On my left hand I have two that have been on for more than two weeks including a polish change.  On my right hand (my dominate one) they don&#x27;t last quite as long but it has been really easy to throw on another one.  You can&#x27;t even tell the difference between my real nails and my &#x27;prothstetic&#x27; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The new Kiss line press on nails are perfect when your time is limited and you&#x27;re on the go. I always get compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply to apply, you just basically find the right size for each nail and stick on. Its way cheaper than getting a full set of acrylic nails. Was pleased with it .</li>
            <li> It comes already glued</li>
