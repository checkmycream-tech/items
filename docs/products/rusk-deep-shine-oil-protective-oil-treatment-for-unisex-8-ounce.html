            <li>It works really well on my fine curly hair.</li>

            <li>I love this product and I received it quick, and I will definitely recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li>Because it is non-greasy, I tried it on my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s curly (Caucasian), hair and it looks and feels fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying my second bottle now as a back-up! :)</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product from Ebay before at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>I was still able to put back in the bottle the amount spilled as it was retained in the plastic bag.</li>
            <li>All my life I have had long hair but couldn&#x27;t get it to shine or look healthy.</li>
            <li>The more dry and /or frizzy</li>
            <li>I really love this product it works well is priced very affordably and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it both on wet and dry hair and gotten great results.</li>
            <li>I even got a bit wet in the rain (after flat ironing + using this oil) and my hair was still straight and amazing!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is finally frizz free and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I have really cruly frizzy nappy hair.  </li>
            <li>This product help me alot, now my hair is shining, easy to brush and long.</li>
            <li>I have used many other products, and this one is my holy grail!</li>
            <li>Dolce gabbanar4 e used So many different types of products and when I finally find something that works they stop selling it.</li>
            <li>This product completely absorbs if you do happen to use too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Oil brand Argan oil before, and, even though I think both this and that are good products, I would recommend this product if your hair needs serious taming and the Moroccan Oil more for regular thickness/regularly wavy hair, as it&#x27;s not as thick as this product.</li>
            <li>The only way I can really get my natural hair to be soft and shiny is by using this stuff.</li>
            <li>The end result is that my frizzy curls are tamed into soft and shiny waves.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR SOFT AND WITH A SHINE</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair that I straighten every day</li>
            <li>I was totally paying so much for this overpriced product at my local hair salon.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, greasy or obvious.</li>
            <li>I live in utah  and the weather its totally dry, my hair broke evrytime when I was brushing it...</li>

            <li> I was totally paying so much for this overpriced product at my local hair salon. When I saw that I could get it so cheap I thought  it had to be too good to be true. Well it&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for sometiome now. It works really well on my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have locks and very dry hair. 3 months ago my stylist gave me a 7.4ml sample; I&#x27;ve been frantically hunting for the Rusk deepshine oil ever since, especially now because I am nearing the end of my sample.  This has kept my roots hydrated and gives it a healthy sheen like no other product I&#x27;ve used.  Because it is non-greasy, I tried it on my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s curly (Caucasian), hair and it looks and feels fabulous.  It virtually eliminates the frizz, makes removing the tangles much easier and smells lovely.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all, including various argan oil products, but this thing is a winner.  It was love at the first contact with the hair.  My hair is finally frizz free and shiny.  Kudos to rusk!</li>

It works well for all the family. Thank you.</li>
            <li> All my life I have had long hair but couldn&#x27;t get it to shine or look healthy. My hairdresser let me try some of this and it&#x27;s a  wonder worker. My hair looks and feels 10 years younger. I can also wear styles that I previously could not wear before, due to the frizziness of my hair. This stuff works! The more dry and /or frizzy your hair is, the more you can apply, and it blends right in. Not heavy, greasy or obvious.</li>
