            <li>At a $200 price difference with some high-end brand names, I honestly don&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>

            <li>After first use, I have noticed my skin felt much more smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this product all over Instagram &amp; blogs defenitley worth the price!</li>
            <li>to point out that the small sponge is really awesome.</li>
            <li>I clean the brushes after every use with anti-bacterial soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments from friends it really made my day.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this product a %100!!</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my face but exfoliates well, is great for dry brushing and for using in the shower.</li>
            <li>The product is worth of every penny.</li>
            <li>So Far I Love It.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel right</li>
            <li>I have to say that Spa Day Skin Care facial cleansing system is the best facial cleansing tools I have ever used so far.</li>
            <li>Lovin my Face! ;-)</li>
            <li>I try to be consistent about using this every night, but admittedly sometimes I&#x27;m in a rush to go to bed and don&#x27;t put in the effort.</li>
            <li>After first day using the brush, I noticed the blackheads around my lips disappeared.</li>
            <li>My first time using it.  </li>
            <li>I just love my facial brush makes me feel radient</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s easy to change the different attachment.</li>
            <li>A smart design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you have tried something that cleans so perfectly, it&#x27;s going to be hard to go back to the old way.</li>
            <li>I really like this devise.</li>
            <li>but with the sponge it really goes into your skin and feel the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Now my wife wants to buy another one for her sister.</li>
            <li>I recently started wearing a light amount of makeup.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I washed my face like I normally do, then washed it with the brush as instructed.</li>
            <li>It really cleans well.</li>
            <li>It was so much makeup still in my pores.</li>
            <li>I had a very oily skin problem on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference and highly recommend it to anyone, like myself, with normal to oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried to see if other brands fit on the handle as I like their brushes so much.</li>
            <li>With a little bit of soaking in hot water, this device makes my heels smooth again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised by how much I like this tool.</li>
            <li>Very classy and the product is made from high quality materials.</li>
            <li>I really live it and recommend to others.</li>
            <li>On 2nd day, I did a little test just to see if what they are claiming “cleans 6X better than hands only” is true.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using facial brush</li>
            <li>I bought this because I really needed to exfoliate dry skin on my face and the reviews were positive.  </li>
            <li>So far after a week of use</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to everyone that wants to improve their skin.</li>
            <li>My skin glows and my face is so soft.</li>
            <li>My face was soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>After using the tool for just a few times, my face has a fabulous glow now.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as deep as I&#x27;d like it to, but still a decent brush.</li>

            <li> It buffs in moisturizer after cleaning so my skin does not feel dry after deep cleansing with the brush.</li>
            <li> It grinds off dry flakes on my heel.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with my usual facial cleanser, applied toner, still see leftover makeups and dirt on the pad; (its gross!)</li>
            <li> or as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a glamor girl, but this has become a part of my morning and night ritual that I look forward to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I would be careful with this product unless I was suppose to do something that I&#x27;m not aware of it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night when I&#x27;m doing my nightly cleanse</li>
            <li> Mine wore out after less than 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d need a tight seal.</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully morning and night for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> Over a few months of me just washing my face morning and night, I noticed my pores beginning to enlarge.</li>
            <li> battery compartment was a little difficult to open</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> This time pad came out clean, no more disgusting leftover makeups and dirt.</li>
            <li> But the brush and system was weak and did not perform as hoped . . .</li>
            <li> Does this mean I have been washing my face wrong</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far after a week of use I really like this devise. It feels like a face massage every day! My skin feels so soft and clean. The pumice stone is great for the bottom of the heels as well.</li>
            <li> my face feels good when I used</li>
            <li> I loved this item for about a month and then water got into the unit and stopped working</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical because a friend of mine has one that&#x27;s way more expensive than this one, and this one comes with different tools as well and hers didn&#x27;t! I use it once a day because I use a facial scrub so it&#x27;s recommended to do it only once and it works perfectly! And I absolutely love the moisturizer tool, when I would apply moisturizer on my face with my hands you can feel it&#x27;s oily for a while and it doesn&#x27;t feel right but with the sponge it really goes into your skin and feel the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this product a %100!! You won&#x27;t regret it! And for this price it&#x27;s absolutely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Very nice cleaning set!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this system.  It works great and the price is terrific ! However, after a month i changed the batteries and it no longer worked. I tried several different batteries and it wouldn&#x27;t come on.  Not sure what happened. But I would be careful with this product unless I was suppose to do something that I&#x27;m not aware of it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my wife. She loves it and she uses it every night. I see a huge improvement on her skin. This product works very well. Now my wife wants to buy another one for her sister. It also came in a fancy box design. Very classy and the product is made from high quality materials. I definitely recommend this to everyone that wants to improve their skin. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> great product and service</li>
            <li> The product is worth of every penny. It works better than my sister&#x27;s expensive brand. Soooo much in love using it. Got lots of compliments on my skin from hubby and coworkers since I started using it last week. Only a week, the result is great!!!!. The service is 5 star. Prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I really needed to exfoliate dry skin on my face and the reviews were positive.  But the brush and system was weak and did not perform as hoped . . . or as expected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I recently started wearing a light amount of makeup. Over a few months of me just washing my face morning and night, I noticed my pores beginning to enlarge. I have never seen my skin like that! After reading the reviews I decided to buy this brush and I&#x27;m soooo glad I did! When I first used it I washed my face like I normally do, then washed it with the brush as instructed. I can&#x27;t believe the amount of dirt I still had on my face! After using it for two days my pores did not look visible at all. My skin glows and my face is so soft. I have been using it faithfully morning and night for a little over a week now and it&#x27;s the best investment ever!!! So glad I bought this...I won&#x27;t be able to go without it. Lovin my Face! ;-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing to a real facial. Each brush gives your face a different feel.  Very refreshing</li>
            <li> bought for my dad. he loves it</li>
            <li> I got my skin cleansing brush two days ago and I am impressed how well it works.  After first use, I have noticed my skin felt much more smoother and softer. On 2nd day, I did a little test just to see if what they are claiming “cleans 6X better than hands only” is true. Check this out! I washed my face with my usual facial cleanser, applied toner, still see leftover makeups and dirt on the pad; (its gross!) then I cleaned my face with the brush, applied toner again. This time pad came out clean, no more disgusting leftover makeups and dirt. Does this mean I have been washing my face wrong all my life?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase, now I just need to make sure I use it everyday twice a day.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I had never used one of these devices before.  I use it every other night when I&#x27;m doing my nightly cleanse and I can see a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this once since I&#x27;ve had it. It really cleans well. I had washed my face twice then used this. It was so much makeup still in my pores. My face was soft afterwards. I will used this again. Update. I have used this every night since my last post. I wish I had bought one sooner. My face is not breaking out as much any more love it. I have to try the body brush soon....</li>
            <li> Considered this product rather than the clarisonic cleaning system. I&#x27;ve seen this product all over Instagram &amp; blogs defenitley worth the price!</li>
            <li> I like using it,it&#x27;s easy to change the different attachment.</li>
            <li> I have to say that Spa Day Skin Care facial cleansing system is the best facial cleansing tools I have ever used so far. Once you have tried something that cleans so perfectly, it&#x27;s going to be hard to go back to the old way. After using the tool for just a few times, my face has a fabulous glow now. My skin tone is already more even than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to point out that the small sponge is really awesome. It buffs in moisturizer after cleaning so my skin does not feel dry after deep cleansing with the brush. A smart design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bonus part is the pumic stone. It grinds off dry flakes on my heel. With a little bit of soaking in hot water, this device makes my heels smooth again. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to order another one for my sister for her birth day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by how much I like this tool. I&#x27;m not much of a glamor girl, but this has become a part of my morning and night ritual that I look forward to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this makes my skin feel. It is gentle on my face but exfoliates well, is great for dry brushing and for using in the shower. It makes you feel like you&#x27;re getting a massage as you exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really deep cleans and has helped minimize the larger pores on my face...I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference and highly recommend it to anyone, like myself, with normal to oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment was a little difficult to open but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s waterproof and you&#x27;d need a tight seal. I clean the brushes after every use with anti-bacterial soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great product and I highly recommend it. At a $200 price difference with some high-end brand names, I honestly don&#x27;t notice much of a difference. So don&#x27;t let the great price fool you, this brush gets the job done and will have your skin feeling soft and smooth in no time.</li>
            <li> The brush does not last long. Mine wore out after less than 2 weeks of use. Additionally, the brush head keeps popping off and does not stay on.</li>
            <li> Works great, really is waterproof, and is affordable. Replacements are affordable as well, but you have to buy all four heads as a unit instead of just individually. Haven&#x27;t tried to see if other brands fit on the handle as I like their brushes so much.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great face brush set for the price! I typically only use the face brush and the moisturizer sponge attachments. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product. It definitely seems to help with my breakouts! I try to be consistent about using this every night, but admittedly sometimes I&#x27;m in a rush to go to bed and don&#x27;t put in the effort. I really should because my face looks so much better when I use it! I&#x27;ve never used a face brush cleansing set before, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others. I just know that this is a great set that meets my needs, and it comes at a great price compared to many others on the market!</li>
            <li> I had a very oily skin problem on my face so I thought I would try one of the facial cleansing brushes that Amazon advertises.  I went for a low price one from Facial Cleansing Brush Skin Cleansing Set by Spa  Day Care Skincare.  It is GREAT.  It has control my oily facial skin and taken care of the blackhead problem that I was having.  I would  love to recommend this product to anyone with similar problems as it is wonderful!!  I am extremely pleased and a very happy person.  Thank you Spa Day Care for the product and great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Skip</li>
            <li> I got this brush set as a gift and I am loving it. This is the first time I am using facial brush and I was very surprised and impressed by the result. I have oily skin and always suffered from blackheads. After first day using the brush, I noticed the blackheads around my lips disappeared. My face was glowing. I got so many compliments from friends it really made my day. I really live it and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> My first time using it.  So Far I Love It.  I recommend for others to try</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as deep as I&#x27;d like it to, but still a decent brush.</li>
            <li> I just love my facial brush makes me feel radient</li>
