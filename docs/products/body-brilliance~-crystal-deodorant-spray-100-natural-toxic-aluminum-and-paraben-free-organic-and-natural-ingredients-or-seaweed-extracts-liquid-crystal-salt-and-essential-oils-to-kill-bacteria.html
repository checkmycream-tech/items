            <li>What&#x27;s even more amazing is the smell!  </li>
            <li>stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>Also felt like for the price it should have been amazing.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I love that I feel like I am doing something good for my body while using a product that works so well for me.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making a great product that has me smelling great throughout my day.</li>
            <li>I have received this product at a reduced rate to write an honest review.</li>
            <li>I have received no instructions and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>but you might find one which smells nice and</li>
            <li>So nice.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice, and it lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>but it smells spicy nice.</li>
            <li>The spray is easy to use &amp; feels good going on.</li>
            <li>and for most people, deodorant without anti perspirant is not as effective.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found yet ---</li>
            <li>Have used this as my primary deodorant since its introduction and am very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very light and feminine.  </li>
            <li>Smell is kind of strong, but I like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I can not get this to SPRAY more than once.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Perhaps others would have better luck with</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the top and gave it a whiff I knew that I would not be using this</li>
            <li>Sure stoops the offensive odor even after a workout...</li>
            <li>I gave his feet a squirt of the Body Brilliance spray and it worked so well even his shoes smell better.  </li>
            <li>Not even sure how that happened.  </li>
            <li>They all enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li>I love Body Brilliance deodorant spray.  </li>
            <li>I love working out in my yard</li>
            <li>On top of the of</li>
            <li>I hope you give Brody Brilliance a chance, I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
            <li>but I found that on the hottest days it didn&#x27;t work for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I guess smelling like patchouli is better than B.O.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;ll continue my search for a healthier alternative at a more competitive price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;d better be, for the cost.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect and everyone has a different biome of bacteria that like living and munching on their sweat (and pooping) on them.  </li>
            <li>I always find it on his side of the bathroom counter :-)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I love the hints of patchouli, I have a feeling it wont hold up all that well through summer</li>
            <li>Body Brilliance is absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake it up before each use as it settles while sitting.</li>
            <li>What fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I will buy more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s particularly impressed with the inclusion of lavandin, spanish sage, patchouli, cajeput and lemon</li>
            <li>I am going to order tons more and give as presents to friends and family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do just fine. :)</li>
            <li>Great all natural product.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and refreshing lavender.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is chemical free</li>
            <li>The scent is light, it is an easy spray, no nasty residue on your clothes</li>
            <li>so I can put on my shirt right away and not worry about stains, and it works so well and smells so nice that my boyfriend loves licking my pits..</li>
            <li>I am so excited I was able to receive this at a discount for my preview of this.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried ever.  </li>
            <li>Great essential oil based, I love this product.</li>
            <li>how strong the deodorant was-</li>
            <li>However, the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>But, after using, it, I can report that it&#x27;s not at all too strong.</li>
            <li>but once it settles in, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>The first day I went spray happy and used to much.  </li>
            <li>However, when first applied, it smells great, but not long after, it smells VERY STRONGLY like patchouli.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned a &amp;#34;musk smell&amp;#34; I have to disagree and say it&#x27;s more like fresh pine.</li>
            <li>but, I enjoy the scent of body brilliance and even the non-sticky feeling it provides.</li>
            <li>The important thing is to get rid of the aluminum and parabens in mainstream deodorant that are cancer-causing carcinogens and screw up the way your body detoxes itself.  </li>
            <li>I am so grateful to Alan Davidson for creating this fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as knowledgeable about essential oils as my wife, but am happy they meet with her approval.</li>
            <li>The label says &amp;#34; a lightly scented deodorant&amp;#34; and I agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very tactile person and like it when a product feels nice.</li>
            <li>pump sprayer gives you many applications at just the right amount so on a cost per application basis</li>
            <li>It definitely works like a deodorant and very effectively.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and dries quickly even though it is a liquid.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to shake it up real well or the patchouli note come out strong!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a cancer survivor and does her best to stay as natural in all things as possible.  </li>
            <li>I have definitely used more effective deodorants and won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients are wonderful and are definitely &amp;#34;spa quality&amp;#34; as the label says.</li>
            <li>If its true what it says on the packet about being 100% natural, this thing is better than sliced bread :-)</li>
            <li>At first the scent is very strong and fortunately it fades fast after application.</li>
            <li>Finally, natural deodorant that works and smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>OMG I have to write a FULL review on this as I think others will find my experience helpful when considering this product.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product but its overwhelming on the patchouli smell, I smell like a hippie.  </li>
            <li>it is light, fresh &amp; airy.</li>
            <li>;) I am very satisfied with the body brilliance deodorant and now have a new found respect for my health.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and clean even on those mornings that my shower gets delayed until afternoon.  </li>
            <li>So clean and fresh, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>But 1) I don&#x27;t need perfume because I smell clean with this, and 2) my health is worth it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn deodorant in over a year because I was pregnant and now in nursing.</li>
            <li>Its a spray that absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>For me, the scent is pretty potent when first applied.</li>
            <li>I waited for a few days to post a review because I wanted to be sure this stuff was as good as it seemed.</li>
            <li>Hard to fine a good natural deodorant ... better than most.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind strong, just not that tree-y woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not have a feminine powder scent nor a masculine musk scent - more just fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve EVER had NO body odor at the end of the day or even first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li>This is my first review after all these years of shopping on Amazon!</li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals, a clean subtle scent (I like to smell good), no greasy stain on my clothes, YES, YES, AND</li>
            <li>Great on a hot day or any other.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to try a natural deodorant, but it&#x27;s the best decision i&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this because I enjoy the fragrance</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does this one work, but it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have read all the reviews of Body Brilliance and knew that this deodorant was worth a try.</li>
            <li>every 8-12 hours just to stay optimally fresh.</li>
            <li>how well it works, it is also an all natural product which I love.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s rating system wins again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s chemical free and actually works.</li>
            <li>Wonderful alternative to the barrage of unhealthy stick or spray deodorants found in the marketplace.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, so I&#x27;m not worried about baby, and it keeps my pits smelling light and fresh!</li>
            <li>It does start to wear after 8-12 hours, but I&#x27;m still very happy with it, and I have about half the bottle left after 3 months of 2-3 sprays on each armpit per day.</li>
            <li>More natural than most, NO aluminum and actually works.  </li>
            <li>And he&#x27;s not wrong.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t always get me through the day when it&#x27;s really hot in Texas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This spray is healthier than most and I give it only 4 stars because of scent.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not selling anything more than a blend of essential oils here.</li>
            <li>I tried this product at the recommendation of a friend and it&#x27;s the first time</li>
            <li>When I first got it and smelled it, I wondered if it would be too &amp;#34;piney&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My current bottle seems to be lasting a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I tried the deodorant and I can say that it works very well, better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and that it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I tried Body Brilliance deodorant and worked through some intense phone calls, highly stressful and was amazed at how fresh I as at 11 that night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that it had to have been burning everyone else&#x27;s noses too.</li>
            <li>So the third day I thought could I really be odor free with one squirt?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working very well, and I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>She really, really likes this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Body brillance has absolutely changed all of that for me..</li>
            <li>Thanks to he creators of Body Brilliance.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works -</li>
            <li>I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li>As an athlete who sweats a lot teaching classes, I need a deodorant that really works...and keeps working.</li>
            <li>this product really works</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not kidding, my husband literally curls up to me and wants to smell my pits.</li>
            <li>I really felt like I had to choose between a deodorant that is harmful for me or the harm I was doing to everyone else around me as the day progressed.  </li>
            <li>The label has a &amp;#34;smooth satin&amp;#34; feel to it that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>live in Washington DC where its been humid and hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a ok deodorant for summer, I have had to reapply after every 4 hours or so in extreme heat.</li>
            <li>if you value keeping your body clear of the toxins found in conventional deodorants) and even the label is nice.</li>
            <li>I sweat A LOT and the true test was wearing it to my incredibly intense cardio workout last week.</li>
            <li>Not sure I would have tried this but for the substantial discount I was given in return for an honest review, but I believe I will buy another bottle of this for when I do need deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely pay the full price for this any day.</li>
            <li>First natural deodorant that has sustained and</li>
            <li>I keep getting the slight whiff of it and each time think it smells so sophisticated, like a beautiful expensive perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many different natural deodorants and this is the first one that actually worked.</li>
            <li>The packaging says its Spa Quality which oddly makes me feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself. :-)  </li>
            <li>I would have been inclined to add another star if there was more Sandalwood and or Patchouli and less of that piny, woodsy, tea tree oil smell to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a well balanced mix that seems to work particularly well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that is concerned about what they put on or in their bodies but also refuse to be or raise the &amp;#34;Smelly kid in class&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few days and the smell is very light.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Here is the hard truth, I still get kind of smelly by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I really like that this deodorant is all natural, and I dint have to worry about any chemicals it metals seeping into my body like the majority of store bought deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Until Body Brilliance, I gave up on finding something that was natural and really worked.  </li>
            <li>I know that aluminum that&#x27;s in most deodorants is deadly...</li>
            <li>Smell is a little different, but I can get used to it, if it is this effective.</li>
            <li>none of them did the trick, they were either too sticky, not strong enough, or they made me sweat more!</li>
            <li>The pleasant scent stays with you for awhile, but the protection works hard all day long.  </li>
            <li>However this a larger than usual spray bottle so would have been worth the money if only I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>decided to try this because of the other reviews and sure enough...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay a premium for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>It does settle down a little bit after a short while, until perspiration appears and the scent is more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Given the differences in body chemistry for everyone, perhaps it won&#x27;t be a strong scent for others.</li>
            <li>It is free of aluminum products and can be used just like any typical deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I have always had a problem staying dry and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Previous natural deodorants did not last more than 2 hours for me.</li>
            <li>I get that this is supposed to be natural</li>
            <li>I will try to spray this on my 6 year old sons feet as his feet tends to sweat a lot and get stinky and see how that works</li>
            <li>I will see how far this will go.</li>
            <li>I tried all the natural ones, toms, arm and hammer, jasons natural...</li>
            <li>natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I understand that the natural stuff cannot compare to the anti-perpirants in effectiveness.</li>
            <li>So, wildly overpriced considering its ineffectiveness.  </li>
            <li>We have cancer in our family so we are all trying to go natural</li>
            <li>This one far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all natural products before and they were ineffective for me.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really keeps my dry.</li>
            <li>I am conscious about the dangers of regular deodorants and have been using a natural deodorant for years.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone, male or female.  </li>
            <li>This is all natural and is scented with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Chicago weather so far, last month since I started wearing).</li>
            <li>I find the smell a little much at first</li>
            <li>Been using for a few days and works very well!</li>
            <li>Well, if you&#x27;re REALLY and TRULY serious about not smelling like strong nasty pit odor, and you&#x27;re serious about being in command of your health, do some research on how to naturally minimize it so you can use this deodorant more effectively.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell much, but sometimes get a little sticky and smell a little if the weather changes suddenly.</li>

            <li> The smell is woodsy and good for a man or a woman.  </li>
            <li> It just smells that good.</li>
            <li> i thought this will be a good one since it has a lot of good reviews.</li>

            <li> I tried this deodorant on a whim and love it!</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles after reading you can use it on your feet too!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even more amazing is the smell!  </li>
            <li> stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> Also felt like for the price it should have been amazing.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I love that I feel like I am doing something good for my body while using a product that works so well for me.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making a great product that has me smelling great throughout my day.</li>
            <li> I have received this product at a reduced rate to write an honest review.</li>
            <li> I have received no instructions and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> but you might find one which smells nice and</li>
            <li> So nice.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice, and it lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> but it smells spicy nice.</li>
            <li> The spray is easy to use &amp; feels good going on.</li>
            <li> and for most people, deodorant without anti perspirant is not as effective.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found yet ---</li>
            <li> Have used this as my primary deodorant since its introduction and am very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very light and feminine.  </li>
            <li> Smell is kind of strong, but I like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I can not get this to SPRAY more than once.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Perhaps others would have better luck with</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the top and gave it a whiff I knew that I would not be using this</li>
            <li> Sure stoops the offensive odor even after a workout...</li>
            <li> I gave his feet a squirt of the Body Brilliance spray and it worked so well even his shoes smell better.  </li>
            <li> Not even sure how that happened.  </li>
            <li> They all enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li> I love Body Brilliance deodorant spray.  </li>
            <li> I love working out in my yard</li>
            <li> On top of the of</li>
            <li> I hope you give Brody Brilliance a chance, I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
            <li> but I found that on the hottest days it didn&#x27;t work for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I guess smelling like patchouli is better than B.O.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;ll continue my search for a healthier alternative at a more competitive price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;d better be, for the cost.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect and everyone has a different biome of bacteria that like living and munching on their sweat (and pooping) on them.  </li>
            <li> I always find it on his side of the bathroom counter :-)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I love the hints of patchouli, I have a feeling it wont hold up all that well through summer</li>
            <li> Body Brilliance is absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Make sure you shake it up before each use as it settles while sitting.</li>
            <li> What fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I will buy more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s particularly impressed with the inclusion of lavandin, spanish sage, patchouli, cajeput and lemon</li>
            <li> I am going to order tons more and give as presents to friends and family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also very cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do just fine. :)</li>
            <li> Great all natural product.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and refreshing lavender.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is chemical free</li>
            <li> The scent is light, it is an easy spray, no nasty residue on your clothes</li>
            <li> so I can put on my shirt right away and not worry about stains, and it works so well and smells so nice that my boyfriend loves licking my pits..</li>
            <li> I am so excited I was able to receive this at a discount for my preview of this.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried ever.  </li>
            <li> Great essential oil based, I love this product.</li>
            <li> how strong the deodorant was-</li>
            <li> However, the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> But, after using, it, I can report that it&#x27;s not at all too strong.</li>
            <li> but once it settles in, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> The first day I went spray happy and used to much.  </li>
            <li> However, when first applied, it smells great, but not long after, it smells VERY STRONGLY like patchouli.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned a &amp;#34;musk smell&amp;#34; I have to disagree and say it&#x27;s more like fresh pine.</li>
            <li> but, I enjoy the scent of body brilliance and even the non-sticky feeling it provides.</li>
            <li> The important thing is to get rid of the aluminum and parabens in mainstream deodorant that are cancer-causing carcinogens and screw up the way your body detoxes itself.  </li>
            <li> I am so grateful to Alan Davidson for creating this fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as knowledgeable about essential oils as my wife, but am happy they meet with her approval.</li>
            <li> The label says &amp;#34; a lightly scented deodorant&amp;#34; and I agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very tactile person and like it when a product feels nice.</li>
            <li> pump sprayer gives you many applications at just the right amount so on a cost per application basis</li>
            <li> It definitely works like a deodorant and very effectively.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and dries quickly even though it is a liquid.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to shake it up real well or the patchouli note come out strong!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a cancer survivor and does her best to stay as natural in all things as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have definitely used more effective deodorants and won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients are wonderful and are definitely &amp;#34;spa quality&amp;#34; as the label says.</li>
            <li> If its true what it says on the packet about being 100% natural, this thing is better than sliced bread :-)</li>
            <li> At first the scent is very strong and fortunately it fades fast after application.</li>
            <li> Finally, natural deodorant that works and smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> OMG I have to write a FULL review on this as I think others will find my experience helpful when considering this product.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but its overwhelming on the patchouli smell, I smell like a hippie.  </li>
            <li> it is light, fresh &amp; airy.</li>
            <li> ;) I am very satisfied with the body brilliance deodorant and now have a new found respect for my health.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and clean even on those mornings that my shower gets delayed until afternoon.  </li>
            <li> So clean and fresh, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> But 1) I don&#x27;t need perfume because I smell clean with this, and 2) my health is worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn deodorant in over a year because I was pregnant and now in nursing.</li>
            <li> Its a spray that absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> For me, the scent is pretty potent when first applied.</li>
            <li> I waited for a few days to post a review because I wanted to be sure this stuff was as good as it seemed.</li>
            <li> Hard to fine a good natural deodorant ... better than most.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind strong, just not that tree-y woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have a feminine powder scent nor a masculine musk scent - more just fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve EVER had NO body odor at the end of the day or even first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li> This is my first review after all these years of shopping on Amazon!</li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals, a clean subtle scent (I like to smell good), no greasy stain on my clothes, YES, YES, AND</li>
            <li> Great on a hot day or any other.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to try a natural deodorant, but it&#x27;s the best decision i&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this because I enjoy the fragrance</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does this one work, but it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have read all the reviews of Body Brilliance and knew that this deodorant was worth a try.</li>
            <li> every 8-12 hours just to stay optimally fresh.</li>
            <li> how well it works, it is also an all natural product which I love.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s rating system wins again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s chemical free and actually works.</li>
            <li> Wonderful alternative to the barrage of unhealthy stick or spray deodorants found in the marketplace.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, so I&#x27;m not worried about baby, and it keeps my pits smelling light and fresh!</li>
            <li> It does start to wear after 8-12 hours, but I&#x27;m still very happy with it, and I have about half the bottle left after 3 months of 2-3 sprays on each armpit per day.</li>
            <li> More natural than most, NO aluminum and actually works.  </li>
            <li> And he&#x27;s not wrong.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t always get me through the day when it&#x27;s really hot in Texas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This spray is healthier than most and I give it only 4 stars because of scent.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not selling anything more than a blend of essential oils here.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at the recommendation of a friend and it&#x27;s the first time</li>
            <li> When I first got it and smelled it, I wondered if it would be too &amp;#34;piney&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My current bottle seems to be lasting a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I tried the deodorant and I can say that it works very well, better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and that it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I tried Body Brilliance deodorant and worked through some intense phone calls, highly stressful and was amazed at how fresh I as at 11 that night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that it had to have been burning everyone else&#x27;s noses too.</li>
            <li> So the third day I thought could I really be odor free with one squirt?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very well, and I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> She really, really likes this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Body brillance has absolutely changed all of that for me..</li>
            <li> Thanks to he creators of Body Brilliance.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works -</li>
            <li> I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> As an athlete who sweats a lot teaching classes, I need a deodorant that really works...and keeps working.</li>
            <li> this product really works</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not kidding, my husband literally curls up to me and wants to smell my pits.</li>
            <li> I really felt like I had to choose between a deodorant that is harmful for me or the harm I was doing to everyone else around me as the day progressed.  </li>
            <li> The label has a &amp;#34;smooth satin&amp;#34; feel to it that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> live in Washington DC where its been humid and hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ok deodorant for summer, I have had to reapply after every 4 hours or so in extreme heat.</li>
            <li> if you value keeping your body clear of the toxins found in conventional deodorants) and even the label is nice.</li>
            <li> I sweat A LOT and the true test was wearing it to my incredibly intense cardio workout last week.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would have tried this but for the substantial discount I was given in return for an honest review, but I believe I will buy another bottle of this for when I do need deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely pay the full price for this any day.</li>
            <li> First natural deodorant that has sustained and</li>
            <li> I keep getting the slight whiff of it and each time think it smells so sophisticated, like a beautiful expensive perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many different natural deodorants and this is the first one that actually worked.</li>
            <li> The packaging says its Spa Quality which oddly makes me feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself. :-)  </li>
            <li> I would have been inclined to add another star if there was more Sandalwood and or Patchouli and less of that piny, woodsy, tea tree oil smell to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a well balanced mix that seems to work particularly well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that is concerned about what they put on or in their bodies but also refuse to be or raise the &amp;#34;Smelly kid in class&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days and the smell is very light.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Here is the hard truth, I still get kind of smelly by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I really like that this deodorant is all natural, and I dint have to worry about any chemicals it metals seeping into my body like the majority of store bought deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Until Body Brilliance, I gave up on finding something that was natural and really worked.  </li>
            <li> I know that aluminum that&#x27;s in most deodorants is deadly...</li>
            <li> Smell is a little different, but I can get used to it, if it is this effective.</li>
            <li> none of them did the trick, they were either too sticky, not strong enough, or they made me sweat more!</li>
            <li> The pleasant scent stays with you for awhile, but the protection works hard all day long.  </li>
            <li> However this a larger than usual spray bottle so would have been worth the money if only I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> decided to try this because of the other reviews and sure enough...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay a premium for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> It does settle down a little bit after a short while, until perspiration appears and the scent is more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Given the differences in body chemistry for everyone, perhaps it won&#x27;t be a strong scent for others.</li>
            <li> It is free of aluminum products and can be used just like any typical deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I have always had a problem staying dry and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Previous natural deodorants did not last more than 2 hours for me.</li>
            <li> I get that this is supposed to be natural</li>
            <li> I will try to spray this on my 6 year old sons feet as his feet tends to sweat a lot and get stinky and see how that works</li>
            <li> I will see how far this will go.</li>
            <li> I tried all the natural ones, toms, arm and hammer, jasons natural...</li>
            <li> natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I understand that the natural stuff cannot compare to the anti-perpirants in effectiveness.</li>
            <li> So, wildly overpriced considering its ineffectiveness.  </li>
            <li> We have cancer in our family so we are all trying to go natural</li>
            <li> This one far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all natural products before and they were ineffective for me.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really keeps my dry.</li>
            <li> I am conscious about the dangers of regular deodorants and have been using a natural deodorant for years.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone, male or female.  </li>
            <li> This is all natural and is scented with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Chicago weather so far, last month since I started wearing).</li>
            <li> I find the smell a little much at first</li>
            <li> Been using for a few days and works very well!</li>
            <li> Well, if you&#x27;re REALLY and TRULY serious about not smelling like strong nasty pit odor, and you&#x27;re serious about being in command of your health, do some research on how to naturally minimize it so you can use this deodorant more effectively.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really smell much, but sometimes get a little sticky and smell a little if the weather changes suddenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and they leave you smelling &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ie sweaty.</li>
            <li> I have used other natural solids</li>
            <li> But I had no odor which surprised me because the all natural deodorants I have used in the past have not worked so well.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t vouch for how long it lasts since I typically only have it on about an for 60 min.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that is natural and with less chemicals, this is the spray for you.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how even at a time when I was sure I would have stinky pits, there was zero body odor!</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t afraid to wear a dressy top.  </li>
            <li> (I have used all natural deodorants in the past that left a greasy film...</li>
            <li> It took a while to dry.  </li>
            <li> At the end of each day I was completely dry under my armpits.</li>
            <li> Body brilliance keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but its true..</li>
            <li> I was not really sure about buying a deoderant that is so expensive when i can get a basic brand in store that works fine.  </li>
            <li> And he is a rough and tumbly boy with sweaty, stinky feet.  </li>
            <li> so this one product is all you need for everyone in your household, no more buying different products made just for women or just for men.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the effect I was going for.</li>
            <li> And this one does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No allergic reaction, which I have had with other deodorants.</li>
            <li> have been concerned with the toxins in other deodorant for years.</li>
            <li> Note that if you are a heavy perspirer, you may need to reapply during the day, as it specifically says it last for hours...which can be a few hours for some or all day for others.</li>
            <li> I am an Herbalist by trade, but I have a hard time switching over to natural beauty care products because they are usually lacking.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is the scent.</li>
            <li> Expensive price led me to believe this was the real</li>
            <li> Maybe as it calms down throughout the day the scent morphs into what I want, but I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> or less.</li>
            <li> Smell a little like BO?  </li>
            <li> I have found I like to spritz a little on when I come in out of the heat.  </li>
            <li> I will say I was a little hesitant to buy because of the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for deodorant.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy sweater and always self conscious of smelling bad especially after working out.</li>
            <li> To quote my husband: &#x27;oh my god- the whole house stinks like that stuff-</li>
            <li> I may not need to order again until a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret Solid for YEARS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy</li>
            <li> I am a very heavy sweater and am always so self conscious of smelling bad especially after working out.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works, the smell was overpowering and quite medicinal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth unfortunately.</li>
            <li> No more odor problems for me.</li>
            <li> and I have not ha the usually sweaty smell that I get (I know TMI) .  </li>
            <li> I have tried using a all natural deodorant before from a local grocery store and hated the sticky feeling I had al day while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical since natural deodorants never seem to work.</li>
            <li> Too bad as I was hoping for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really that expensive (</li>
            <li> Whether I shake it or leave it for hours - it only sprays once.  :(</li>
            <li> In fact I think I smell worse with this product once a sweat cycle begins.  </li>
            <li> So, unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t used it since.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that nostalgic musky, hippie smell I was hoping for when I bought this.</li>
            <li> It is faint</li>
            <li> And stay the heck away from those nasty chemicals!  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that I don&#x27;t need those nasty ingredients found in products that deter wetness.</li>
            <li> It smells awful.</li>
            <li> And the non-aluminum deodorants I&#x27;ve tried are terrible.</li>
            <li> Yes try it, it works, I was doubtful too!</li>
            <li> Stinks!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I can not get this to SPRAY more than once.  Whether I shake it or leave it for hours - it only sprays once.  :(</li>
            <li> Works amazing! However, when first applied, it smells great, but not long after, it smells VERY STRONGLY like patchouli. To quote my husband: &#x27;oh my god- the whole house stinks like that stuff- it&#x27;s burning my nose&#x27;. And he&#x27;s not wrong. The next day, I was in a meeting and I could smell how strong the deodorant was- I&#x27;m certain that it had to have been burning everyone else&#x27;s noses too. But again the deodorant itself works GREAT! I was shocked at how even at a time when I was sure I would have stinky pits, there was zero body odor! So if you don&#x27;t mind the patchouli smell, definitely buy this!</li>
            <li> I find the smell a little much at first but once it settles in, it&#x27;s fine.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to reapply it and I&#x27;m not stinky at the end of the day.  Not sure I would have tried this but for the substantial discount I was given in return for an honest review, but I believe I will buy another bottle of this for when I do need deodorant.  I try not to wear deodorant or antiperspirants but sometimes it&#x27;s a necessity if you&#x27;re going to be out in public.  :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn deodorant in over a year because I was pregnant and now in nursing. I don&#x27;t really smell much, but sometimes get a little sticky and smell a little if the weather changes suddenly. I tried this deodorant on a whim and love it! It&#x27;s all natural, so I&#x27;m not worried about baby, and it keeps my pits smelling light and fresh!</li>
            <li> I really like that this deodorant is all natural, and I dint have to worry about any chemicals it metals seeping into my body like the majority of store bought deodorants.  My issue with this deodorant, though, is that it smelled like dirt when applied.  Maybe it&#x27;s just how it reacts with my body&#x27;s chemistry, but it was incredibly noticeable.  Even my husband asked why it smelled like soil in the house.  So, unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t used it since.  Perhaps others would have better luck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this deoderant.  I purchased it in November and still have plenty left in the bottle.  I love that I feel like I am doing something good for my body while using a product that works so well for me.  It smells great, I get lots of compliments (I don&#x27;t tell them it&#x27;s my deoderant unless they are a good friend!). I was not really sure about buying a deoderant that is so expensive when i can get a basic brand in store that works fine.  I am really happy that I tried it. I have already bought another bottle as a back up  (don&#x27;t want to run out!) and sent some to a friend in Florida!</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works, the smell was overpowering and quite medicinal.  My son tried it and had to take a shower to wash off the smell as it was bothering everyone in the house.  Too bad as I was hoping for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I like this spray. It&#x27;s working very well, and I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  I use it everyday!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the call to see if I liked your product, that was very nice!!</li>
            <li> Ugh no.... I&#x27;m sorry. I get that this is supposed to be natural but I would not want to walk around smelling like this. It states it is &amp;#34;lightly scented&amp;#34; and its NOT. As soon as I opened the top and gave it a whiff I knew that I would not be using this. I will try to spray this on my 6 year old sons feet as his feet tends to sweat a lot and get stinky and see how that works but I will not be using it under my arms or anywhere else on my body.</li>
            <li> Sure stoops the offensive odor even after a workout...</li>
            <li> Got this today and used it today. Works well. This is all natural and is scented with essential oils. It is free of aluminum products and can be used just like any typical deodorant. It can also be used on your feet. Note that if you are a heavy perspirer, you may need to reapply during the day, as it specifically says it last for hours...which can be a few hours for some or all day for others. If you are looking for something that is natural and with less chemicals, this is the spray for you. Also note, that even though this has some anti bacterial properties, it is not an anti perspirant. and for most people, deodorant without anti perspirant is not as effective. I do not perspire a lot so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I bought this for my mom.  She&#x27;s a cancer survivor and does her best to stay as natural in all things as possible.  She really, really likes this deodorant.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do just fine. :)</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and it works great no odor. It has a earthy smell to it but doesn&#x27;t stay with you. Great all natural product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this deodorant....It is absolutely the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried ever.  It has me smelling great, it lasts all day, and does not leave any chalky film on my clothes. I am so excited I was able to receive this at a discount for my preview of this. I would definitely pay the full price for this any day. I will be ordering again as soon as I need it. My current bottle seems to be lasting a good amount of time. I may not need to order again until a few months. I will see how far this will go. Thanks for making a great product that has me smelling great throughout my day. Previous natural deodorants did not last more than 2 hours for me.</li>
            <li> OMG I have to write a FULL review on this as I think others will find my experience helpful when considering this product.  The first day I went spray happy and used to much.  It took a while to dry.  (Totally user error).  But I had no odor which surprised me because the all natural deodorants I have used in the past have not worked so well.  The second day I did 2 squirts and it dried MUCH faster.  Still no odor and I wasn&#x27;t afraid to wear a dressy top.  (I have used all natural deodorants in the past that left a greasy film...YUCK).  So the third day I thought could I really be odor free with one squirt?  And the answer to my surprise was yes.  No nasty chemicals, a clean subtle scent (I like to smell good), no greasy stain on my clothes, YES, YES, AND YES!!  So this maybe boarder line TMI but my youngest son refuses to wear socks with his spider man shoes.  And he is a rough and tumbly boy with sweaty, stinky feet.  I gave his feet a squirt of the Body Brilliance spray and it worked so well even his shoes smell better.  Not even sure how that happened.  My skin feels fresh and clean even on those mornings that my shower gets delayed until afternoon.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that is concerned about what they put on or in their bodies but also refuse to be or raise the &amp;#34;Smelly kid in class&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great on a hot day or any other. Smells wonderful &amp; is non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I stopped using deodorant several years ago when I learned of the harmful effects of parabens. I tried all the natural ones, toms, arm and hammer, jasons natural... They all sucked for one reason or another... none of them did the trick, they were either too sticky, not strong enough, or they made me sweat more! Body brillance has absolutely changed all of that for me.. Its a spray that absorbs quickly so I can put on my shirt right away and not worry about stains, and it works so well and smells so nice that my boyfriend loves licking my pits.. TMI, I know. Sorry, but its true.. Now hes using it also.  ;-0</li>
            <li> Hi, I&#x27;m a skeptic!&lt;br /&gt;I know the risk to my health using deodorants laced with harmful chemicals. I have tried using a all natural deodorant before from a local grocery store and hated the sticky feeling I had al day while wearing it. I have read all the reviews of Body Brilliance and knew that this deodorant was worth a try. Another reviewer mentioned a &amp;#34;musk smell&amp;#34; I have to disagree and say it&#x27;s more like fresh pine. Everyone&#x27;s nose is different but, I enjoy the scent of body brilliance and even the non-sticky feeling it provides. I do suggest re-applying it every 8-12 hours just to stay optimally fresh. I did test it out and ask several people I work with and my husband...... They all enjoyed the scent. ;) I am very satisfied with the body brilliance deodorant and now have a new found respect for my health. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love Body Brilliance deodorant spray.  It was recommended to me by a family member who has used it for years.  I love working out in my yard and I have always had a problem staying dry and fresh.  I received Body Brilliance on Thursday and two days later, I was on our tractor mowing the five acres around our home. At the end of each day I was completely dry under my armpits. I could not believe how well this product worked.  Body Brilliance deodorant spray will be the only deodorant spray I will be using from now on. I highly recommend this product to anyone, male or female.  The fragrance is one that is pleasing to both men and women so this one product is all you need for everyone in your household, no more buying different products made just for women or just for men. We will be a Body Brilliance deodorant spray household from now on.  On top of the of how well it works, it is also an all natural product which I love.  I hope you give Brody Brilliance a chance, I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
            <li> I was on my last bit of &#x27;tea tree oil based&#x27; deodorant and I was in the mood to try something different because spring and summer is around the corner and my non-aluminum deodorant doesn&#x27;t always get me through the day when it&#x27;s really hot in Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this because of the other reviews and sure enough... Amazon&#x27;s rating system wins again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing... it works like a charm... smells great... and is not harmful.  The packaging says its Spa Quality which oddly makes me feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself. :-)  I agree with another reviewer that this being an Amazon Prime product pushed me over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to you if you like a holistic lifestyle, while smelling great without resorting to using harmful antiperspirants.  Thanks to he creators of Body Brilliance.</li>
            <li> I have received this product at a reduced rate to write an honest review. I have received no instructions and the opinions expressed are my own. I have been using this for a few days and the smell is very light. I love that it&#x27;s chemical free and actually works. I am a heavy sweater and always self conscious of smelling bad especially after working out. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It looks good and I like it. No irritation or itching noted. The only complaint is the scent. At first the scent is very strong and fortunately it fades fast after application. This spray is healthier than most and I give it only 4 stars because of scent.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this because I enjoy the fragrance but I found that on the hottest days it didn&#x27;t work for more than a couple of hours. I have definitely used more effective deodorants and won&#x27;t buy this one again. Also felt like for the price it should have been amazing. I would not recommend this for anyone that ever sweats.</li>
            <li> I guess smelling like patchouli is better than B.O. It does work, but I actually had a co-worker ask me, &amp;#34;Is that you who smells like patchouli and musk?&amp;#34; YIKES! Not exactly the effect I was going for. So ... I&#x27;m still in search of the perfect nontoxic spray-on deodorant.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few days and works very well!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works - I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and they leave you smelling &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ie sweaty. This one has a nice herbal smell and keeps me smelling pleasant even in the Texas heat.&lt;br /&gt;The pump sprayer gives you many applications at just the right amount so on a cost per application basis it&#x27;s not really that expensive (if you value keeping your body clear of the toxins found in conventional deodorants) and even the label is nice.</li>
            <li> 1. Looking to cut carcinogens out of my life. Looked for all natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Read reviews. This spray was the best-rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Expensive price led me to believe this was the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Product smelled of lavender and pine, I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. My kids said, \\&quot;something stinks,\\&quot; after I sprayed it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I was throughly dissapointed because it DOES tend to wear off throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. I smelled like musk, and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. It needs to be re-applied throughout the day for effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Did not pass the gym test. I smelled musky afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. It performed just as well as Tom of Maine Lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nut shell, I understand that the natural stuff cannot compare to the anti-perpirants in effectiveness. I understand everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, however, upon reading the reviews I THOUGHT I HAD FOUND THE HOLY GRAIL. NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth unfortunately. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bite the $25 bullet and will return it. I expected more for the price. In the meantime, I&#x27;ll continue my search for a healthier alternative at a more competitive price.</li>
            <li> It definitely works like a deodorant and very effectively. I have 2 complaints though; 1.) the price. C&#x27;Mon! You&#x27;re not selling anything more than a blend of essential oils here. Yes, it smells good but not THAT good. 2.) I would have been inclined to add another star if there was more Sandalwood and or Patchouli and less of that piny, woodsy, tea tree oil smell to it. It&#x27;s pretty strong. I really don&#x27;t mind strong, just not that tree-y woodsy smell. It doesn&#x27;t have that nostalgic musky, hippie smell I was hoping for when I bought this. Maybe as it calms down throughout the day the scent morphs into what I want, but I wouldn&#x27;t know. I have a feeling it doesn&#x27;t. This is NOT patchouli or Sandalwood dominant in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found yet --- and it&#x27;d better be, for the cost. :)  The smell is woodsy and good for a man or a woman.  It isn&#x27;t perfect and everyone has a different biome of bacteria that like living and munching on their sweat (and pooping) on them.  Keep in mind that all kinds of factors influence how you smell --- genetics, what you eat, how much daily exercise you get, etc.  The important thing is to get rid of the aluminum and parabens in mainstream deodorant that are cancer-causing carcinogens and screw up the way your body detoxes itself.  Smell a little like BO?  Well, if you&#x27;re REALLY and TRULY serious about not smelling like strong nasty pit odor, and you&#x27;re serious about being in command of your health, do some research on how to naturally minimize it so you can use this deodorant more effectively.  And stay the heck away from those nasty chemicals!  **December 26, 2015 edit:  It still works great.  It does start to wear after 8-12 hours, but I&#x27;m still very happy with it, and I have about half the bottle left after 3 months of 2-3 sprays on each armpit per day.</li>
            <li> As an athlete who sweats a lot teaching classes, I need a deodorant that really works...and keeps working. And this one does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants but never found one that worked before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like to spray it on my feet, the tea tree is excellent for preventing fungus. I would purchase it just for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a feminine powder scent nor a masculine musk scent - more just fresh and clean. My husband uses it too - how do I know? I always find it on his side of the bathroom counter :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay a premium for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works. I read a number of reviews, and in a moment of weakness, allowed myself to believe that this product was the answer. However, it doesn&#x27;t work, or doesn&#x27;t work for me.  In fact I think I smell worse with this product once a sweat cycle begins.  So, wildly overpriced considering its ineffectiveness.  I just found a JASON product at my local supermarket that does work (!) and for about 1/10th the price.</li>
            <li> We have cancer in our family so we are all trying to go natural this product really works</li>
            <li> This deodorant works for me all day and through the night. I like the fact that I don&#x27;t need those nasty ingredients found in products that deter wetness. For me, the scent is pretty potent when first applied. It does settle down a little bit after a short while, until perspiration appears and the scent is more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Given the differences in body chemistry for everyone, perhaps it won&#x27;t be a strong scent for others.</li>
            <li> Finally, natural deodorant that works and smell amazing.  I&#x27;ve tried several over the last 2-3 years and almost always have to go back to traditional deodorants, because they just don&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this one work, but it smells amazing.  My wife loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus of being an Amazon Prime product was the deal sealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a total winner.</li>
            <li> It smells awful. I bought it because it doesn&#x60;t include harmful chemicals but you might find one which smells nice and doesn&#x27;t&#x60;t include paraben.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deodorant.  More natural than most, NO aluminum and actually works.  Even in 89 degree humid southern heat.  Yes I did make my hubby sniff my pits.  I was VERY skeptical since natural deodorants never seem to work. I have made several, bought several, etc.  I am an Herbalist by trade, but I have a hard time switching over to natural beauty care products because they are usually lacking.  This one far exceeded my expectations.  The scent is light and refreshing lavender.  It is faint so  you don&#x27;t have an overpowering flowery smell.  It is also very cool and refreshing. I have found I like to spritz a little on when I come in out of the heat.  So nice.</li>
            <li> The best, people ask me why I smell so good.......</li>
            <li> Smell is kind of strong, but I like the smell.  Bought it for use after CrossFit for times I need to run to the store before going home and getting a shower.  Works well for that purpose.  Can&#x27;t vouch for how long it lasts since I typically only have it on about an for 60 min. or less.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and works well for my daily deodorant.</li>
            <li> This may work but I personally couldn&#x27;t stand the scent of it</li>
            <li> I love the hints of patchouli, I have a feeling it wont hold up all that well through summer months(cool Chicago weather so far, last month since I started wearing). Regardless a great yet pricey option.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I have ever used. No body order day after day. No allergic reaction, which I have had with other deodorants. Smell is a little different, but I can get used to it, if it is this effective.</li>
            <li> I waited for a few days to post a review because I wanted to be sure this stuff was as good as it seemed. I know that aluminum that&#x27;s in most deodorants is deadly...but I didn&#x27;t want to reek either. And the non-aluminum deodorants I&#x27;ve tried are terrible. Body Brilliance is absolutely phenomenal. I sweat A LOT and the true test was wearing it to my incredibly intense cardio workout last week. Guess what? It passed the test. I love the smell. So clean and fresh, but not overpowering. And I&#x27;m not kidding, my husband literally curls up to me and wants to smell my pits. It&#x27;s not a kinky thing. It just smells that good. I will say I was a little hesitant to buy because of the price. It&#x27;s a little pricey for deodorant. But 1) I don&#x27;t need perfume because I smell clean with this, and 2) my health is worth it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is simply amazing.  I used the same deodorant for yeeeeeaaarrrssss and i neglected to admit when it stopped working for me.  I was a little hesitant to try a natural deodorant, but it&#x27;s the best decision i&#x27;ve made.  It smells so nice, and it lasts throughout the day.  No more odor problems for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days now.  The smell is very light and feminine.  I love that it is chemical free and it actually works. I am a very heavy sweater and am always so self conscious of smelling bad especially after working out.  This deodorant has been great after work outs and I have not ha the usually sweaty smell that I get (I know TMI) .  It goes on easily and dries quickly even though it is a liquid.  Make sure you shake it up before each use as it settles while sitting.</li>
            <li> Best Deodorant on the market! Works great!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but its overwhelming on the patchouli smell, I smell like a hippie.  However this a larger than usual spray bottle so would have been worth the money if only I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> OK, I have to admit I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve tried all natural products before and they were ineffective for me. I&#x27;ve been using Secret Solid for YEARS. I tried this product at the recommendation of a friend and it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve EVER had NO body odor at the end of the day or even first thing in the morning! I just ordered two more bottles after reading you can use it on your feet too! I&#x27;m a bit blown away and think I just converted!</li>
            <li> I am conscious about the dangers of regular deodorants and have been using a natural deodorant for years.  Here is the hard truth, I still get kind of smelly by the end of the day.  Especially if I had a stressed day or exercise vigorously.  My job requires some stressful conversations and that nervous sweat, well it is not so pleasant.  I tried Body Brilliance deodorant and worked through some intense phone calls, highly stressful and was amazed at how fresh I as at 11 that night.  It actually lasted all day.  I really felt like I had to choose between a deodorant that is harmful for me or the harm I was doing to everyone else around me as the day progressed.  Until Body Brilliance, I gave up on finding something that was natural and really worked.  The scent is light, it is an easy spray, no nasty residue on your clothes and it totally works.  I am so grateful to Alan Davidson for creating this fantastic product.  Yes try it, it works, I was doubtful too!</li>
            <li> What fabulous product! This deodorant really keeps my dry. I exercise quite a bit and I am a massage therapist. Body brilliance keeps me dry all day. The smell is great. It&#x27;s not too heavy it is light, fresh &amp; airy. I will buy more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I have been concerned with the toxins in other deodorant for years. I have used other natural solids but they don&#x27;t work. This works! Yay!!! The spray is easy to use &amp; feels good going on.</li>
            <li> I tried the deodorant and I can say that it works very well, better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and that it is easy to apply.  However, the scent is too strong for me.  Have you tried formulating a deodorant without the patchouli?</li>
            <li> My husband and I are switching to all mom toxic products and I found this spray which we both can use. We love it. Just remember to shake it up real well or the patchouli note come out strong!</li>
            <li> This is my first review after all these years of shopping on Amazon! I was moved to leave this comment because Body Brilliance Deodorant is, well, brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase as I totally love this product. Both my wife and I use it. The natural ingredients are wonderful and are definitely &amp;#34;spa quality&amp;#34; as the label says. I&#x27;m not as knowledgeable about essential oils as my wife, but am happy they meet with her approval. She&#x27;s particularly impressed with the inclusion of lavandin, spanish sage, patchouli, cajeput and lemon peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the oil that jumps out is pine needle. When I first got it and smelled it, I wondered if it would be too &amp;#34;piney&amp;#34;. But, after using, it, I can report that it&#x27;s not at all too strong. It&#x27;s a well balanced mix that seems to work particularly well with my body chemistry. The label says &amp;#34; a lightly scented deodorant&amp;#34; and I agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a liquid spray in a 4.46 fl oz plastic bottle with a spray pump and cap. I&#x27;ll see if I can upload a picture. The bottle feels great in my hand. I&#x27;m a very tactile person and like it when a product feels nice. The label has a &amp;#34;smooth satin&amp;#34; feel to it that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite &amp;#34;go for it&amp;#34; in my book!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different natural deodorants and this is the first one that actually worked. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> Hard to fine a good natural deodorant ... better than most.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome product. I am going to order tons more and give as presents to friends and family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Washington DC where its been humid and hot. I&#x27;ve also worn polyester tops (sweat breading ground) and believe me when I 100% confirm that I have not been sweating at all. What&#x27;s even more amazing is the smell!  I keep getting the slight whiff of it and each time think it smells so sophisticated, like a beautiful expensive perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love and forever grateful!! If its true what it says on the packet about being 100% natural, this thing is better than sliced bread :-)</li>
            <li> Great product. First natural deodorant that has sustained and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Great essential oil based, I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ok deodorant for summer, I have had to reapply after every 4 hours or so in extreme heat. The pump doesn&#x27;t work too well hence 3 stars but it smells spicy nice.</li>
            <li> Stinks!!! Not for me..i thought this will be a good one since it has a lot of good reviews. I should have listened to the reviewers who gave this product a 1 star</li>
            <li> Wonderful alternative to the barrage of unhealthy stick or spray deodorants found in the marketplace.  Have used this as my primary deodorant since its introduction and am very, very pleased.  The pleasant scent stays with you for awhile, but the protection works hard all day long.  Highly recommend.</li>
