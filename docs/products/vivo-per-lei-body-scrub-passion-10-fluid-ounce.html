            <li>All of the flavors are good.</li>
            <li>While this product smells good and feels good on skin, it leaves a greasy residue in the shower.</li>
            <li>If you have never tried any of the Vivo products be sure and give this one a try!</li>
            <li>The product does a nice job of exfoliating my skin.  </li>
            <li>the smell was nice</li>
            <li>love body scrubs, but this one is exceptional.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful not over powering and it leaves your skin silky soft.</li>

            <li>Feels so good, and clean.</li>
            <li>love how my skin feels when I finish my shower, very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I purhased while on vacation for much more, I thought this was a bargain at amazon</li>
            <li>wish I had bought more jars.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the scrub is fantastic, though!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product would get it again .</li>
            <li>The price of this product at the mall was very high, so I was delighted to see it on Amazon&#x27;s site for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>The salt scrub felt great on my winter-parched skin and helped keep it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The salt on your body is kind of rough, but the results leave your skin feeling smooth and smelling very nice.</li>
            <li>its worth it!</li>
            <li>Does leave the skin a bit \\&quot;oily\\&quot; for a little bit, but when your skin finishes absorbing  it, you will be even softer and wonderful smelling all day!!</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>It really made me skin feel nice and soft and</li>
            <li>I bought two jars and will be back for more.</li>
            <li>My first time buying this product, it was sealed and delivered pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is like heaven and just pure.</li>
            <li>This product really help soften your skin.</li>

            <li>I enjoy this product very much, make my skin feel so soft and the smell lasts a big part of the day.</li>
            <li>Yes, my hands were soft and moisturized, however I was charged an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;First he said the normal price for the scrub was $99.  </li>
            <li>Than the soft skin and renewed feeling is the topper on the cake!</li>
            <li>Just shake it up a little bit before use so the oils are mixed better with the salt.</li>
            <li>I always have a few extra jars around just in case something special comes along.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be so soft and the smell is terrific.</li>

            <li> I purhased while on vacation for much more, I thought this was a bargain at amazon and I think it is one the of the best sea salts I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I began to use this product.  It was clumpy and sticky.  Other products from this line have been satisfactory.  I wish I could say the same for this one.</li>
            <li> Because it was badly packaged and it lost most of the moisture, t does not leave my skin as soft as when I tried it in the demo.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> you want to make people turn heads as you pass them? This stuff is like heaven and just pure. Feels so good, and clean. i have skin problems. it doesnt effect any of my other creams. its worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! wish I had bought more jars.  Smells wonderful not over powering and it leaves your skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> This product really help soften your skin. I use this product every 2 weeks or once a month. All of the flavors are good. Great product for your money. Don&#x27;t buy in the mall!</li>
            <li> I was accosted by a rep at a kiosk in the mall.  I went through a demonstration on my hands with water, salt scrub, rinse then a dab of body butter.  Yes, my hands were soft and moisturized, however I was charged an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;First he said the normal price for the scrub was $99.  Then he said the holiday sale was $59.99.  Followed by a &#x27;deal&#x27; of one 9.8 oz salt scrub - Passion and 9.6 oz body butter Passion for $120.  Then he asked if I know of someone that would use the product, I said, &amp;#34;Yes, my mother&amp;#34;.  So, he sort of whispered (away from his manager) that he would do 2 salts and 1 body butter for $120.  I was such a sucker, but also wanted a &#x27;deal&#x27; so I asked for 2 salts and 2 butters for $120, which I got.  Short of it is, if you are going to buy these products, buy from Amazon.  As they are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> My first time buying this product, it was sealed and delivered pretty fast.  The only thing i didn&#x27;t like is that although it was sealed it did leak into the box, but oil still remainined with the salt so im not upset.  The salt on your body is kind of rough, but the results leave your skin feeling smooth and smelling very nice.</li>
            <li> The product does a nice job of exfoliating my skin.  My skin feels soft and smells wonderful after using the scuba.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and is a great gift for your friends when not using it for yourself. I always have a few extra jars around just in case something special comes along. Never can have enough Vivo !!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product very much, make my skin feel so soft and the smell lasts a big part of the day. The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at a kiosk at a local mall, along with the matching body butter. The salt scrub felt great on my winter-parched skin and helped keep it smooth and soft. The price of this product at the mall was very high, so I was delighted to see it on Amazon&#x27;s site for a fraction of the price. I bought two jars and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I like this product, my face feels softer and it makes my face look softer.  I really like the price compared to the MALL.</li>
            <li> While this product smells good and feels good on skin, it leaves a greasy residue in the shower. Its slippery and hard to clean. I wont use it anymore, already threw it away.</li>
            <li> great !&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s scrubs really well&lt;br /&gt;I recommand</li>
            <li> This would have been a wonderful product had it not leaked on the way to my house. The oils in the jar leaked out during shipping, and got on the other 2 things in my order- one being a flag which now has a big oil stain on it. The smell of the scrub is fantastic, though!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product would get it again . It really made me skin feel nice and soft and the smell was nice</li>
            <li> This is so wonderful...a treat to myself after a long day! Your skin will be so soft and the smell is terrific. If you have never tried any of the Vivo products be sure and give this one a try! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The smell alone does it for me! Than the soft skin and renewed feeling is the topper on the cake! Does leave the skin a bit \\&quot;oily\\&quot; for a little bit, but when your skin finishes absorbing  it, you will be even softer and wonderful smelling all day!! Just shake it up a little bit before use so the oils are mixed better with the salt.</li>
            <li> love body scrubs, but this one is exceptional.  love how my skin feels when I finish my shower, very smooth and silky.</li>
