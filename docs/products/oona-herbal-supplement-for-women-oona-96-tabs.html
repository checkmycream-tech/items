            <li>I started taking it last fall when my hot flashes started.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was having multiple hot flashes throughout the day and night and was hesitant to use hormone therapy. My doctor suggested that I research herbal supplements and that&#x27;s how I found this product. I am writing this review because it worked so well for me! After 2 weeks taken as indicated on the package (6/day), I was still having hot flashes but they were not coming as often or lasting as long. I went ahead and started the maintenance dosage because of the cost of the product (3/day). After one month using the product faithfully, I am no longer having hot flashes at all. I never thought this would be possible! I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with hot flashes.</li>
            <li> good for some, not for me.  I&#x27;ve has much better success by rubbing peppermint oil on the back of my neck</li>
            <li> I am 56 and have been experiencing nuclear hot flashes day and night (worse at night) for a few years now.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products without success and was becoming tired and frustrated.  I was to the point where if hrt wasn&#x27;t so dangerous I would have taken it. I saw this product, and though skeptical decided to try it out of desperation even if it meant only getting a small amount of relief, it was better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking the product according to the directions, and I must say that in a short amount of time the hot flashes subsided substantially.  I still get them, but they are not as severe and I don&#x27;t get them as often.  I am sleeping much better at night which means less irritability during the day.  There are no miracle cures for hot flashes, but this product has made coping with them much easier.</li>
            <li> It cut the symptoms down to about 90% for me! Barely, have hot flashes, no more headaches!  It truly works!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this for perimenopause symptoms (I am 43):  restless sleep/insomnia, hot flashes at night (no sweat - just felt like I was burning from the inside out), daily headaches, unexplained muscle and joint pain all over for no reason, foggy thinking, irritability/mood swings and depression, and irregular periods with spotting and cramping all month long.  Have been on it a week now (2 pills, 3x a day) and feel fantastic.  Sleeping through the night, happier, less edgy and irritable (no longer want to clobber people all day, every day), and the body and joint aches have toned WAY down.  Just feel unexplainably better, almost like feeling lighter because I am not weighed down with muscle pain, headaches and irritability.  Will remain to be seen if it helps the PMS symptoms, but I have not had any cramping or spotting so bonus there.  And it helps so much with the other problems I don&#x27;t even care about PMS!  So in conclusion, I highly recommend this product!  I will sail on into menopause with it by my side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. Great for hot flashes. I recommend</li>
            <li> This product works for severe hot flashes, but I also am taking a Natural Hormone, and together I am getting the relief I need.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything herbal under the sun and finally went to an alternative healer to learn about this product.  I am so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;An emergency hysterectomy forced me to be on hormones and I have been on them for years, increasing my risk for breast cancer.  I have tried weaning myself off of them to no avail because the hot flashes are so severe I can only go a few days off it it.  So I tried this product with immediate positive results! I will never have to take the horrible hormones again!  Thank you to the makers of this product because you help many women like myself that are forced to take replacements that are very risky!</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for about 1month and so far so good.  It did take about 10days for results but it was worth the wait.  My menopause symptoms have reduced greatly.  Although they are not completely gone, they are at a bare minimum.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m of the age when these things happen.  A friend recommended these for the flashes and after taking these as directed (it&#x27;s been three weeks now) the flashes are still there but are fewer and lighter in intensity.</li>
            <li> This product works great!  Eliminated my hot flashes and helped with mood swings.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from menopause.  Much better than anything you doctor will prescribe.</li>
            <li> I noticed fewer hot flashes, night sweats and even dizzy spells after taking Oona,  Now I&#x27;m just taking maintenance dose (1 tablet 3x a day) and it still works.</li>
            <li> This takes a while to get into your system and must be taken regularly once you build it up in your system, but it is one of the things that works to keep my hot flashes down to a bare minimum. I have multiple severe hot flashes 24 hours a day with multiple triggers. These help keep me sane.</li>
            <li> Hard to remember to take three times a day. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well for me along with bioidentical projesterone creme. I just couldn&#x27;t keep up the expense of both of them monthly. Sure wish I could have.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical but after suffering hot flashes every hour day and night my friend suggested I try this. Within a week I was sleeping again and no longer breaking into sweats. If I have a hot flash it is very mild and passes quickly.</li>
            <li> It may be a combination of things I am using that are helping with the hot flashes.  Seems to be a good product.  I will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> As the instructions suggest, it took a while for me to start feeling improvement. After about 3 weeks taking as directed (the &amp;#34;loading&amp;#34; dose, not the maintenance dose), hot flashes are fewer and less intense, and my sleep has improved noticeably. Still not like before, but definitely better. I prefer to use this before I go for HRT. I&#x27;m happy with how this is working so far, so I&#x27;ll be sticking with it.</li>
            <li> I found this product very effective in minimizing the hot flashes, night sweats and thinning tissues.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend and I have had great results with Oona. My hot flashes were severe and quite embar-rassing. So,I did a salvia test from ZRT labs to find out what hormones I was low in and the test showed I was low in progesterone.&lt;br /&gt; I supplement 2( 4- 20 mg packets) times a day with Emerita Progest and take 2 tables of Onna 3 times a day. I take Oona like my&lt;br /&gt;life depended on it and it  has decreased my hot flashes immensely.</li>
            <li> I am having Far fewer hot flashes now. What a relief. I only take two in the morning and it works.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product as directed for two weeks and still suffer from headaches, hot flashes, night sweats and everything else - It has made no difference. I will continue to use this product until it runs out, but I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Oona is worth every cent.  I started taking it last fall when my hot flashes started.  I started with the recommended dose and now have continued taking it twice a day, every day for the last 8 months!  My hot flashes have quit and I am feeling much more even with my moods and stress level.  I recommend it HIGHLY!!!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to believe that this would reduce my hot flashes which were quite severe but it does. In fact, I feel the difference between taking 2-3 a day (which still leaves room for some mild hot flashes) or 4-5 a day (where I basically have no hot flashes). It doesn&#x27;t work instantly though, it takes a few days to see the effect. I&#x27;m so glad I found this - I didn&#x27;t want to use any prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> I used to burst into invisible flames about every 3-5 minutes.  There are fans on my desk, in my kitchen, bathroom and every where that I&#x27;d go, including the fold out fan that goes from handbag to handbag. I did not  want to take any prescription medicine, so I did some research and decided that I&#x27;d try Oona. Well, jackpot! Once you take Oona as prescribed, it works wonders. This supplement must stay in your system for maximum results. I found that out the hard way.  I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again.</li>
