            <li>I love Essie &amp; I always try to buy the mini cubes before each season!</li>

            <li>The colors are great and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I liked the colors.</li>
            <li>I have always been OPI fan- love</li>
            <li>but the colors are cute.</li>
            <li>Granddaughters really enjoyed the polish.  </li>
            <li>Great that you get mini bottles of the new Spring 2013 collection.  </li>
            <li>Great for spring and nice to have the mini-bottles to sample different colors before buying the full size bottle.</li>
            <li>Even my husband, who normally doesn&#x27;t give a lick about the polishes I use, made the comment of how good it looked when I was trying them.</li>
            <li>These polishes go on smooth and coverage</li>
            <li>Great colors, let&#x27;s you try out these colors to see if you want the larger bottles when they come out.</li>
            <li>&amp; I just cant say enough good things about Essie polish:)</li>
            <li>These have held up okay, good formula with only two coats needed for full coverage.</li>
            <li>very hot right now for sring color!!</li>
            <li>The polish went on smooth, lasted long (especially when paired with their Good to Go Rapid Dry Top Coat), and it looks great!  </li>
            <li>I also loved trying them first and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I love that you can have a selection of colors, but not the full size ones, which never seem to get used up before they dry out.  </li>
            <li>The color is fresh and very spring-like</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Avenue Maintain&amp;#34; another one in the set is an okay blue not too much of a fan of it.</li>
            <li>The colors are perfect for little girls and the bottles are small enough for her to handle on her own.</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I can use these colors for a whole season and use them.</li>
            <li>The polishes start chipping really fast</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like Essie polish (chips so fast!)</li>
            <li>The purple and the light pink are almost identical in shade though.</li>
            <li>But that is normal with a lot of polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smaller bottles are nice since I won&#x27;t use them over and over but a few times.</li>
            <li>The purples are pretty similar.</li>
            <li>Essie is by far one of my favourite.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brand names on a regular basis but i always go back to Essie.</li>
            <li>i really like all the pink colors.</li>
            <li>I use only two of them the pink and lavender because two of the lavender are pretty much same colors!!</li>

            <li> All of the colors are very appealing to me. I also loved trying them first and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> As always, loves Essie!! Great for spring and nice to have the mini-bottles to sample different colors before buying the full size bottle.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t opened it up yet, but I was impressed by the price. I went to target and bought about the same thing instead it was 5 nail polishes for 15 bucks. I perfer amazons price</li>
            <li> Big girls wear Essie polish so since my daughter turned 8 on Christmas day, I figured she should have big girl polish.  The colors are perfect for little girls and the bottles are small enough for her to handle on her own.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish. I usually only use OPI but I saw this collection and had to get it because of the colors. The colors are great and it goes on smoothly. Sometimes I can get a little messy putting nail polish on but something about this nail polish makes me seem like a pro. It&#x27;s not too thick or too thin although you might wanna do the usual two coats.</li>
            <li> perfect for the summer time and I also don&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m wasting nail polish when I dont use it over a year. I can use these colors for a whole season and use them. Also my friend went with 2 for herself.... not to happy about that</li>
            <li> i really like all the pink colors. not a super big fan of the dark blue but the essie cubes are always a hit for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with Essie ever since I discovered the brand. Being a nail art enthusiast, I&#x27;m always looking for nail polish brands that work. Essie is by far one of my favourite. This mini collection, among a few others, didn&#x27;t fail to deliver. The polish went on smooth, lasted long (especially when paired with their Good to Go Rapid Dry Top Coat), and it looks great!  Even my husband, who normally doesn&#x27;t give a lick about the polishes I use, made the comment of how good it looked when I was trying them. I think I had to maybe use 2 coats for some. But that is normal with a lot of polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like Essie polish (chips so fast!) but I wanted these colors and couldn&#x27;t find anything comparable in OPI. These have held up okay, good formula with only two coats needed for full coverage. The smaller bottles are nice since I won&#x27;t use them over and over but a few times. The purples are pretty similar. The pink has a little shimmer to it but not too noticeable. It was a good purchase and I would recommend the colors and the Mini Cube set.</li>
            <li> Looks like easter eggs- I have always been OPI fan- love this Essie polish it goes on well and stays on!</li>
            <li> I love Essie &amp; I always try to buy the mini cubes before each season! These are awesome colors...very hot right now for sring color!! Essie stays on top of the lastest fashion &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; colors!! The polish goes on like a dream &amp; I just cant say enough good things about Essie polish:) Very Happy with purchase!!</li>
            <li> I liked the colors. This is the second Essie ordered that is too thick. The polish hard to put on.  The Essie I buy local Walmarts and Walgreens does not have this proplem. I will not purchase Essie nail police online again.</li>
            <li> All these Essie colors are great but, GO GINZA is just perfect for spring and summer!  These polishes go on smooth and coverage is great.</li>
            <li> Very good product and nice colors. There is no chipping with this product and the colors last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I love collecting nail polishes and this is the best; you get more than one and the perfect size so if you don&#x27;t use often, they will not be drying out or getting this any time soon. Looking forward to my next Cube!</li>
            <li> good quality, good size. i liked all the colors, and though I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, the ones I have used have a great quality</li>
            <li> The color is fresh and very spring-like and I bought it for my friend as a gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> The polishes start chipping really fast but the colors are cute. The purple and the light pink are almost identical in shade though.</li>
            <li> wonderful!!!! Great price, the polish is good. There is no problem with this product. Great colors too. I loved the selection.</li>
            <li> Colors are not the greatest ! I use only two of them the pink and lavender because two of the lavender are pretty much same colors!!</li>
            <li> Great that you get mini bottles of the new Spring 2013 collection.  Great colors, let&#x27;s you try out these colors to see if you want the larger bottles when they come out.</li>
            <li> Granddaughters really enjoyed the polish.  I would tell family and friends about this product. The polish was all I expected&lt;br /&gt;and more!</li>
            <li> I have several of the Essie Mini Cubes.  I love that you can have a selection of colors, but not the full size ones, which never seem to get used up before they dry out.  The colors in this set are great for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> Excellent products! I have tried many other brand names on a regular basis but i always go back to Essie. I love the colors!</li>
            <li> These bottles are mini sized. But im a fan of essie, they have good quality nail polish. The &amp;#34;Madison ave-hue&amp;#34; is a magenta with glitter inside. &amp;#34;Avenue Maintain&amp;#34; another one in the set is an okay blue not too much of a fan of it.</li>
