            <li>I LOVE THIS COLOR!</li>
            <li>I just love the color!</li>
            <li>I used it as my first color to put on my own nails, and it stayed on great!</li>
            <li>But it would be nice to know what shade to expect before spending that amount of money on a color.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice color.</li>
            <li>so I can do my own nails at home and save some money.</li>
            <li>The color is nice...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of coral ,so it can swing both ways and go with outfits that range from pinks to warmer</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this product and my whole purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice color though.  </li>
            <li>I own about 35 Gelish colors.</li>
            <li>I really liked the color.  </li>
            <li>Gotta have nicely painted nails when I visit my husband!(he&#x27;s stationed there with the Navy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS, I have fair skin, and I love it with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>A nice color for spring or summer.</li>
            <li>I love to wear pinks and this is a great color because it&#x27;s not too bright, but just the perfect shade of pink.</li>
            <li>New to using gel nail polishs and would like you to know that this color looks awesome on my nails.</li>
            <li>VERY fast shipping - loved the vendor!</li>
            <li>Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li>Love it in my opinion all this gellish are amazing the color is perrrfect to do some nails and rock that hand of yours ,, thank you</li>
            <li>the colour, it is an awesome bright pink and colour lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a BRIGHT pink and perfect for summer :)</li>
            <li>Not bad for toes, but too bright for fingers, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Izzy wizzy lets get busy on top of passion and its perfect :) I am in love :)</li>
            <li>Luckily it has good coverage</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was good quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more colors.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>If my daughter hadn&#x27;t already had a system, I wouldn&#x27;t know to wipe the top coat with 99% alcohol after drying.</li>
            <li>All of a sudden, it&#x27;s a perfect manicure.</li>
            <li>Without the alcohol, the top coat is sticky.</li>
            <li>I was also concerned because the coats of polish were tacky after drying, but that is resolved with the top coat.</li>
            <li>I love the gelish product line, but this color is not represented well in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Love that the polish lasts approx.</li>
            <li>I love the gelish polish line...and just ordered this color to add to my collection.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a coral/pink as that is the color shown on the Gelish website, but there was not a hint of coral in mine.  </li>
            <li>I love the Gelish products for the quality, value and variety of colors.</li>
            <li>more more words.</li>
            <li>This entire Gelish line is so awesome!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li>Much better buy on Amazon, than at Sally Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li>Love the color, love Gelish.  </li>
            <li>and this is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Gelish Foundation, Gelish Nail Color in Passion, and Shellac Top Coat (a lot of reviews</li>
            <li>online say this top coat is easier to remove than the Gelish topcoat), and some 91% rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I just bought 2 more colors.  </li>
            <li>I totally love it.</li>
            <li>Even though the reviews warned me, I went ahead and ordered this color in the hope that it was more \\&quot;coral\\&quot; than \\&quot;pink.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>love gelish</li>
            <li>4weeks plus! cute color</li>
            <li>Get a lot more for your money.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will deff be buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>I love being able to use the gel nail polish at home.</li>
            <li>Love this polish, nothing compares to gelish nail polish.</li>
            <li>I LOVE gelish -</li>
            <li>Will continue to be a gelish customer for pedicures until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I chose this color...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it cuz I love the color for summer.</li>
            <li>Love this gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li>the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  </li>
            <li>It cures in around 1 minuter with my UV lamp, but I prefer to do it in 2 just in case :).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to add some more Gelish to my collection.</li>
            <li>Very pretty corral color- love putting Vegas Nights over it, or just on one nail!</li>
            <li>perfect well more than a month, but when I did a  manicure by myself at home by using this ordered products , which  can able to hold it less than three days.</li>
            <li>Also, it was shipped free and no tax, so I ended up saving more.</li>
            <li>I love the way this polish applies - easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a full size bottle!</li>
            <li>I have other colors that work perfectly but not from this seller.</li>
            <li>Shelac, however cracked and my nails chipped easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so easy to use</li>
            <li>is true to color, just love the uniqueness of the color.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t decide if the color is more pink or coral, but it&#x27;s a beautiful color</li>
            <li>so two coats are just fine.</li>
            <li>Girl\\&quot; but it has more of a bubble gum hot pink tone to it which is perfect for spring and summer!</li>
            <li>I bought the whole Gelish set from Sally Beauty and the polishes are so much more there!</li>
            <li>It will wick up under the skin, and as it grows out you&#x27;ll have a huge ridge.  </li>
            <li>It went on smooth and lasted over 2 weeks without any chips.</li>
            <li>Tried it four times, drying each coat for 30 seconds with LCD uv light.</li>
            <li>The color is a great color since it is a now color and definitely is liked by young and old.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been happy with them, but this one, totally different story.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous spring/summer color.</li>
            <li>I cured this with my UV light for 2 minutes...</li>
            <li>so you get a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>You will require an LED or UV curing light.  </li>
            <li>Love the service and shipping time is fast :) And</li>
            <li>I would characterize the color as a kind of bright, medium pink with a touch of coral.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the Gelish products and am thrilled to say that it does last!  </li>
            <li>This is a beautiful hot pink color maybe a little bit of salmon colored my daughters love it perfect for summer toes</li>
            <li>It looks nice on all skin colors, from fair to dark.</li>
            <li>This color is awesome, super bright yet deep full coverage pink.</li>
            <li>Dense rich color in 2 coats.  </li>
            <li>Had this color first applied at the nail salon to make sure I&#x27;d like it before ordering it.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like this color, but now I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>The company contaced me letting me know that they were replacing the polish for me and giving me a discount on my next bottle...when a company goes this far to be sure their customers are happy with the products they sell you can be sure they will be the first company I go to to buy a product.  </li>
            <li>Great pink for Spring/Summer.  </li>
            <li>This is a great hot pink/coral color terrific for summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gelish for over a year now and have liked all the colors so far.</li>
            <li>Also the color stays true and does not fade.</li>
            <li>Nice for teens but not for an adult woman.</li>
            <li>What sold me on the color was the customer images, especially those who have fair skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice pink color.</li>
            <li>This color is a lot more vibrant than the online picture.</li>
            <li>Repairs are done quickly.</li>
            <li>will recommend the seller and this color to anyone that likes bright/happy kind of fuschia pink if that makes sense. :))</li>
            <li>Real nice color, goes on smooth and not too thick.</li>
            <li>and I am finding I prefer darker more rich colors like hot rod red and the dark brown chocolate best.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty color, though.</li>
            <li>Shipping is very fast!</li>
            <li>It is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Make sure to really clean the nail up near the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>This color is a new favorite.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This is not as bright as I expected.  </li>
            <li>The middle picture of just the circle with the product # is the most accurate.</li>
            <li>The gelish polish is fantastic when applied correctly and is very shiny.</li>
            <li>If you like a candy-coated look, that is bright pink without being neon, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>This color is beautiful when first applied, but after a few days, it looses some of its color.  </li>
            <li>I gave a less than perfect review on this product because the product was not applying properly, it was bubbling up.</li>
            <li>Fast service, true to color.</li>
            <li>It is between a pink and a peach!!&lt;br /&gt;It looks great in light brown and white skin!!</li>
            <li>I love the color, BUT I&#x27;ve never had more trouble with a polish before.  </li>
            <li>a little apprehensive thought the color maybe too bright or shade</li>
            <li>I applied the color  Passion last night and LOVE it</li>
            <li>I have been buying my gel polishes from amazong since Novemember 2011 and will definitely be purchasing from amazon from now on :)</li>
            <li>This color is more of a coral pink than bright pink.  </li>
            <li>However, I am super-excited over the whole gelish line and would recommend anyone get it as it is totally worth the time and money.</li>
            <li>but the product picture is the most accurate, its a very bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li>But still a pretty mani/pedi</li>
            <li>I did my first Gelish manicure with Passion.  </li>
            <li>Love Gelish, Passion is one of several colors I have.</li>
            <li>So much better than regular polish for me.  </li>
            <li>so pretty not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely say the polish is more coral then the color on the screen shows.</li>
            <li>Pretty Pink almost Salmon kind of color at times (depends on the lighting).</li>
            <li>At Sally&#x27;s you&#x27;re paying the same or more and getting a mini size bottle.  </li>
            <li>I find that I redo every 2 weeks, because as my nails grow out, at that point it starts to be pretty noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I think it is pretty close to the picture shown and quite pink in my opinion, but to each their own.</li>
            <li>This is my first gelish color of choice and application, I was</li>
            <li>This was my first gel polish ans was ha&lt;</li>
            <li>Pretty color.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and</li>
            <li>Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
            <li>Passion has looked great and lasted more than two weeks, and I am anxious to try other colors.  </li>
            <li>Stays a long time and many colors to chose from for the summer</li>
            <li>Its more of a hot pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color, more coral pink than what I thought.</li>
            <li>This is one of favorite hot pink colors of gel.</li>
            <li>You have to use a UV light in between coats or they do not dry.</li>
            <li>I love this pink color, its so pretty.</li>
            <li>Not only do I have an amazing gel manicure that will last 14 days, but I don&#x27;t have to shell out the money anymore for one.  </li>
            <li>Passion is very similiar to the color \\&quot;Gossip</li>
            <li>too much time devoted to gel polish</li>
            <li>Still I really like the color itself.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>Fun, playful, and young.</li>
            <li>Probably could have gone longer, but my nails had grown out so much that I removed it myself &amp; tried another color afterward.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like the results I get with Gelish</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for being a five star company who cares about your customers.</li>
            <li>A coral that&#x27;s more on the pink side</li>
            <li>These thicker colors tend to wrinkle or bubble under the light, so you have to do 3 lighter coats as opposed to 2 regular coats.</li>
            <li>Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;However, hopefully it is real Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Passion, because I do know why the nail shop gave me a manicure once a month by using the Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Passion, which can be holden  </li>
            <li>and I felt almost too old to wear it as I think it is more of a teenage girl color.  </li>
            <li>lovely hot pink color!!</li>
            <li>Passion is a true bold pink color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting these products if you are pretty decent at doing nails.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this color so I would have a gel manicure when I go to Japan next month.</li>
            <li>I ordered Gelish Passion along with the base, top coat and a 45 watt UV light to do my own manicures.</li>
            <li>So vibrant</li>
            <li>For the same price, I was able to get this bottle, which is almost twice as big as Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick only 3 days.  </li>
            <li>My husband purchased this color a few months ago with several other gelish colors for me to do my own manicures at home :)</li>
            <li>Unlike most other gel colors one coat is enough unless you want a very vibrant strong pink.</li>
            <li>I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>This color looked more pink in the picture, but the color is a coral color, not pink.</li>
            <li>I have 3 more colors coming, just hope I can wait it out to change colors and let the manicure last as long as it will.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you like pinks - seems to be lasting well</li>
            <li>When mistakes are done they are easy to correct and most of all this color is flashy but is still wearable to work.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cost so much less on your site</li>
            <li>The quality is consistent with the other Gelish polishes I own, and I get at least 2 weeks of wear with this polish before it starts to peel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty...a little to orange, so I mixed it with another color to achieve a warm pink  color.  </li>
            <li>gel manicure really would last for weeks as far as chipping goes.  </li>
            <li>The polish I received was old.</li>
            <li>has lasted 3-4 weeks so far and still going!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>but almost inbetween a coral color or dusty rose color.  </li>
            <li>I did like this enough to purchase it, along with some other gelish brand colors and a LED light to start doing gel manicures myself at home.</li>
            <li>My wife use it all the time and enjoy the quality of these products as well as other from the same company.</li>
            <li>All of my gel polishes are this same brand, but this one particular color seems to be causing problems.  </li>
            <li>Really pretty pink color with a hint of coral.</li>
            <li>I love the gelish nail polish, it lasts a long time and it has such a shiny finish, I only ordered Passion along with my top coat, base, and lamp, and from the user photos I thought the color would be more of an orange pink</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to put on a light coat and cover every spot on your nail.</li>
            <li>It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  </li>
            <li>This color looks nothing like the sample shown - it turned out very bubble gum pink</li>
            <li>This is not a pink, but a coral.  </li>
            <li>but It was very close to expected.</li>
            <li>The pink doesn&#x27;t stand out too much either, which can happen with some pinks.</li>
            <li>It has a really thick consistency though so you have to be careful not to put too much on or else it will wrinkle under the light.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t return nail polish as it&#x27;s deemed a hazardous material.</li>
            <li>I notice on several of the Gelish colors, different reviewers report getting different shades from the same color name--they disagree on what a particular shade looks like.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely pink, maybe even a hot pink, but it&#x27;s got a hint of coral in there as well.  </li>
            <li>The color is a pretty pink, almost like a bubblegum pink, but with a touch of a coral undertone.</li>
            <li>The top coat hides it for the most part, but it is annoying none the less.</li>
            <li>and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS COLOR!</li>
            <li> I just love the color!</li>
            <li> I used it as my first color to put on my own nails, and it stayed on great!</li>
            <li> But it would be nice to know what shade to expect before spending that amount of money on a color.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice color.</li>
            <li> so I can do my own nails at home and save some money.</li>
            <li> The color is nice...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of coral ,so it can swing both ways and go with outfits that range from pinks to warmer</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product and my whole purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice color though.  </li>
            <li> I own about 35 Gelish colors.</li>
            <li> I really liked the color.  </li>
            <li> Gotta have nicely painted nails when I visit my husband!(he&#x27;s stationed there with the Navy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS, I have fair skin, and I love it with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> A nice color for spring or summer.</li>
            <li> I love to wear pinks and this is a great color because it&#x27;s not too bright, but just the perfect shade of pink.</li>
            <li> New to using gel nail polishs and would like you to know that this color looks awesome on my nails.</li>
            <li> VERY fast shipping - loved the vendor!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> Love it in my opinion all this gellish are amazing the color is perrrfect to do some nails and rock that hand of yours ,, thank you</li>
            <li> the colour, it is an awesome bright pink and colour lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a BRIGHT pink and perfect for summer :)</li>
            <li> Not bad for toes, but too bright for fingers, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Izzy wizzy lets get busy on top of passion and its perfect :) I am in love :)</li>
            <li> Luckily it has good coverage</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and was good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more colors.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> If my daughter hadn&#x27;t already had a system, I wouldn&#x27;t know to wipe the top coat with 99% alcohol after drying.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden, it&#x27;s a perfect manicure.</li>
            <li> Without the alcohol, the top coat is sticky.</li>
            <li> I was also concerned because the coats of polish were tacky after drying, but that is resolved with the top coat.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish product line, but this color is not represented well in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Love that the polish lasts approx.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish polish line...and just ordered this color to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a coral/pink as that is the color shown on the Gelish website, but there was not a hint of coral in mine.  </li>
            <li> I love the Gelish products for the quality, value and variety of colors.</li>
            <li> more more words.</li>
            <li> This entire Gelish line is so awesome!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li> Much better buy on Amazon, than at Sally Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li> Love the color, love Gelish.  </li>
            <li> and this is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Gelish Foundation, Gelish Nail Color in Passion, and Shellac Top Coat (a lot of reviews</li>
            <li> online say this top coat is easier to remove than the Gelish topcoat), and some 91% rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I just bought 2 more colors.  </li>
            <li> I totally love it.</li>
            <li> Even though the reviews warned me, I went ahead and ordered this color in the hope that it was more \\&quot;coral\\&quot; than \\&quot;pink.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> love gelish</li>
            <li> 4weeks plus! cute color</li>
            <li> Get a lot more for your money.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will deff be buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I love being able to use the gel nail polish at home.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, nothing compares to gelish nail polish.</li>
            <li> I LOVE gelish -</li>
            <li> Will continue to be a gelish customer for pedicures until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I chose this color...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it cuz I love the color for summer.</li>
            <li> Love this gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li> the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  </li>
            <li> It cures in around 1 minuter with my UV lamp, but I prefer to do it in 2 just in case :).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to add some more Gelish to my collection.</li>
            <li> Very pretty corral color- love putting Vegas Nights over it, or just on one nail!</li>
            <li> perfect well more than a month, but when I did a  manicure by myself at home by using this ordered products , which  can able to hold it less than three days.</li>
            <li> Also, it was shipped free and no tax, so I ended up saving more.</li>
            <li> I love the way this polish applies - easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a full size bottle!</li>
            <li> I have other colors that work perfectly but not from this seller.</li>
            <li> Shelac, however cracked and my nails chipped easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so easy to use</li>
            <li> is true to color, just love the uniqueness of the color.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t decide if the color is more pink or coral, but it&#x27;s a beautiful color</li>
            <li> so two coats are just fine.</li>
            <li> Girl\\&quot; but it has more of a bubble gum hot pink tone to it which is perfect for spring and summer!</li>
            <li> I bought the whole Gelish set from Sally Beauty and the polishes are so much more there!</li>
            <li> It will wick up under the skin, and as it grows out you&#x27;ll have a huge ridge.  </li>
            <li> It went on smooth and lasted over 2 weeks without any chips.</li>
            <li> Tried it four times, drying each coat for 30 seconds with LCD uv light.</li>
            <li> The color is a great color since it is a now color and definitely is liked by young and old.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been happy with them, but this one, totally different story.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous spring/summer color.</li>
            <li> I cured this with my UV light for 2 minutes...</li>
            <li> so you get a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> You will require an LED or UV curing light.  </li>
            <li> Love the service and shipping time is fast :) And</li>
            <li> I would characterize the color as a kind of bright, medium pink with a touch of coral.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the Gelish products and am thrilled to say that it does last!  </li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hot pink color maybe a little bit of salmon colored my daughters love it perfect for summer toes</li>
            <li> It looks nice on all skin colors, from fair to dark.</li>
            <li> This color is awesome, super bright yet deep full coverage pink.</li>
            <li> Dense rich color in 2 coats.  </li>
            <li> Had this color first applied at the nail salon to make sure I&#x27;d like it before ordering it.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this color, but now I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> The company contaced me letting me know that they were replacing the polish for me and giving me a discount on my next bottle...when a company goes this far to be sure their customers are happy with the products they sell you can be sure they will be the first company I go to to buy a product.  </li>
            <li> Great pink for Spring/Summer.  </li>
            <li> This is a great hot pink/coral color terrific for summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gelish for over a year now and have liked all the colors so far.</li>
            <li> Also the color stays true and does not fade.</li>
            <li> Nice for teens but not for an adult woman.</li>
            <li> What sold me on the color was the customer images, especially those who have fair skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice pink color.</li>
            <li> This color is a lot more vibrant than the online picture.</li>
            <li> Repairs are done quickly.</li>
            <li> will recommend the seller and this color to anyone that likes bright/happy kind of fuschia pink if that makes sense. :))</li>
            <li> Real nice color, goes on smooth and not too thick.</li>
            <li> and I am finding I prefer darker more rich colors like hot rod red and the dark brown chocolate best.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty color, though.</li>
            <li> Shipping is very fast!</li>
            <li> It is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Make sure to really clean the nail up near the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> This color is a new favorite.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is not as bright as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The middle picture of just the circle with the product # is the most accurate.</li>
            <li> The gelish polish is fantastic when applied correctly and is very shiny.</li>
            <li> If you like a candy-coated look, that is bright pink without being neon, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful when first applied, but after a few days, it looses some of its color.  </li>
            <li> I gave a less than perfect review on this product because the product was not applying properly, it was bubbling up.</li>
            <li> Fast service, true to color.</li>
            <li> It is between a pink and a peach!!&lt;br /&gt;It looks great in light brown and white skin!!</li>
            <li> I love the color, BUT I&#x27;ve never had more trouble with a polish before.  </li>
            <li> a little apprehensive thought the color maybe too bright or shade</li>
            <li> I applied the color  Passion last night and LOVE it</li>
            <li> I have been buying my gel polishes from amazong since Novemember 2011 and will definitely be purchasing from amazon from now on :)</li>
            <li> This color is more of a coral pink than bright pink.  </li>
            <li> However, I am super-excited over the whole gelish line and would recommend anyone get it as it is totally worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> but the product picture is the most accurate, its a very bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li> But still a pretty mani/pedi</li>
            <li> I did my first Gelish manicure with Passion.  </li>
            <li> Love Gelish, Passion is one of several colors I have.</li>
            <li> So much better than regular polish for me.  </li>
            <li> so pretty not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely say the polish is more coral then the color on the screen shows.</li>
            <li> Pretty Pink almost Salmon kind of color at times (depends on the lighting).</li>
            <li> At Sally&#x27;s you&#x27;re paying the same or more and getting a mini size bottle.  </li>
            <li> I find that I redo every 2 weeks, because as my nails grow out, at that point it starts to be pretty noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I think it is pretty close to the picture shown and quite pink in my opinion, but to each their own.</li>
            <li> This is my first gelish color of choice and application, I was</li>
            <li> This was my first gel polish ans was ha&lt;</li>
            <li> Pretty color.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and</li>
            <li> Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
            <li> Passion has looked great and lasted more than two weeks, and I am anxious to try other colors.  </li>
            <li> Stays a long time and many colors to chose from for the summer</li>
            <li> Its more of a hot pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color, more coral pink than what I thought.</li>
            <li> This is one of favorite hot pink colors of gel.</li>
            <li> You have to use a UV light in between coats or they do not dry.</li>
            <li> I love this pink color, its so pretty.</li>
            <li> Not only do I have an amazing gel manicure that will last 14 days, but I don&#x27;t have to shell out the money anymore for one.  </li>
            <li> Passion is very similiar to the color \\&quot;Gossip</li>
            <li> too much time devoted to gel polish</li>
            <li> Still I really like the color itself.</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> Fun, playful, and young.</li>
            <li> Probably could have gone longer, but my nails had grown out so much that I removed it myself &amp; tried another color afterward.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like the results I get with Gelish</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for being a five star company who cares about your customers.</li>
            <li> A coral that&#x27;s more on the pink side</li>
            <li> These thicker colors tend to wrinkle or bubble under the light, so you have to do 3 lighter coats as opposed to 2 regular coats.</li>
            <li> Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;However, hopefully it is real Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Passion, because I do know why the nail shop gave me a manicure once a month by using the Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Passion, which can be holden  </li>
            <li> and I felt almost too old to wear it as I think it is more of a teenage girl color.  </li>
            <li> lovely hot pink color!!</li>
            <li> Passion is a true bold pink color.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting these products if you are pretty decent at doing nails.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this color so I would have a gel manicure when I go to Japan next month.</li>
            <li> I ordered Gelish Passion along with the base, top coat and a 45 watt UV light to do my own manicures.</li>
            <li> So vibrant</li>
            <li> For the same price, I was able to get this bottle, which is almost twice as big as Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick only 3 days.  </li>
            <li> My husband purchased this color a few months ago with several other gelish colors for me to do my own manicures at home :)</li>
            <li> Unlike most other gel colors one coat is enough unless you want a very vibrant strong pink.</li>
            <li> I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> This color looked more pink in the picture, but the color is a coral color, not pink.</li>
            <li> I have 3 more colors coming, just hope I can wait it out to change colors and let the manicure last as long as it will.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you like pinks - seems to be lasting well</li>
            <li> When mistakes are done they are easy to correct and most of all this color is flashy but is still wearable to work.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cost so much less on your site</li>
            <li> The quality is consistent with the other Gelish polishes I own, and I get at least 2 weeks of wear with this polish before it starts to peel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty...a little to orange, so I mixed it with another color to achieve a warm pink  color.  </li>
            <li> gel manicure really would last for weeks as far as chipping goes.  </li>
            <li> The polish I received was old.</li>
            <li> has lasted 3-4 weeks so far and still going!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> but almost inbetween a coral color or dusty rose color.  </li>
            <li> I did like this enough to purchase it, along with some other gelish brand colors and a LED light to start doing gel manicures myself at home.</li>
            <li> My wife use it all the time and enjoy the quality of these products as well as other from the same company.</li>
            <li> All of my gel polishes are this same brand, but this one particular color seems to be causing problems.  </li>
            <li> Really pretty pink color with a hint of coral.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish nail polish, it lasts a long time and it has such a shiny finish, I only ordered Passion along with my top coat, base, and lamp, and from the user photos I thought the color would be more of an orange pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put on a light coat and cover every spot on your nail.</li>
            <li> It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  </li>
            <li> This color looks nothing like the sample shown - it turned out very bubble gum pink</li>
            <li> This is not a pink, but a coral.  </li>
            <li> but It was very close to expected.</li>
            <li> The pink doesn&#x27;t stand out too much either, which can happen with some pinks.</li>
            <li> It has a really thick consistency though so you have to be careful not to put too much on or else it will wrinkle under the light.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t return nail polish as it&#x27;s deemed a hazardous material.</li>
            <li> I notice on several of the Gelish colors, different reviewers report getting different shades from the same color name--they disagree on what a particular shade looks like.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely pink, maybe even a hot pink, but it&#x27;s got a hint of coral in there as well.  </li>
            <li> The color is a pretty pink, almost like a bubblegum pink, but with a touch of a coral undertone.</li>
            <li> The top coat hides it for the most part, but it is annoying none the less.</li>
            <li> and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>
            <li> I think I saw someone else complain that the polish never dried on this product or one of the other Gelish polishes I was looking at on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The color is flat with no sparkle or shimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a bubble gum pink (hard cool pink) on your nails.</li>
            <li> The other thing to be mindful of is to be careful when applying near the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my current polish on for 2 weeks without a single chip or loss of shine!  </li>
            <li> Pink Smoothie and Red Roses.  </li>
            <li> The other colors (same brand) don&#x27;t clump like this one.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a single one break or tear while I&#x27;ve had this polish on.  </li>
            <li> Also this color swatch is not as dark as the actual color.</li>
            <li> u can&#x27;t beat $12 and some change, considering sally&#x27;s beauty supply sells the smaller bottles for the same if not more....</li>
            <li> But Passion is a dark coral, not the deep Pepto Bismol pink shade shown on all the color charts.  </li>
            <li> Not totally coral, but slightly.</li>
            <li> Sally sells bottles half the size for same amount of money.  </li>
            <li> It is strange to me though that other reviews say it was too coral for them.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this is the only color that has bubbled up on me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pink polish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it again in a week or so and see if an even lighter application helps, but I&#x27;m not really very heavy-handed when applying the polish.</li>
            <li> this is a creamy pink and coral shade.</li>
            <li> I recommend this color to all those pink fans.</li>
            <li> is not what I expected...</li>
            <li> There are a couple of things to be careful of when applying.  </li>
            <li> I got a complement on this color just the other day.  </li>
            <li> My one and only gripe is that I discovered through online research, that a few of the colors - of which Passion is one - are just a little thicker than other colors.</li>
            <li> The version I got is very pink.  </li>
            <li> A little brighter than expected</li>
            <li> My only issue is the nail polish is really thick.</li>
            <li> Lasts about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> It was shipped the morning after I bought and was received in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I do all kinds of gardening work and house remodeling projects, so there are plenty of chances to mess it up.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I bought a few pinks for summer</li>
            <li> Take your time while doing it and watch the you tube video from harmony on how to do it correctly and you will be a pro with a little practice!</li>
            <li> but I like it with a coat of a subtle sparkle to tone it down a bit.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful to apply thin coats or the polish will wrinkle.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.  </li>
            <li> It lasted for approximately two and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to describe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to judge the color on line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink with a faint hit of coral.  </li>
            <li> I think I applied it too thickly, used 2 coats.</li>
            <li> If my color coat is too thick it puckers under the lamp.</li>
            <li> It is thick and clumpy and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> When you apply the polish, since it&#x27;s a thick gel, it settles out any brush strokes before it cures</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very thick and therefore not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency which may cause the polish to wrinkle during curing time if you don&#x27;t focus on applying very very thin coats.</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails</li>
            <li> If you try to stay a little ways away from the base of the nail it won&#x27;t be a problem.  </li>
            <li> I told seller there was something wrong with this polish</li>
            <li> Finally, as you&#x27;re working on your nails, just ignore how awful the cuticles look.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy this expensive polish as the quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the color which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Recommend the product but was disappointed in the color.</li>
            <li> Even when applying very thin coats, this wrinkles terribly.  </li>

            <li> Color is better on than the picture presents!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter.  She loves it. I&#x27;ll be buying more colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gelish for over a year now and have liked all the colors so far. This color is just what I wanted but it&#x27;s very thick and therefore not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this color a few months ago with several other gelish colors for me to do my own manicures at home :) I applied the color  Passion last night and LOVE it :) It&#x27;s a BRIGHT pink and perfect for summer :) I am one that loves glitter polishes so I applied the Gelish Izzy wizzy lets get busy on top of passion and its perfect :) I am in love :) I have been buying my gel polishes from amazong since Novemember 2011 and will definitely be purchasing from amazon from now on :) Love the service and shipping time is fast :) And the PRice for the polish u can&#x27;t beat $12 and some change, considering sally&#x27;s beauty supply sells the smaller bottles for the same if not more....</li>
            <li> This color looked more pink in the picture, but the color is a coral color, not pink. I didnt expect it to be this color and I cannot return the item.</li>
            <li> This color is a lot more vibrant than the online picture. Its more of a hot pink. The color is flat with no sparkle or shimmer. I love the color. It looks awesome and have gotten a lot of compliments. Gel Polish is the gift that keeps on giving!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  Makes manicure and pedicure possible at home instead of spending a fortune at a nail salon.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Love it!!! Love it!!!! Now I can do my nails and they will be good for 9 to 15 fays!!!!!! Thank YOU!</li>
            <li> I ordered Gelish Passion along with the base, top coat and a 45 watt UV light to do my own manicures. I think I applied it too thickly, used 2 coats. It&#x27;s a pretty color, more coral pink than what I thought. If my daughter hadn&#x27;t already had a system, I wouldn&#x27;t know to wipe the top coat with 99% alcohol after drying. All of a sudden, it&#x27;s a perfect manicure. Without the alcohol, the top coat is sticky. I was also concerned because the coats of polish were tacky after drying, but that is resolved with the top coat. I have 3 more colors coming, just hope I can wait it out to change colors and let the manicure last as long as it will.</li>
            <li> Good but almost inbetween a coral color or dusty rose color.  This is not as bright as I expected.  It&#x27;s still very beautiful tho!</li>
            <li> I love the gelish product line, but this color is not represented well in the picture.  This color is more of a coral pink than bright pink.  Love that the polish lasts approx. 2 weeks!  Recommend the product but was disappointed in the color.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish polish line...and just ordered this color to add to my collection. Passion is very similiar to the color \\&quot;Gossip Girl\\&quot; but it has more of a bubble gum hot pink tone to it which is perfect for spring and summer!</li>
            <li> I am truly baffled by the gelish color swatches.  I have read almost every review on Amazon on every color they make and I do wonder if each \\&quot;batch\\&quot; is slightly different.  This color looks nothing like the sample shown - it turned out very bubble gum pink and I felt almost too old to wear it as I think it is more of a teenage girl color.  I was hoping for more of a coral/pink as that is the color shown on the Gelish website, but there was not a hint of coral in mine.  It is strange to me though that other reviews say it was too coral for them.  However, I am super-excited over the whole gelish line and would recommend anyone get it as it is totally worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> Very nice color. I love to wear pinks and this is a great color because it&#x27;s not too bright, but just the perfect shade of pink.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish nail polish, it lasts a long time and it has such a shiny finish, I only ordered Passion along with my top coat, base, and lamp, and from the user photos I thought the color would be more of an orange pink but the product picture is the most accurate, its a very bubble gum pink. But still a pretty mani/pedi</li>
            <li> Great product!  But Passion is a dark coral, not the deep Pepto Bismol pink shade shown on all the color charts.  Although Passion blends well with both pink and soft red clothes, it is not what I was expecting or needed at the time.  I notice on several of the Gelish colors, different reviewers report getting different shades from the same color name--they disagree on what a particular shade looks like.  Is there a problem with inconsistent mixing or labeling by Gelish?  Passion has looked great and lasted more than two weeks, and I am anxious to try other colors.  But it would be nice to know what shade to expect before spending that amount of money on a color.</li>
            <li> I did my first Gelish manicure with Passion.  I saw that a manicure could last for up to 2 weeks and had to give this a go.      This is a great summer time color, I wouldn&#x27;t wear this in fall.  It&#x27;s pink with a faint hit of coral.  Kinda hard to describe.</li>
            <li> This is not a pink, but a coral.  When I compare color on my nails to sample picture, not even close!</li>
            <li> too much time devoted to gel polish</li>
            <li> The color is absolutely beautiful!! Unlike most other gel colors one coat is enough unless you want a very vibrant strong pink. The color matches phenomenally with my skin color and what can I say! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice color. The middle picture of just the circle with the product # is the most accurate. It is not red/orange, don&#x27;t let those 2 hand pictures fool you.     My only complaint is that this is the only color that has bubbled up on me. If my color coat is too thick it puckers under the lamp. The top coat hides it for the most part, but it is annoying none the less. Still I really like the color itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gelish before but it was applied at salons.I love the Gelish products for the quality, value and variety of colors. For Christmas, I bought myself a UV lamp and Gelish polishes so I can do my own nails at home and save some money. I was looking for a pink polish so I decided to try Passion. I would characterize the color as a kind of bright, medium pink with a touch of coral. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the color which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It went on smooth and lasted over 2 weeks without any chips.</li>
            <li> its great. 2 coats and is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this color! its very bright and happy. perfect for summer and spring. The gelish polish is fantastic when applied correctly and is very shiny. Last almost 2 weeks with out peeling or chipping each time i&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Great pink for Spring/Summer.  The formula is great and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it wrinkling or shrinking during curing. Also the color stays true and does not fade.</li>
            <li> This is a bright color ... but I like it with a coat of a subtle sparkle to tone it down a bit.  CND Ice Vapor is wonderful over this for summertime and the beach !</li>
            <li> The most perfect color I own. Not watery. Dense rich color in 2 coats.  Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;More more more words.</li>
            <li> I love the color, BUT I&#x27;ve never had more trouble with a polish before.  All of my gel polishes are this same brand, but this one particular color seems to be causing problems.  It wrinkles, bubbles, and lifts during the curing process.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice and have had the same problem on several fingers both times.  I&#x27;m going to try it again in a week or so and see if an even lighter application helps, but I&#x27;m not really very heavy-handed when applying the polish.</li>
            <li> Love Gelish, Passion is one of several colors I have. This is a great hot pink/coral color terrific for summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the Gelish products and am thrilled to say that it does last!  So much better than regular polish for me.  This color is a new favorite.  It&#x27;s definitely pink, maybe even a hot pink, but it&#x27;s got a hint of coral in there as well.  It looks great with coral colors, pinks, and just about anything.  It&#x27;s worth a try if you like pinks - seems to be lasting well and I get lots of compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> lovely hot pink color!! This entire Gelish line is so awesome! It is the answer to my nail prayers!!! I am not a nail tech, however I can do this and it looks just like a pro did it!!! I get compliments on how great my nails look all the time! I tell all my friends and they love it too!!! Take your time while doing it and watch the you tube video from harmony on how to do it correctly and you will be a pro with a little practice! Mine lasts for a minimum of 2.5 weeks!!</li>
            <li> I love it! The real nice thing about it is that it covers fully with one coat. Real nice color, goes on smooth and not too thick. Great buy!</li>
            <li> If you like a candy-coated look, that is bright pink without being neon, this is the one for you. Not bad for toes, but too bright for fingers, in my opinion. Fun, playful, and young.</li>
            <li> https://www.pinterest.com/pin/476255729321596739/</li>
            <li> The polish I received was old. Didn&#x27;t cure and rippled. I had to throw away. 👎🏼</li>
            <li> Love the color! I have not had a chance to wear this color yet! But I will soon! This is one of my favorite colors. I&#x27;ll buy it again in a heart brat...</li>
            <li> this is a creamy pink and coral shade. opaque in two coats. vibrante shade. not muted at all. beautiful color.</li>
            <li> Even when applying very thin coats, this wrinkles terribly.  Tried it four times, drying each coat for 30 seconds with LCD uv light. Waste of my money. Very pretty color, though.</li>
            <li> This is one of favorite hot pink colors of gel. so pretty not overpowering at all.  I recommend this color to all those pink fans.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say the polish is more coral then the color on the screen shows. Not totally coral, but slightly.</li>
            <li> The color is nice... My only issue is the nail polish is really thick. It&#x27;s hard to put on a light coat and cover every spot on your nail.</li>
            <li> The color is very nice and bright. But the nail polish separated when I was drying my nails. It also looks cracked after drying.</li>
            <li> The color is a great color since it is a now color and definitely is liked by young and old.</li>
            <li> Color is off. This is a bubble gum pink (hard cool pink) on your nails. Nice for teens but not for an adult woman.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hot pink color maybe a little bit of salmon colored my daughters love it perfect for summer toes</li>
            <li> Pretty Pink almost Salmon kind of color at times (depends on the lighting). Had this color first applied at the nail salon to make sure I&#x27;d like it before ordering it.  The durablity of Gelish polish is amazing!  I had this color on my nails for 3 weeks without any chipping or peeling.  Probably could have gone longer, but my nails had grown out so much that I removed it myself &amp; tried another color afterward.  I did like this enough to purchase it, along with some other gelish brand colors and a LED light to start doing gel manicures myself at home. Much better buy on Amazon, than at Sally Beauty Supply.  At Sally&#x27;s you&#x27;re paying the same or more and getting a mini size bottle.  This is a full size bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several colors from this same brand and I&#x27;ve been happy with them, but this one, totally different story. This one clumps up, and yes, I do know how to cure my nails and have the necessary tools. The other colors (same brand) don&#x27;t clump like this one.</li>
            <li> It is so bright and stays on great using the gel system.  It lasted for approximately two and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> My favorite Gelish cover! So vibrant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty...a little to orange, so I mixed it with another color to achieve a warm pink  color.  I find it only lasts 1 week for me.  But, I don&#x27;t agressively sand the surface of my nail, and my hands are in water a lot.  The polish does not chip or peel until day 7 or 8.  With regular polish, my nails chip and peel after one day.  It goes on very smooth.  I love it !</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the color, love Gelish.  I have been doing my gel nails myself for a year.  (Found a great UV light on Amazon for a great price.)  I really like the results I get with Gelish and this is my favorite color.  It&#x27;s kind of coral ,so it can swing both ways and go with outfits that range from pinks to warmer reds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel manicure really would last for weeks as far as chipping goes.  I find that I redo every 2 weeks, because as my nails grow out, at that point it starts to be pretty noticeable.  But they never chip.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage. Passion is a true bold pink color. Perfect for the spring and summer months!  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product on Amazon and had to get the supplies and give it a try.  I bought the Gelish Foundation, Gelish Nail Color in Passion, and Shellac Top Coat (a lot of reviews online say this top coat is easier to remove than the Gelish topcoat), and some 91% rubbing alcohol.  I also bought  a 9 watt lamp instead of initially shelling out over $100 for the 36w and above.  I am so impressed with this product and my whole purchase.  Not only do I have an amazing gel manicure that will last 14 days, but I don&#x27;t have to shell out the money anymore for one.  I highly recommend getting these products if you are pretty decent at doing nails. I clip my cuticles, file the nail, buff away the calluses on my feet, and then start the Gelish process.  The only difference is that since I have the 9w lamp so I do 10 minutes instead of the 2 they suggest.  It turns out perfect.  I just bought 2 more colors.  Pink Smoothie and Red Roses.  If you want my opinion on the color.  I think it is pretty close to the picture shown and quite pink in my opinion, but to each their own.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous spring/summer color. I totally love it. The quality is consistent with the other Gelish polishes I own, and I get at least 2 weeks of wear with this polish before it starts to peel.</li>
            <li> Was intoduced to Gelish while in AZ, loved it. When I returned to ND, all salons here use Shellac.  Gelish is pliable, doesn&#x27;t crack and retains appearance until removal.    Shelac, however cracked and my nails chipped easily. Shelac did retain shine until removed.    Gelish, Gelish, Gelish, Yea!</li>
            <li> Even though the reviews warned me, I went ahead and ordered this color in the hope that it was more \\&quot;coral\\&quot; than \\&quot;pink.\\&quot;  The version I got is very pink.  It&#x27;s a nice color though.  VERY fast shipping - loved the vendor!</li>
            <li> I accidentally purchased this even though I have the color at home already. Its great color though so I will be using it.</li>
            <li> has lasted 3-4 weeks so far and still going!&lt;br /&gt;Love the colour, it is an awesome bright pink and colour lasts.</li>
            <li> Shipping and product Are great.&lt;br /&gt;Picture is true to color, just love the uniqueness of the color. Just be careful to apply thin coats or the polish will wrinkle.</li>
            <li> I own about 35 Gelish colors. At first I didn&#x27;t like this color, but now I LOVE it. It looks nice on all skin colors, from fair to dark. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Fast service, true to color.</li>
            <li> love gelish 4weeks plus! cute color</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT.  Get a lot more for your money.  Sally sells bottles half the size for same amount of money.  Will always buy here</li>
            <li> I like the color, but the one I received was lumpy and unusable. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t return nail polish as it&#x27;s deemed a hazardous material. I would not buy this expensive polish as the quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> I gave a less than perfect review on this product because the product was not applying properly, it was bubbling up. The company contaced me letting me know that they were replacing the polish for me and giving me a discount on my next bottle...when a company goes this far to be sure their customers are happy with the products they sell you can be sure they will be the first company I go to to buy a product.  Thank you so much for being a five star company who cares about your customers.</li>
            <li> I really liked the color.  It&#x27;s bright and cheery. Easy to use.  Good coverage. Lasts about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t decide if the color is more pink or coral, but it&#x27;s a beautiful color and I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments. It was shipped the morning after I bought and was received in less than a week. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got a complement on this color just the other day.  People seem to notice the Gelish polishes since they are so shiny.</li>
            <li> It us a very nice color, bright and cheery. It has a thick consistency which may cause the polish to wrinkle during curing time if you don&#x27;t focus on applying very very thin coats. Luckily it has good coverage so two coats are just fine.</li>
            <li> New to using gel nail polishs and would like you to know that this color looks awesome on my nails. I love it.</li>
            <li> This color is awesome, super bright yet deep full coverage pink. I only needed one coat of it. I will deff be buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice pink color. However after receiving it, i&#x27;ve noticed that is looks a lot like Gelish - Make a Difference, but without the sparkle. Had I known that, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. Covered well with 2 coats.</li>
            <li> These gel polishes are great. You have to use a UV light in between coats or they do not dry.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love being able to use the gel nail polish at home. Repairs are done quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Easy to use and cost so much less on your site then anywhere I have found.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to judge the color on line but It was very close to expected.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, nothing compares to gelish nail polish. Stays a long time and many colors to chose from for the summer</li>
            <li> Very happy with this color.  A little brighter than expected but I still love it!!  I LOVE gelish - so easy to use and my nails always look great!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color! It was shipped very quickly and has a great result! Would suggest this color if you are looking for a \\&quot;coral\\&quot; or \\&quot;pinkish\\&quot; color!</li>
            <li> LOVE this color! A coral that&#x27;s more on the pink side - it&#x27;s the perfect shade for me! Had so many compliments on it! My one and only gripe is that I discovered through online research, that a few of the colors - of which Passion is one - are just a little thicker than other colors. These thicker colors tend to wrinkle or bubble under the light, so you have to do 3 lighter coats as opposed to 2 regular coats. But otherwise, definitely a favorite!!</li>
            <li> My favorite and lasts forever! Will continue to be a gelish customer for pedicures until something better comes along. Gelish also has a bigger selection of colors than shellac and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Great product! It shipped quickly and was good quality. No issues and I loved the color. It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love it in my opinion all this gellish are amazing the color is perrrfect to do some nails and rock that hand of yours ,, thank you</li>
            <li> My wife use it all the time and enjoy the quality of these products as well as other from the same company.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful when first applied, but after a few days, it looses some of its color.  It gets a funky tinge after 2-3 days..Not sure why.  Still looks good, and gets lots of compliments, but I notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and formula. It is between a pink and a peach!!&lt;br /&gt;It looks great in light brown and white skin!!</li>
            <li> I thought this color would be a bit warmer and as my skin has peachy tones it clashes. I would recommend this for people with very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I told seller there was something wrong with this polish and they refused to do anything about it. It is thick and clumpy and I had to throw it away. I have other colors that work perfectly but not from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love how bright this color is! It is a nice pop of color, has great coverage!</li>
            <li> Very pretty corral color- love putting Vegas Nights over it, or just on one nail!</li>
            <li> Shipping is very fast! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;However, hopefully it is real Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Passion, because I do know why the nail shop gave me a manicure once a month by using the Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Passion, which can be holden  perfect well more than a month, but when I did a  manicure by myself at home by using this ordered products , which  can able to hold it less than three days.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS COLOR! I bought the whole Gelish set from Sally Beauty and the polishes are so much more there! For the same price, I was able to get this bottle, which is almost twice as big as Sally&#x27;s! Also, it was shipped free and no tax, so I ended up saving more. The color is a pretty pink, almost like a bubblegum pink, but with a touch of a coral undertone. The pink doesn&#x27;t stand out too much either, which can happen with some pinks. I originally bought this color so I would have a gel manicure when I go to Japan next month. Gotta have nicely painted nails when I visit my husband!(he&#x27;s stationed there with the Navy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, I have fair skin, and I love it with my skin tone. What sold me on the color was the customer images, especially those who have fair skin.</li>
            <li> does not go on like the color displayed.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick only 3 days.  This is my first gelish color of choice and application, I was a little apprehensive thought the color maybe too bright or shade is not what I expected...but I&#x27;m glad I chose this color...it compliments my fair skin tone..I cured this with my UV light for 2 minutes...all in all gelish is great...just need to test  if it will actually last for atleast 2-3 weeks...will recommend the seller and this color to anyone that likes bright/happy kind of fuschia pink if that makes sense. :))</li>
            <li> It is a coral/pink color. It is very pretty. Goes on great. I just love the color! This was my first gel polish ans was ha&lt;br /&gt;Py I choose this color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite.  I bought a few pinks for summer and I am finding I prefer darker more rich colors like hot rod red and the dark brown chocolate best.  Also this color swatch is not as dark as the actual color.</li>
            <li> I love this pink color, its so pretty. I ordered it cuz I love the color for summer. Especially when I do Shellac on my toes!!</li>
            <li> Pretty color.  It has a really thick consistency though so you have to be careful not to put too much on or else it will wrinkle under the light.</li>
            <li> Love this gel nail polish.  It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  I&#x27;ve had my current polish on for 2 weeks without a single chip or loss of shine!  And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  I do all kinds of gardening work and house remodeling projects, so there are plenty of chances to mess it up.  The best thing about this type of polish is it adds thickness and strength to your nails.   I have very weak nails and I haven&#x27;t had a single one break or tear while I&#x27;ve had this polish on.  When you apply the polish, since it&#x27;s a thick gel, it settles out any brush strokes before it cures so you get a smooth finish.  There are a couple of things to be careful of when applying.  Make sure to really clean the nail up near the cuticle.  I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  The other thing to be mindful of is to be careful when applying near the cuticles.  It will wick up under the skin, and as it grows out you&#x27;ll have a huge ridge.  If you try to stay a little ways away from the base of the nail it won&#x27;t be a problem.  Finally, as you&#x27;re working on your nails, just ignore how awful the cuticles look.  The cleaning solution drys them out, but the nourish oil fixes it all up at the end.  Read the directions on the Gelish website.  You will require an LED or UV curing light.  I think I saw someone else complain that the polish never dried on this product or one of the other Gelish polishes I was looking at on Amazon.  Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
            <li> Standard bottle of gel nail polish. Really pretty pink color with a hint of coral. A nice color for spring or summer.</li>
            <li> I love the way this polish applies - easy and smooth. When mistakes are done they are easy to correct and most of all this color is flashy but is still wearable to work. I find that I need to apply 3 coats instead of two because I have  a darker skin tone. It cures in around 1 minuter with my UV lamp, but I prefer to do it in 2 just in case :). When I need to remove it I just use acetone, a cotton ball, and some tin foil. In 20 mins they&#x27;re already peeling. Can&#x27;t wait to add some more Gelish to my collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this one forever, and always loved it.  I used it as my first color to put on my own nails, and it stayed on great!</li>
