            <li>I truly love this masque.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried it as it did sooth, soften and hydrate my skin</li>
            <li>I never paid more than $15 for a masque.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed Queen Helene products, in fact, they are my most purchased skincare/hygiene products and also my most used.</li>
            <li>I simply apply this miracle cream (which also smells excellent, does not smell like olive oil at all) as directed, and after I wash it off, my face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum!</li>
            <li>I love this product never had any problem with it</li>
            <li>I love queen helene products.</li>
            <li>i have been using the  Borghese mud mask for years and that stings much more .so</li>
            <li>its ok to me.</li>
            <li>My whole life I used the Mint Julep, so thought I would take the Olive Oil for a spin.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, it&#x27;s fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>guess for radiant skin you have to alwasys have good sleep ,and these beauty products can be addtional ,but they cant save the skin if you dont live healtily .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy, smells nice, hydrating, and does not tighten the skin dramatically.</li>
            <li>Surprised on how good the scent was and the texture of the product</li>
            <li>i decided to try more brands that has more reasonable price .so</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, many products would irritate it not this one thought!</li>
            <li>Great masque for dry skin!</li>
            <li>very clean refreshing facial mask with olive oil</li>
            <li>My beautician was kind enough to gift me the mask...</li>
            <li>Still, the price and size are indeed worth it.</li>
            <li>Do your face a favor, add few dollars more and buy a better product.</li>
            <li>I love this.my beautician used this on ny for my wedding facial and my friend kept sayimg in glowing..</li>
            <li>this is great for my dry skin especially in the winter</li>
            <li>left my face nice and soft - I have oily skin</li>
            <li>I liked the moisturizing side of this, but I felt like I had to use half the bottle to get the desired affect.</li>
            <li>This masque also has a blend of Chamomile and Sage extract, which really calmed my skin from irritation.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>Did not dry my face out, and did not irritate my sensitive skin so worked out fine.</li>
            <li>my face is super dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft after, no greasiness, no break outs.</li>
            <li>i think those who are having problem must have sensitive skin your skin is at its drys in the morning when you get up thats</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect much, was just hoping to get some extra moisture bcus</li>
            <li>This is a low quality product, full of ingredients that I am not excited about putting on my face.</li>

            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> Would recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used it 2x a week in the winter and my dry patches went away.</li>

            <li> I have very dry skin that often flakes, which led me to this product.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild acne on my face, and after using my other products to heal this acne, it can leave my face quite dry; well I can say goodbye to that irritating feeling now!</li>
            <li> Product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> (minus the acne)</li>
            <li> I have used Queen Helene for decades, and as I&#x27;ve aged my skin has dried.</li>
            <li> The flakiness of my skin has toned down a lot, maybe because I use the masque 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I use this every other night for 10 minutes and my skin looks great, especially with this horrible cold weather.</li>
            <li> It stings a little...</li>
            <li> This is a little difficult to wash off, but it works well.</li>
            <li> This is not my first moisturizing masque, but this one does the worst job.  </li>
            <li> I like 2 layers of it because it&#x27;s not to heavy(It&#x27;s thin)</li>
            <li> it moisturizes ,but not great .i</li>

            <li> I am not a fan of this product. I have very dry skin and was hoping this would help with that. I noticed no improvement and even an increase in dryness.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that often flakes, which led me to this product. It&#x27;s very creamy, smells nice, hydrating, and does not tighten the skin dramatically. I like 2 layers of it because it&#x27;s not to heavy(It&#x27;s thin) but I would like to see the product show. The flakiness of my skin has toned down a lot, maybe because I use the masque 4 times a week. This masque also has a blend of Chamomile and Sage extract, which really calmed my skin from irritation. Just give it a TRY</li>
            <li> I have used Queen Helene for decades, and as I&#x27;ve aged my skin has dried. My whole life I used the Mint Julep, so thought I would take the Olive Oil for a spin.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, it&#x27;s fantastic!!! My skin felt so soft after, no greasiness, no break outs. This is now a once-a-week habit for me. I truly love this masque.</li>
            <li> * Queen Helene Olive Oil Masque: Surprised on how good the scent was and the texture of the product&lt;br /&gt;* I am glad I tried it as it did sooth, soften and hydrate my skin&lt;br /&gt;* A great find for the price!</li>
            <li> left my face nice and soft - I have oily skin so will only use 1 or 2x a month</li>
            <li> Great masque.  My skin feels wonderful after I apply and remove this masque.  It is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Product was what I expected. Did not dry my face out, and did not irritate my sensitive skin so worked out fine.</li>
            <li> This is a low quality product, full of ingredients that I am not excited about putting on my face. Like fragrance, mineral oil, parabens. This is not my first moisturizing masque, but this one does the worst job.  I never paid more than $15 for a masque. Do your face a favor, add few dollars more and buy a better product.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and this stuff is awesome. Makes me feel like a queen after using. Would recommend for dry skin. Soothing!</li>
            <li> very clean refreshing facial mask with olive oil scent.&lt;br /&gt;i used it for 3 months and still have some left. great convenient value product</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed Queen Helene products, in fact, they are my most purchased skincare/hygiene products and also my most used. By the way, I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;m saying this. I suffer from mild acne on my face, and after using my other products to heal this acne, it can leave my face quite dry; well I can say goodbye to that irritating feeling now! I simply apply this miracle cream (which also smells excellent, does not smell like olive oil at all) as directed, and after I wash it off, my face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum! (minus the acne)</li>
            <li> I love this product never had any problem with it i brought it 3 times i think those who are having problem must have sensitive skin your skin is at its drys in the morning when you get up thats when i put it on leave on for about 30 mins wash off then face  cream and make up for the day my face feels moisturize for the hole day works well for me believe it or not i have know wrinkles and im 58yrs</li>
            <li> this is great for my dry skin especially in the winter</li>
            <li> I love queen helene products. Never too harsh for my sensitive skin and always works extremely well. Will continue to buy this again and again</li>
            <li> It stings a little...i have been using the  Borghese mud mask for years and that stings much more .so its ok to me. i decided to try more brands that has more reasonable price .so i found this one .it does give the skin a refresh and radiant looking afer the frist use .but it didnt last ...it moisturizes ,but not great .i guess for radiant skin you have to alwasys have good sleep ,and these beauty products can be addtional ,but they cant save the skin if you dont live healtily .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much, was just hoping to get some extra moisture bcus my face is super dry in the winter. Smells wonderful and did the job.</li>

My beautician was kind enough to gift me the mask...I used it 2 months after my wedding...and my husnand instantly noticed that I had done something different to my face.it was looking heathier...I had just used the mask while prepping for shower.</li>

            <li> This is a little difficult to wash off, but it works well. I used it 2x a week in the winter and my dry patches went away. Big plus that it&#x27;s so inexpensive!</li>
