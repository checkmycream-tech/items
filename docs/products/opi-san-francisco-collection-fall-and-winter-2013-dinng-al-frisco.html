            <li>💅 Love this color! ...</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a nice wintery color</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast and the polish arrived in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S NICE</li>
            <li>I really like this color from Opi,i agree with one reviewer who said its like a pearl color looks great on nice for any time of year to get the color of picture I used three coats and a top coat</li>
            <li>I like it very well, beautiful color, for winter</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my beautiful, trendy 28 year old wife.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it eventually, but not the color that I wanted.</li>
            <li>Looks more gray-blue.</li>
            <li>It is ok and I will keep it.  </li>
            <li>, it is pearly, I love that, I associate it with pearly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color and the thickness of the lacquer is prefect.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI..</li>
            <li>great color wish the prices were a lil lower since this color is almost 2yrs old</li>
            <li>Goes on and covers , dries nice, makes my feet look hot</li>
            <li>1 coat was good enough, 2 was much better though.  </li>
            <li>lots of compliments on the color from young as well as older people.perhaps just a bit darker than the pic but just as attractive.</li>
            <li>This color is much darker than the picture and more metallicy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be pleased with the new ones.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be placing more orders!</li>
            <li>main reason for loving this brand is that it stays on chip free longer than any other that I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always likes O.P.I. and this blue is  no exception, have had many compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Love the blue color!  </li>
            <li>Such a gorgeous blue!</li>
            <li>I really wanted turquoise, but this is more blue.  </li>
            <li>It hides my &amp;#34;ribbed&amp;#34; nails and covers very well.</li>
            <li>And shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I loved the unusual blue color and the depth of the shimmer, but this is one of those OPI polishes that must have a topcoat, or it will only last two days.</li>
            <li>Must put 2 coats on (which is normal for any brand polish I have ever purchased)</li>
            <li>Am branching out in new areas...</li>
            <li>I CAN ORDER ANY COLOR I WANT AND EVEN NEW COLORS.</li>
            <li>SUCH PRETTY COLORS</li>
            <li>I rarely use polish on my fingers due to work, will be putting it on toes when warmer weather comes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not completely giving up, I just purchased a few more.....</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this particular color but what I received was nothing like it is shown above.</li>
            <li>She loves this as much as the other 9000 OPI polishes she has.  </li>

            <li> Such a gorgeous blue! perfect Summer color to wear a pair of flip flops :)</li>
            <li> I should have gotten two.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my beautiful, trendy 28 year old wife.  I thought this would be a nice wintery color and I suppose the blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while.  She loves this as much as the other 9000 OPI polishes she has.  That is all I need to give it 5/5.</li>
            <li> This color is much darker than the picture and more metallicy. I do like OPI brand, though. It usually lasts longer without chipping.</li>
            <li> I loved the unusual blue color and the depth of the shimmer, but this is one of those OPI polishes that must have a topcoat, or it will only last two days.</li>

            <li> I recently purchased this particular color but what I received was nothing like it is shown above. It was a disgusting color, much much darker and I was so upset over it that I couldn&#x27;t even be bothered to send it back, I threw it in the trash! I&#x27;m only commenting so others won&#x27;t be as disappointed as I was. And I&#x27;ve gotten a number of polishes from Amazon before, and bought several this time as well.  I&#x27;m not completely giving up, I just purchased a few more.....I&#x27;m hoping this was a one-time ooops and I&#x27;ll be pleased with the new ones.</li>
            <li> Looks more gray-blue.</li>
            <li> opi is just the best of the best..lots of compliments on the color from young as well as older people.perhaps just a bit darker than the pic but just as attractive.</li>

            <li> I wanted something to wear that went with my Turquoise Jewelry..not a real good match..but I think I will like this during the summer on my toes..</li>
            <li> The color I received was not like the online picture.  The blue is darkish gray blue.  It is ok and I will keep it.  I wanted a brighter blue.  If you want a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; polish then OPI is good.  I just wish I had received the color in the picture.</li>
            <li> I wear it on my toes all summer long.  Love the color!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color love OPI</li>
            <li> Love the blue color!  Am branching out in new areas...at the age of 68!  My children and grandchildren think I&#x27;m quite &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.  The shipment was fast and the polish arrived in excellent condition.  Will definitely be placing more orders!</li>
            <li> I like it very well, beautiful color, for winter, it is pearly, I love that, I associate it with pearly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like the photography.</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on this color. It goes with a lot of colors. I use on my toenails and sometimes on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is a great color. Cannot go wrong with O.P.I.  Must put 2 coats on (which is normal for any brand polish I have ever purchased)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color and the thickness of the lacquer is prefect.  It hides my &amp;#34;ribbed&amp;#34; nails and covers very well.</li>
            <li> I really love this color! 1 coat was good enough, 2 was much better though.  I got so many compliments at work!!</li>
            <li> SUCH PRETTY COLORS I ORDERED I WANT TO WEAR THEM ALL AT ONE TIME. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH OPI AND IT&#x27;S NICE TO NO I CAN ORDER ANY COLOR I WANT AND EVEN NEW COLORS. FOR WOMAN WHO NEVER USED OPI IT&#x27;S DEFINITLY NUMBER ONE IN MY BOOK I NEVER USED ANYTHING ELSE. AND IT DON&#x27;T CHIP AND LAST TIL YOU TAKE IT OFF THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> great color wish the prices were a lil lower since this color is almost 2yrs old</li>
