            <li>I believe many people will not check the ingredients and continue using this product thinking they have the Rejuvenating Treatment.</li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>I love how this cream makes my face look and feel but as for wrinkles I&#x27;m using this to prevent them.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Voila perfect skin all day long !</li>
            <li>It was fun to see me looking so much better &amp; glowy-er!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin smooth and even.</li>
            <li>excellent product, I recommended for those who are over 40year will help take care of your fas no more to say</li>
            <li>large pores look a lot better though so</li>
            <li>The texture was creamy but thick; perfect for both morning and night time usage.</li>
            <li>I did expect an improvement since I&#x27;d heard good things about it &amp; it would be included in Hollywood gift baskets &amp; such.</li>
            <li>It gave me exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>the although it&#x27;s pricier than store bought, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have any results yet on my skin , found the product is greasy and doesn&#x27;t sink into my skin , so when putting on makeup right after it&#x27;s too shiny.</li>
            <li>Rejuvenating  Tx before and don&#x27;t  think they sent me the right product.</li>
            <li>I am generally a very easy person to please but the only nice thing that I can say about this product is that it comes in a pretty blue jar.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Hydroxatone feels light on my skin, which makes it easy to use my same makeup products I already have,</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the past 3 or 4 years and mt face looks great.</li>
            <li>So I am happy to see, at least the first jar is packed well and full.</li>
            <li>I look ten years younger wrinkles are greatly reduced</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Just into my first jar</li>
            <li>If you use it consistently will work wonders.</li>
            <li>First of all this is a very greasy cream.  </li>
            <li>I probably don&#x27;t use it as much as I should.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think anything can fix wrinkles, but it does have a sun blocker.</li>
            <li>It keeps dark circles under the eyes and puffiness at abeyance :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different products and I love these results!  </li>
            <li>If it would have possible  for an extended free trial, these results may have been different.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely opposite  to the one I&#x27;m use to ,very greasy and not as affective as the real hydroxatone.</li>
            <li>My last order in 2012 was not, 2 of my jars of product were only 1/2 full.</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite product for me in the past, however, the order method from the radio advertisers frequently sent additional orders of the product before needed.</li>
            <li>This cream is soft, although somewhat greasy, and it appears to block the sun&#x27;s rays on my face.  </li>
            <li>As far a sunscreen</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopping to get the real one next time with the youth effect.</li>
            <li>My third major problem with this cream is that it stung my eyes.  </li>

            <li> ^_^&lt;br /&gt;So am not sure if it works one wrinkles if u have them.</li>
            <li> Apply wait a few minutes then use the BB cream fir your base...</li>
            <li> so I was sad not to re-order because I knew I wanted to stay with it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>

            <li> I purchased this product to see what all the hype was about.  It is a good cream for night or day but I also purchased the Bellaplex the same day.. I use the Hydroxotone during the day because of it&#x27;s SPF and the Bellaplexmat night. It turned out thiis is a good regimen for me. The Hydroxatone feels light on my skin, which makes it easy to use my same makeup products I already have,</li>
            <li> Really works great.  i also use the BB cream as well. I look ten years younger wrinkles are greatly reduced</li>

            <li> excellent product, I recommended for those who are over 40year will help take care of your fas no more to say</li>
            <li> Received the product 2 days ago. Don&#x27;t have any results yet on my skin , found the product is greasy and doesn&#x27;t sink into my skin , so when putting on makeup right after it&#x27;s too shiny. Will continue to use it but may be for only nighttime or during the day when I don&#x27;t have to put on makeup .</li>
            <li> I did expect an improvement since I&#x27;d heard good things about it &amp; it would be included in Hollywood gift baskets &amp; such. I ran out of  money so I was sad not to re-order because I knew I wanted to stay with it, it gave a wonderful &amp; youthful glow. It gave me exactly what I was hoping for! It was fun to see me looking so much better &amp; glowy-er! Just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great product. Every time I use it I get compliments on my skin. This product keeps my skin smooth and even.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted. The product was packaged very nicely and the cream came with a top cover.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and loved it. I just count afford it from the manufacture. Plan on buying again.</li>
            <li> This cream is soft, although somewhat greasy, and it appears to block the sun&#x27;s rays on my face.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> I am generally a very easy person to please but the only nice thing that I can say about this product is that it comes in a pretty blue jar.&lt;br /&gt;I really gave the Hydroxatone a very good try, I used it for four months every morning and evening, and this a summary of my results.  First of all this is a very greasy cream.  No matter how small an amount is applied, and how thin it is applied, it&#x27;s just really greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is that for me, it did not hydrate.  My skin felt dry about an hour after application, so when possible, I would reapply several times a  day.  My third major problem with this cream is that it stung my eyes.  Now the directions do state to &amp;#34;keep away from eyes&amp;#34;, so I would apply it well above my eyebrows, skip the bridge of my nose, skip any part of my face close to my eyes and just apply it lower down on my cheeks down toward my mouth, chin and jaw line, but somehow after 15 minutes or so my eyes would start to burn, and the crazy thing is that I do not have sensitive eyes.  I have used all sorts of eye lash serums, eye creams. face serums and moisturizers and I have never had a problem with burning eyes.  Any benefits from Hydroxatone...None At All.  As far a sunscreen, well SPF is only 15, which is nothing because you should use a minimum of 30.&lt;br /&gt; For me, one star is too good to rate this product.</li>
            <li> Just into my first jar and everything is as expected. My last order in 2012 was not, 2 of my jars of product were only 1/2 full. So I am happy to see, at least the first jar is packed well and full. I do like the product....I was up set so I&#x27;m very glad to see that the 1/2 filled jars may have been an accident...Quality Control is so important!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Martin</li>
            <li> I could see a difference after just one week of use along with the Bellaplex. I use the Hydroxatone in the morning and the Bellaplex at night. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does not work well at all...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different products and I love these results!  It&#x27;s a good product and the although it&#x27;s pricier than store bought, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received my package promptly. I used the cream for several days before reading the box. I was curious about the ingredients and found that my jar only had three active ingredients - all with a purpose of sunscreen only. No Matrixyl 3000, no acetyl Hexapeptide and no hyduronic acid were in this product. I believe I paid for one item and was sent something else.  I believe many people will not check the ingredients and continue using this product thinking they have the Rejuvenating Treatment.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite product for me in the past, however, the order method from the radio advertisers frequently sent additional orders of the product before needed. They also charged my credit card without notice. Ordering through Amazon seems to be the ideal situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product. It keeps dark circles under the eyes and puffiness at abeyance :)</li>
            <li> I love how this cream makes my face look and feel but as for wrinkles I&#x27;m using this to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;My large pores look a lot better though so yay. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;So am not sure if it works one wrinkles if u have them. -_-&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile now. One of the best products on the market. If you use it consistently will work wonders.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I have used it for some time and now i don&#x27;t want to go without it. This seller did everything to make my buying experience good.</li>
            <li> I canceled this order!!!  It does not work as advertised.  Very disappointed!  If it would have possible  for an extended free trial, these results may have been different.  But, I&#x27;ll never know the answer to this because I cannot continue without being charged another month for supplies.....</li>
            <li> I used the Am pm Rejuvenating  Tx before and don&#x27;t  think they sent me the right product. it&#x27;s completely opposite  to the one I&#x27;m use to ,very greasy and not as affective as the real hydroxatone. I&#x27;m hopping to get the real one next time with the youth effect.</li>
