            <li>It has awesome coverage, without being too much, and feels super light on your skin without being oily.</li>
            <li>With my combination skin :) It is light, moisturizing and does not look like a mast on the face.</li>
            <li>Gives a light shimmer, love the shade Alaska.</li>
            <li>The color I picked, Alaska, is very well suited to my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a mineral powder for I used all of my bare essentials; however, upon reading all the great reviews for this product, I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of this tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>(the SPF is a huge help when you don&#x27;t know where the day will take you).</li>
            <li>My color is polynesia, the product is medium coverage and light weight.  </li>
            <li>I have rather light olive skin and Alaska</li>
            <li>This product goes on like a light moisturizer but covers like a foundation.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go out of the house without it anymore, even when I go to the gym because it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>Gluten free is not a fad.</li>
            <li>This definitely lives up to its excellent reviews and high rating!</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite!</li>
            <li>I just bought a huge amount of NARS at a big event because the company was claiming to be 100% gluten free, testing to be sure, safe for celiacs.</li>
            <li>It gives you the perfect blurring effect without looking like you&#x27;ve tried too hard.</li>
            <li>I loved the lemony-scent of this stuff, but was ultimately disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s true with practically anything.</li>
            <li>The coverage is good too,a little better than some moisturizers with tint.</li>
            <li>I love the overall radience (and many products bandy this about but seldom deliver).</li>
            <li>I also wanted to say that it washes off nicely and is VERY easy to wash out of your brushes unlike a lot of heavy liquid/cream foundations.</li>
            <li>I have only been using NARS for two days, but I already love it!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and makes my face a very even color (I&#x27;m very blotchy) without being too dense.</li>
            <li>And, although a bit pricey, it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is really worth the money.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to many products but this has not made me break out at all.</li>
            <li>; I love that it has SPF in it, so I can use a day cream that has other effects and put this on top.</li>
            <li>It spreads/applies very easily, looks dewy and glowy in a natural way (but not too much), the color is flattering</li>
            <li>(Pick the right color the first time and you won&#x27;t have this problem!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting chemical peels and even with my skin being dry and flaking, this covers it really nicely.</li>
            <li>but they quickly discontinued it and replaced it with a so-called BB cream (roughly similar but not the formula I loved) when I got back to the states.</li>
            <li>The color &amp;#34;Alaska&amp;#34; definitely has a yellow tint, which is perfect for my red undertone--especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with tinted moisturizers a while back while living in Paris-- at the time I got hooked on Kiehl&#x27;s tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>The Laura Mercier was very similar,  but the NARS product seems to do a slightly better job.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll try a lighter shade but since the coverage seems buildable it blends with my skin tone better if I don&#x27;t load too much on.</li>
            <li>First, I have light skin, blue eyes and brown hair and Alaska matches  my skin tone exactly.  </li>
            <li>I really think you&#x27;ll like it.  </li>
            <li>I could really push the limit and see how much coverage I could get out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and it really works for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear oily and lasts my whole 9-hour work day.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the scent which is very perfumie/old-ladyesque.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t tell I have any product on my skin at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep this review short and sweet...</li>
            <li>Figured it was time for something more high-end, and let me say that you can immediately tell that this is more expensive just from the texture and formula.</li>
            <li>I maybe wish the coverage was a tiny bit better but again, buildable so maybe if I wasn&#x27;t worried about looking too yellow</li>
            <li>This gives my older complexion</li>
            <li>A little MAC gold deposit on my cheek bones, winged out cat eye and your favorite lipstick/gloss and mascara</li>
            <li>I also have roseacea and this covers the redness completely, except when it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>At first I did not like it, but now I barely notice it.</li>
            <li>If I want to look a little more natural, I mix it with my day cream and put it on together.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new go-to product.</li>
            <li>I used to use both Laura Mercier and La Mer tinted moisturizers, and a friend told me about the new Nars one.</li>
            <li>I am blonde haired, blue eyed and fair skinned with a slight tan.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>soft coverage</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly natural looking.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many foundations and this is the only one that provides coverage and doesn&#x27;t look heavy or unnatural.</li>
            <li>I got the Alaska color which was honestly a little yellow for my complexion in the winter but has been a better match once I got outside a bit this summer</li>
            <li>In general i recommend.</li>
            <li>, I decided to try Bare Essenteuals BUT</li>
            <li>I apply it with either a stippling brush or a regular old medium foundation brush.</li>
            <li>The tinted moisturizer gives my skin a natural yet dewy finish, since I have oil spots in my T zone I apply a finishing powder in that area ONLY.  </li>
            <li>I believe the NARS color suits me better than the similar color from Laura Mericer because it has a slightly more yellow base.</li>
            <li>I use a little bit of concealer for my blemishes first.</li>
            <li>I purchased Alaska and, while it&#x27;s a liiiittle darker than my natural color, it looks REALLY natural, especially when blended down my neck.</li>

            <li> I also have roseacea and this covers the redness completely, except when it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> At first I did not like it, but now I barely notice it.</li>
            <li> If I want to look a little more natural, I mix it with my day cream and put it on together.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my new go-to product.</li>
            <li> I used to use both Laura Mercier and La Mer tinted moisturizers, and a friend told me about the new Nars one.</li>
            <li> I am blonde haired, blue eyed and fair skinned with a slight tan.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> soft coverage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many foundations and this is the only one that provides coverage and doesn&#x27;t look heavy or unnatural.</li>
            <li> I got the Alaska color which was honestly a little yellow for my complexion in the winter but has been a better match once I got outside a bit this summer</li>
            <li> In general i recommend.</li>
            <li> , I decided to try Bare Essenteuals BUT</li>
            <li> I apply it with either a stippling brush or a regular old medium foundation brush.</li>
            <li> The tinted moisturizer gives my skin a natural yet dewy finish, since I have oil spots in my T zone I apply a finishing powder in that area ONLY.  </li>
            <li> I believe the NARS color suits me better than the similar color from Laura Mericer because it has a slightly more yellow base.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of concealer for my blemishes first.</li>
            <li> I purchased Alaska and, while it&#x27;s a liiiittle darker than my natural color, it looks REALLY natural, especially when blended down my neck.</li>
            <li> will say that it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on all day as other reviewers noted (I don&#x27;t have oily skin so not sure why that would be different for me than others, but whatever), but all things considered it stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> it left my skin dry, so when I read that this product is a moisturizer, I was sold!</li>
            <li> As an older person, I have very uneven skin and some blotchiness and redness in areas.  </li>
            <li> I often work very long days and this wears nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid this might be watered down or a replica of the original Nars product I usually get at Sephora, but it&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount and it covers just like a regular foundation.</li>
            <li> always on amazon, be careful about which vendor you are buying beauty and hair products from.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t figure out how I could be getting glutened when I was so careful.</li>
            <li> I got this a few days earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Your company&#x27;s policy flip flop made me and many other people literally sick.</li>
            <li> I expected it to make me look oily as I already have somewhat oily skin, but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even deduct a star for the price because I use such a small amount to cover my face that the tube lasts for months.</li>
            <li> However, I wish I&#x27;d taken a chance on a slightly darker tint.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that provides medium to heavy coverage...</li>
            <li> However, when the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer in my color was not available, I decided to try NARS.</li>
            <li> But I do have a few leftover TMs to blend it with (the Balm, CoverFx).</li>
            <li> Let me start of my saying that I&#x27;m an AA women with combination skin with a few blemishes on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> So, usually I wear NYX concealer and Loreal ture match powder foundation, and it worked for me and made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One tube lasts me at least 11 months.</li>
            <li> Now, a week later the NARS corporate position has flip flipped, which explains why I&#x27;ve been so sick, tired, and even spent a day with a horrifying migraine...</li>
            <li> and I have serious problem skin, but I never experienced any problems from this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a heavy base feel.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it. With my combination skin :) It is light, moisturizing and does not look like a mast on the face.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and easily. Matches perfectly and stays on all day! Best of all is it is light and has SPF 30!</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation! I have tried so many foundations and this is the only one that provides coverage and doesn&#x27;t look heavy or unnatural. I have very sensitive skin and I never break out from it. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this, best product for what I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this review short and sweet...I&#x27;m a huge fan of this tinted moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t like a heavy base feel.  This provides a nice light coverage and it blends with my skin tone.  Once I put it on I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup...and I love that.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that provides medium to heavy coverage...this is not for you.  Otherwise, give it a try...I really think you&#x27;ll like it.  And, although a bit pricey, it&#x27;s worth the money.  One tube lasts me at least 11 months.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice tinted moisturizer.  The color I picked, Alaska, is very well suited to my fair skin. This product does give a dewy finish to my skin.  And it has SPF 30 sun protector. The coverage is good too,a little better than some moisturizers with tint.</li>
            <li> I loved the lemony-scent of this stuff, but was ultimately disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it triggered acne-breakouts for me, and also had a tendency to uh, collect in the creases above my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not to impressed with this product. When I put it on my face it  looks greasy, oily. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It blends so well, and never looks like you&#x27;re too &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34; I love that it has SPF in it, so I can use a day cream that has other effects and put this on top. If I want to look a little more natural, I mix it with my day cream and put it on together. It gives you the perfect blurring effect without looking like you&#x27;ve tried too hard. The color &amp;#34;Alaska&amp;#34; definitely has a yellow tint, which is perfect for my red undertone--especially in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried my friend&#x27;s shade, &amp;#34;Groenland,&amp;#34; and it also looks great--definitely better if I have a bit of a tan. I&#x27;m on my third tube of this. I used to wear Laura Mercier, but this gives a bit more coverage.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with tinted moisturizers a while back while living in Paris-- at the time I got hooked on Kiehl&#x27;s tinted moisturizer but they quickly discontinued it and replaced it with a so-called BB cream (roughly similar but not the formula I loved) when I got back to the states. After that I tried LORAC&#x27;s BB cream but didn&#x27;t love it...also have been through basically all of the drugstore brands. Figured it was time for something more high-end, and let me say that you can immediately tell that this is more expensive just from the texture and formula. Smooth, creamy and very moisturizing, unlike lots of BB creams and even tinted moisturizers this does not sink into the crevices of your skin but smooths everything out and feels wonderful. I got the Alaska color which was honestly a little yellow for my complexion in the winter but has been a better match once I got outside a bit this summer (the SPF is a huge help when you don&#x27;t know where the day will take you). Next time I&#x27;ll try a lighter shade but since the coverage seems buildable it blends with my skin tone better if I don&#x27;t load too much on. (Pick the right color the first time and you won&#x27;t have this problem!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practically everything makes me break out and I have serious problem skin, but I never experienced any problems from this product. It&#x27;s wonderful for my skin and feels like I&#x27;m actually doing something good for it rather than just covering up the imperfections (of which there are many).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on all day as other reviewers noted (I don&#x27;t have oily skin so not sure why that would be different for me than others, but whatever), but all things considered it stays on pretty well. I definitely have to re-apply if I&#x27;m going out at night but that&#x27;s true with practically anything. I maybe wish the coverage was a tiny bit better but again, buildable so maybe if I wasn&#x27;t worried about looking too yellow I could really push the limit and see how much coverage I could get out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go-to product.</li>
            <li> I am on my second tube of this product.  It evens out skin tone and blends in perfectly .  It has the requirements that my dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> I am blonde haired, blue eyed and fair skinned with a slight tan.  Perfect color.  The best moisturizer, make-up I have used to date.  It has an SPF of 30 which is recommended by my dermatologist.  As an older person, I have very uneven skin and some blotchiness and redness in areas.  This gives my older complexion just the look I want and the photos of me taken with this cover looks so great.  It is really worth the money.  You get what you pay for for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and it really works for me. It is very light as if you did not put on makeup.</li>
            <li> You could call me a sales person for Laura Mercier - I love the product. However, when the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer in my color was not available, I decided to try NARS. I believe the NARS color suits me better than the similar color from Laura Mericer because it has a slightly more yellow base. It goes on very smoothly and makes my face a very even color (I&#x27;m very blotchy) without being too dense. The Laura Mercier was very similar,  but the NARS product seems to do a slightly better job. The only downside is that the NARS product has a scent to it whereas Laura Mercier does not. At first I did not like it, but now I barely notice it. I will continue to buy the NARS tinted moisturizer once I am done with this one.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a review in Lucky magazine of the best summer skin products. This definitely lives up to its excellent reviews and high rating!</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite! I used to use both Laura Mercier and La Mer tinted moisturizers, and a friend told me about the new Nars one. I adore it. It has awesome coverage, without being too much, and feels super light on your skin without being oily. The best part is that it lasted all day. Very pleased with my purchase, super pumped that I can now buy it on Amazon as well!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mineral powder for I used all of my bare essentials; however, upon reading all the great reviews for this product, I had to try it. I love it! I wasn&#x27;t in love with my mineral powder bc it left my skin dry, so when I read that this product is a moisturizer, I was sold! I needed lightweight coverage to wear to work that would give me a nice glow. This product does it all. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love the overall radience (and many products bandy this about but seldom deliver). However, I wish I&#x27;d taken a chance on a slightly darker tint. But I do have a few leftover TMs to blend it with (the Balm, CoverFx). In general i recommend. But do bear in mind what one reviewer mentioned about being ok with a yellowish cast. that works for me as i have some blotchy redness around my nose (yay).</li>
            <li> This is very nice if you want a tinted moisturizer, don&#x27;t expect it to cover up everything. This works well with layers or just a layer. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! The tinted moisturizer I was using from Smashbox can&#x27;t compare. I purchased Alaska and, while it&#x27;s a liiiittle darker than my natural color, it looks REALLY natural, especially when blended down my neck. It doesn&#x27;t appear oily and lasts my whole 9-hour work day. I also have roseacea and this covers the redness completely, except when it&#x27;s really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting chemical peels and even with my skin being dry and flaking, this covers it really nicely. I&#x27;m obscenely happy with it and will stay with NARS and this product in particular.</li>
            <li> Gives a light shimmer, love the shade Alaska. I can wear it most months (July and August I mix it with a darker shade). It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I was afraid this might be watered down or a replica of the original Nars product I usually get at Sephora, but it&#x27;s the real deal! I got this a few days earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Let me start of my saying that I&#x27;m an AA women with combination skin with a few blemishes on my cheeks. Also, I can&#x27;t wear liquid of cream foundations because my face will breakout. So, usually I wear NYX concealer and Loreal ture match powder foundation, and it worked for me and made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to try Bare Essenteuals BUT an artist at Sephora recommended that I try NARS tinted moisturizer. I&#x27;m not a stranger to NARS cosmetics and they are know for quality, well pigmented products, so I gave it a try.  My color is polynesia, the product is medium coverage and light weight.  I apply it with either a stippling brush or a regular old medium foundation brush. Not to mention that the product has SPF!! I use a little bit of concealer for my blemishes first. The tinted moisturizer gives my skin a natural yet dewy finish, since I have oil spots in my T zone I apply a finishing powder in that area ONLY.  A little MAC gold deposit on my cheek bones, winged out cat eye and your favorite lipstick/gloss and mascara and you are done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product! I also wanted to say that it washes off nicely and is VERY easy to wash out of your brushes unlike a lot of heavy liquid/cream foundations.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of tinted moisturizers and this one is by far the best. You only have to use a small amount and it covers just like a regular foundation. Feels great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply, feels really good, very smooth, will refer to a friend and definetely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have tried different BB, CC, tinted moisturizers and foundations at every price point. I find this to be the absolute best. It spreads/applies very easily, looks dewy and glowy in a natural way (but not too much), the color is flattering and I receive compliments on my skin. I often work very long days and this wears nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always on amazon, be careful about which vendor you are buying beauty and hair products from.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Good soft coverage</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It is very light and matches my skin tone perfectly. it blends in nicely with anything else too. Great product!</li>
            <li> Nice coverage and color. Lightweight. Not a fan of the scent which is very perfumie/old-ladyesque.</li>
            <li> I have only been using NARS for two days, but I already love it! I have rather light olive skin and Alaska matches me perfectly, giving me a sun-kissed yet extremely natural look. I expected it to make me look oily as I already have somewhat oily skin, but it doesn&#x27;t! Nor does it turn orange. This gives great but very light, breathable coverage. My skin is sensitive to many products but this has not made me break out at all. You only need to use a tiny bit, too. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> First, I have light skin, blue eyes and brown hair and Alaska matches  my skin tone exactly.  You really can&#x27;t tell I have any product on my skin at all and I apply it all over my face including under my eyes and over them too if I&#x27;m not going to put on eye shadow.  It&#x27;s incredibly natural looking. This product goes on like a light moisturizer but covers like a foundation.  I don&#x27;t go out of the house without it anymore, even when I go to the gym because it&#x27;s so light I don&#x27;t even feel it yet I know my face is protected from (anymore) sun damage.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and I could swear my skin has improved in texture, (smaller pores), and it&#x27;s more even - not as many discolorations.  I can&#x27;t even deduct a star for the price because I use such a small amount to cover my face that the tube lasts for months. I consider it a good value.</li>
            <li> I just bought a huge amount of NARS at a big event because the company was claiming to be 100% gluten free, testing to be sure, safe for celiacs. Now, a week later the NARS corporate position has flip flipped, which explains why I&#x27;ve been so sick, tired, and even spent a day with a horrifying migraine...and I couldn&#x27;t figure out how I could be getting glutened when I was so careful. I didn&#x27;t just believe the blogger hype - I read everything I could find on your line and then talked extensively to three of your makeup reps (who all insisted that your line is 100% safe for celiacs) before committing. Gluten free is not a fad. Your company&#x27;s policy flip flop made me and many other people literally sick. Would you allow a teeny bit fo nuts into a product, then market it to people with a nut allergy because you don&#x27;t use nut ingredients?</li>
            <li> this is the best tinted moisturizer I have ever used would deffinetly recommend it. it does exactly what it says. my face looks and feels so good. will b purchacing more</li>
