    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful soap.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for oily skin but try to use body lotion after use.</li>
            <li>This otherwise excellent soap would have gotten 5 stars, but the version sent me</li>
            <li>This is an excellent  product. !  </li>
            <li>Very good for skin.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser is great and the value can&#x27;t be best for the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my combination/sensitive skin, and it smells great.</li>

            <li>Great value for the money.</li>
            <li>Great product love it!</li>
            <li>You have to use it to understand how good it is.</li>
            <li>Kirks also makes a bar soap that is equally good</li>
            <li>To be fair, it does contain some fragrance.</li>
            <li>Well, I am not going to say that this liquid version doesn&#x27;t foam as good as the bar version does...</li>
            <li>I have always loved using Castile soap but this one in the pump makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li>I have used the bar soap and liked it so the liquid to keep at the kitchen sink was a good idea.  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Kirk&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>There are so many additives that I can&#x27;t pronounce!</li>
            <li>Love the product!  </li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer, my shins use to be flakey, even after using a moisturizer, but since using this great soap not anymore!!!</li>
            <li>Gentle and great fragance!  </li>
            <li>its just not as nice as the bar.</li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>
            <li>Nice soap.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find a liquid version of Kirk&#x27;s Castile, and pleased that it has all the qualities of the bar soap but more convenient for use in the shower.</li>
            <li>Excellent lather, and a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful option for sensitive hands.</li>
            <li>Very useful and good quality.  </li>
            <li>Cuts through grease and gets my hands clean even after working in the yard and is good for the environment as well.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>KIRK&#x27;S IS A BETTER CHOICE THAN MOST</li>
            <li>I like this dispenser better in the shower than the squeeze bottle Kirk&#x27;s uses for their shower wash.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>My favorite plus the Kirk bar soap.</li>
            <li>I truly Love this soap.</li>
            <li>A great classic find for my home.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I feel very clean and fresh after using this.  </li>
            <li>Nor will I say that it doesn&#x27;t clean...</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the clean Ivorylight scent I was used to.</li>
            <li>Washes clean.  </li>
            <li>It is the reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t state enough how much I love this castille soap!</li>
            <li>Pure, non-irritating, lasts for ages and leaves a nice scent which I would describe as fairly masculine in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than mild enough for a baby&#x27;s bath, although there will be tears aplenty if it gets into the eyes.</li>
            <li>Skin feels young and smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>This liquid soap is great for showering, and there&#x27;s no build up of soap scum in the soap holder.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>We valued it  (and still do) for its purity, sharp, soapy clean scent, potent cleaning power and voluminous suds.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that it was pure.</li>
            <li>and I really like the lather, the fragrance (think Ivory light), and especially the way it makes my skin feel, very moist, which is important since I got ezcema flare ups occasionally BEFORE I started using this soap.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>This soap really lathers well, esp.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Really like the Castile Liquid Soap w/pump.  </li>
            <li>Great beginning base to make your own liquid handsoap</li>
            <li>Lastly, 1 of the 2 bottles ordered was dented near the top.</li>
            <li>First, let me clear up a misconception that might arise from another review of this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little unusual, but refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Makes you feel clean and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin on your hands like many other soaps.</li>
            <li>young children&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Smells different, doesn&#x27;t give that intense cleansing effect you get from the bar, and</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>The bar is on a rack away from the direct water so its not that, it&#x27;s just the difference in the soaps</li>
            <li>The main and obvious difference to me was the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am lazy, I do not like to clean.</li>
            <li>We have petty hard water where I am at and this soap leaves me soft and clean every time.</li>

            <li> We have petty hard water where I am at and this soap leaves me soft and clean every time.</li>
            <li> Leaves my dry skin softer than regular soap.</li>
            <li> But, in all honesty, I expected the Liquid Soap Castile w/Pump to be the same as the bar, and it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I am curious to know whether the \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; is the same scent as the bar or the liquid.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be without this soap, although I suggest seeing if you can get it locally for a few dollars less than Amazon&#x27;s exceptionally high price.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS SO MUCH SOFTER AND LESS IRRATABLE WITH THE WELEDA PRODUCTS, AND THEY DO NOT SEEM, HARSH AND AS DRYING IN ANY WAY.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap for a very long time, and it was in use in our house when I was a child.</li>
            <li> I live in an area that has hard water and my skin was getting really dry</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t waste it, this big bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only down side to the bar is that is melts away quicker than other non-castile bar soaps, alot quicker.</li>
            <li> I had been using Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap for years but for some reason decided to try some other products.  </li>
            <li> When it is empty, I will get another one to replace it!</li>
            <li> It took less than three months</li>
            <li> I have found it takes less soap per shower</li>
            <li> Makes for less mess as the bars tend to melt away in my soap dish.  </li>
            <li> This may not bother me after I use it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It lathers just as well as the bar  using very little soap.</li>
            <li> and I usually shower twice/day.</li>
            <li> to the bar soap&#x27;s shelf life, I decided to try the liquid soap and have been using it for the past week.</li>
            <li> Sorry Kirks...doesn&#x27;t seem like it is the same product, at least, not to me.</li>
            <li> He was tired of all the girlie soap the women kept getting and putting in the mens&#x27; room.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients that some have found difficult to pronounce and have labeled \\&quot;additives\\&quot; are, in fact, common ingredients without which soap would not be soap.</li>
            <li> When buying in liquid form this soap is quite expensive, but I like the product.</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> It was not encased in anything,had the pump taped down,and was somewhat difficult to get pumping.  </li>
            <li> it is just very faint.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this soap. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  This soap really lathers well, esp. for castile.  The smell is a little unusual, but refreshing.  I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Very useful and good quality.  Would recommend it to everyone.  Very good for skin.  Skin feels young and smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> I DO LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND USED IT FOR MONTHS UNTIL WINTER CAME AND I STARTED USING WELEDA.  MY SKIN IS SO MUCH SOFTER AND LESS IRRATABLE WITH THE WELEDA PRODUCTS, AND THEY DO NOT SEEM, HARSH AND AS DRYING IN ANY WAY.  KIRK&#x27;S IS A BETTER CHOICE THAN MOST BUT THE GERMAN&#x27;S (WELEDA, DR. HAUSCKA (SP), AND LAGONA) SEEM TO KNOW THEIR STUFF WITH SKIN/BEAUTY CARE.</li>
            <li> Looking for products that dont aggravate my nasal allergies (Irish Spring, Coast, etc) I found this one. You have to use it to understand how good it is. Kirks also makes a bar soap that is equally good and they leave it up to you whether to put on cologne after you wash.</li>
            <li> Well-made shoe but I vote with my feet in buying shoes and my feet said no.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer, my shins use to be flakey, even after using a moisturizer, but since using this great soap not anymore!!!</li>
            <li> I am lazy, I do not like to clean. This liquid soap is great for showering, and there&#x27;s no build up of soap scum in the soap holder. Keeps my shower/tub looking cleaner for longer. If you don&#x27;t waste it, this big bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> When buying in liquid form this soap is quite expensive, but I like the product. It&#x27;s a wonderful option for sensitive hands. ie. young children&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this to take to work with him.  He was tired of all the girlie soap the women kept getting and putting in the mens&#x27; room.  He has done nothing but rave about it since he got it.  He loves the soap and has been so happy not to have to use the girlie stuff anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have a problem with fragrance and this has almost NO smell! To be fair, it does contain some fragrance. it is just very faint. I will be buying more when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Kirk&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Great beginning base to make your own liquid handsoap</li>
            <li> If you have ever used Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soap, then you know that it does not play.  It cleanses like nothing you have ever experienced before...right? Well, I am not going to say that this liquid version doesn&#x27;t foam as good as the bar version does...cause it does. Nor will I say that it doesn&#x27;t clean...cause it does.  But, in all honesty, I expected the Liquid Soap Castile w/Pump to be the same as the bar, and it isn&#x27;t.  Sorry.  Smells different, doesn&#x27;t give that intense cleansing effect you get from the bar, and so, I think I will stick to the bar version.  I will NOT be buying the Liquid version again.  Sorry Kirks...doesn&#x27;t seem like it is the same product, at least, not to me.</li>
            <li> I actually had to send it back because the soap leaked out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap.  I feel very clean and fresh after using this.  I like this dispenser better in the shower than the squeeze bottle Kirk&#x27;s uses for their shower wash.</li>
            <li> We have petty hard water where I am at and this soap leaves me soft and clean every time. I appreciate that this soap doesn&#x27;t have an over powering fragrance too. The dispenser is great and the value can&#x27;t be best for the product. A great classic find for my home.</li>
            <li> I live in an area that has hard water and my skin was getting really dry and I tried Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap after reading other reviews on Amazon and my skin is soft again!</li>
            <li> Great product love it!</li>
            <li> Pure, non-irritating, lasts for ages and leaves a nice scent which I would describe as fairly masculine in your bathroom. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This is like the bar soap only in liquid form.  Makes you feel clean and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin on your hands like many other soaps.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it was pure. There are so many additives that I can&#x27;t pronounce! Not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> First, let me clear up a misconception that might arise from another review of this product. The ingredients that some have found difficult to pronounce and have labeled \\&quot;additives\\&quot; are, in fact, common ingredients without which soap would not be soap. None of them are unnatural or toxic in any way, facts which the reader can confirm by looking them up online (I don&#x27;t think this is the place for an in-depth discussion of the chemical components of soap). Suffice to say there is nothing in this soap that anyone could object to as an additive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap for a very long time, and it was in use in our house when I was a child. We valued it  (and still do) for its purity, sharp, soapy clean scent, potent cleaning power and voluminous suds. It&#x27;s more than mild enough for a baby&#x27;s bath, although there will be tears aplenty if it gets into the eyes. I was delighted to find a liquid version of Kirk&#x27;s Castile, and pleased that it has all the qualities of the bar soap but more convenient for use in the shower. I won&#x27;t be without this soap, although I suggest seeing if you can get it locally for a few dollars less than Amazon&#x27;s exceptionally high price.</li>
            <li> Gentle and great fragance!  Excellent for oily skin but try to use body lotion after use. I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Nice clean scent.  Leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Really like the Castile Liquid Soap w/pump.  Makes for less mess as the bars tend to melt away in my soap dish.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about droping the soap in the shower either.  Just measure out the amount you need and wash away.  Overall..great product!!  Will order again!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t state enough how much I love this castille soap! It&#x27;s perfect for my combination/sensitive skin, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to add a bit about the differences I noticed between the \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; and their bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the bar for about 6 months and I really like the lather, the fragrance (think Ivory light), and especially the way it makes my skin feel, very moist, which is important since I got ezcema flare ups occasionally BEFORE I started using this soap. The only down side to the bar is that is melts away quicker than other non-castile bar soaps, alot quicker. I go through a bar every week and I usually shower twice/day. The bar is on a rack away from the direct water so its not that, it&#x27;s just the difference in the soaps nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the bar soap&#x27;s shelf life, I decided to try the liquid soap and have been using it for the past week. It lathers just as well as the bar  using very little soap. The main and obvious difference to me was the fragrance. It is the reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars. It wasn&#x27;t the clean Ivorylight scent I was used to. It&#x27;s not objectionable but IMHO its just not as nice as the bar. This may not bother me after I use it for a few weeks but I just wanted to note it since no one else has mentioned it. I am curious to know whether the \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; is the same scent as the bar or the liquid. Hopefully someone will mention it.</li>
            <li> I had been using Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap for years but for some reason decided to try some other products.  It took less than three months and I am back.  I have found it takes less soap per shower and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you are coated in something when you are done.  Enough experimentation - I&#x27;m back for life.</li>
            <li> Nice smell my face likes it, and it cleans well.  My favorite plus the Kirk bar soap.</li>
            <li> we bought this product because we have a septic system and are trying to cut back on the amount of detergents we use. I have used the bar soap and liked it so the liquid to keep at the kitchen sink was a good idea.  Cuts through grease and gets my hands clean even after working in the yard and is good for the environment as well.  When it is empty, I will get another one to replace it!</li>
            <li> This otherwise excellent soap would have gotten 5 stars, but the version sent me had a somewhat different scent then the original,which has such a pleasant,mild citrus aroma.  The soap was not in a blister pack,as shown here.  It was not encased in anything,had the pump taped down,and was somewhat difficult to get pumping.  Lastly, 1 of the 2 bottles ordered was dented near the top.</li>
            <li> Buy this soap . Worth every penny. Your skin will feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent  product. !  I truly Love this soap. I have always loved using Castile soap but this one in the pump makes it easier to use. Excellent lather, and a fresh, clean scent. Multiple uses. Great value for the money. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice soap.  Washes clean.  Leaves my dry skin softer than regular soap.</li>
