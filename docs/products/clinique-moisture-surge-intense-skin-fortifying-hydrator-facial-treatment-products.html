            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Good service, excellent delivery, I am very satisfied with the product, it is almost too rich.</li>
            <li>This cream is excellent and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this feels on my face, great product.</li>
            <li>You cannot ask for anything more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinique for probably 35 plus years and love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>amazing product.</li>
            <li>and I previously really loved clinique moisture surge, so I decided to try this moisturizer to see if it would provide even more moisture.</li>
            <li>You will love this as it feels good going on and keep your under eye area moist.</li>
            <li>Clinque Moisture can be a bit greasy on hot days, but a great nighttime moistureizer.</li>
            <li>I feel it could soak in a bit better.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite moisturizers that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love this&lt;</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy her more if she continues to like it.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve been way better off with just some Aloe gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Even $10 drug store products are better than this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff, feels like silk</li>
            <li>Love this product, best for dry climates.keeps moisture all day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and used it before, however this jar had a strangest chemical scent that doenot belong to the Clinique original brand</li>
            <li>read ingredients, or try to, and I think this is parable free, and it&#x27;s def moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is kinda like paint?&lt;br /&gt;Not strong, just not pretty or attractive</li>
            <li>This 60-year old gal is pleased!</li>
            <li>need to spend this much for an ok moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and need more moisture.  </li>
            <li>I love the clean and botanical scent of this, and I don&#x27;t think it would bother people who are sensitive to fragrances because the scent dissipates rather quickly upon absorption.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This product is just ok - not as rich as I expected.  </li>
            <li>However, I would absolutely recommend  it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers - this one sinks in and is not greasy, also you don&#x27;t need much it goes a long way - the price is good too</li>
            <li>is my first time buy cream online.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t find it to be any better than the well-known drug store</li>
            <li>intense right</li>
            <li>I wish I would have gotten this long ago, love clinique</li>
            <li>Shipping very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Has a very chemical like odor.</li>
            <li>I would get up in the morning and my skin was very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, gentle, and very hydrating!  </li>
            <li>I have another skin care system that I use religiously, but in the winter when my skin is extra dry, or if I have spent time in a chlorine pool or the sun, this is like getting a tranfusion its so good!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is totally worth the price, and since with normal use you really only need a pinky finger&#x27;s worth, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I just started using a new night cream that makes my face soft and plump in the morning.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It completely eliminates those flaky patches of skin.</li>
            <li>After my babies were born (2 yr old and 4 month old)</li>
            <li>I have really dry mature skin and at first this seemed to work</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light enough to wear undermakeup but heavy enough to really feel like it works.</li>
            <li>I understand that everybody&#x27;s skin is different, so everyone may not have the same positive results.</li>
            <li>During the dry winter months, my sensitive skin requires a heavier cream that provides a high level of moisture.  </li>
            <li>....actually my 24 yr old daughter recommended it for my dry, flaking patches between my eyebrows and each side of my nose.....</li>
            <li>I use Lancome foundation and even after putting this moisturizer on and letting it have time to air dry for a good 5 minutes, I brush on my foundation and it streaks like crazy.</li>
            <li>I use a light application in the am and then if my skin ever feels raw or extra dry, i slather a little extra on at night and wake up with my skin 98% back to normal.</li>

            <li> My skin has been so dry</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my dry, peeling skin at all either.</li>
            <li> great product to use - will never be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like this cream because my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> My face is very dry.</li>
            <li> However, I get some dry patches on my face during the colder winter months, and I use a small amount of this stuff in conjunction with my regular night cream.</li>
            <li> would not recommend for people to purchase this product through a seller other than Clinique because the product might not be authentic.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Cleaned my face with my usual Cerave cleanser, rinsed and dried my face and neck, applied this hydrator, and woke up to improved skin: smaller pores, and plumper, tighter skin.</li>
            <li> After putting on this product, my face becomes very oily, dirty and dull-looking.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few products I can wear without an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This product allows my skin to be hydrated without that greasy, heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> This does not fit that bill.  </li>
            <li> It unfortunately didn&#x27;t soak completely into my skin.</li>
            <li> waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product everyday for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that problem at all with my usual moisture surge extended thirst relief.</li>
            <li> It was not the same color and acutally had a chemical smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice and broke out terrible.</li>
            <li> , I just happened to purchase the wrong moisture surge.</li>
            <li> I know I couldn&#x27;t put makeup over it because the makeup would have gotten stuck in the weird texture and stickiness of the residue.</li>
            <li> But as soon as I put on this clinique product, my face becomes dirty and oily-looking again!</li>
            <li> I hate the feeling of a lotion, eww!</li>

            <li> This cream is excellent and well worth the money.  I will buy it again.  Makes my skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
            <li> I love this&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sorta a spongy gel texture&lt;br /&gt;The smell is kinda like paint?&lt;br /&gt;Not strong, just not pretty or attractive smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I read ingredients, or try to, and I think this is parable free, and it&#x27;s def moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I like this cream because my skin is very dry.I love it.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time buy cream online.Shipping very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
            <li> I understand that everybody&#x27;s skin is different, so everyone may not have the same positive results. But I bought this moisturizer this week and noticed a difference after only one application! Cleaned my face with my usual Cerave cleanser, rinsed and dried my face and neck, applied this hydrator, and woke up to improved skin: smaller pores, and plumper, tighter skin. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it&#x27;s close. This 60-year old gal is pleased!</li>
            <li> This was not what I buy at Macy&#x27;s. It was not the same color and acutally had a chemical smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice and broke out terrible. This product was not Clinique Moisture Surge at all.</li>
            <li> this is the best skin moisturizer for my face I have ever found.  I have highly sensitive skin and this is one of the few products I can wear without an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This is THE best hydrator I have ever found.  I have another skin care system that I use religiously, but in the winter when my skin is extra dry, or if I have spent time in a chlorine pool or the sun, this is like getting a tranfusion its so good!  You just need the littlest bit on your skin because it glides on so well.  If you need that extra &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; to your skin care to feel hydrated like a child&#x27;s skin, then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> So happy I found this on amazon...my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer that has never caused me to break out after continued use. it&#x27;s light enough to wear undermakeup but heavy enough to really feel like it works. I use a light application in the am and then if my skin ever feels raw or extra dry, i slather a little extra on at night and wake up with my skin 98% back to normal. This stuff is totally worth the price, and since with normal use you really only need a pinky finger&#x27;s worth, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and I don&#x27;t use this as my regular daily moisturizer. However, I get some dry patches on my face during the colder winter months, and I use a small amount of this stuff in conjunction with my regular night cream. It completely eliminates those flaky patches of skin. You cannot ask for anything more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique for probably 35 plus years and love it! I love this moisturizer too, I just happened to purchase the wrong moisture surge. This one is great if you are not putting it on under a foundation. I use Lancome foundation and even after putting this moisturizer on and letting it have time to air dry for a good 5 minutes, I brush on my foundation and it streaks like crazy. I don&#x27;t have that problem at all with my usual moisture surge extended thirst relief. Guess I will just have to use this one when I&#x27;m not putting my foundation on.</li>
            <li> After my babies were born (2 yr old and 4 month old) my skin has been through all types of extremes. This product allows my skin to be hydrated without that greasy, heavy feeling. I&#x27;m sticking with this one!</li>
            <li> Has a very chemical like odor.</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels on my face, great product. I wish I would have gotten this long ago, love clinique</li>
            <li> I bought for her and she&#x27;s happy with it. I&#x27;ll buy her more if she continues to like it. The container is smaller than it appears so you might want to buy extra.</li>
            <li> I have really dry mature skin and at first this seemed to work but after a couple of weeks it stopped working. I would get up in the morning and my skin was very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I would not tell anyone to use this.</li>
            <li> Love this product, best for dry climates.keeps moisture all day.  Wish I could have found it sooner.  Recommend for all types of skin</li>
            <li> Came in 2 days... I couldn&#x27;t have gotten to the store any faster. I have used this product everyday for the past 5 years. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is just ok - not as rich as I expected.  During the dry winter months, my sensitive skin requires a heavier cream that provides a high level of moisture.  This does not fit that bill.  I personally don&#x27;t find it to be any better than the well-known drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to spend this much for an ok moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great way to get clinique products without driving miles to a mall.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so dry and I previously really loved clinique moisture surge, so I decided to try this moisturizer to see if it would provide even more moisture. It unfortunately didn&#x27;t soak completely into my skin. It left my skin feeling quite tacky for the next couple hour. By the end of the day, I could still feel it on my skin. I hate the feeling of a lotion, eww! I know I couldn&#x27;t put makeup over it because the makeup would have gotten stuck in the weird texture and stickiness of the residue. It didn&#x27;t help my dry, peeling skin at all either. I gave up on it after a couple days.</li>
            <li> I love this product and used it before, however this jar had a strangest chemical scent that doenot belong to the Clinique original brand</li>
            <li> I am a swimmer, who is exposed to chlorine often. It has left my skin extremely dry sometimes my skin feels like its on fire from the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the moisture surge intense right after I get out of the shower and let me tell you it feels amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommended this product to anybody who ever feels like their face is on fire or continuously scratches their faces from dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend for people to purchase this product through a seller other than Clinique because the product might not be authentic.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> this is the only moisturizer i will ever use again! non sticky creamy formula that instantly makes your skin feel like you just had a facial. i even have my husband using it!</li>
            <li> ....actually my 24 yr old daughter recommended it for my dry, flaking patches between my eyebrows and each side of my nose.....amazing product.</li>
            <li> My face is very dry. After putting on this product, my face becomes very oily, dirty and dull-looking. Doesn&#x27;t give my face that plump, moisturized look AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I just started using a new night cream that makes my face soft and plump in the morning. Great. But as soon as I put on this clinique product, my face becomes dirty and oily-looking again! I would&#x27;ve been way better off with just some Aloe gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Even $10 drug store products are better than this.</li>
            <li> Clinque Moisture can be a bit greasy on hot days, but a great nighttime moistureizer. Would suggest to a friend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff, feels like silk</li>
            <li> great product to use - will never be disappointed! You will love this as it feels good going on and keep your under eye area moist.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer!!</li>
