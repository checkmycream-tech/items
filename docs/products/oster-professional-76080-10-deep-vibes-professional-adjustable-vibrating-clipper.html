            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>Perfect function.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>My husband says they work excellent!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good to know!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of clippers and these are the best.</li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>These are great clippers.  </li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>These were anything but great.  </li>
            <li>I abused mine and got 4 good years out of them.  </li>
            <li>These are magnetic clippers though so maybe that wouldn&#x27;t be a good comparison.  </li>
            <li>Great for trimming your own hair or the apprentice barber.</li>
            <li>They work ok.  </li>
            <li>but it is ok.</li>
            <li>oster is probably the best clipper out there i like to keep my hair short and the description of the product didnt say that there were guards included and Amazon suggested purchasing trimmer guards with this product</li>
            <li>These are a good substitute for the Fast Feed clippers also made by Oster.  </li>
            <li>I know these are a newer model but in time if Oster continues to build these with quality I&#x27;m sure there will be more positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly my hair and is made in USA.</li>
            <li>I can finally Fade my hair on my own!</li>
            <li>Was delivered very fast (about 3 days after ordering it (over a weekend!)</li>
            <li>I own quite a few sets of professional clippers and these are great.  </li>
            <li>You could run the Wahl&#x27;s a long time with good trimming results.  </li>
            <li>so I bought this new one that is even better.</li>
            <li>Box was like it was fresh off of the store shelves.</li>
            <li>I order this item because it was like the first one we had that lasted 30 yrs.</li>
            <li>I received this product yesterday, upon opening, can see the Oster cosmetic logo cover on the front of the clipper is falling off, the top clipping blade is crooked, and the blades looked used.  </li>
            <li>This one was not as good quality as I have had in the past.</li>
            <li>They ARE hefty weight wise, but if these clippers are taken care of, they should last a long time.</li>
            <li>People ask who&#x27;s my barber all the time, haha.</li>
            <li>We rated it as a four because we have not had much use as yet.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and very dependable.</li>
            <li>The clipper was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>There are a couple of other clipper sets on the market but this one seems to be better than the others.</li>
            <li>So far it has perform as well as the first one.</li>
            <li>The thumb adjustment lever that raises and lowers the blades seems a bit stiff initially, but I suspect it will move more smoothly with use and repeated lubrication.</li>
            <li>So it was highly recommended before.</li>
            <li>Remarkably better than the previous 2 clipper we had at home, for few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Wish they had a little more power.  </li>
            <li>Excellent price also (Oster can be quite expensive for the really Professional models), couldn&#x27;t find them at this price at local Beauty Supply shops.</li>
            <li>great product for cutting hubbys hair</li>
            <li>I was looking for a great pair of clippers for cutting hair at home.  </li>
            <li>This thing is loud.</li>
            <li>The sizing combs are obnoxiously loud when installed and the clippers are on.  </li>
            <li>i had one about 12 years ago that just got old.</li>
            <li>The Oster Deep Vibes 76080 model is similar in design, weight, and construction to the older 284 B model and it&#x27;s still American made.</li>
            <li>An added bonus, the Deep Vibes 76080 uses the same plastic guide combs (Oster 6 piece set 76926) as the old 284 B model.</li>
            <li>These Oster&#x27;s get bogged down easily like</li>

            <li> One thing you should know is these use the same gaurds as other Oster clippers</li>
            <li> It woke my sleeping daughter 3 rooms away through a closed door.</li>
            <li> the blade drive doesn&#x27;t have much power behind it, once the blades start to heat up forget it.  </li>
            <li> of course i open the box and discover guards included once you pay return shipping and restocking fee you waste just about what you pay for the guards</li>
            <li> Been a fan of Oster hair clippers/shavers since my first barber began cutting my hair with them and my dad only buys Oster brand shavers and trimmers, so I&#x27;ve decided to keep that going.</li>
            <li> I usually buy only Oster brand hair clippers.</li>
            <li> This one is a little louder than i excepted</li>
            <li> I began cutting my hair myself years ago and this model beats the previous Oster Clippers I&#x27;ve had by far, with the adjustable lever</li>
            <li> Occasionally the will be unable too cut through thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> The sliding on/off switch is now covered by a small thumb guard that should help keep excess oil and hair clippings out of the switch mechanism.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use, does not cut hair well</li>
            <li> They keep turning off in the middle of cutting hair, and they also keep going on and off, bad experience.</li>
            <li> If you order a set of these and they don&#x27;t perform you just have a bad set.  </li>
            <li> Just going to get a refund but am disappointed with Oster.</li>
            <li> I bought another brand but was very disappointed in it because the plastic comb and some of the attachments were bent.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, so returning.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE item.</li>

            <li> They work ok.  Wish they had a little more power.  Occasionally the will be unable too cut through thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This thing is loud. Hopefully for Oster, i got a defective product. It woke my sleeping daughter 3 rooms away through a closed door. Just going to get a refund but am disappointed with Oster. Going to stick with Wahl.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Pro Quality</li>
            <li> These are great clippers.  Says made in USA.  Perfect function.  Use then every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am Very happy with this purchase! Was delivered very fast (about 3 days after ordering it (over a weekend!) and 3 days before it was scheduled to arrive!)Product Box was like it was fresh off of the store shelves. Been a fan of Oster hair clippers/shavers since my first barber began cutting my hair with them and my dad only buys Oster brand shavers and trimmers, so I&#x27;ve decided to keep that going. Excellent price also (Oster can be quite expensive for the really Professional models), couldn&#x27;t find them at this price at local Beauty Supply shops. I began cutting my hair myself years ago and this model beats the previous Oster Clippers I&#x27;ve had by far, with the adjustable lever I can finally Fade my hair on my own! People ask who&#x27;s my barber all the time, haha. Great Seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. A Plus is that this product has the Made in America seal!</li>
            <li> They keep turning off in the middle of cutting hair, and they also keep going on and off, bad experience.</li>
            <li> great product for cutting hubbys hair</li>
            <li> I usually buy only Oster brand hair clippers. This one was not as good quality as I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> My husband says they work excellent!</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this product.  I was looking for a great pair of clippers for cutting hair at home.  These were anything but great.  Even after adjustments and oil, still pulled hair when in use.  These found their way into the trash after the third use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a replacement for my trusty Oster 284 Series B clippers which died after 24 years of regular use. The Oster Deep Vibes 76080 model is similar in design, weight, and construction to the older 284 B model and it&#x27;s still American made. The sliding on/off switch is now covered by a small thumb guard that should help keep excess oil and hair clippings out of the switch mechanism. The thumb adjustment lever that raises and lowers the blades seems a bit stiff initially, but I suspect it will move more smoothly with use and repeated lubrication. An added bonus, the Deep Vibes 76080 uses the same plastic guide combs (Oster 6 piece set 76926) as the old 284 B model. How convenient!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had the Wahl clippers in the same price range you&#x27;ll regret the purchase of this Oster trimmer.  You could run the Wahl&#x27;s a long time with good trimming results.  I abused mine and got 4 good years out of them.  These Oster&#x27;s get bogged down easily like the blade drive doesn&#x27;t have much power behind it, once the blades start to heat up forget it.  The sizing combs are obnoxiously loud when installed and the clippers are on.  I&#x27;ll probably never purchase Oster trimmers again, avoid these.</li>
            <li> llego a tiempo, muy bien todo, los recomiendo muy responsables.</li>
            <li> I order this item because it was like the first one we had that lasted 30 yrs. So far it has perform as well as the first one. We hope it lasts  as long. We rated it as a four because we have not had much use as yet.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the clippers</li>
            <li> I own quite a few sets of professional clippers and these are great.  If you order a set of these and they don&#x27;t perform you just have a bad set.  These are a good substitute for the Fast Feed clippers also made by Oster.  These are magnetic clippers though so maybe that wouldn&#x27;t be a good comparison.  I know these are a newer model but in time if Oster continues to build these with quality I&#x27;m sure there will be more positive reviews.  One thing you should know is these use the same gaurds as other Oster clippers but you can use Andis gaurds on Oster clippers.  I don&#x27;t know why I included that but it&#x27;s good to know!!!</li>
            <li> It cuts smoothly my hair and is made in USA. Remarkably better than the previous 2 clipper we had at home, for few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Well made clippers that stand the test of time. Professionals use these for a reason. They are well made and reasonably quiet. Great for trimming your own hair or the apprentice barber. They ARE hefty weight wise, but if these clippers are taken care of, they should last a long time.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE item. Stopped working properly after about 3 uses. Don&#x27;t bother buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of clippers and these are the best. Others pull hair while they cut and these will glide through.</li>
            <li> i had one about 12 years ago that just got old. This one is a little louder than i excepted but it is ok.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use, does not cut hair well</li>
            <li> oster is probably the best clipper out there i like to keep my hair short and the description of the product didnt say that there were guards included and Amazon suggested purchasing trimmer guards with this product and i did.wasted 26 bucks cause of course i open the box and discover guards included once you pay return shipping and restocking fee you waste just about what you pay for the guards so i kept them. this is the only reason i rated the clippers at 4</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for over 25 years now and used an Oster clipper set. The cord finally shorted out so I bought this new one that is even better. There are a couple of other clipper sets on the market but this one seems to be better than the others. I bought another brand but was very disappointed in it because the plastic comb and some of the attachments were bent. Also they did not include the slanted attachments to trim around the ears. I would recommend this brand over all of the rest. It is reasonably priced and very dependable.</li>
            <li> It never worked. From day one i received it, it did not come on. it is still in its packet as a junk in my store</li>
            <li> The clipper was more than I expected. It was recommended to me by my barber teacher. So it was highly recommended before.</li>
            <li> I had an Oster before and this one does not disappoint. I like how it cuts close to my scalp since I have very short hair. Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I consider Oster a quality brand.  I received this product yesterday, upon opening, can see the Oster cosmetic logo cover on the front of the clipper is falling off, the top clipping blade is crooked, and the blades looked used.  Very disappointed, so returning.</li>
