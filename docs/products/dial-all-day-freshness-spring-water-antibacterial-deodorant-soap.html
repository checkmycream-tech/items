            <li>Much better value!</li>
            <li>Glad we can get it through Amazon!</li>
            <li>Excellent product highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I cannot use Dove products, even though they are supposed to be the best for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the world&#x27;s greatest soap because it&#x27;s plain and excellent.</li>
            <li>Nice on skin, the smell is fine</li>
            <li>Dial Basics is one of my favorite bar soaps.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this soap.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance reminds me of the Pikaki  flower and is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more when these run out.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap cheap and cleans nicely</li>
            <li>And skin is looking and feeling Much, Much Better.</li>
            <li>My dad who is 94 likes product.  :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps.</li>
            <li>Had bought this item before seeing that i had become allergic to the perfume that many of the soaps used.</li>
            <li>nice and clean.</li>
            <li>This soap is great for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this on Amazon, and for less than $1 a bar, I consider it a great deal!</li>
            <li>The soap has a very light and pleasant fragrance and it seems that it really rinses off very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So light it almost smells like there is no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is a great simple soap.</li>
            <li>I had to use my wife&#x27;s &amp;#34;Kirks&amp;#34; soap which cleaned great, makes lots of lather, and left no odor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s flowery, but light --</li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t do that, but it still works great on my oily, Irish skin.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Be aware it does contain fragrance in the ingredients, but the scent is very, very light.  </li>
            <li>It is a clean scent not flowery or fruity.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t CLEAN a good enough aroma all by itself?  </li>
            <li>This product replaces Dial&#x27;s &#x27;Pure &amp; Natural&#x27; bar soap, which I loved but disappeared from store shelves some years ago.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>Very consistent texture, scent and results...</li>
            <li>Nice alternative to regular soap.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, received a big free batch while on deployment and soon realized that my body is far more accepting to this as opposed to other types of men&#x27;s body wash.</li>
            <li>My skin very sensitive so important that it doesn&#x27;t have perfume in it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean, but not dried out.  </li>
            <li>It also rinses off completely ( no left over residue ) RINSES CLEAN !  </li>
            <li>This soap can also double for a strong solvent based soaps that ruin your skin.</li>
            <li>This soap is PURE soap ( No allergy problems at all ).</li>
            <li>I figured I’d give it a shot and hoped I would find it to be an inexpensive, but gentle cleansing bath bar...</li>
            <li>And I have never had to use this medicine on my whole body, ever</li>
            <li>; that don&#x27;t actually get my skin squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>It is the main soap that I use to wash my hands.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like most soaps that have harsh antibiotic junk in them that give me contact dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap in the entire world and it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>There is a slight odor that resembles a fragrance despite containing none, most likely the fresh scent of natural soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, lots of people (myself included) may have sensitive skin issues, and when they say hypoallergenic on the label, (I know it isn’t necessarily all natural, but,) most expect the product not to further inflame or damage the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my own experience so it may work for those who are less sensitive, but in my case, it was definitely a no.</li>
            <li>I hear that Dial also sells the same soap under a different name (Pure &amp; Natural) for a higher price; get this one instead.  </li>
            <li>It is hypoallergenic and does not irritate my sensitive, allergic skin.  </li>
            <li>I was completely mislead on the pricing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a ginger and have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Feels and smells like old school soap.  </li>
            <li>This is the only soap I use, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, anyway I read the reviews on Basis (albeit by Dial) and they were mostly fairly reasonable by other persons with sensitive skin issues, so</li>
            <li>people just do better with more natural, less complicated products and currently I am alternating between Kirk&#x27;s Coco Castile Fragrance-Free Soap and Natural-Cosmetics&#x27; African Black Soap (both here on Amazon) and Nasabb&#x27;s natural Honey Oatmeal Soap (Nasabb.com).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why Dial stopped selling their original Hypo Allergenic soap &amp;#34;Pure &amp; Natural&amp;#34;, but this soap sucks.</li>
            <li>Though the Germans who made my &amp;#34;Pure &amp; Natural&amp;#34; soap (which I used for years) swore that they&#x27;d stopped making it &amp;#34;because not enough was being sold&amp;#34;, it seems they rejiggered the formula for &amp;#34;Dial&amp;#34; (which I&#x27;d never liked), because this is pretty much a clone of &amp;#34;Pure &amp; Natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my thighs completely after using the first bar for no more than a week.</li>
            <li>This is one of the only soaps that does not dry out my hands.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It seems to me that someone at Dial, or up the food chain at Henkel could understand that a hypoallergenic product that causes a sinus flareup is not really hypoallergenic at all.</li>
            <li> ; is listed as an ingredient, it&#x27;s not very strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had also tried baby soaps but to no positive results, this dial soap did the trick.</li>
            <li> The only quibble I have is that the bars are rather small.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, it has no scent, deodorant, coloring or other additives.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had to wash my hands with other soap after handling this one.</li>
            <li> Use it especially if you get the small ingrown hair spots anywhere on your person, like I do.</li>
            <li> after breaking out in a rash from using harsher industry bars such as Coast, regular Dial and even the all-gentle master Oil of Olay (go figure on that one—but I think they changed the formulary because I have tried it in the past without any negative reaction)</li>
            <li> soap is long lasting and cleans without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately this is not a product that can be recommended for very sensitive skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, F-minus minus / Zero stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> … I was a little worried as to what to try next…</li>
            <li> This soap is heavily perfumed.  </li>
            <li> I returned the soap the day after it arrived and put a note in the reason box that it was heavily perfumed.  </li>
            <li> I literally threw this soap in the garbage within a few minutes of receiving it because I wanted it out of my house.</li>
            <li> and I think it is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within 5-minutes of use, my skin felt very tight and itchy</li>
            <li> I usually pay @ $.99 per 3 pack bars, and this order came out to paying $.95 per bar which is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> and I broke out in weird red hives</li>
            <li> And we are now getting rid of all Basis/ Dial type products as they seem to be the worst offenders by far, so far -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It does not contain any artificial colors it is white.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather well, and worst of all it doesn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li> And can you believe, it&#x27;s next to impossible to find in the stores!</li>
            <li> Unable to locate in a store in my area.  </li>
            <li> It smells like the fake floral/honeysuckle scent used in some insect poisons, or fertilizer products, to cover the smell of their chemicals.</li>
            <li> For people like me with fairly common petro-chemical allergies, the fake fragrance is a guaranteed headache at least and nausea at worst.</li>
            <li> Heavy perfumes are one of the worst things for my allergies.  </li>
            <li> Bad form Dial</li>
            <li> Terrible soap.</li>
            <li> I get sinus infections with terrible sinus headaches.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dial Basics is one of my favorite bar soaps.  It is the main soap that I use to wash my hands.  It is hypoallergenic and does not irritate my sensitive, allergic skin.  Be aware it does contain fragrance in the ingredients, but the scent is very, very light.  So light it almost smells like there is no fragrance.  It is a clean scent not flowery or fruity.  It does not contain any artificial colors it is white. This is one of the only soaps that does not dry out my hands.  It is a great simple soap.</li>
            <li> I recently started getting skin rashes in response to a lot of soaps and detergents, so I&#x27;ve been switching to hypoallergenic products.  This soap has been working great for me.  I hear that Dial also sells the same soap under a different name (Pure &amp; Natural) for a higher price; get this one instead.  Much better value!</li>
            <li> my wife loves the soap</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was completely mislead on the pricing.  I usually pay @ $.99 per 3 pack bars, and this order came out to paying $.95 per bar which is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> This soap is heavily perfumed.  Heavy perfumes are one of the worst things for my allergies.  Why is it that people who design and make our products feel the need to add fragrances to everything??  Isn&#x27;t CLEAN a good enough aroma all by itself?  I returned the soap the day after it arrived and put a note in the reason box that it was heavily perfumed.  It seems to me that someone at Dial, or up the food chain at Henkel could understand that a hypoallergenic product that causes a sinus flareup is not really hypoallergenic at all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap.  I&#x27;m a ginger and have sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t like most soaps that have harsh antibiotic junk in them that give me contact dermatitis.  Likewise, I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;beauty bars&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t actually get my skin squeaky clean.  This is the perfect medium for me, but unfortunately it&#x27;s become difficult to find locally.  I was pleased to find this on Amazon, and for less than $1 a bar, I consider it a great deal!</li>
            <li> I needed an antibacterial soap for folliculitis, but soap fumes give me headaches.  This is the only soap on the market I can use!  PLEASE DON&#x27;T STOP MAKING IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THanks</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap in the entire world and it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find in stores.  Fragrance reminds me of the Pikaki  flower and is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now and I have not had an issue. I will purchase this product again. Great quality. Cleans well. Nice on skin, the smell is fine don&#x27;t know what people are talking about. I am sensitive to smells and I think it is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  No scent-  nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;Basic&amp;#34; soap, no anti-bacterial stuff or deodorant in it so it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin. And can you believe, it&#x27;s next to impossible to find in the stores! Glad we can get it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Will purchase more when these run out.  My skin very sensitive so important that it doesn&#x27;t have perfume in it.  Nice alternative to regular soap.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I cannot use Dove products, even though they are supposed to be the best for sensitive skin.  This is a great alternative - and is more affordable.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap this soap does not have any perfumes or smells .  This soap is PURE soap ( No allergy problems at all ). It also rinses off completely ( no left over residue ) RINSES CLEAN !  The only down side is if you have real dry skin this soap will dry your skin ( It will remove ALL oil from your skin ). This soap can also double for a strong solvent based soaps that ruin your skin. This soap won&#x27;t do any damage to your skin at all .</li>
            <li> This product replaces Dial&#x27;s &#x27;Pure &amp; Natural&#x27; bar soap, which I loved but disappeared from store shelves some years ago.  The only quibble I have is that the bars are rather small.</li>
            <li> I like this soap cheap and cleans nicely</li>
            <li> Our review.&lt;br /&gt;Please note the system will not let you give ZERO stars...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, lots of people (myself included) may have sensitive skin issues, and when they say hypoallergenic on the label, (I know it isn’t necessarily all natural, but,) most expect the product not to further inflame or damage the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after breaking out in a rash from using harsher industry bars such as Coast, regular Dial and even the all-gentle master Oil of Olay (go figure on that one—but I think they changed the formulary because I have tried it in the past without any negative reaction)… I was a little worried as to what to try next…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, anyway I read the reviews on Basis (albeit by Dial) and they were mostly fairly reasonable by other persons with sensitive skin issues, so I figured I’d give it a shot and hoped I would find it to be an inexpensive, but gentle cleansing bath bar...&lt;br /&gt;Not, so…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 5-minutes of use, my skin felt very tight and itchy and I broke out in weird red hives/welts all over my body which lasted about 3days before clearing up (after liberal use of Betamethasone Rx-cream topical). And I have never had to use this medicine on my whole body, ever and I have had issues with eczema… So, meh to the makers of this product, (in this case the folks over at Dial). This was my own experience so it may work for those who are less sensitive, but in my case, it was definitely a no. And we are now getting rid of all Basis/ Dial type products as they seem to be the worst offenders by far, so far -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unfortunately this is not a product that can be recommended for very sensitive skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, F-minus minus / Zero stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people just do better with more natural, less complicated products and currently I am alternating between Kirk&#x27;s Coco Castile Fragrance-Free Soap and Natural-Cosmetics&#x27; African Black Soap (both here on Amazon) and Nasabb&#x27;s natural Honey Oatmeal Soap (Nasabb.com). And skin is looking and feeling Much, Much Better.</li>
            <li> Terrible soap. Don&#x27;t know why Dial stopped selling their original Hypo Allergenic soap &amp;#34;Pure &amp; Natural&amp;#34;, but this soap sucks. It doesn&#x27;t lather well, and worst of all it doesn&#x27;t clean. It didn&#x27;t get the odor out of my arm pits. I had to use my wife&#x27;s &amp;#34;Kirks&amp;#34; soap which cleaned great, makes lots of lather, and left no odor.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for someone with sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey, but it has a pleasant smell.  Although&amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is listed as an ingredient, it&#x27;s not very strong.&lt;br /&gt;I would warn a potential buyer not to confuse the price per bar with the price per three. These soap bars are packaged in threes and I find I can get them cheaper locally-about $1 for a 3-pack or 33 cents per bar.</li>
            <li> Unable to locate in a store in my area.  My dad who is 94 likes product.  :-)</li>
            <li> I like this soap, it has no scent, deodorant, coloring or other additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is long lasting and cleans without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> The soap was great, I always purchase this soap but not at $1 A BAR...I paid $1 for 3 pack</li>
            <li> This is the world&#x27;s greatest soap because it&#x27;s plain and excellent. No dyes or perfumes or anything but the BASICS!</li>
            <li> It was very good for my skin it helps control my eczema</li>
            <li> No smell.  Nothing fancy.  Just soap.  That&#x27;s hard to find.  Can&#x27;t always find this in the store, and it&#x27;s a delight to find it here.</li>
            <li> I literally threw this soap in the garbage within a few minutes of receiving it because I wanted it out of my house. It smells like the fake floral/honeysuckle scent used in some insect poisons, or fertilizer products, to cover the smell of their chemicals. It literally made me gag and I had to wash my hands with other soap after handling this one.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is NOT hypoallergenic!  For people like me with fairly common petro-chemical allergies, the fake fragrance is a guaranteed headache at least and nausea at worst. Bad form Dial; I had to toss it out.</li>
            <li> I like the scent -- it&#x27;s flowery, but light -- but I just wanted to point that out, in case anyone else made the assumption that a hypoallergenic product would be unscented.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells like old school soap.  Leaves you feeling clean, but not dried out.  There is a slight odor that resembles a fragrance despite containing none, most likely the fresh scent of natural soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps. I get sinus infections with terrible sinus headaches. This soap doesn&#x27;t do that, but it still works great on my oily, Irish skin.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  Quick delivery</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to it and can have a shower !!!! no reaction !!! It is the best soap ever !!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use, I have very sensitive skin and this does the trick.  The soap has a very light and pleasant fragrance and it seems that it really rinses off very well.  It&#x27;s all we use now.</li>
            <li> Best hypoallergenic soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Very consistent texture, scent and results... it has eliminated Winter skin problems from soap chemicals and additives. Excellent product highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, received a big free batch while on deployment and soon realized that my body is far more accepting to this as opposed to other types of men&#x27;s body wash. Use it especially if you get the small ingrown hair spots anywhere on your person, like I do. Cleared up my thighs completely after using the first bar for no more than a week.</li>
            <li> Though the Germans who made my &amp;#34;Pure &amp; Natural&amp;#34; soap (which I used for years) swore that they&#x27;d stopped making it &amp;#34;because not enough was being sold&amp;#34;, it seems they rejiggered the formula for &amp;#34;Dial&amp;#34; (which I&#x27;d never liked), because this is pretty much a clone of &amp;#34;Pure &amp; Natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product! Had bought this item before seeing that i had become allergic to the perfume that many of the soaps used. I had also tried baby soaps but to no positive results, this dial soap did the trick. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
