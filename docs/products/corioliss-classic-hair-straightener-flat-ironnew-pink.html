    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best hair product I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>and I am a very happy person.</li>
            <li>My sisters are always wanting to borrow it and I am planning on getting it for my 3 sisters for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;Great product, Great price!  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly!!</li>
            <li>Awesome product great delivery time</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>just breaks through beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>, it is easy to use, is what I needed and for the price I paid is perfect!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve got nothing but good things to say about Corioliss.</li>
            <li>and she just loved it.</li>
            <li>and I loved it for a couple of years</li>
            <li>and I loved hers.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was quick, the product works EXCELLENT</li>
            <li>I guess it would be a good product for someone who has frizz free hair.</li>
            <li>This straightener does a good job of adding shine to your hair and keeping it full of life, but it takes me an hour and sometimes over to straighten my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I just bought one myself and plan to buy my sister one for her birthday :)</li>
            <li>i love this straightener.</li>
            <li>And for under $100, good deal for a useful hair product.</li>
            <li>I love this straighter.</li>
            <li>I used mine for almost 5 years until it got stepped on my lovely fiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont think you can buy a better straightener for the money.  </li>
            <li>Guess a better word would be \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li>This iron is not has good as the first one, it takes a couple of times to get the results I want.</li>
            <li>This was a very good flat iron for the price, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>They also threw in an \\&quot;AMIKA\\&quot; bottle of hair oil, which I STRONGLY suggest you buy.</li>
            <li>NOT worth that money, but $30 is a perfect price.</li>
            <li>Since she liked it so much</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I originally had purchased one of these at a mall kiosk for 300 dollars.</li>
            <li>Came in it&#x27;s original packaging, just like the one I had purchased at the kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it for it&#x27;s light weight, it&#x27;s heating temperature control (even though i always keep it high) and the rapid heating it has.  </li>
            <li>After reading positive reviews on this flat iron, I took the chance on it and happy I did.  </li>
            <li>Does the job and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I immediatly looked online for a new one and got a much better price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This straightener can pull hair straight on the first pass with even the most damaged and curly of hair.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>i loved it so much i bought the same one.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a good flat iron at a decent price.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t top of the line, but it works very well and comes in a few adorable colors.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Corioliss at the mall (the demo just made it irrisistable)</li>
            <li>that I love, but is on it&#x27;s last leg.  </li>
            <li>before it broke (I think it just got dropped too many times, the plates started to come loose).  </li>
            <li>After a good blow dry, I comb this flat iron through my hair and the shine</li>
            <li>It really just takes seconds to heat up.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Very \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot; feeling.  </li>
            <li>I left my flat iron for her and just purchased another one for me because it is amazing.</li>
            <li>And although the picture shows a light pink one, the one you will receive in the mail is going to be darker like fuchsia.</li>
            <li>The temperature knob was super loose and the light on top that turned red when it was hot would go from green to red constantly.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and the temperature is adjustable, definite plus, if your hair is thinner.</li>
            <li>My second straightener has been straightening my hair every day for the past 4 years and its still going strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would have to say, the only down fall would be the one I had purchased from the kiosk was a light pink.</li>
            <li>I have very thick frizzy hair and this new one doesn&#x27;t seem to work really well on my hair, the old one I had, used to get the job done way  faster.</li>

            <li> That is my second flat iron from the same brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because my Mom has this same brand</li>
            <li> and my mom started to use my flat iron</li>
            <li> It also leaves body to your hair instead of it laying flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not too hot to handle as other flat irons i&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I have tried other flat irons and none of them work as well as this one!</li>
            <li> I had the same one (which i loved)in black for 6 years until I dropped it and broke</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my limited Edition pink Xmas Corioliss iron I purchased 8 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> Even the crazy mall price is worth it!</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair and</li>
            <li> After a year and a half of owning it, it broke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little anti-frizz product, and you&#x27;ll be set straightening out your hair.</li>
            <li> Also, since the Corioliss has a somewhat round barrel you can also use it to put curls in your hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in thinking hat because this straightener was only 1 inch that it would take forever to straighten my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wish it had the same quality as the old one.</li>
            <li> Before I had this I would hardly even brush my hair, but now i look forward to straightening it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thankyou, if you were not satisfied they will fix your problem!</li>
            <li> well i was wrong.</li>
            <li> The cord base twirls so while you&#x27;re styling your hair, it won&#x27;t get tangled up.</li>

            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever purchased.  The delivery was quick, the product works EXCELLENT and I am a very happy person.</li>
            <li> I never did my hair before I bought this straightener.  I was roped in at the mall and have never regretted it.  Before I had this I would hardly even brush my hair, but now i look forward to straightening it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so fast and easy to use. My sisters are always wanting to borrow it and I am planning on getting it for my 3 sisters for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;Great product, Great price!  Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This straightener is sold at malls for about $100 &amp; up. NOT worth that money, but $30 is a perfect price. It isn&#x27;t top of the line, but it works very well and comes in a few adorable colors. I just bought one myself and plan to buy my sister one for her birthday :)</li>
            <li> i love this straightener. i had this one for over 3 years before it broke... i loved it so much i bought the same one.</li>
            <li> There were some mixed reviews regarding the product but I&#x27;ve got nothing but good things to say about Corioliss. It heats up fast and the temperature is adjustable, definite plus, if your hair is thinner. The cord base twirls so while you&#x27;re styling your hair, it won&#x27;t get tangled up. Just a little anti-frizz product, and you&#x27;ll be set straightening out your hair. Also, since the Corioliss has a somewhat round barrel you can also use it to put curls in your hair. And for under $100, good deal for a useful hair product.</li>
            <li> That is my second flat iron from the same brand. I  bought one and I was using it for a while. I went to visit my family in Brazil and my mom started to use my flat iron and she just loved it.Since she liked it so much I left my flat iron for her and just purchased another one for me because it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my limited Edition pink Xmas Corioliss iron I purchased 8 yrs ago. This iron is not has good as the first one, it takes a couple of times to get the results I want.</li>
            <li> This was a very good flat iron for the price, can&#x27;t complain. Does the job and heats up quickly. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> ~Today on 2/29/2012 they have called me to fix the problem&lt;br /&gt;but I don&#x27;t know if it will work, hoping what they said was true.&lt;br /&gt;But then I will remove this comment when they send me a link to&lt;br /&gt;contact them. Thankyou, if you were not satisfied they will fix your problem!</li>
            <li> I love this straighter. I used mine for almost 5 years until it got stepped on my lovely fiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and keep it off the counter away from the kitty cat.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Corioliss at the mall (the demo just made it irrisistable) and I loved it for a couple of years before it broke (I think it just got dropped too many times, the plates started to come loose).  I immediatly looked online for a new one and got a much better price.  This straightener can pull hair straight on the first pass with even the most damaged and curly of hair. It leaves your hair shiny and beautiful.  It also leaves body to your hair instead of it laying flat and lifeless.  My second straightener has been straightening my hair every day for the past 4 years and its still going strong.  I dont think you can buy a better straightener for the money.  Even the crazy mall price is worth it!</li>
            <li> After reading positive reviews on this flat iron, I took the chance on it and happy I did.  I have coarse thick hair and this thing just works wonders on it. After a good blow dry, I comb this flat iron through my hair and the shine just breaks through beautifully.  I love it for it&#x27;s light weight, it&#x27;s heating temperature control (even though i always keep it high) and the rapid heating it has.  It really just takes seconds to heat up.  And it&#x27;s not too hot to handle as other flat irons i&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have tried other flat irons and none of them work as well as this one!</li>
            <li> After about a year the plates started detaching and kept pulling my hair</li>
            <li> This straightener does a good job of adding shine to your hair and keeping it full of life, but it takes me an hour and sometimes over to straighten my wavy hair. I would recommend a different straightner.</li>
            <li> I like it so much, it is easy to use, is what I needed and for the price I paid is perfect!</li>
            <li> Awesome product great delivery time</li>
            <li> I originally had purchased one of these at a mall kiosk for 300 dollars. They also threw in an \\&quot;AMIKA\\&quot; bottle of hair oil, which I STRONGLY suggest you buy. After a year and a half of owning it, it broke.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought it here for 30 bucks! Came in it&#x27;s original packaging, just like the one I had purchased at the kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say, the only down fall would be the one I had purchased from the kiosk was a light pink. And although the picture shows a light pink one, the one you will receive in the mail is going to be darker like fuchsia. But other than that, it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue ordering from them!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because my Mom has this same brand and I loved hers.  When I got this one it was almost as if it was a knock off or something.  Very \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot; feeling.  Guess a better word would be \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; looking and feeling.  The temperature knob was super loose and the light on top that turned red when it was hot would go from green to red constantly. I ended up sending it back and just continue to use my Tigi Bed Head iron  that I love, but is on it&#x27;s last leg.  Still looking for a good flat iron at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I had the same one (which i loved)in black for 6 years until I dropped it and broke so I decided to go with the same brand and style To be on the \\&quot;safe\\&quot; side, well i was wrong. I have very thick frizzy hair and this new one doesn&#x27;t seem to work really well on my hair, the old one I had, used to get the job done way  faster. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wish it had the same quality as the old one. I&#x27;m not returning it because I don&#x27;t wanna go thought the hassle of sending it back and blah blah blah.... I guess it would be a good product for someone who has frizz free hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in thinking hat because this straightener was only 1 inch that it would take forever to straighten my long, thick hair.  It works amazingly!! Only takes me about 15 minutes to straighten my hair and it works well for curling your hair, too.</li>
