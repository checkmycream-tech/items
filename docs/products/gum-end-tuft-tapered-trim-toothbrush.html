            <li> this is a great  toothbrush. doses a great job get good reports. will buy agan. gum is the best will use all the time.</li>
            <li> The brush head on one of the toothbrushes had black bristles, yuck. Had to return. Was very satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s return handling.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and it was delivered the next day.</li>
            <li> Works really well roll get the back molars. Takes some getting used to, but hoping I&#x27;m get positive feedback from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Being prone to plaque, my dentist suggested I try something like this brush.  Post brushing, I run this brush along my gum line several times.  It cleans any missed plaque and it stimulates the gums.  The brushes are study, good handy and I find them easy to grip and use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent in controlling and preventing periodontal disease.  The tuft reaches below the gum line to remove debris that causes inflammation resulting in perio disease.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> My mice have never had nicer smiles!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my father-in-law because he can&#x27;t find it in Hawaii.  Says it an excellent product, will be ordering more for him later.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite brushes and not available in any stores in my area. I like the fact that they are not ultra soft as I like to use it to scrub behind my front teeth which are curved so a regular toothbrush misses it. It&#x27;s excellent for getting around the gums between the teeth and all the way behind the molars. I&#x27;m careful to brush gently around the gums. I use this in addition to an electric brush.</li>
            <li> Ahead of schedule and in good shape!  Product was recommended by my dentist and I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, great product.</li>

            <li> I love these brushes. I have a small jaw and struggle to clean behind my back teeth. My dental hygienist gave me one of these to try, and now I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Great product at good price -- these are hard to find in the drugstores and are so good for hard to reach teeth (or with braces).</li>

            <li> Purchased for my mother and she loves them!</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush to get inbetween my teeth where my other brush doesn&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for years. Used to get them free from my dentist. Unable to find them in stores.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t check it out with my dentist yet, but it works amazing.. great for cleaning better than floss it seems like.. or in addition to floss..  I&#x27;ll report back after I see my dentist and get the scoop on what she thinks as well.  Was highly recommended by a friend and his dentist.</li>
            <li> Good brush for getting at tight spaces. The bristles are relatively soft.</li>

This works perfectly and also gets into difficult spots like behind your molars and in between your teeth (of course don&#x27;t forget to floss!)  I cannot find these end-tuft toothbrushes in the grocery store or drug stores so it is great that they can be purchased online.</li>
            <li> easily takes care of those hard-to-reach places</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended these end tuft brushes for my back molars and I noticed a different fill the first time I used one. I will definitely continue to use them.</li>
