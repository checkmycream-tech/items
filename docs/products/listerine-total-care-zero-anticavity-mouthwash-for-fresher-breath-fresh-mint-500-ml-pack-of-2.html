            <li> Many reviewers have had the same, and much worse, experience with Listerine Total Care Zero.</li>
            <li> but without the harsh burn of the classic one.</li>
            <li> As a commenter helpfully pointed out, all of the active ingredients of regular Listerine which are listed as antiplaque/antigingivitis are actually also listed on Total Care Zero as inactive ingredients.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I just had to warn other potential buyers of this.</li>
            <li> But additionally, I had noticed that some days I&#x27;d wake up with a film of dead skin in my mouth which I&#x27;d have to wipe away (gross, I know!).  </li>
            <li> They also leave my mouth tingling (not the minty fresh feeling, something weird).</li>
            <li> This happens quite a few hours afterwards and it is rather gross pulling the stuff out of ones mouth!  </li>
            <li> I wish I had taken the advise of other raters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the suffering.</li>
            <li> I kinda think it taste water down not like the one in the store</li>
            <li> Odd, in any case, but perhaps it does do everything.  </li>
            <li> It left my mouth numb feeling, all day and with a lasting after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept finding stringy bits of dead skin when I brush my teeth at night.  </li>
            <li> just a few uses-seems to freshen breath well without making my eyes well up, but in return my mouth falls out.</li>
            <li> Totally a waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to stick with mouthwashes that bear the ADA Accepted seal from now on (Plain ol&#x27; Listerine and ACT Fluoride).  </li>
            <li> Ever since my dentist told me that alcohol-based mouthwashes turn to sugar in your mouth, I&#x27;ve been looking for a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t taste funny or leave a bad taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what prompted me to give it another try, but I did a few months ago</li>
            <li> At least after you spit out the regular mouth wash, the nasty feeling is gone within a minute and you feel very fresh in your mouth.</li>
            <li> They make little pieces of flesh, yes flesh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this happens to EVERYONE</li>
            <li> Still, I want to gargle and don&#x27;t want to wake up with dead skin in my mouth!</li>
            <li> I then ate candy, drank water, it&#x27;s still very bad but starting to feel getting normal slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t only taste bad, it feels like my entire tongue is numb and dry</li>
            <li> My whole mouth goes very numb.</li>
            <li> Not regular alcohol numb.</li>
            <li> I immediately dumped the rest of this product down the drain!!!</li>
            <li> It is ridiculous the way it foams out of your mouth when trying to gargle.</li>
            <li> For a regular bad product, I will just finish it and not use it again.</li>
            <li> Not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try that, since the Listerine use has greatly decreased my gingivitis</li>
            <li> I might have had worse things in my mouth</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it took me a week to realize that this mouthwash is what caused it.</li>
            <li> This is disturbing.</li>
            <li> I hate to waste money.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers seem to think it tastes awful, but that&#x27;s not my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this mouthwash a couple times my tongue and lips both went numb.</li>
            <li> however both my husband and I have noted some weird sloughing of what I presume is cheek tissue!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It tastes sooo bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t supposed to drink or eat within 30 mins using mouth wash, but after spitting out repeatedly without any relief, I felt almost sick and want to throw up.</li>
            <li> though, it makes me feel so sick that I have to throw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Nasty.  </li>
            <li> Both are horrible!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now, and I think I&#x27;m done with it.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a clean feeling without the burn of normal Listerine, sure, but both times I noticed it leaves this white film in your mouth an hour after you use it. It&#x27;s unpleasant. I&#x27;m not sure if this happens to EVERYONE but it does to me, so you might want to try a small sample bottle first.</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken the advise of other raters.It is ridiculous the way it foams out of your mouth when trying to gargle. It is best used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;This junk is an insult to the good name of &amp;#34;Listerine&amp;#34; it should be removed from the shelves.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I was shocked. I could feel it adhering to my teeth as I swished it around. I never expected a mouthwash to really do more than take care of my breath, but this does. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Ever since my dentist told me that alcohol-based mouthwashes turn to sugar in your mouth, I&#x27;ve been looking for a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t taste funny or leave a bad taste in my mouth.  I tried all the store brands--yech!  This one actually tastes like its killing germs, but not too strong.  Highly recommended, and my dentist said my gums and teeth were perfect last check-up!  Of course, you have to floss and brush too!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff, and gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of it&#x27;s all-in-one nature.  But....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It left my mouth numb feeling, all day and with a lasting after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I kept finding stringy bits of dead skin when I brush my teeth at night.  Nasty.  Here is what I found out about this effect:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It has phosphoric acid in it.  That stuff damages teeth enamel.  Now according to my research, this is intentional, to \\&quot;etch\\&quot; the tooth for the fluoride to adhere to better.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a good thing or not, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with good old ACT fluoride and not take the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to stick with mouthwashes that bear the ADA Accepted seal from now on (Plain ol&#x27; Listerine and ACT Fluoride).  According to this source:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Listerine \\&quot;sandwiched\\&quot; in between brushing teeth and fluoride rinse can help mitigate the drying effects of the alcohol.  I&#x27;m going to try that, since the Listerine use has greatly decreased my gingivitis (for once the hygienist didn&#x27;t say I had tons of plaque and said I looked pretty good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can go to the ADA&#x27;s website to see what products are ADA Accepted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> ATTENTION!&lt;br /&gt;If you have dental implants, be cautious.&lt;br /&gt;In my particular case, the &amp;#34;Listerine Total Care Zero&amp;#34; works very well around my teeth (pockets are getting smaller), BUT at the same time the pockets around my dental implants stay of the same size, or even getting bigger.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only reason why I have this product one star. Otherwise, I would rate it with 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;IF SOMEONE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM, please let me know.</li>
            <li> I tried Listerine Total Care a couple years ago and really didn&#x27;t like the taste.  I&#x27;m not sure what prompted me to give it another try, but I did a few months ago and I don&#x27;t know if they changed their flavor/formula or if my tastes changed, but it tasted just fine to me!  Other reviewers seem to think it tastes awful, but that&#x27;s not my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, thinking I was buying another bottle of Total Care, I accidentally picked up a bottle of Total Care Zero.  Maybe this makes sense for people who have some sort of sensitivity to alcohol, but if you don&#x27;t, I strongly recommend you get the regular stuff!  The first thing I noticed was that you cannot gargle with it -- it bubbles up immediately like Scope.  That&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me -- I want a \\&quot;mouthwash and gargle.\\&quot;  But additionally, I had noticed that some days I&#x27;d wake up with a film of dead skin in my mouth which I&#x27;d have to wipe away (gross, I know!).  I hadn&#x27;t connected it to this mouthwash until I saw another reviewer mention it.  I don&#x27;t think regular Total Care did that to me.  In any case, Total Care Zero might be right for some people if you really can&#x27;t stand alcohol, but I&#x27;m definitely sticking with [[ASIN:B003VUL8IY Listerine Total Care Plus Whitening Mouthwash Fresh Mint, 32-Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (4/18/2013): Maybe everyone looking at this product is already aware, but this is just a \\&quot;fluoride rinse.\\&quot;  Branding it as \\&quot;Total Care\\&quot; with \\&quot;6 benefits in 1\\&quot; led me to believe it was doing more than regular Listerine, but that is not the case!  Regular Listerine (such as [[ASIN:B0014CXT6K Cool Mint Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash (2 X 1.5lt)]]) combats plaque and gingivitis which this one does not.  It&#x27;s only active ingredient is fluoride which is great for preventing cavities, but I use a fluoride toothpaste (aren&#x27;t almost all?) and pretty much any public water supply is fluoridated, so I&#x27;d rather have a mouthwash that does something else useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (2/25/2014): I guess scratch that \\&quot;just a fluoride rinse\\&quot; edit I made last year.  As a commenter helpfully pointed out, all of the active ingredients of regular Listerine which are listed as antiplaque/antigingivitis are actually also listed on Total Care Zero as inactive ingredients.  Does sodium fluoride render them inert?  If so, why would they leave them in?  The \\&quot;Use\\&quot; list definitely does not have preventing or reducing plaque and gingivitis like regular Listerine does -- just \\&quot;Anticavity.\\&quot;  Maybe it&#x27;s just a marketing thing.  Odd, in any case, but perhaps it does do everything.  Still, I want to gargle and don&#x27;t want to wake up with dead skin in my mouth!</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t use mouthwash if it wasn&#x27;t effective and this is effective without the sharp biting medication taste so common in most.  It&#x27;s halfway pleasant to use and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to keep on counter. I was tiered of the bigger sizes being in my way.</li>
            <li> This makes me feel like I&#x27;m taking good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> After using this mouthwash a couple times my tongue and lips both went numb. Almost like I had burnt them. I also lost most of my sense of taste (hopefully this is temporary!) Unfortunately, it took me a week to realize that this mouthwash is what caused it. After finally wising up and reading reviews on Amazon, Walgreens, and Linsterine&#x27;s site I can see that I am definitely not alone. Many reviewers have had the same, and much worse, experience with Listerine Total Care Zero. I immediately dumped the rest of this product down the drain!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this and the crest alcohol free mouthwash. Both are horrible! They make little pieces of flesh, yes flesh! rip off in my mouth throughout the day. This is disturbing. They also leave my mouth tingling (not the minty fresh feeling, something weird). I have no idea what type of chemicals I&#x27;m putting in my mouth and what type of issues this will cause later.I am returning both and will find an all natural substitute.</li>
            <li> I kinda think it taste water down not like the one in the store im to sure about it need lil more time to think about it</li>
            <li> It functions just like Listerine but without the harsh burn of the classic one. I use it every day and it does what its supposed to. I cannot say if my teeth are healthier or not but the dentist says it cant hurt.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product recommended by our dentist and I also recommend it.  It leaves a cool, pleasant taste rather than the medicinal one left by original Listerine.  The price is good at Amazxon.</li>
            <li> I even like regular Listerine better than this one. My whole mouth goes very numb. Not regular alcohol numb. Like a coating of numbness in my mouth. Not a good feeling. I can&#x27;t gargle it cause it immediately bubbles up. I hope I can get through the whole bottle. I hate to waste money.</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me that age dries out one&#x27;s mouth and therefore I need an alcohol-free mouthwash. So I use the zero. I like the taste of this and use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> does the job and is alcohol free</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about foaming at the mouth or weird tasting as described by others-it seems ok to me esp after using the Crest product which annihilates one&#x27;s taste buds for a good 24 hours.  Much milder than the original Listerine. Seems to last well, mouth stays fresh feeling for most of the day.  however both my husband and I have noted some weird sloughing of what I presume is cheek tissue!  This happens quite a few hours afterwards and it is rather gross pulling the stuff out of ones mouth!  So I give a mixed review after just a few uses-seems to freshen breath well without making my eyes well up, but in return my mouth falls out. So it&#x27;s a wash!</li>
            <li> I bought this from a drug store not Amazon, but I couldn&#x27;t help coming here searching for reviews to see if anybody else share the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried it. 10 mins ago. It tastes sooo bad. The regular one I can handle although it stings during application. At least after you spit out the regular mouth wash, the nasty feeling is gone within a minute and you feel very fresh in your mouth. This zero product however, linger on in my entire mouth and won&#x27;t go away. It doesn&#x27;t only taste bad, it feels like my entire tongue is numb and dry and there&#x27;s strange filmy thing on the top layer of the tongue. I can&#x27;t see it, but I can feel it. I knew I wasn&#x27;t supposed to drink or eat within 30 mins using mouth wash, but after spitting out repeatedly without any relief, I felt almost sick and want to throw up. I then ate candy, drank water, it&#x27;s still very bad but starting to feel getting normal slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had to warn other potential buyers of this. I would return this if I could, but I lost my receipt. Totally a waste of money. For a regular bad product, I will just finish it and not use it again. This one though, it makes me feel so sick that I have to throw it in the trash. It&#x27;s not worth the suffering.</li>
            <li> Although tis claims to be more natural, it is filled with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The taste is putrid.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this item.</li>
            <li> These bottles are so small that I think it&#x27;s better to buy at store.  My husband and I both use this brand and we went through the bottles quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is vile. I might have had worse things in my mouth but I&#x27;ve managed to suppress those memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought this accidentally, intending to buy the regular Total Care fresh mint, which we like, but instead grabbed the Zero variant. I don&#x27;t know what was substituted for the alcohol content but whatever it is belongs in an EPA Super Fund site.</li>
