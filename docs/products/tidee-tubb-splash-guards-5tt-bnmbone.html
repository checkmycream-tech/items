    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect!.</li>
            <li>Great at keeping water off floor.</li>
            <li>Works well, but the included caulk stuff wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>works great and is doing whats</li>
            <li>Great concept expecially if you have kids, but the adhesive/caulk it comes with doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  </li>
            <li>Works good, but if your wall and tub are not close to perpendicular, could have an installation problem.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make a good seal.</li>
            <li>It was a good idea, but it didn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>they work great and easy to install</li>
            <li>I used some better caulk I had around the house</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Got this to stop our tub from leaking over the top when taking showers.</li>
            <li>Dimensions should be more descriptive.  </li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>These guards work great and fixed the problem!</li>
            <li>We were looking for something easy to install to keep water off the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>Now its holding strong.</li>
            <li>They have been in place now for two years, and stick sticking strong.</li>
            <li>luckily I ordered some caulk and was able to install it.</li>
            <li>This was a quick and easy install.</li>
            <li>Works well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Hubby put it up quickly..</li>
            <li>We let it dry overnight and were good to go.</li>
            <li>The guard itself is a nice big size but</li>
            <li>Then the splash guard comes right off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend you spare yourself a re-do and use a quality sealant-glue the first time.</li>
            <li>First off, it didn&#x27;t sit flush against both the wall and the tub.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re going to look for better adhesive at our local home improvement store.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use them, they are too large for the size of the shower stall we wanted to use them on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After installing these guards the problem stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Product is good quality hard plastic.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a bigger product that will fit flush to the tub.</li>
            <li>The color (bone) matched my tile very well.</li>
            <li>The bone color was neutral and went with the American Standard tub, and we liked the way they curve into the tub.</li>
            <li>Might be a great product if tile were perfectly flat, adhesive caulk worked AND it didn&#x27;t have an uneven bottom.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Guess I&#x27;ll have to but a giant tube of silicone (for the small amount I really need) and do this right.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good product.</li>
            <li>They were not hard to install.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install, but there is an odd curve to it which prevented it from lining up flush to the tub.  </li>
            <li>They seem strong and should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I also think you have to put more caulk/glue on than just a small bead as indicated in the directions.  </li>
            <li>I wound up ordering clear ones instead.  </li>
            <li>The tube of caulk that comes with this is either old or just inferior.  </li>
            <li>Our next step is to get some new silicone caulking for the tub to see if that works.</li>
            <li>but I know I&#x27;ll have to take it off and do it again in the near future.  </li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t long enough to direct the water back into the tub.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The caulk did not hold it in place.</li>
            <li> Works good, but if your wall and tub are not close to perpendicular, could have an installation problem.</li>
            <li> This product is not as big as I thought it would be.  It was easy to install, but there is an odd curve to it which prevented it from lining up flush to the tub.  It does work, but it is not a permanent solution.  I will be looking for a bigger product that will fit flush to the tub.</li>
            <li> Bought this because the shower kept leaking on to the floor in the back of our tub.  Put this up and it leaks no more.</li>
            <li> Great at keeping water off floor. Bought theses for my Son&#x27;s bathroom, because they would always get water on the floor&lt;br /&gt;when they took a shower, just a little added protection.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the included caulk stuff wasn&#x27;t that great. I used some better caulk I had around the house and we haven&#x27;t had any splash-over since.</li>
            <li> The tube of caulk that comes with this is either old or just inferior.  Have installed and re-caulked twice - still leaks.  Yes, I read and followed the instructions, drying time etc.&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;ll have to but a giant tube of silicone (for the small amount I really need) and do this right.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good product.</li>
            <li> Just what was promised except for the lousy glue.</li>
            <li> The adhesive is terrible and broke loose in a day. I had to buy silicone and redo it. Now its holding strong.</li>
            <li> works great and is doing whats it is supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;leveling it was difficult but it finally was OK</li>
            <li> I love these. This is my second set (one for each bathroom) and they work like a charm!!</li>
            <li> These are just what I needed to prevent water from tracking along the corners during a shower. They seem strong and should last a long time. But, I used the enclosed calk/adhesive included in the set to mount the barriers. This is a no go. The adhesive is weak and did not withstand two showers. I solved this with marine grade Goop. Now the barriers are in place and should stay there a long time. I&#x27;d recommend you spare yourself a re-do and use a quality sealant-glue the first time. Give the unused calk a toss.</li>
            <li> We were looking for something easy to install to keep water off the bathroom floor. This was a quick and easy install. The bone color was neutral and went with the American Standard tub, and we liked the way they curve into the tub. After installing, my husband ran a bead of caulking where the guard meets the tub edge. We let it dry overnight and were good to go. They have been in place now for two years, and stick sticking strong.</li>
            <li> Might be a great product if tile were perfectly flat, adhesive caulk worked AND it didn&#x27;t have an uneven bottom.  The bottom had a little nub on it that kept it from being perfectly flat.  Every time I put the caulk on and tried to hold it still it just slid around on that nub.  Item will be sent back.</li>
            <li> Got this to stop our tub from leaking over the top when taking showers. The guard itself is a nice big size but the adhesive that was included was no good. It didn&#x27;t make a good seal. My husband reapplied again and it still leaks. Our next step is to get some new silicone caulking for the tub to see if that works. It didn&#x27;t solve the problem of our bathroom floor getting wet after every shower!</li>
            <li> The guard works but the adhesive that comes with it was dried up on arrival luckily I ordered some caulk and was able to install it.</li>
            <li> It was a good idea, but it didn&#x27;t work well.  First off, it didn&#x27;t sit flush against both the wall and the tub.  It also isn&#x27;t long enough to direct the water back into the tub.  Then, it let loose after a couple months.  The caulk is still there, stuck to the wall and the tub, waiting to be scraped off.  Keep looking - this isn&#x27;t the solution.</li>
            <li> Works well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my tub with the water leaking over the tub onto the floor when taking a shower. These guards work great and fixed the problem! They were not hard to install.</li>
            <li> For months we were trying to figure out&lt;br /&gt;why we had a water drip in the basement&lt;br /&gt;After installing these guards the problem stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Product is good quality hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Did the job we bought it for! Perfect!. Hubby put it up quickly.. Keeps the water from dripping out of the shower onto the floor.</li>
            <li> Great concept expecially if you have kids, but the adhesive/caulk it comes with doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  We&#x27;v had to re-glue this twice now &amp; each time, it only sticks for a couple of days.  Then the splash guard comes right off.  The adhesive seems to stick to the tub &amp; not the splash guard.  We&#x27;re going to look for better adhesive at our local home improvement store.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use them, they are too large for the size of the shower stall we wanted to use them on.  Dimensions should be more descriptive.  Threw the box away so can&#x27;t return them either.</li>
            <li> I like the gizmo but the installation is so-so.  I THINK I dried and cleaned all surfaces well but the caulk/glue that comes with the product didn&#x27;t seal as well as I thought it would.  It&#x27;s in and I haven&#x27;t removed it to re-caulk as it&#x27;s doing the job but I know I&#x27;ll have to take it off and do it again in the near future.  I also think you have to put more caulk/glue on than just a small bead as indicated in the directions.  I only used the one piece at the end of the shower/bath.  The color (bone) matched my tile very well.</li>
            <li> The color was nowhere near a match as it was really dark.  I wound up ordering clear ones instead.  However, they worked well to prevent water from the showerhead from dripping outside the bathtub.</li>
            <li> I love them they work great and easy to install</li>
    </ol>
