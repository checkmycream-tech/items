    <ol>
            <li>These are awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO happy with this product!</li>
            <li>BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li>Of course this is a good product - its Burts Bees!</li>
            <li>The tint (honeysuckle) itself is a nice nude color, perfect for a \\&quot;no make up\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>It looks great with</li>
            <li>The color is perfect, it smells great and feels nice and moist.</li>
            <li>I started loving this protuct!</li>
            <li>Great price and fit into their clutches perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, excellent moisturizer &amp; perfect nude tone!  </li>
            <li>There is no SPF, but I work inside all day and am more concerned with moisturizing and having great color...</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s GREAT that it&#x27;s available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>and I love the feeling on my lips and the color!</li>
            <li>My favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm!</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with fair skin, so I thought this light shade would give some tint to my lips, but it doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li>This lip balm moisturizes like no other lip balm I have tried...with beautiful color!  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t see this product as a balm, just as a tint, so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li>It was a bit more pastel.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a translucent tint, but I plan to try another color to see if maybe I just need to pick a color that&#x27;s even more reddish than the picture of the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shade for a while and its always fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is my most fave balm that I use as a lipstick as well.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask?  </li>
            <li>and Haldol I do feel somewhat better, but I am still suffering some anxiety.</li>
            <li>Love this lipgloss.  </li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and their tinted lip balm is no exception.</li>
            <li>It is  light and smooth and has good staying power for a lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love burts bee&#x27;s chapstick, but there tinted balms fell short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color in the Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm line.</li>
            <li>:P All in all, I like the shades that the BB lip tint comes in, I think they are a bit overpriced, and are a bit drying if you were to use them for your normal lip balm.</li>
            <li>You are better off with original untinted.</li>
            <li>, nonetheless, it is a very pretty chapstick :)</li>
            <li>The wax is smooth, and stays on.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first one retail, but loved it so much that I got this 2 pack to keep extras on-hand.</li>
            <li>They smell great, feels comfortable on, not too \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, and they do have a slight tint.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite lipbalm period.</li>
            <li>It is great alone for a regular natural look.</li>
            <li>Because the product is very waxy, the tint on top of that is bit too much.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t always get it right</li>
            <li>It looks pretty on (not too heavy, but still noticeable) and it makes my lips feel great.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s imperative to have some sort of hygiene seal when purchasing cosmetics, this could have been accomplished much more cheaply by using a simple plastic seal.</li>
            <li>Better than regular chapstick and more natural.</li>
            <li>Considering the brand, I thought it was pretty well priced.</li>
            <li>This light, sheer, tan color provides a slightly more nude lip look over my natural lip.</li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t be the first thing I reached for when chapped lips are a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems pretty flat - and would be better with a little more shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Just a great basic color to give your lips a little shine and softness.  </li>
            <li>much anything.</li>
            <li>It improves the look of my lips and is a nice everyday color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting for a balm and feels nice on.</li>
            <li>I know we may pay more for a 100% natural product, but Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t need to pile on even more cost with unnecessary packaging.</li>
            <li>does a decent job</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very neutral with just a hint of natural lip color.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a long time fan but there have been some products that are a waste), but they did a good job with this tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li>Better yet, just use cherry chapstick if you want a subtly tinted lip balm--so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>This is a new lip case and I think formulae also.</li>
            <li>It could be a bit less.... orange-y, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me that much(I have warm undertones), and it&#x27;s not really *orange</li>
            <li>Very classy nude.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Honeysuckle is a natural hint gloss.</li>
            <li>but it is mostly natural.</li>
            <li>It seems to stay put for a lot longer, too, and at the end of the day, my lips are soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>My doctor and fellow PTSD group members advised that I speak my mind to you directly regarding the trauma this has caused me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect nude shade when it comes to tinted lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it alone or as a base color.</li>
            <li>I hope to someday be able to walk past the Burt&#x27;s Bees display in my local pharmacy without having a panic attack, and I trust that now that I have pointed out this problem</li>
            <li>Plus, where I live the climate is too dry for this very light-duty balm to be the only lip balm I use.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is pretty average</li>
            <li>However, Im not sure its worth such the hefty price tag.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical as I once originally got the original Burt&#x27;s Bees balm</li>
            <li>I purchased this lip balm because of the positive reviews, and I was looking for a subtle tint in a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lip balm that could be my all-in-one answer for chapped lips and desire for subtle color.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s subtle all right!</li>
            <li>There is no flavor (which is fine with me) and no noticeable odor (I do have a poor sense of smell, and one review mentioned an odor).  </li>

            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Based on the packaging I was expecting a much larger tube than what I got for the 7.99 I spent.</li>

            <li> I would have given this 5 stars, but the additional packaging is an unnecessary extra cost.</li>
            <li> Had I known how small it was going to be, I would have purchased a same-sized tube for 2.99.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a jumbo stick, but when I opened the chunky cardboard case, a tinny, thin little tube slid out into my hands.</li>
            <li> *, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Sounds expensive, and it is for lip balm</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this type of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm.</li>

            <li> Honeysuckle is a natural hint gloss. It stays on.. definitely not a sticky feeling. It is great alone for a regular natural look.</li>
            <li> When I bought this lip tint I thought I was getting a jumbo stick, but when I opened the chunky cardboard case, a tinny, thin little tube slid out into my hands. I was a bit upset that I had paid so much for just an ordinary size stick of lip tint, but I&#x27;ve gotten over it. The tint (honeysuckle) itself is a nice nude color, perfect for a \\&quot;no make up\\&quot; look. It could be a bit less.... orange-y, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me that much(I have warm undertones), and it&#x27;s not really *orange*, it&#x27;s just not *pink*, if you know what I mean. :P All in all, I like the shades that the BB lip tint comes in, I think they are a bit overpriced, and are a bit drying if you were to use them for your normal lip balm. But I don&#x27;t see this product as a balm, just as a tint, so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  They smell great, feels comfortable on, not too \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, and they do have a slight tint.

            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t always get it right (I&#x27;m a long time fan but there have been some products that are a waste), but they did a good job with this tinted lip balm. The color, honeysuckle, is a tinted nude without being sheer and has a little shimmer. It&#x27;s long lasting for a balm and feels nice on. It improves the look of my lips and is a nice everyday color. I like that you can tell that I&#x27;m wearing it and it doesn&#x27;t disappear into my lips. I&#x27;m always afraid of splurging on a tinted balm and not being able to tell I have it on. Not the case with this one. And,  it&#x27;s not too oily for me. These are less than seven dollars at Walmart. Sounds expensive, and it is for lip balm but it is mostly natural. Overall, I like this product and want to try another color, as well. The cardboard tube is a waste of materials. They should just shrink wrap the lip balm and leave it at that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO happy with this product! I was a little skeptical as I once originally got the original Burt&#x27;s Bees balm and I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, it made me almost gag. However, I do not like lipstick and lip gloss is too drying and sticky for me so when I discovered this, I couldn&#x27;t wait. I bought one today and I love the feeling on my lips and the color! The honeysuckle one is comparable to a nude color. Once again, woopee!!</li>
            <li> Love this color.  Lasts a long time. Smells just a little like traditional lipstick.  It seems pretty flat - and would be better with a little more shimmer.  But I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a new lip case and I think formulae also. I buy 2ea of every color I like at the start of spring</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm because of the positive reviews, and I was looking for a subtle tint in a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lip balm that could be my all-in-one answer for chapped lips and desire for subtle color. Well, it&#x27;s subtle all right! Subtle to the point that you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s not a clear lip balm. I am Caucasian with fair skin, so I thought this light shade would give some tint to my lips, but it doesn&#x27;t at all. Plus, where I live the climate is too dry for this very light-duty balm to be the only lip balm I use. Don&#x27;t buy this product if you are looking to add tint to your lips or are looking for an all-in-one balm that will really moisturize and stay put for a few hours. Or possibly try a darker shade if all you want is color. Better yet, just use cherry chapstick if you want a subtly tinted lip balm--so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural look, something that looks like you tried, but not really. This light, sheer, tan color provides a slightly more nude lip look over my natural lip. It provides moisture, not shine, and is definitely a no-mirror application. Actually, should you go a little over, it serves to make your lips look a little fuller. The wax is smooth, and stays on.  I would have given this 5 stars, but the additional packaging is an unnecessary extra cost. While it&#x27;s imperative to have some sort of hygiene seal when purchasing cosmetics, this could have been accomplished much more cheaply by using a simple plastic seal. I know we may pay more for a 100% natural product, but Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t need to pile on even more cost with unnecessary packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shade for a while and its always fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is my most fave balm that I use as a lipstick as well.  It&#x27;s all natural, excellent moisturizer &amp; perfect nude tone!  Very classy nude.  I buy these by the truck load and can&#x27;t get enough - have them in every bag and every bathroom in our house!  BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li> WOW!  This lip balm moisturizes like no other lip balm I have tried...with beautiful color!  What more can you ask?  It seems to stay put for a lot longer, too, and at the end of the day, my lips are soft and moisturized.  There is no flavor (which is fine with me) and no noticeable odor (I do have a poor sense of smell, and one review mentioned an odor).  This is not a &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feeling lip balm, and it is not sticky. There is no SPF, but I work inside all day and am more concerned with moisturizing and having great color...I can switch to a balm with SPF when I leave work.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this type of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm. It looks pretty on (not too heavy, but still noticeable) and it makes my lips feel great. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so it&#x27;s GREAT that it&#x27;s available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Bought for my bridesmaids to go into their bridal party gift bags. Great price and fit into their clutches perfectly.</li>
            <li> I started loving this protuct! I almost became ubsessed with it! But my grandma told me that her docter said they clog pores around your lips! I would stick to eos products!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is pretty average overall.&lt;br /&gt;It does a decent job but it wouldn&#x27;t be the first thing I reached for when chapped lips are a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely prefer the untinted Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its in my purse--but a backup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm and I must say I have never been so upset! Based on the packaging I was expecting a much larger tube than what I got for the 7.99 I spent. Had I known how small it was going to be, I would have purchased a same-sized tube for 2.99. My doctor and fellow PTSD group members advised that I speak my mind to you directly regarding the trauma this has caused me. I would have posted sooner, but I didn&#x27;t have access to my laptop in the hospital. Anyway, after the ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) and Haldol I do feel somewhat better, but I am still suffering some anxiety. I hope to someday be able to walk past the Burt&#x27;s Bees display in my local pharmacy without having a panic attack, and I trust that now that I have pointed out this problem Burt&#x27;s Bees will change the packaging and nobody else will have to suffer as I have.</li>
            <li> Love this lipgloss.  Just a great basic color to give your lips a little shine and softness.  Better than regular chapstick and more natural.</li>
            <li> Of course this is a good product - its Burts Bees! However, Im not sure its worth such the hefty price tag. I wont be buying it again for that reason, nonetheless, it is a very pretty chapstick :)</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and their tinted lip balm is no exception. It is  light and smooth and has good staying power for a lip balm. The coverage/color is very sheer yet pigmented. Also, I got 2 day shipping and got it in one! I would definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lipbalm period. The color is perfect, it smells great and feels nice and moist. It also lasts for hours unlike other natural lipbalm that can last only minutes. I bought my first one retail, but loved it so much that I got this 2 pack to keep extras on-hand. My favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees product!</li>
            <li> You are better off with original untinted. Because the product is very waxy, the tint on top of that is bit too much. It makes the lips look cakey.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect nude shade when it comes to tinted lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it alone or as a base color. It looks great with&lt;br /&gt;pretty much anything. Adore it. It&#x27;s my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm!</li>
            <li> I love burts bee&#x27;s chapstick, but there tinted balms fell short.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work as a chap stick, nor did it hold a color as a tint.&lt;br /&gt;It might work as a gloss.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color in the Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm line. Very neutral with just a hint of natural lip color. I have several of these tucked in my purse, at work, and at home.</li>
