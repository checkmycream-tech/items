    <ol>
            <li>Great deal, they do their job well.</li>
            <li>They work and look great.</li>
            <li>good buy.</li>
            <li>good quality.</li>
            <li>Loved the colors and the size.</li>
            <li>&quot; this product speaks of to keep hair in place because it sure didn&#x27;t work on my hair!</li>
            <li>But I had a great return experience with Amazon, it was easy to return them and my payment was returned promptly.  </li>
            <li>I do not understand what kind of \\&quot;technology\\</li>
            <li>Personally, I really liked these.  </li>
            <li>and they look nice.  </li>
            <li>These clips are Great for people with fine to very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Works good for my extremely fine hair</li>
            <li>Most clips do not have the ability to hold that kind of hair</li>
            <li>-- Very important, to me, is that these things do not appear to be \\&quot;barretts\\</li>
            <li>The oval sides flare out to hold more hair than bobby pins.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to order more as soon as I finish writing this review.</li>
            <li>These are ok.  </li>
            <li>I love these snap clips.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>Meh, they work ok.</li>
            <li>Ok product.</li>
            <li>Nice unique shape.  </li>
            <li>They hold well, are easy to put in, and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>Stays in all day &amp; I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>These work well, even on fine hair.</li>
            <li>so these were a perfect size and snapped tightly.</li>
            <li>These little fasteners are perfect for me!!!</li>
            <li>These are great for holding back my rather fine hair from my face.  </li>
            <li>These are the cheap metal clips.  </li>
            <li>They need to smooth that end tip</li>
            <li>accessories available today.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and these work fine without the special stuff.</li>
            <li>The metal doesn&#x27;t have the right flexibility any more.  </li>
            <li>I found these on Amazon and thought the shape and design were unique</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try these clips.  </li>
            <li>These work very well on fine hair!</li>
            <li>While cute, they don&#x27;t really hold my hair</li>
            <li>These clips are okay quality and a nice price, but they dont stay put very well though, i use them to pin back my shorter layers.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited ...</li>
            <li>these are great little hair clips.  </li>
            <li>I am using them and they work, but don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind I will use.  </li>
            <li>Not as good quality as expected</li>
            <li>They stay in place for my fine, long hair and are cute too.</li>
            <li>just slip right out</li>
            <li>So when i got these and took them out of the package, part of the no-slip surfaces stuck to the cardboard tray and came right off the clip.  </li>
            <li>The slid right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>&quot; They do slip very much.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but have experienced many other clips that at least stay in place.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than the usual clips where you have to push the bottom of the clip inder the top of the clip,  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Seem to be pretty durable</li>
            <li>In terms of function, these easily slip off your hair (although supposedly no-slip) if you have very straight hair regardless of the amount of hair you clip, as they don&#x27;t clip with enough pressure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been into barrettes and clips, and these blend quite nicely with my dark hair.  </li>
            <li>They do work better than other clips I&#x27;ve tried with no lining, but on some places on my head, they slide right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;and has me looking high and low to find more.  </li>
            <li>In terms of looks these clips are a nice departure from the typical snap-ons.</li>
            <li>I wear my long, fine gray hair in a french braid everyday and these clips work great for holding back the sides if I use them towards the top portion of my head.</li>
            <li>Is a good hair clip that hard to design ?</li>
            <li>I like these barrette and the simplicity of them, however, the very end of the barrette catches on your hair and there&#x27;s no way to get it out except pull it.  </li>
            <li>They are comfortable enough to sleep with them on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the colors as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I understand that they don&#x27;t work for some, but others find they hold the hair more securely with less damage than similar models.</li>
            <li>The top grows forward, thus giving me very thick/heavy hair hanging down in front.</li>
            <li>Fall out easily and loose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and was go glad to find them again since I was down to a couple barrettes.</li>
            <li>The quality used to be so consistently good, now it&#x27;s impossible to find clips and barrettes that actually hold your hair and don&#x27;t just sit on top of your head!</li>
            <li>I love these little things</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;gripper&amp;#34; was more slippery than plain metal.  </li>
            <li>The new ones I have bought no longer work.  </li>
            <li>I would love to find some of the old ones to use but the new ones are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>This little hair fastener is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that is strong enough to securely hold back my hair.</li>
            <li>When you have super fine hair, like I do, these were a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  </li>
            <li>Had I not been so busy,  I would have returned the items.  </li>
            <li>Not like the old school ones.</li>
            <li>The stray hairs kept slipping out of the clips, which ruined the whole point of buying hair clips!</li>
            <li>Not very good for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Well Scunci, like many other companies, decided to change them up and put a little plastic sleeve on the clip instead</li>
            <li>Finally, a way to hold back my very thick in volume, but fine in texture, straight hair with more than a few wiry grey hairs.</li>
            <li>These are easy to put on, just push down and it snaps closed.  </li>
            <li>I have relied on Scunci hair clips to keep my hair in place for years--but only the old ones.  </li>
            <li>Thought these might work like other snap clips but were useless at holding hair, but were always good at pinching.</li>
            <li>Too small &#x3D; useful only for a child.</li>

            <li> Too small &#x3D; useful only for a child.</li>
            <li> The older style (same shape) had little rubbery nubs that held my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and these fell out worse than a bobby pin!  </li>
            <li> I looked for a long time to find a clippie like these,&lt;br /&gt;that has a hole on the end, so that I can put</li>
            <li> We will use them to hold in loose strands when my daughter has her hair in a bun, and the hair is already in place and plastered with hairspray.</li>
            <li> the hair comes loose.  </li>
            <li> My little girls have thin, slick hair and these work fabulous for them!</li>
            <li> I thought they were 12 separate small clips and not 6 big long clips; they are practically useless to my fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they slip right out of my hair</li>
            <li> For those of us with fine hair, finding something that keeps our hair in place is very difficult.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s like every other clip I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> these little devilish nuisances, or scunci propaganda anymore!</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the non-slip jaw clips which worked</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s long and thick)</li>
            <li> Holds little hair.  </li>
            <li> if u want to waste your money then buy it ..</li>
            <li> Wearing the clips behind the ear does tend to slip out after several hours.</li>
            <li> And any surface decoration pops off after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> They hold the front of my hair, just a small section, away from my face for work outs.  </li>
            <li> Quality like this one usually does not easily&lt;br /&gt;find in hair ornaments.</li>
            <li> They say they are no-slip but they still slip in my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and small packs of stray, hanging hair</li>
            <li> My kids got thin hair, and they slide off in about 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> very bad quality product it dont make any grip properly.....</li>
            <li> The item was delivered dirty and broken.</li>
            <li> This is not a flaw in the clips, in fact, I think the design is genius, I just have really weird hair.</li>
            <li> i have thick semi-wavy hair and these stupid clips</li>
            <li> The packaging was stained with some brown stuff, it was disgusting.  </li>
            <li> that just makes the barrette slide out of my hair - HATE THEM!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good buy. good quality.</li>
            <li> These are the cheap metal clips.  I am using them and they work, but don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like these barrette and the simplicity of them, however, the very end of the barrette catches on your hair and there&#x27;s no way to get it out except pull it.  They need to smooth that end tip so there is no circle that&#x27;s going to grab your hair and pull it out.</li>
            <li> These are easy to put on, just push down and it snaps closed.  It will stay where you snap it, so your hair stays where you want it.  These are so much better than the usual clips where you have to push the bottom of the clip inder the top of the clip,  It&#x27;s the only kind I will use.  The are low priced and durable.  I&#x27;ve never had one break or lose its snap.  They also come in an oval shape,</li>
            <li> I thought they were 12 separate small clips and not 6 big long clips; they are practically useless to my fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> THESE DO NOT STAY IN ANY HAIR! i have thick semi-wavy hair and these stupid clips just slip right out no matter how i put them in! save yourself some money and just go buy some at dollar tree!</li>
            <li> very bad quality product it dont make any grip properly.....if u want to waste your money then buy it ..</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these...&lt;br /&gt;and has me looking high and low to find more.  I understand that they don&#x27;t work for some, but others find they hold the hair more securely with less damage than similar models.</li>
            <li> I tried using these because I need to keep my hair up and in place for my job.  I have fine hair, and these fell out worse than a bobby pin!  I do not understand what kind of \\&quot;technology\\&quot; this product speaks of to keep hair in place because it sure didn&#x27;t work on my hair! The stray hairs kept slipping out of the clips, which ruined the whole point of buying hair clips! I think I&#x27;ll just get my head shaved so I won&#x27;t need to worry about my hair,  these little devilish nuisances, or scunci propaganda anymore! Problem solved.</li>
            <li> There is nothing on these clips that make them qualify for the title \\&quot;no-slip.\\&quot; They do slip very much. I have fine hair, but have experienced many other clips that at least stay in place. These start to slip lower within fifteen minutes, maybe. We will use them to hold in loose strands when my daughter has her hair in a bun, and the hair is already in place and plastered with hairspray. I cannot use them to hold my sides up as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I wear my long, fine gray hair in a french braid everyday and these clips work great for holding back the sides if I use them towards the top portion of my head. Wearing the clips behind the ear does tend to slip out after several hours. Otherwise, my french braid stays when I combine the clips with gel. They are comfortable enough to sleep with them on. The oval sides flare out to hold more hair than bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Finally, a way to hold back my very thick in volume, but fine in texture, straight hair with more than a few wiry grey hairs. The top grows forward, thus giving me very thick/heavy hair hanging down in front. This little hair fastener is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that is strong enough to securely hold back my hair. Wish I had found these years ago. I love these little things and I&#x27;m going to order more as soon as I finish writing this review. -- Very important, to me, is that these things do not appear to be \\&quot;barretts\\&quot; obviously holding back my hair. They are almost undiscernable. I&#x27;m a grandmother of 5 and don&#x27;t want to look like a nut wearing headbands, bobby pins, or barretts.  These little fasteners are perfect for me!!!</li>
            <li> Fall out easily and loose</li>
            <li> I have relied on Scunci hair clips to keep my hair in place for years--but only the old ones.  The new ones I have bought no longer work.  The metal doesn&#x27;t have the right flexibility any more.  And any surface decoration pops off after a few uses.  I would love to find some of the old ones to use but the new ones are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Personally, I really liked these.  I have thin hair and small packs of stray, hanging hair so these were a perfect size and snapped tightly.</li>
            <li> Thought these might work like other snap clips but were useless at holding hair, but were always good at pinching. Never buy these again. Is a good hair clip that hard to design ?</li>
            <li> these are great little hair clips.  fold back on them selves to grip well.  i use them for the hairs  that fall out of ponytails and to  clip bangs back</li>
            <li> My little girls have thin, slick hair and these work fabulous for them!</li>
            <li> I found these on Amazon and thought the shape and design were unique so I wanted to try them.  They work well and keep my hair pinned up.  I&#x27;d ordered them again.</li>
            <li> These work very well on fine hair! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The item was delivered dirty and broken. The packaging was stained with some brown stuff, it was disgusting.  Whoever packed this item, simply didn&#x27;t care. The gel strips where all crusty and came off. Had I not been so busy,  I would have returned the items.  Waste of money and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works good for my extremely fine hair</li>
            <li> Not like the old school ones. While cute, they don&#x27;t really hold my hair (it&#x27;s long and thick) so I&#x27;ll give them to a friend.</li>
            <li> So when i got these and took them out of the package, part of the no-slip surfaces stuck to the cardboard tray and came right off the clip.  The rest of it came off within one use.  The clips however do their job even without it and they look nice.  Would I spend extra for the no-slip? Not again.  I have fine hair and these work fine without the special stuff.</li>
            <li> Great deal, they do their job well.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer below - these are useless as are most of the Scunci, Goody, etc. accessories available today.  Since the manufacturing has been outsourced I find that the quality has taken a nose-dive.  The quality used to be so consistently good, now it&#x27;s impossible to find clips and barrettes that actually hold your hair and don&#x27;t just sit on top of your head!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and was go glad to find them again since I was down to a couple barrettes. They don&#x27;t break, I misplace them.  They hold the front of my hair, just a small section, away from my face for work outs.  They stay in place for my fine, long hair and are cute too.</li>
            <li> For those of us with fine hair, finding something that keeps our hair in place is very difficult.  Scunci No-Grip Fin Hair Double Oveal Snap Clips comes close.  The stuff in the middle of the clip helps keep the hair there in place, but the ends have no stuff (possibly silicone)and the hair comes loose.  Still needs work.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  They tend to get stuck in my hair and pull out hairs.  Ugh!</li>
            <li> These are great for holding back my rather fine hair from my face.  I&#x27;ve never been into barrettes and clips, and these blend quite nicely with my dark hair.  They hold well, are easy to put in, and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> Having a career in Cosmetology I am always looking for products to help my clients with their beauty needs.  These clips are Great for people with fine to very fine hair.  Most clips do not have the ability to hold that kind of hair</li>
            <li> These clips are okay quality and a nice price, but they dont stay put very well though, i use them to pin back my shorter layers. The coating has faded and chipped in places and the clips slip and slide throughout the day and need readjusting often. wouldnt recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend! Fast delivery! Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> These arrived within promised time frame so I was pretty excited ... until I saw the product.  Once I opened the package and took one of the clips off the paper backing, the &#x27;no-slip&#x27; material flaked off.  I immediately unsnapped all of the clips and the no-slip material was brittle/flaked on all of the clips.  If it didn&#x27;t break off when I unsnapped it was because it was already stuck to the paper backing.  If it was a more expensive product I would consider returning.</li>
            <li> I used this product only twice.  Both times, I could not get it out of my hair.  It ended up tangling and pulling some of my hair out!  I do not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> Not as good quality as expected</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the non-slip jaw clips which worked so I was excited to try these clips.  Unfortunately, they slip right out of my hair so it&#x27;s like every other clip I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> These clip hair well.</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time to find a clippie like these,&lt;br /&gt;that has a hole on the end, so that I can put&lt;br /&gt;a dangly piece of jewelry or an earring in it for&lt;br /&gt;added effect. They work and look great. I have&lt;br /&gt;worn them for months and they still look brand&lt;br /&gt;new. Quality like this one usually does not easily&lt;br /&gt;find in hair ornaments.</li>
            <li> Like the way the clips function and look, but two broke - popped open unmendably -  immediately upon use.</li>
            <li> I love these snap clips. I will be buying more soon. Stays in all day &amp; I have fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t rip my hair like bobby pins either.</li>
            <li> They say they are no-slip but they still slip in my thick hair. They do have some sort of plastic coating that seems like it would help protect your hair but it seems to make them slippery in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My hair is even finer and thinner than these can work with reliably.  They do work better than other clips I&#x27;ve tried with no lining, but on some places on my head, they slide right out of my hair.  This is not a flaw in the clips, in fact, I think the design is genius, I just have really weird hair.</li>
            <li> When you have super fine hair, like I do, these were a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  The older style (same shape) had little rubbery nubs that held my hair in place.  Well Scunci, like many other companies, decided to change them up and put a little plastic sleeve on the clip instead that just makes the barrette slide out of my hair - HATE THEM!  I always say, &amp;#34;If it&#x27;s not broke - DON&#x27;T FIX IT!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Too small &#x3D; useful only for a child. Could not get them to stay &amp; they still slipped no matter what.</li>
            <li> Meh, they work ok. My kids got thin hair, and they slide off in about 1-2 hours. I&#x27;ll keep searching for the optimal solution.</li>
            <li> These work well, even on fine hair. Stays in well. Loved the colors and the size. Seem to be pretty durable</li>
            <li> Holds little hair.  Nice unique shape.  Have open end.  Made of metal.  Bend the metal to open and close.  Can use for clipping the bangs to the side or clipping the side of the hair when it is put up.</li>
            <li> The slid right out of my hair.  The &amp;#34;gripper&amp;#34; was more slippery than plain metal.  But I had a great return experience with Amazon, it was easy to return them and my payment was returned promptly.  Every once in a while I order something that does not work for me, and I appreciate your handling of the return on this product.</li>
            <li> Not very good for fine hair.</li>
            <li> In terms of looks these clips are a nice departure from the typical snap-ons. In terms of function, these easily slip off your hair (although supposedly no-slip) if you have very straight hair regardless of the amount of hair you clip, as they don&#x27;t clip with enough pressure.</li>
            <li> Ok product. Don&#x27;t like the colors as much as I thought I would.</li>
