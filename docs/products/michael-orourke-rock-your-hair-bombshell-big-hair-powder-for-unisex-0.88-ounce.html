            <li>This powder really does volumize, and it smells great too!</li>
            <li>Bombshell&#x27;s texture is closer to baby powder and it smells nice.  </li>

            <li>Itll give you that sexy tousled look or if you are from Jersey....and amazing pouf</li>
            <li>I travel a lot for work and when I don&#x27;t check a bag, it&#x27;s nice to be able to carry this on and not worry about the liquids/aerosol restrictions</li>
            <li>I was happy with it at first because it DOES give volume.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell.</li>
            <li>After trying several hair powders, &amp;#34;Rock Your Hair&amp;#34; is the best out there.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>IT IS LIKE MAGIC FAIRY DUST</li>
            <li>I love all of the RYH products and hope the line is never discontinued.</li>
            <li>I just love it..</li>
            <li>Love this product for the price</li>
            <li>but I have friends that just love it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This is one of my most favorite hair care products.</li>
            <li>I tried this powder on my hair the day after washing to freshen up my style and add more volume.</li>
            <li>For so many years I&#x27;d been using root pumps, mousse, etc.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure after reading some of the reviews</li>
            <li>but I am SO glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m glad i tried this and have this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and this is one of my favorite hair powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product....</li>
            <li>I always have a problem getting volume at my roots on top...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reasons I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>And no one is going to notice it, or even feel it (if they touch the top of your hair).  </li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>(Although you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell that just by looking at it...)</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>will be buying more.</li>
            <li>It could be good in the right hands, but most people don&#x27;t have the time or patience to comb out most of the product so there is no dandruff looking residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s mainly for your roots, but works great if you have hair that doesn&#x27;t hold styles well...</li>
            <li>It really works but make sure you don&#x27;t spill too much on your hair because it stays white!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, awesome for volume!</li>
            <li>I just wonder if people apply it, think it looks good because they can&#x27;t see the back of their head and then leave good reviews?</li>
            <li>This is great stuff if you want volume, yet you will most likely have to wash your hair after use.</li>
            <li>I recommend using with a dry shampoo, even if your hair is clean, for the best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It also gets greasy very quickly, which this product seems to help with.)</li>
            <li>Then I tried a fine toothed comb and that helped a bit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gives me AMAZING volume, pushes a blow-out to 4 or 5 days depending on how much working out</li>
            <li>I love it when my hair is big and full and with just a sprinkle of this product and a good forceful scalp rub,  those results can be achieved.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this on line.</li>
            <li>so I was really excited to try it.</li>
            <li>wow LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I end up using more hairspray than I &#x27;d like and this helps me NOT need so much.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use VERY sparingly and use your fingers to work it through.</li>
            <li>This product has changed my the way I style my hair and guarantees me a full, voluminous look for days.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>The best way to use it is to lift your hair up and sprinkle a very small amount in the area(s)</li>
            <li>I have no clue how this has so many high ratings.</li>
            <li>light dusting on the roots and first 2 inches of my hair.</li>
            <li>has good hold and lift and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to tease your hair as much to get the results you want!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used this since first trying it from a friend and have never used anything else!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair but fine and straight.</li>
            <li>hair is straight, medium thickness, somewhat fine and difficult-to-fluff.</li>
            <li>I  feel why wash your hair if you&#x27;re going to grease it up again, but this product, although a little sticky,  gave great hold without that \\&quot;greasy kid look.\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>works great in bangs when they are limp.</li>
            <li>Now my hair will look great everyday.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing if you want the big hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for some body on top of my thin head of hair.  </li>
            <li>and was surprised to find I didn&#x27;t even miss it because this powder does such a great job by itself.</li>
            <li>This is so worth trying.</li>
            <li>but maybe I am not using it right...</li>
            <li>I was originally going to get the Big Sexy Powder Play at Ulta but saw this one on clearance and decided to try it, because this was my first time trying hair powder and the cheaper price appealed to me.</li>
            <li>:) However, less is definitely more with this product - when it dries it feels how I would imagine spray glue/gel in your would</li>
            <li>This makes your teasing far more effective, so you can tease less and it stays longer and looks more natural.</li>
            <li>It will take a couple of trys till you get it right so play with it on your day off first.  </li>
            <li>I have normal, straight hair that does a good poof on its own, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable, have not found it in any store for this price.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take much to work!  </li>
            <li>I was so amazed the first time I used it at what a difference it makes.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, this is my first hair powder</li>
            <li>Will most definitely order this product again and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>Big Hair Powder gives me that volume, lift and tousselled look that I love.</li>
            <li>I have VERY fine blonde hair that doesn&#x27;t have much volume.</li>
            <li>This product goes on feeling cool and after working it through with my fingers, itkeeps my hair full for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>, you really dont need to tease very much with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Was discouraged at first because I was using too much.  </li>
            <li>This product gives my hair so much volume, makes me look like I really have hair and my hair styles so much easier and stays longer!</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>It is opposed ti being tamed though, and I don&#x27;t really have gime to sraighten, curl and blowdry.  </li>
            <li>I think I apply too much, so use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>Its really like a backcomb in a bottle.</li>
            <li>If you watch Michael O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s YouTube videos when he uses the product, you&#x27;ll get the real sense of how it&#x27;s suppose to be used.</li>
            <li>Love and trust comes in a pink bottle, after all.</li>
            <li>My hair wouldn&#x27;t stay curled no matter how much product I used, until I sprinkled the powder over my whole head and worked it into the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>very slippery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The detangling wet brushes will allow you to brush your hair, as well as remove most of the powder (if you want/need to).  </li>
            <li>This sounds nutty but really works.</li>
            <li>It really helps create texture and lift.</li>
            <li>Nothing moved, it really clings to your hair.</li>
            <li>For me, this is too much work and worry.</li>
            <li>this hair product works very well for my hairstyle.</li>
            <li>It was just a little but still weird lol other than that it&#x27;s thee BEST STUFF EVER</li>
            <li>This hair powder transforms fine flat hair into a voluminous head of hair.</li>
            <li>It does texturize your hair so after using it hair isn&#x27;t as touchable or have as much movement as clean hair does but for big hair and styling, it makes ALL the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I originally purchased at salon for almost double the price.</li>
            <li>When I apply it to the roots then rub around I get way more volume than with any other product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other powder products that have been much better..</li>
            <li>it works great as a dry shampoo/ and also you can put a little in when your hair is clean to give it extra body for teasing.  </li>
            <li>You can always add more so start small till you find your right place.</li>
            <li>I happen to have a bathroom with a mirror configuration so that I can easily and clearly see the back of my head where I applied this stuff.</li>
            <li>but this feels cool on my hair and does&#x27;t leave any white residue.</li>
            <li>This is a great product... similar to Osis Dustit but not as hard to work with.</li>
            <li>I get less volume instead of more.  </li>
            <li>particularly curls.</li>
            <li>It came highly recommended for my hair type, and it just did not work.  </li>
            <li>i used a good chunk of this thinking its just powder and would be feathery light, boy was i wrong!</li>
            <li>Wow! Volume!</li>
            <li>So I LOVE Bombshell because it gives my hair as much volume as I want with super long lasting stay power for my long days.</li>
            <li>I love pure abundance by aveda, but its procey and Avedas gone down hill ever since it made Oprahs best of crap</li>
            <li>I start from the part on top of my head and lift my hair in 1\\&quot; sections, holding the bottle sideways a few inches away and tap-tapping to sprinkle just a wee bit on each section.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if you like long lasting volume that you can refresh anytime you want then you will love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if you like long lasting volume that you can refresh anytime you want then you will love this.</li>
            <li>also i like it better than the spray dry shampoos cuz it always seems you can only get like 10 sprays out of them</li>
            <li>Make sure to use little as possible &amp; rub in good with dark hair or will get white streaks/spots.</li>
            <li>First off, this is NOT a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but honestly it doesn&#x27;t last long enough</li>
            <li>this little guy i have had for about 6 months and its still going strong-</li>
            <li>The only other comparable product I know of is Aveda Pure Abundance Hair Potion, but it costs way more and works the same.</li>
            <li>Especially the top of my head goes flat and stays flat.</li>
            <li>If you have fine, limp hair</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I saw large pieces of white stuff where I applied it.</li>
            <li>It definitely volumizes my hair, but it makes it look kind of greasy and makes it hard to even brush through if I decide to.</li>
            <li>and this is one of the only things that really does what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li>I do use this same brand&#x27;s root pump, but not as much as I was before.</li>
            <li>If you apply too much it feels really gross on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>My hair wants to be flat while I want it to be poofy!</li>
            <li>The next time i used it, i only used a teeny bit on my crown and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>The one caution I&#x27;d have is you definitely have to be careful to apply a light layer only.</li>
            <li>You really need to be careful to use the smallest amount possible and then brush it in really well.</li>
            <li>I have used other hair powders before such as big sexy, sallys products, and aveda hair potion and this product works about the same as the others!</li>
            <li>Absolutely cannot live without rocking my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>my hair is thick and fine...</li>
            <li>My hair is naturallly pretty fine and limp and its not as thick as I wish it was.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and so many of the products out there weight it down and make my scalp feel dirty and itchy.  </li>
            <li>i apply it near roots, with a big makeup brush dipped into a cup with the powder in the bottom-so that i don&#x27;t get too much in different spots.</li>
            <li>I have very thin, fine straight hair</li>
            <li>I love the dry shampoo, but this stuff is no good.</li>
            <li>I do dry shampoo and Elnett hairspray nearly every day.</li>
            <li>This rocks fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine and thin hair.</li>

            <li> I travel a lot for work and when I don&#x27;t check a bag, it&#x27;s nice to be able to carry this on and not worry about the liquids/aerosol restrictions</li>
            <li> I was happy with it at first because it DOES give volume.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell.</li>
            <li> After trying several hair powders, &amp;#34;Rock Your Hair&amp;#34; is the best out there.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> IT IS LIKE MAGIC FAIRY DUST</li>
            <li> I love all of the RYH products and hope the line is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> I just love it..</li>
            <li> Love this product for the price</li>
            <li> but I have friends that just love it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This is one of my most favorite hair care products.</li>
            <li> I tried this powder on my hair the day after washing to freshen up my style and add more volume.</li>
            <li> For so many years I&#x27;d been using root pumps, mousse, etc.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure after reading some of the reviews</li>
            <li> but I am SO glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m glad i tried this and have this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and this is one of my favorite hair powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product....</li>
            <li> I always have a problem getting volume at my roots on top...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reasons I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> And no one is going to notice it, or even feel it (if they touch the top of your hair).  </li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> (Although you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell that just by looking at it...)</li>
            <li> love this product.  </li>
            <li> will be buying more.</li>
            <li> It could be good in the right hands, but most people don&#x27;t have the time or patience to comb out most of the product so there is no dandruff looking residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s mainly for your roots, but works great if you have hair that doesn&#x27;t hold styles well...</li>
            <li> It really works but make sure you don&#x27;t spill too much on your hair because it stays white!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, awesome for volume!</li>
            <li> I just wonder if people apply it, think it looks good because they can&#x27;t see the back of their head and then leave good reviews?</li>
            <li> This is great stuff if you want volume, yet you will most likely have to wash your hair after use.</li>
            <li> I recommend using with a dry shampoo, even if your hair is clean, for the best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It also gets greasy very quickly, which this product seems to help with.)</li>
            <li> Then I tried a fine toothed comb and that helped a bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives me AMAZING volume, pushes a blow-out to 4 or 5 days depending on how much working out</li>
            <li> I love it when my hair is big and full and with just a sprinkle of this product and a good forceful scalp rub,  those results can be achieved.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this on line.</li>
            <li> so I was really excited to try it.</li>
            <li> wow LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I end up using more hairspray than I &#x27;d like and this helps me NOT need so much.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use VERY sparingly and use your fingers to work it through.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my the way I style my hair and guarantees me a full, voluminous look for days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> The best way to use it is to lift your hair up and sprinkle a very small amount in the area(s)</li>
            <li> I have no clue how this has so many high ratings.</li>
            <li> light dusting on the roots and first 2 inches of my hair.</li>
            <li> has good hold and lift and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to tease your hair as much to get the results you want!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this since first trying it from a friend and have never used anything else!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but fine and straight.</li>
            <li> hair is straight, medium thickness, somewhat fine and difficult-to-fluff.</li>
            <li> I  feel why wash your hair if you&#x27;re going to grease it up again, but this product, although a little sticky,  gave great hold without that \\&quot;greasy kid look.\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> works great in bangs when they are limp.</li>
            <li> Now my hair will look great everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing if you want the big hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for some body on top of my thin head of hair.  </li>
            <li> and was surprised to find I didn&#x27;t even miss it because this powder does such a great job by itself.</li>
            <li> This is so worth trying.</li>
            <li> but maybe I am not using it right...</li>
            <li> I was originally going to get the Big Sexy Powder Play at Ulta but saw this one on clearance and decided to try it, because this was my first time trying hair powder and the cheaper price appealed to me.</li>
            <li> :) However, less is definitely more with this product - when it dries it feels how I would imagine spray glue/gel in your would</li>
            <li> This makes your teasing far more effective, so you can tease less and it stays longer and looks more natural.</li>
            <li> It will take a couple of trys till you get it right so play with it on your day off first.  </li>
            <li> I have normal, straight hair that does a good poof on its own, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable, have not found it in any store for this price.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t take much to work!  </li>
            <li> I was so amazed the first time I used it at what a difference it makes.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, this is my first hair powder</li>
            <li> Will most definitely order this product again and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> Big Hair Powder gives me that volume, lift and tousselled look that I love.</li>
            <li> I have VERY fine blonde hair that doesn&#x27;t have much volume.</li>
            <li> This product goes on feeling cool and after working it through with my fingers, itkeeps my hair full for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> , you really dont need to tease very much with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Was discouraged at first because I was using too much.  </li>
            <li> This product gives my hair so much volume, makes me look like I really have hair and my hair styles so much easier and stays longer!</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> It is opposed ti being tamed though, and I don&#x27;t really have gime to sraighten, curl and blowdry.  </li>
            <li> I think I apply too much, so use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Its really like a backcomb in a bottle.</li>
            <li> If you watch Michael O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s YouTube videos when he uses the product, you&#x27;ll get the real sense of how it&#x27;s suppose to be used.</li>
            <li> Love and trust comes in a pink bottle, after all.</li>
            <li> My hair wouldn&#x27;t stay curled no matter how much product I used, until I sprinkled the powder over my whole head and worked it into the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> very slippery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The detangling wet brushes will allow you to brush your hair, as well as remove most of the powder (if you want/need to).  </li>
            <li> This sounds nutty but really works.</li>
            <li> It really helps create texture and lift.</li>
            <li> Nothing moved, it really clings to your hair.</li>
            <li> For me, this is too much work and worry.</li>
            <li> this hair product works very well for my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> It was just a little but still weird lol other than that it&#x27;s thee BEST STUFF EVER</li>
            <li> This hair powder transforms fine flat hair into a voluminous head of hair.</li>
            <li> It does texturize your hair so after using it hair isn&#x27;t as touchable or have as much movement as clean hair does but for big hair and styling, it makes ALL the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I originally purchased at salon for almost double the price.</li>
            <li> When I apply it to the roots then rub around I get way more volume than with any other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other powder products that have been much better..</li>
            <li> it works great as a dry shampoo/ and also you can put a little in when your hair is clean to give it extra body for teasing.  </li>
            <li> You can always add more so start small till you find your right place.</li>
            <li> I happen to have a bathroom with a mirror configuration so that I can easily and clearly see the back of my head where I applied this stuff.</li>
            <li> but this feels cool on my hair and does&#x27;t leave any white residue.</li>
            <li> This is a great product... similar to Osis Dustit but not as hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I get less volume instead of more.  </li>
            <li> particularly curls.</li>
            <li> It came highly recommended for my hair type, and it just did not work.  </li>
            <li> i used a good chunk of this thinking its just powder and would be feathery light, boy was i wrong!</li>
            <li> Wow! Volume!</li>
            <li> So I LOVE Bombshell because it gives my hair as much volume as I want with super long lasting stay power for my long days.</li>
            <li> I love pure abundance by aveda, but its procey and Avedas gone down hill ever since it made Oprahs best of crap</li>
            <li> I start from the part on top of my head and lift my hair in 1\\&quot; sections, holding the bottle sideways a few inches away and tap-tapping to sprinkle just a wee bit on each section.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, if you like long lasting volume that you can refresh anytime you want then you will love this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, if you like long lasting volume that you can refresh anytime you want then you will love this.</li>
            <li> also i like it better than the spray dry shampoos cuz it always seems you can only get like 10 sprays out of them</li>
            <li> Make sure to use little as possible &amp; rub in good with dark hair or will get white streaks/spots.</li>
            <li> First off, this is NOT a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> but honestly it doesn&#x27;t last long enough</li>
            <li> this little guy i have had for about 6 months and its still going strong-</li>
            <li> The only other comparable product I know of is Aveda Pure Abundance Hair Potion, but it costs way more and works the same.</li>
            <li> Especially the top of my head goes flat and stays flat.</li>
            <li> If you have fine, limp hair</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I saw large pieces of white stuff where I applied it.</li>
            <li> It definitely volumizes my hair, but it makes it look kind of greasy and makes it hard to even brush through if I decide to.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the only things that really does what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li> I do use this same brand&#x27;s root pump, but not as much as I was before.</li>
            <li> If you apply too much it feels really gross on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> My hair wants to be flat while I want it to be poofy!</li>
            <li> The next time i used it, i only used a teeny bit on my crown and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> The one caution I&#x27;d have is you definitely have to be careful to apply a light layer only.</li>
            <li> You really need to be careful to use the smallest amount possible and then brush it in really well.</li>
            <li> I have used other hair powders before such as big sexy, sallys products, and aveda hair potion and this product works about the same as the others!</li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot live without rocking my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> my hair is thick and fine...</li>
            <li> My hair is naturallly pretty fine and limp and its not as thick as I wish it was.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and so many of the products out there weight it down and make my scalp feel dirty and itchy.  </li>
            <li> i apply it near roots, with a big makeup brush dipped into a cup with the powder in the bottom-so that i don&#x27;t get too much in different spots.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine straight hair</li>
            <li> I love the dry shampoo, but this stuff is no good.</li>
            <li> I do dry shampoo and Elnett hairspray nearly every day.</li>
            <li> This rocks fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> This product takes my fine, limp, ordinary hair and instantly transforms me into a ravishing Goddess!!</li>
            <li> Left my hair flat and sticky.</li>
            <li> I had very straight dull hair Until I found rock your hair volume powder.....</li>
            <li> and then my hair falls flat.</li>
            <li> all day long you just fix with your hands and it is back in place</li>
            <li> I did all of this on freshly washed and dried hair and after a few hours when to check the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it as dry shampoo since it leaves somewhat of a gritty feel to hair.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo had a similar effect for me</li>
            <li> Dry shampoos can leave some white residue.  </li>
            <li> If you add too much, you end up with stiff hair which is rough to the touch..</li>
            <li> This made my baby-fine, glass-shiny, stick straight hair sticky, dull, and clumped together.  </li>
            <li> You would be crazy not to try it :-)</li>
            <li> You have to be ok with your hair feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but</li>
            <li> Smaller packaging than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Also, I have black hair, and it left a faded white film where it was applied.</li>
            <li> Its not silky and smooth at the crown like it is at the nape, but if it was, it would be silky and smooth- and flat and boring.</li>
            <li> but it feels the same in my hair as the other one. )</li>
            <li> You only need a little sprinkle at the roots to give amaizing volume instantly!  </li>
            <li> and I straighten it with a straightening iron after I blow dry it,</li>
            <li> I dry my hair with a brush, straighten it, and then section the crown, sprinkling some powder it and rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> Instead, I recommend using a dry shampoo.  </li>

            <li> The ONLY way to feel it is to stick your fingers all the way down to your scalp and attempt to run your fingers through the hair at the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I discovrerd this stuff long ago!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine limp hair and it makes my hair feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> and like the way my blowout looks with a little left in my hair.</li>
            <li> and thats such a waste..</li>

            <li> The rhinestones were missing off of mine and the package was open.  </li>
            <li> B00821ZHMK The Wet Hair Brush, Metallic Purple]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Its thick and does not seem adverse to that wild look.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Their other product that was supposed to work just as well did not even come close.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> you are looking for just a little volume, or to just absorb oil at the scalp, volumizing powders are not really the way to go.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to give hair volume, it does leave the roots (where you sprinkle the powder) where it is hard to run your fingers or a regular brush through.  </li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is so worth trying.e of that dirty sensation.</li>
            <li> and I wear it long - past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a little product to a moderate amount and it literally makes my hair gooey and dull.</li>
            <li> This one is less sticky but the volume isn&#x27;t all that.  </li>
            <li> (turned out i found this one because it was less spendy-</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less to pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it made my hair a gunky mess.</li>
            <li> not really sure if you can add this to partially wet hair.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like that your hair looks thin and flat then rub a little of this on your roots when wet and blow</li>
            <li> The texture is hard to explain, it&#x27;s not sticky at all but does have a tackiness to it, but it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in the past.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE SPRINKLE AND BANG ...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it stacks up against other brands</li>
            <li> gives them a little volume</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t drop it all in 1 little area.</li>
            <li> this totally makes my hair look and feel very thick.  </li>
            <li> heavy withnthisnstuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.....</li>
            <li> Just a few shakes and then shape with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Just a few &#x27;taps&#x27; in the palm of your hand, rub hands together and rub your hands through your hair and proceed with your style.  </li>
            <li> agree with other reviewers that it is a little hard to shampoo out</li>
            <li> I usually do this down to about my ear level.</li>
            <li> should&#x27;ve read the small print.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have hair a bit past my chin</li>
            <li> First used by my stylist and they know I hate that greasy hold look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stiff, like cement in your hair.</li>
            <li> It hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Sad i spent money on this.</li>
            <li> If the feeling of product in your hair or a slight sticky feeling bothers you, you might not love this because of that dirty sensation.</li>
            <li> I was shocked this actually worked</li>
            <li> I have a hard time shampooing this out!  </li>
            <li> my hairdresser used the really expensive one on my hair at the salon and ever since i was in search of it.  </li>
            <li> I hce weird wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Poor wee bottle!</li>
            <li> Its a weird texture...goes on like powder</li>
            <li> Kinda weird.</li>
            <li> No More Teasing!!!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in the past. This one is less sticky but the volume isn&#x27;t all that.  Lovely smell.</li>
            <li> After trying several hair powders, &amp;#34;Rock Your Hair&amp;#34; is the best out there.  I have fine hair and so many of the products out there weight it down and make my scalp feel dirty and itchy.  This product goes on feeling cool and after working it through with my fingers, itkeeps my hair full for the entire day.  If I feel it needs a boost, I just scratch and massage and then the lift reinvents itself and starts working all over again.</li>
            <li> I was shocked this actually worked but honestly it doesn&#x27;t last long enough but maybe I am not using it right...I will continue to work on that.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  it works great as a dry shampoo/ and also you can put a little in when your hair is clean to give it extra body for teasing.  its crazy though, you really dont need to tease very much with this stuff.  my hairdresser used the really expensive one on my hair at the salon and ever since i was in search of it.  (turned out i found this one because it was less spendy- but it feels the same in my hair as the other one. ) also i like it better than the spray dry shampoos cuz it always seems you can only get like 10 sprays out of them and thats such a waste.. this little guy i have had for about 6 months and its still going strong- although i dont use every day/ maybe 2x a week.  i would also recommend using a clarifying shampoo after use so you get any residue out of your hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.....I love it when my hair is big and full and with just a sprinkle of this product and a good forceful scalp rub,  those results can be achieved. It also doesn&#x27;t take much to work!  Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Bombshell Big Hair Powder - IT IS LIKE MAGIC FAIRY DUST IN A BOTTLE.  A LITTLE SPRINKLE AND BANG ... VOLUME!  Has a wonderful fragrance too!</li>
            <li> If you have fine, limp hair I have two words for you - GET THIS!  I was so amazed the first time I used it at what a difference it makes.  Believe me I have tried everything and this is one of the only things that really does what it promises to do.  I love all of the RYH products and hope the line is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> This product adds superior volume to your hair..it really works. I just love it..The seller and price was great..&lt;br /&gt;Bombshell is one porduct that did what it said it would do.\\&quot;give you big hair\\&quot; and it does.</li>
            <li> I use this to make the perfect hair bump.  Makes your hair feel thicker and gives you the ability to style it easier.  Doesn&#x27;t look greasy and even though it&#x27;s a white powder it doesn&#x27;t show in my hair at all (I am blonde though). Love this product for the price</li>
            <li> If I was on a deserted island with George Clooney and I could only have 1 hair care product it would be BOMBSHELL powder!! This product takes my fine, limp, ordinary hair and instantly transforms me into a ravishing Goddess!! I don&#x27;t know what I did before having this product, but I do know it is a keeper and I will never be without it again!</li>
            <li> i used a good chunk of this thinking its just powder and would be feathery light, boy was i wrong! it made my hair a gunky mess. The next time i used it, i only used a teeny bit on my crown and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love pure abundance by aveda, but its procey and Avedas gone down hill ever since it made Oprahs best of crap she can afford to buy and we cant. I hce weird wavy hair. Its thick and does not seem adverse to that wild look. It is opposed ti being tamed though, and I don&#x27;t really have gime to sraighten, curl and blowdry.  I wash and fly. I can sprinkle this stuff in as I hit the freeway. Only thing is, it makes my hair greasy. It puffs. A littlte but fall heavy withnthisnstuff. I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this on line. I originally purchased at salon for almost double the price. It arrived within a week too!  This is a great product to add texture to your fine hair!</li>
            <li> It definitely volumizes my hair, but it makes it look kind of greasy and makes it hard to even brush through if I decide to.</li>
            <li> This product did not meet expectations...it was terrible for my hair but I have friends that just love it...the delivery for this product was good...received the merchandise in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> It does great in my hair. I have a lot of hair but fine and straight. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff if you want volume, yet you will most likely have to wash your hair after use.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but should&#x27;ve read the small print. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Smaller packaging than what I expected. A small amount goes a long way. If you add too much, you end up with stiff hair which is rough to the touch..which you do not want!&lt;br /&gt;Im not really sure if you can add this to partially wet hair. My stylist used another hair powder on my partially wet hair and I did not even know she put that in.</li>
            <li> I was originally going to get the Big Sexy Powder Play at Ulta but saw this one on clearance and decided to try it, because this was my first time trying hair powder and the cheaper price appealed to me. I LOVE this stuff! Like I said, this is my first hair powder so I&#x27;m not sure how it stacks up against other brands but if you are considering trying some, I&#x27;d recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives me AMAZING volume, pushes a blow-out to 4 or 5 days depending on how much working out I&#x27;m doing (could probably go longer but I have always been an over-shamppoer). It does texturize your hair so after using it hair isn&#x27;t as touchable or have as much movement as clean hair does but for big hair and styling, it makes ALL the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that it is a little hard to shampoo out but I actually like that and like the way my blowout looks with a little left in my hair.</li>
            <li> It did the job!  Great for some body on top of my thin head of hair.  My advice:  Use Sparingly!  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This powder really does volumize, and it smells great too! I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it as dry shampoo since it leaves somewhat of a gritty feel to hair. Also, I have black hair, and it left a faded white film where it was applied. I think I apply too much, so use it sparingly. I would buy it again once it runs out though.</li>
            <li> This is one of my most favorite hair care products. After using several different kinds this is the one for me. Pleasant scent, works great. Price is very reasonable, have not found it in any store for this price. Will most definitely order this product again and recommend it to anyone. Shipped in timely manner, received in good condition.</li>
            <li> I ordered Michael O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s Rock Your Hair Bombshell Big Hair Powder for Unsex (sold by RedCatCat) and received it yesterday. I could not believe how tiny the container of the product is!!! I paid $15.98 for this product and now I feel totally ripped off!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.....I will NEVER buy anything on Amazon in the future that is sold by RedCatCat!!!!!</li>
            <li> This rocks fine thin hair. When I apply it to the roots then rub around I get way more volume than with any other product. (My hair is short and layered.) The only other comparable product I know of is Aveda Pure Abundance Hair Potion, but it costs way more and works the same.</li>
            <li> I tried this powder on my hair the day after washing to freshen up my style and add more volume. It didn&#x27;t add any volume and it made my hair look like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in days! I couldn&#x27;t believe how greasy it looked. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine and thin hair. This product gives my hair so much volume, makes me look like I really have hair and my hair styles so much easier and stays longer! Talk about Rocking my Hair . . . This does and I am pleased! Thank you Rock Your Hair for making an awesome product...</li>
            <li> works great in bangs when they are limp. gives them a little volume</li>
            <li> wow LOVE this product! I went by the reviews and thought it might work for me too. I wish I discovrerd this stuff long ago!! I have hair a bit past my chin and I straighten it with a straightening iron after I blow dry it, but I always try to get volume in there. I end up using more hairspray than I &#x27;d like and this helps me NOT need so much. I dry my hair with a brush, straighten it, and then section the crown, sprinkling some powder it and rubbing it in. I do about 3 sections on each side and then 2 at the top-back.  During the day, I can stick my fingers in my hair through my temples and simple &amp;#34;fluff up&amp;#34; my hair and that works perfectly. I&amp;#34;m very impressed. I really like this product!  For so many years I&#x27;d been using root pumps, mousse, etc. I do use this same brand&#x27;s root pump, but not as much as I was before. My volume comes from the powder. My hair is naturallly pretty fine and limp and its not as thick as I wish it was. this totally makes my hair look and feel very thick.  The feeling takes some getting used to. Its not silky and smooth at the crown like it is at the nape, but if it was, it would be silky and smooth- and flat and boring.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever.... I recomend this product to every woman in the nation.  Not only does the product work, but the packaging is like eye candy. This product has it all.  The founder Michael O&#x27;Rourke knows what he is doing.  Every woman loves pink and diamonds.  Its the perfect gift for every girl! Try it, you will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I used this product before until my salon stopped carrying it. Their other product that was supposed to work just as well did not even come close. I was so happy to find this online and so ordered my three bottles. Now my hair will look great everyday.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure after reading some of the reviews but I am SO glad I ordered it. This powder gives my roots that lift that I&#x27;ve always wanted. It also helps to keep oil at bay so I can go a day without shampooing.</li>
            <li> This made my baby-fine, glass-shiny, stick straight hair sticky, dull, and clumped together.  I was really disappointed with how this ended up working on my hair.  It came highly recommended for my hair type, and it just did not work.  It sits in my cabinet, unused.  Poor wee bottle!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time shampooing this out!  It hard to work with. It feels dense once it hits the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have one daughter who loves this stuff!  I purchased it all for her and she very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this prodect! Tried a friends and had to purchase it. It works great and will recommend to friends or anyone that askes.</li>
            <li> if youre looking for all day volume, this is it!</li>
            <li> This product does not work for my hair.  I have very fine limp hair and it makes my hair feel dirty.  I get less volume instead of more.  I had read a lot of good reviews on the product before purchasing it but it did not work the same on my hair as it seems to work on others.</li>
            <li> Great product for &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; people who don&#x27;t the time to play with their hair all day! Continuous body all day!!</li>
            <li> I had very straight dull hair Until I found rock your hair volume powder.....I sprinkle it on my hair and I swear its like magic! It instantly gives me the volume and style I&#x27;ve been wanting all my life! You would be crazy not to try it :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% i&#x27;ll buy this again but i&#x27;m glad i tried this and have this product. It dirty&#x27;s up my hair a bit on days when i shower and my hair is boring and limp. Dry shampoo had a similar effect for me but this feels cool on my hair and does&#x27;t leave any white residue.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing!!  You only need a little sprinkle at the roots to give amaizing volume instantly!  Its a weird texture...goes on like powder but when it gets in your hair it feels damp. Just make sure to use VERY sparingly and use your fingers to work it through. Itll give you that sexy tousled look or if you are from Jersey....and amazing pouf no bumpit or backcombing required! Its really like a backcomb in a bottle. It really does work!</li>
            <li> This is a great product... similar to Osis Dustit but not as hard to work with. I love it. It smells like Smarties candy, so if you don&#x27;t like that this is not for you. I&#x27;m a hair product junkie and this is one of my favorite hair powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re getting a great price here... it&#x27;s almost 2x this in stores.</li>
            <li> Works great! Make sure to use little as possible &amp; rub in good with dark hair or will get white streaks/spots.</li>
            <li> Bottle is tiny. The rhinestones were missing off of mine and the package was open.  Total rip off.  Mine was not sold as advertised. Product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot live without rocking my hair every other day. This product has changed my the way I style my hair and guarantees me a full, voluminous look for days.</li>
            <li> First used by my stylist and they know I hate that greasy hold look. I  feel why wash your hair if you&#x27;re going to grease it up again, but this product, although a little sticky,  gave great hold without that \\&quot;greasy kid look.\\&quot;.  An amazing powder.  Just a few shakes and then shape with your fingers.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel disgusting</li>
            <li> I always have a poof in my hair. I have normal, straight hair that does a good poof on its own, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. So I LOVE Bombshell because it gives my hair as much volume as I want with super long lasting stay power for my long days. For all those reviews out there that say this made their hair oily... it&#x27;s about using it properly and not cakeing it on. A little goes a long way! And spread it out. Don&#x27;t drop it all in 1 little area. If you watch Michael O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s YouTube videos when he uses the product, you&#x27;ll get the real sense of how it&#x27;s suppose to be used. The travel size bottle always comes with me. Love and trust comes in a pink bottle, after all.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing if you want the big hair.  You don&#x27;t need to tease your hair as much to get the results you want!!  Good stuff</li>
            <li> I have no clue how this has so many high ratings. I&#x27;ve tried a little product to a moderate amount and it literally makes my hair gooey and dull. Don&#x27;t try to run your fingers through your hair (or let someone else), it feels like a greasey dirty mess and its so bad that you get the buildup under your fingernails!</li>
            <li> Love this product....great volume for the hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thin hair that only does what it wants?????  Try this, it actually works.  Was discouraged at first because I was using too much.  Just a few &#x27;taps&#x27; in the palm of your hand, rub hands together and rub your hands through your hair and proceed with your style.  It will take a couple of trys till you get it right so play with it on your day off first.  You can always add more so start small till you find your right place.</li>
            <li> I always have a problem getting volume at my roots on top...even with backcombing/teasing so I use Bombshell now to get the look I want.  The packaging is so cute!</li>
            <li> About me:&lt;br /&gt;My hair is straight, medium thickness, somewhat fine and difficult-to-fluff. My hair wants to be flat while I want it to be poofy! Especially the top of my head goes flat and stays flat. I&#x27;ve been using every volumizing shampoo, volumizing mousse, root lifter, $30 hairspray known to man and I just discovered this about six months ago. This powder is my soulmate hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;A light dusting on the roots and first 2 inches of my hair. I start from the part on top of my head and lift my hair in 1\\&quot; sections, holding the bottle sideways a few inches away and tap-tapping to sprinkle just a wee bit on each section. I usually do this down to about my ear level. It&#x27;s not necessary to dust the entire length of your hair, nor necessary to apply to your entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;1) It lasts all day. If your hair falls and you lose volume, just shake your hair upside down or lift the roots with your fingers and your volume is instantly restored.&lt;br /&gt;2) When you sprinkle this then backcomb your hair, it actually stays in. This makes your teasing far more effective, so you can tease less and it stays longer and looks more natural. Even if you didn&#x27;t backcomb, this makes it look like you did.&lt;br /&gt;3)It can be used as a standalone product. I actually ran out of hairspray a couple days ago (emergency!!) and was surprised to find I didn&#x27;t even miss it because this powder does such a great job by itself. I travel a lot for work and when I don&#x27;t check a bag, it&#x27;s nice to be able to carry this on and not worry about the liquids/aerosol restrictions and it&#x27;s less to pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;1) The one caution I&#x27;d have is you definitely have to be careful to apply a light layer only. If you apply too much it feels really gross on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;2) You have to be ok with your hair feeling dirty. If the feeling of product in your hair or a slight sticky feeling bothers you, you might not love this because of that dirty sensation. Doesn&#x27;t bother me but people who aren&#x27;t used to product residue might take a while to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you like long lasting volume that you can refresh anytime you want then you will love this. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. This is so worth trying.e of that dirty sensation. Doesn&#x27;t bother me but people who aren&#x27;t used to product residue might take a while to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you like long lasting volume that you can refresh anytime you want then you will love this. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. This is so worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other powder products that have been much better.. I just don&#x27;t feel like this product gives me the big hair that I look for when I do clients hair.</li>
            <li> I have used other hair powders before such as big sexy, sallys products, and aveda hair potion and this product works about the same as the others! Except this one smells sooooo sexy, i love it! Plus the bottle is so cute and girly!</li>
            <li> This hair powder transforms fine flat hair into a voluminous head of hair. I recommend using with a dry shampoo, even if your hair is clean, for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mainly for your roots, but works great if you have hair that doesn&#x27;t hold styles well...particularly curls. My hair wouldn&#x27;t stay curled no matter how much product I used, until I sprinkled the powder over my whole head and worked it into the ends of my hair. Amazing results.</li>
            <li> Had some water inside and came out on my hair.. Kinda weird. It was just a little but still weird lol other than that it&#x27;s thee BEST STUFF EVER TO GIVE YOUR HAIR A POOF WITH LOTS OF VOLUME! LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> my hair is thick and fine...very slippery. it can&#x27;t even hold a barrette. this gives it some tackiness so my hair combs will hold in place. also, teasing doesn&#x27;t hold in my hair but this makes it work. i apply it near roots, with a big makeup brush dipped into a cup with the powder in the bottom-so that i don&#x27;t get too much in different spots.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! No More Teasing!!!!! Just Sprinkle on scalp, and rub it in, and Wow! Volume! Volume! Volume!!! It&#x27;s also Great for texture, and sprinkle on curled hair, and get ready For Amazing Hair!!!!!! A Product I can&#x27;t go without!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works for about 5 minutes and then my hair falls flat. It does plump back up when I run my fingers up the roots, but have to do this often to keep the volume. I now use with a root lift spray and teasing spray and between the three I get volume for several hours before a touch up.</li>
            <li> First off, this is NOT a dry shampoo.  This is a hair volumizing powder.  A little goes a long way.  The best way to use it is to lift your hair up and sprinkle a very small amount in the area(s) you want volume.  I&#x27;ve also used [[ASIN:B00NFUXX6K Got 2B Powder&#x27;Ful Volumizing Style Powder 0.35oz (2 Pack)]], but I prefer this RYH Bombshell Hair Powder because of its smell and texture.  Bombshell&#x27;s texture is closer to baby powder and it smells nice.  There is no white residue remaining after you rub it in your hair/scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to give hair volume, it does leave the roots (where you sprinkle the powder) where it is hard to run your fingers or a regular brush through.  I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as sticky, though.  And no one is going to notice it, or even feel it (if they touch the top of your hair).  The ONLY way to feel it is to stick your fingers all the way down to your scalp and attempt to run your fingers through the hair at the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detangling wet brushes will allow you to brush your hair, as well as remove most of the powder (if you want/need to).  These brushes all work equally well at brushing through roots with volumizing powder in it ... [[ASIN:B00821ZHMK The Wet Hair Brush, Metallic Purple]], [[ASIN:B000L596FE The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush, Colors Vary]], [[ASIN:B008O4YM80 SHARKK Hair Brush Professional Detangling Shower Brush For Wet Or Dry Hair (Black)]]).  Don&#x27;t attempt to brush your hair at the roots with a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for just a little volume, or to just absorb oil at the scalp, volumizing powders are not really the way to go.  Instead, I recommend using a dry shampoo.  I like [[ASIN:B006T8BXF8 Dove Invigorating Dry Shampoo, 5 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B00HUECKJS Batiste Dry Shampoo Strength and Shine, 6.73 Ounce]].  Dry shampoos can leave some white residue.  The best thing to do is to massage your scalp and run your fingers through your hair.  If you still need more white removed, run the wet detangling brush through your hair a few times and that does the trick.wet detangling brush through your hair a few times and that does the trick.</li>
            <li> This sounds nutty but really works. I have thinning hair and I just love it. I now get compliments on my hair also,</li>
            <li> Works awesome for putting your hair up. I used on my wedding day and it held all day in the southern humidity</li>
            <li> Yuck is all I can say. Left my hair flat and sticky. And that was using the tiniest amount.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this product on me and I loved the results.  I tried a similar product from the beauty supply store but it was not as good.  Only Rock Your Hair Bombshell Big Hair Powder gives me that volume, lift and tousselled look that I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this since first trying it from a friend and have never used anything else! It really helps create texture and lift.</li>
            <li> I read about this stuff somewhere recently so came here to buy it. It has great reviews so I was really excited to try it. I have very thin, fine straight hair and I wear it long - past my shoulders. I do dry shampoo and Elnett hairspray nearly every day. I also use sea salt spray, texture spray, spray wax, hair paste, etc. So, I have a lot of experience with hair products. This one I do not like, and here&#x27;s why: With even the smallest, tiniest amount applied to the under section of hair around my crown, it leaves what looks like dandruff everywhere. I was happy with it at first because it DOES give volume. The texture is hard to explain, it&#x27;s not sticky at all but does have a tackiness to it, but it&#x27;s dry. It&#x27;s very stiff, like cement in your hair. You really need to be careful to use the smallest amount possible and then brush it in really well. I did all of this on freshly washed and dried hair and after a few hours when to check the back of my head. That&#x27;s when I saw large pieces of white stuff where I applied it. It looked bad, like really awful dandruff. I then took a brush and tried to work it out. Nothing moved, it really clings to your hair. Then I tried a fine toothed comb and that helped a bit. For me, this is too much work and worry. I happen to have a bathroom with a mirror configuration so that I can easily and clearly see the back of my head where I applied this stuff. I just wonder if people apply it, think it looks good because they can&#x27;t see the back of their head and then leave good reviews? It could be good in the right hands, but most people don&#x27;t have the time or patience to comb out most of the product so there is no dandruff looking residue.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product for my hair! I have VERY fine blonde hair that doesn&#x27;t have much volume. (It also gets greasy very quickly, which this product seems to help with.) I use this product daily with a teashing comb and it works wonders. :) However, less is definitely more with this product - when it dries it feels how I would imagine spray glue/gel in your would if you try to run your fingers through it. (Although you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell that just by looking at it...)</li>
            <li> Sad i spent money on this. It made my hair feel gross. I love the dry shampoo, but this stuff is no good.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like that your hair looks thin and flat then rub a little of this on your roots when wet and blow dry out it will give you lots of volume.</li>
            <li> love this product.  tried it at my hair dresser and it keeps my hair poofy.  all day long you just fix with your hands and it is back in place</li>
            <li> This was another hair fiber product I didn&#x27;t like. Made my hair feel &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; texture wise. Made my head itch. Sorry</li>
            <li> It really works but make sure you don&#x27;t spill too much on your hair because it stays white!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, awesome for volume!</li>
            <li> this hair product works very well for my hairstyle. has good hold and lift and lasts all day long. will be buying more.</li>
