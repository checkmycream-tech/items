            <li>This Sarna lotion is good at taking away the itch.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Sure does the job for my family...not more itching!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to apply and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance free lotion is great, however.</li>
            <li>It is a great light moisturizer that truly gets rid of the itching.</li>
            <li>Packaging was effective in the receiving of the product without damage.  </li>
            <li>but the smell is very strong</li>
            <li>In my searches, this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful topical product.</li>
            <li>not awful but competed with Eau de Jasmine.  </li>
            <li>will give it more time to try .</li>
            <li>Most stores carry Sarna....</li>
            <li>So my husband rubs it into my back twice a day - a pleasant experience!  </li>
            <li>If you mix this with Almond Oil you create a very good hydrating cream that relieves itch, breathes easily and hydrates you for the entire day without any grease.</li>
            <li>strong smell like Mexsana...</li>
            <li>It easily removes most itches quickly, without the use of steroids.</li>
            <li>Since we are allergic to fragrances we found the original much too strong with perfume!!  </li>
            <li>so I can put this on and go out but not with the original because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li>will keep it available to use whenever, or wherever I feel the need.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really offer an honest opinion because I had an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance free sarna -- the regular is good too</li>
            <li>and I prefer it as it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Just not the Fragrance Free formula</li>
            <li>GOT MY LOTION IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER, GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE,  THE LOTION WAS SUGGESTED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST, AND IT ALLEVIATES MY DRY SKIN AND ITCHING.THANKS SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I have tried several products and while all provide some relief my first experience with Sarna has been very good.</li>
            <li>Good product; doesn&#x27;t stop every itch but is soothing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;For more heavy duty, use a steroid.</li>
            <li>Medication keeps me sane, but with this lotion added I actually get amazing itch-free relief.</li>
            <li>Rubbing just one pump&#x27;s worth into my hands is all I need in those cases.</li>
            <li>but I still itch in certain areas on my body and right now we are trying light treatments</li>
            <li>It does not sink in right away</li>
            <li>Very light and low fragrance .</li>
            <li>I do not know what more I could say about a product I use daily.</li>
            <li>so I was so glad to find it on Amazon for the same price!!  </li>
            <li>This product is very effective to resolve major itching and other skin discomforts.  </li>
            <li>Works fine for sensitive skin, very soothing for itchy skin.</li>
            <li>it does the job is not grease A quick and easy way to treat dry skin</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, with winter and dry skin</li>
            <li>lotion did help make it look and feel a bit better, but my skin was dry and tender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very cooling on itchy, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>This is very soothing on burning feet, too.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the scented version available locally...</li>
            <li>This really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some areas around my ankles that are still bothering me, but the Sarna is always very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really solves the itch problem</li>
            <li>I find this Lotion very cooling and it does help to control itch.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion we have found (and we have spent a good sum on alot of others) that ACTUALLY works and is SCENT FREE.  </li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li>Sarna works on my skin better than any other anti itch lotion.  </li>
            <li>This lotion was recommended by our dermatoligist, but only found original in stores.  </li>
            <li>and it works better than other things I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The first kind I bought had a smell that wasn&#x27;t too bad, but very strong.</li>
            <li>Tne consistency is light and easy to apply, unlike some lotions which are too thick.</li>
            <li>Same famous anti-itch lotion as regular Sarna without the stong menthol odor and cooling sensation, which we don&#x27;t really need in the winter.</li>
            <li>As a Psoriasis sufferer, I live by Sarna.</li>
            <li>I find it particularly useful to re-moisturize my hands after doing things that dry out my skin, like yard work or cleaning the house.</li>
            <li>Look for the scent-free version if your skin is sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li>Sarna Sensitive, Anti-Itch Lotion Fragrance...</li>
            <li>Arrived early and intact</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Sensitive &amp; Fragrance Free&#x27; formula is hard to find</li>
            <li>It really soothes the dry skin and my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin from regular water aerobics &amp; this is the &#x27;sensivie&#x27; version.</li>
            <li>I have used on mosquito bites, ant bites and just general skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>is the only lotion I use to help with my dry itchy sensitive skin as it contains both hydrocortisone and pramoxine.</li>

            <li> I have used Sarna for a long time.  </li>

            <li> The doctor said your skin is dry and this lotion will eliminate the itch from the bite and dryness of the skin.  </li>
            <li> It even removed two patches of dry skin.  </li>

            <li> , I selected some tiny little sample tubes of Sarna.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My physician tells me I have moderate neuralgia along my mid-vertebral column and that the cheapest and least invasive way to treat it is with a product such as Sarna.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> stops annoying itching and scratching.  really works.</li>
            <li> I buy it because it works for me.</li>
            <li> Sarna is an excellent product for relief of skin itch. I have been using it for the last year and Sarna provides relief I wasn&#x27;t getting from other products.</li>
            <li> I have eczema from food allergies and this can relieve the pain that I get from not scratching.</li>
            <li> Sarna works on my skin better than any other anti itch lotion.  I have used on mosquito bites, ant bites and just general skin irritations.  I can put the lotion on and within a few minutes I forget about the bites or irritation.  Like this three pack as it allows me to have Sarna in both bathrooms and in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> My physician tells me I have moderate neuralgia along my mid-vertebral column and that the cheapest and least invasive way to treat it is with a product such as Sarna.  So my husband rubs it into my back twice a day - a pleasant experience!  The Sarna does the trick.  Look for the scent-free version if your skin is sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> Very light and low fragrance . Does a very good job of relieving itching and promotes healing as well as the skin irritation. Works on people as well as the dog. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Sarna Sensitive, Anti-Itch Lotion Fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;This is the only lotion I use to help with my dry itchy sensitive skin as it contains both hydrocortisone and pramoxine.</li>
            <li> Works fine for sensitive skin, very soothing for itchy skin. BUT!  but this type of suction delivery system always wastes at least 3/4 oz when the suction tube gets close to the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> Being a dialysis patient brings a lot of itching. My dermatologist recommended this OTC product. Hard to find in stores, so Amazon here I come. It&#x27;s a wonderful topical product. It&#x27;s not a thick, heavy product but it&#x27;s very cooling on itchy, irritated skin. It does not sink in right away but you can continue to slather it on until the itching abates. By ordering it through Amazon I did save on the cost versus purchasing it at a store.</li>
            <li> Good product; doesn&#x27;t stop every itch but is soothing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;For more heavy duty, use a steroid.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, with winter and dry skin it is the only cream that works for me.  I was having trouble finding it in the stores, I will always order it on line again.</li>
            <li> GOT MY LOTION IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER, GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE,  THE LOTION WAS SUGGESTED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST, AND IT ALLEVIATES MY DRY SKIN AND ITCHING.THANKS SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> This is very soothing on burning feet, too.  I didn&#x27;t like the scented version available locally...strong smell like Mexsana...not awful but competed with Eau de Jasmine.  This really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  Also, I have very sensitive skin from regular water aerobics &amp; this is the &#x27;sensivie&#x27; version.</li>
            <li> I have used Sarna for a long time.  It is the only product that relieves an itch.  Thanks. I do not know what more I could say about a product I use daily. Virginia Slusher</li>

            <li> have not seen big improvement .  will give it more time to try .</li>
            <li> My dermatologist had prescribed a lotion for my itchy, irritated legs.&lt;br /&gt;The rash looked terrible, but felt even worse.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion did help make it look and feel a bit better, but my skin was dry and tender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my next visit to her, I selected some tiny little sample tubes of Sarna.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it that night, and immediately, I felt relief!&lt;br /&gt;There are some areas around my ankles that are still bothering me, but the Sarna is always very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep it available to use whenever, or wherever I feel the need.&lt;br /&gt;Buying it through Amazon, I opted for buying a bundle of three bottles.&lt;br /&gt;That should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I find it particularly useful to re-moisturize my hands after doing things that dry out my skin, like yard work or cleaning the house. Rubbing just one pump&#x27;s worth into my hands is all I need in those cases.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Haven&#x27;t found the perfect lotion yet.  In my searches, this is the best so far.</li>

            <li> I have severe eczema and Serna applied to the troubled areas relieves the constant itching</li>
            <li> Seems to be the best stuff out there for elderly people with skin problems.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to apply and does not feel greasy.  Helped my dry itchy skin!!!</li>
            <li> Really solves the itch problem</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by my Dermatologist.  I decided to buy some after I used the samples the doctor provided.  I had some flea bites from a puppy we babysat and it itched.  The doctor said your skin is dry and this lotion will eliminate the itch from the bite and dryness of the skin.  I used it one day and I could feel the difference.  I use it all over my body now.  It really soothes the dry skin and my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.  I will continue to use it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Works as well as Gold Bond, without the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This Sarna lotion is good at taking away the itch.  It even removed two patches of dry skin.  One on my ear and one on my arm.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stops itching</li>
            <li> Guess what : i t workks !!!!</li>
            <li> Great product for relief from sun poisoning</li>
            <li> I have  allergies and horribly dry skin that itches incessantly sometimes.  Sarna helps alleviate that itching.</li>
            <li> I had psoriasis pretty bad and the dermatologist recommended doing humira shots which cleared me completely up but I still itch in certain areas on my body and right now we are trying light treatments but I also use a lot of the sarna lotion and I&#x27;ve used a lot of creams prescription and otc and the sarna is the only thing that gives me relief. I don&#x27;t have any rash or anything that is visible.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and intact</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really offer an honest opinion because I had an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It&#x27;s the only cream that makes my skin feel like it can breathe while simultaneously taking away the itch caused by my SD. I found an excellent technique. If you mix this with Almond Oil you create a very good hydrating cream that relieves itch, breathes easily and hydrates you for the entire day without any grease. I Put about 2/3 sarna cream and 1/3 almond oil.</li>
            <li> I helps so I don&#x27;t have a rash or itch after being in a clorined pool.</li>
            <li> For years I have had a problem with dry itching skin especially on my forearms. I have tried several products and while all provide some relief my first experience with Sarna has been very good. No smell, not greasy mess and it works better than other things I&#x27;ve used. Good product.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance free sarna -- the regular is good too but the smell is very strong so I can put this on and go out but not with the original because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> The product is very effective to resolve skin itching and distress.  The product provider shipped &amp; I received the product in a timely manner.  Packaging was effective in the receiving of the product without damage.  All containers were found to be as I would have picked them up in a drug store.  This product is very effective to resolve major itching and other skin discomforts.  I would recommend it to anyone having skin irritations.  I discussed this product with my dermatologist and she recommended its use.  I suggest anyone using this product to discuss it with their dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I find this Lotion very cooling and it does help to control itch. I have extremely dry skin  and helps t moisturize my skin. I have tried innumerable body creams and prefer sarna.  Tne consistency is light and easy to apply, unlike some lotions which are too thick.</li>
            <li> Sure does the job for my family...not more itching!!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It is a great light moisturizer that truly gets rid of the itching.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this brand. The first kind I bought had a smell that wasn&#x27;t too bad, but very strong. I found this and I prefer it as it is fragrance free. The lotion is amazing! I have psoriasis and eczema and am subject to unbearable 24/7 itching, especially my hands. Medication keeps me sane, but with this lotion added I actually get amazing itch-free relief. I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> This is great for skin problems!</li>
            <li> The product was supposed to have CAMPHOR.  the product ingredients changed.  I would like to have the product with camphor that I thought it was getting.</li>
            <li> We are DRY in west texas and lotions are a must.  As my Husband and I have aged (50+) our skin has become dryer and itchy.  This is the only lotion we have found (and we have spent a good sum on alot of others) that ACTUALLY works and is SCENT FREE.  The &#x27;Sensitive &amp; Fragrance Free&#x27; formula is hard to find so I was so glad to find it on Amazon for the same price!!  Most stores carry Sarna....Just not the Fragrance Free formula and I don&#x27;t like the menthol smell.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> As a Psoriasis sufferer, I live by Sarna. It easily removes most itches quickly, without the use of steroids.</li>
            <li> At times I itch a lot and it really doesn&#x27;t help much</li>
