            <li>I have been using GM Collin products for over 15 years and simply love the clean and gentle characteristics of the skin care line.  </li>

            <li>The Hydramucine Optimal Gel is described as a light and ultra-fresh hydrating lotion, enriched with vegetal peptides and chrono-energizers for a quenched, soft and radiant skin.</li>
            <li>In the summer when there is more moisture in the air I only use the gel but in the winter when the air is dryer I use both</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>But few other friends that are using it, are also happy!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for clean and fresh skin care.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have problems with most lotions this and the hydramucine concentrated serum, are the only ones that work well.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t spend this much $ on skincare products, but because I have tricky skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>reccomend GM Collin products to all with normal skin.</li>
            <li>Product is for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, brand new.</li>
            <li>Package doesn&#x27;t look brand new, but bottle inside seemed new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It you dislike fragrances or are sensitive to them you might want to get the Sensiderm Gel instead.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t know anyone that have sensitive skin, so i won&#x27;t dare to suggest for those, who has skin problems, ask your cosmetologists/dermatologists).</li>

            <li> Great Collin product.  I use it regularly and get many compliments on my skin. I&#x27;m 50 and I look 40.  Products delivered quickly and then perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best oil free face moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t create acne.</li>

            <li> GM Collin is a spa brand that is normally found at spa locations that provide facial services. The Hydramucine Optimal Gel is described as a light and ultra-fresh hydrating lotion, enriched with vegetal peptides and chrono-energizers for a quenched, soft and radiant skin. It is alcohol-free and oil-free and has a pleasant scent.   The gel has a light blue color and smells wonderful. It you dislike fragrances or are sensitive to them you might want to get the Sensiderm Gel instead. I have dry skin after washing but get oily throughout the day. Hydramucine provides hydration but also helped to control the oil throughout the day.  I like this gel lotion more than Clinique Moisture Surge, Biore Moisturizer, DDF Oil-Free Moisturizing Dew, Philosophy Hope in a Jar, Dior Hydra Life Pro-Youth Sorbet Creme, Shiseido, and many others. The only downside is the cost of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this product, using it for few years now, and Amazon.com made it even better, with providing great price. I have previously bought it through the cosmetologist, and it was a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend GM Collin products to all with normal skin.

            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Collin facial line for 2 years now. This products reduces the lines in my face. My face is hydrated. I will continue to use them for a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I am very happy with GM Collins products.  I use these products every day, morning and afternoon.  Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> Gel is light and yet it works! I need a PH balance moisturizer. This is not oily and you can tell its working. Packaged well and delivered within the week.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream although I wish it were not as expensive. This is great to use during the winter time for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome for dehydrated skin.  Leaves skin feeling rejuvenated and refreshed.  I definitely recommend this product for clean and fresh skin care.</li>

            <li> It balances my mostly oily/sometimes weirdly dry skin perfectly. I am very acne prone and it causes no breakouts and does not make me greasy.</li>
            <li> I recently had a facial and the aesthetician recommended I try this gel, as I have combination normal/oily skin.  I  love, love, love this moisturizer and highly recommend for anyone with combination skin.  My husband uses it as well and has the same great results.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have problems with most lotions this and the hydramucine concentrated serum, are the only ones that work well. They leave my skin hydrated, without making my skin break out.  This lotion is light but hydrates very well.  In the summer when there is more moisture in the air I only use the gel but in the winter when the air is dryer I use both and it is a perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a light fragrance but it goes away soon after application.  I was worried the scent would make my face go crazy but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Hydrates mixed zone skin types, light, not greasy&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not an anti-wrinkle cream as well, price</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my wife and she&#x27;s happy with it. It arrived on time, brand new. Just what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Great for dehydrated skin without being oily. It&#x27;s more expensive at the spa. Glad I searched Amazon for a better deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for 6 months now along with the cleansing milk and I love it. My skin is nice and soft but not greasy. Delivery was quick and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon is now carrying it. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years. It&#x27;s wonderful! It&#x27;s not oily and yet moisturizes my skin for the entire day.</li>
            <li> GM Collin has great products; but my derm switched me to skin medica.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Package doesn&#x27;t look brand new, but bottle inside seemed new.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it was repacked. Product is for normal to oily skin. Still feels&lt;br /&gt;too rich for acne prone T-zone. Will go back to oxygen gel next time.</li>
            <li> This is the best face lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  So smooth and light on skin.</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended this product to me after a facial last year.  I normally don&#x27;t spend this much $ on skincare products, but because I have tricky skin (combination dry/oily with periodic breakouts).. I decided to give it a try.  I would say this is the best moisturizing product I have ever used.  It did not cause breakouts and feels great on.  I like to mix it with my favorite foundation to make my own tinted moisturizer for a fresh look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I ran out of the bottle I bought from the salon, I set out to find a less expensive option.. and thankfully Amazon was that option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> They said it has NO oil because its a gel but it makes my face so oily. Ugh!!!</li>
            <li> Love it used it for years.  Light oil free, plumps skin.  Lasts for 5 months. Good value for the money</li>
            <li> I love GM Collin Hydramucine Optimal Gel!  It is the best yet. I love the way it goes on...it&#x27;s so soft and smooth. I love the way it makes you face look so alive. I highly recommend it.</li>
