            <li>Just some of the most remarkable acne medication ive ever come in contact with...bar-none.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was just amazing..</li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling nice because of the grit exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>lmao</li>
            <li>Skin does better without too many steps!</li>
            <li>I love Proactiv, I&#x27;ve used it for years and have amazing skin.  </li>
            <li>Was thrilled to be able to buy 2 cleansers from Amazon w/o having to re-engage my Proactiv membership.</li>
            <li>THIS is by far the best cleansing face wash</li>
            <li>This alone with the Original Revitalizing Toner keeps my skin looking beautiful and free of break outs.</li>
            <li>Great and fast delivery and an awesome-working product!</li>

            <li>Love it and love that Amazon sells it</li>
            <li>great product and fast</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>It contains sodium PCA, sodium hyaluronate, sorbitol, and urea all of which moisturize the skin and keep it healthy</li>
            <li>I love it and don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a hormone imbalance</li>
            <li>My son is very happy with Proactiv, but he only likes the Step 1 product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the price fluctuates so much when I am buying it every two months or so, but I will keep buying it, because it has done a great job of clearing up his acne and keeping it away.</li>
            <li>buy it did an ok job</li>
            <li>This one was must have for a person that I love.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my order.</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This product has made my skin look better than it has.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say mine was the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It works and everything but after not using it for a week you start to break out more</li>
            <li>Well, I have to say, the Skingenixx is the better product.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of products, most are to strong for my skin and break me out.  </li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon and it keeps my daughters face clear of acne.</li>
            <li>I love the light dermobrasion feeling.</li>
            <li>It works great, then I complete with Step 2 and 3 after my shower in front of mirror.  </li>
            <li>Great price for this product - love being able to buy this product individually...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like the joy of a clear face and the confidence it gives you.</li>
            <li>MUCH larger amounts is just incredible.</li>
            <li>All in all however, thank you for the quick delivery, the item was un-expired, and came in very quick manner!</li>
            <li>It has been a easy way to control acne for him.</li>
            <li>It hands down is the best product for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I received a huge bottle that was already expired.</li>
            <li>and shes a red head at her skin looks GREAT.</li>
            <li>Very handy in the larger size too.</li>
            <li>She brags about the significant improvement she&#x27;s seen with it.  </li>
            <li>Nothing makes my face feel clean like this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the whole pack just the face wash because the face wash alone works just fine!</li>
            <li>I love the large size.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t want to order two other products to get this one product from Proactiv, it&#x27;s nice to be able to order it from someplace else.</li>
            <li>Authentic product, professionally packaged, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to order only when you need the product.</li>
            <li>Always satisfied with this product, my face is completely clear - decent price, like the 90 day supply, and it shipped in time.</li>
            <li>Expect to find it priced much higher at a Proactiv kiosk.</li>
            <li>I first got all three..</li>
            <li>Love the actual product itself.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described and delivered as promised.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was not my first time buying Proactiv...</li>
            <li>Her skin really does look cleaner and clearer!  </li>
            <li>so I think I&#x27;m gunna stick to clean and clear</li>
            <li>i usually always have a good experience with amazon.</li>
            <li>granted, it did take a full 4 months for it to COMPLETELY rid my face of acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very very heart breaking as a cool dinosaur design could have been added anywhere on the white bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Attached is the dinosaur I would have used for the image on the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>Aside from the cost I really like Proactiv.</li>
            <li>Price...not so much.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I really need all of that.</li>
            <li>I really wish they would adjust this misleading part of their listings, and not create termed expectations for use.  </li>
            <li>so why the hell makes these ppl thimk to charge this much??</li>
            <li>I stopped buying this product 2 years ago from the &amp;#34;Proactiv Club&amp;#34; because I had too much product.</li>
            <li>works really well if u use it.</li>
            <li>It made me wonder if this was really proactive</li>
            <li>I really like ordering it through Amazon,</li>
            <li>However, it is very pricey.  </li>
            <li>REAL SOON.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast service and the product works</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product was as described.  </li>
            <li>My son a regular ProActiv user and he bought this because I saw the cheap price.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>this stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this product via Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>They really need to state these things (i.e. expiration dates) in the description.</li>
            <li>I purchased from this seller on March 2nd and started using it just 3 days ago because that&#x27;s when I ran out of my original Proactiv.</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t use the other 2 pieces in the normal kit like the toner and lotion, they irritated  my skin or break me out even more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another cool option/feature that could have been added is whenever you squeeze the bottle it would make a cool dinosaur rawring noise out of the little hole.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product on it&#x27;s own, but I truly hate proactiv&#x27;s &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; and I am much happier purchasing thru amazon!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone should pay that much money for something that isn&#x27;t new</li>
            <li>Been using proactive for 10 years, super product, in short, this cleaner works!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li>This has really helped my chin acne that I have developed as a menopausal woman.  </li>
            <li>But No- I&#x27;m 58 years old and much to my dismay</li>
            <li>and I broke out everywhere, So I went back to using proactive to calm my skin down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So most of it will get wasted since i&#x27;ll have to dispose it in 3 months.</li>
            <li>Only thing is, be sure to moisturize with oil-free moisturizer after you tone so your face doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>ITS MORE MARKET HYPE, THAN EVER, PLEASE DON&#x27;T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU HEAR ON THE ADVERTS ON THE TELEVISION, ITS PLAIN NON SENSE.</li>
            <li>the bottle was new with the plastic shrink wrap still in place.</li>
            <li>I live by my Pro Activ system</li>
            <li>Came in time, brand new.</li>
            <li>I wasted a good deal of money trying that stuff out only to go back to this formula.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need the full regiment every day, maybe wash with this 3-4 times per week and use the other treatments as needed.</li>
            <li>However, you do need to give it time (a couple of weeks) to clear up your skin.  </li>
            <li>But then it will KEEP your skin clear if you continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>clear my skin with in one week.</li>
            <li>only problem is it sometimes dries out the skin to much.</li>
            <li>Ur a fool if u actually spend this much on face wash</li>
            <li>It clears up the blemishes within one day and the skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Around 30-31 years old, I started to have adult acne.</li>
            <li>Your skin looks and feels like you had a professional taking care of your skin after using about 3-4 days</li>
            <li>MY WIFE WASHED HER FACE IN WATER THAT CONTAINED ROUGH SKIN LEMON AND GOT BETTER RESULTS, RESEARCH ROUGH SKIN LEMON, YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED.</li>
            <li>proactiv is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that gets rid of my severely inflamed acne and consistently keeps it away with regular use.</li>
            <li>I started using this to see if it would help my recently very oily skin and minor acne.  </li>
            <li>the rest of the Proactive family are super harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I like that I could just by a single bottle off of Amazon instead of the whole kit.</li>
            <li>Ur only buyimg the cleanser n not the complete proactive set</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is somewhat drying and can bleach your eyebrows if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]].</li>
            <li>Even worse, I bought more than 1, and there is no way I can finish using them before they expire.  </li>
            <li>My daughter uses this product for her face and acne because it does not dry out her skin.</li>
            <li>Seriously, do not trust this seller, and absolutely do not buy this item.  </li>
            <li>I had none of the problems the other buyers had, however, beware that this is the new proactiv+ formula</li>
    </ol>

            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like the joy of a clear face and the confidence it gives you.</li>
            <li> MUCH larger amounts is just incredible.</li>
            <li> All in all however, thank you for the quick delivery, the item was un-expired, and came in very quick manner!</li>
            <li> It has been a easy way to control acne for him.</li>
            <li> It hands down is the best product for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I received a huge bottle that was already expired.</li>
            <li> and shes a red head at her skin looks GREAT.</li>
            <li> Very handy in the larger size too.</li>
            <li> She brags about the significant improvement she&#x27;s seen with it.  </li>
            <li> Nothing makes my face feel clean like this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the whole pack just the face wash because the face wash alone works just fine!</li>
            <li> I love the large size.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t want to order two other products to get this one product from Proactiv, it&#x27;s nice to be able to order it from someplace else.</li>
            <li> Authentic product, professionally packaged, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to order only when you need the product.</li>
            <li> Always satisfied with this product, my face is completely clear - decent price, like the 90 day supply, and it shipped in time.</li>
            <li> Expect to find it priced much higher at a Proactiv kiosk.</li>
            <li> I first got all three..</li>
            <li> Love the actual product itself.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was not my first time buying Proactiv...</li>
            <li> Her skin really does look cleaner and clearer!  </li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;m gunna stick to clean and clear</li>
            <li> i usually always have a good experience with amazon.</li>
            <li> granted, it did take a full 4 months for it to COMPLETELY rid my face of acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very very heart breaking as a cool dinosaur design could have been added anywhere on the white bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Attached is the dinosaur I would have used for the image on the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Aside from the cost I really like Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Price...not so much.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I really need all of that.</li>
            <li> I really wish they would adjust this misleading part of their listings, and not create termed expectations for use.  </li>
            <li> so why the hell makes these ppl thimk to charge this much??</li>
            <li> I stopped buying this product 2 years ago from the &amp;#34;Proactiv Club&amp;#34; because I had too much product.</li>
            <li> works really well if u use it.</li>
            <li> It made me wonder if this was really proactive</li>
            <li> I really like ordering it through Amazon,</li>
            <li> However, it is very pricey.  </li>
            <li> REAL SOON.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Fast service and the product works</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product was as described.  </li>
            <li> My son a regular ProActiv user and he bought this because I saw the cheap price.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> this stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this product via Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> They really need to state these things (i.e. expiration dates) in the description.</li>
            <li> I purchased from this seller on March 2nd and started using it just 3 days ago because that&#x27;s when I ran out of my original Proactiv.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t use the other 2 pieces in the normal kit like the toner and lotion, they irritated  my skin or break me out even more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another cool option/feature that could have been added is whenever you squeeze the bottle it would make a cool dinosaur rawring noise out of the little hole.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product on it&#x27;s own, but I truly hate proactiv&#x27;s &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; and I am much happier purchasing thru amazon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone should pay that much money for something that isn&#x27;t new</li>
            <li> Been using proactive for 10 years, super product, in short, this cleaner works!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my chin acne that I have developed as a menopausal woman.  </li>
            <li> But No- I&#x27;m 58 years old and much to my dismay</li>
            <li> and I broke out everywhere, So I went back to using proactive to calm my skin down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So most of it will get wasted since i&#x27;ll have to dispose it in 3 months.</li>
            <li> Only thing is, be sure to moisturize with oil-free moisturizer after you tone so your face doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> ITS MORE MARKET HYPE, THAN EVER, PLEASE DON&#x27;T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU HEAR ON THE ADVERTS ON THE TELEVISION, ITS PLAIN NON SENSE.</li>
            <li> the bottle was new with the plastic shrink wrap still in place.</li>
            <li> I live by my Pro Activ system</li>
            <li> Came in time, brand new.</li>
            <li> I wasted a good deal of money trying that stuff out only to go back to this formula.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the full regiment every day, maybe wash with this 3-4 times per week and use the other treatments as needed.</li>
            <li> However, you do need to give it time (a couple of weeks) to clear up your skin.  </li>
            <li> But then it will KEEP your skin clear if you continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> clear my skin with in one week.</li>
            <li> only problem is it sometimes dries out the skin to much.</li>
            <li> Ur a fool if u actually spend this much on face wash</li>
            <li> It clears up the blemishes within one day and the skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Around 30-31 years old, I started to have adult acne.</li>
            <li> Your skin looks and feels like you had a professional taking care of your skin after using about 3-4 days</li>
            <li> MY WIFE WASHED HER FACE IN WATER THAT CONTAINED ROUGH SKIN LEMON AND GOT BETTER RESULTS, RESEARCH ROUGH SKIN LEMON, YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED.</li>
            <li> proactiv is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that gets rid of my severely inflamed acne and consistently keeps it away with regular use.</li>
            <li> I started using this to see if it would help my recently very oily skin and minor acne.  </li>
            <li> the rest of the Proactive family are super harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like that I could just by a single bottle off of Amazon instead of the whole kit.</li>
            <li> Ur only buyimg the cleanser n not the complete proactive set</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is somewhat drying and can bleach your eyebrows if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]].</li>
            <li> Even worse, I bought more than 1, and there is no way I can finish using them before they expire.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product for her face and acne because it does not dry out her skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously, do not trust this seller, and absolutely do not buy this item.  </li>
            <li> I had none of the problems the other buyers had, however, beware that this is the new proactiv+ formula</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some of the other reviews are talking about, this works as well as the stuff I bought directly from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Long story short these people are crooks..</li>
            <li> I mean really!</li>
            <li> I thought that with old age and gray hair that I would at least get a clear complexion.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> It never completely gets rid of my skin problems</li>
            <li> and I have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the other things, which is why I only buy the renewing cleanser by itself.</li>
            <li> The other products I personally feel are things I can buy in any drugstore.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or make it too oily.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t irritate dry skin.</li>
            <li> but my face can&#x27;t live without it no matter how hard I try to find other alternatives</li>
            <li> Received sooner than expected. . .</li>
            <li> Took about 3 days to ship out which was longer that I had expected.</li>
            <li> but I thought it was a little strange</li>
            <li> I used a lot of other stuff</li>
            <li> that has never happened to any of the other proactive bottles I purchased.</li>
            <li> I believe there are other drugstore products that would perform as well.</li>
            <li> I found I had other hormone issues anyway...</li>
            <li> it may work faster for other people....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d quit using this stuff for about 6 months without any real breakouts but recently had to start using it again because I have a stressful job which was making me break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> When using this regularly,(I personally use this in the mornings and Clean and Clear(green bottle) at night and no longer have those annoying, under the skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the face mask which was 85% watered down.</li>
            <li> and I have had my ups and down with this cleanser</li>
            <li> It might be cheaper than other listing, but expiring items is like trash!  </li>
            <li> This would make me wonder if there are little dinosaurs in every bottle making my face wash</li>
            <li> I wish this was a little cheaper because I&#x27;m a broke college student</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected!!!</li>
            <li> and i was only planning to use it once a day so ill be throwing it away before the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the cleanser a few months ago and stated to break out again</li>
            <li> It removed all of the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Harsh on your skin</li>
            <li> for people saying it contains harsh ingredients, look them up.</li>
            <li> this purchase was a waste.</li>
            <li> With a 90 days use product, how can they sell something that is expiring in less than 90 days????!  </li>
            <li> My skin goes back to its original oily nasty ways, but when I have it...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with the small bottles.</li>
            <li> I have been a Proactiv user for the past 2 years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, just when I start to break out and it works like a champ for my problem face!</li>
            <li> I tried every product from neutrogena to  Clinique and after those failed attempts I gave in to the proactiv but only the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product didn&#x27;t smell the same as some we purchased before.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible purchase that I have ever had with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s now)</li>
            <li> I mean, I shouldn&#x27;t even be forced to use something immediately after I purchased them.  </li>
            <li> Acne no more!</li>
            <li> Seriously Proactiv, why did you change the formula?</li>
            <li> but I would get one or two really bad pimples that would last forever and scar.</li>
            <li> My face has broken out to the fullest and I will be filing a complaint.</li>
            <li> I have not found one person that has not loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv Plus is no good...</li>
            <li> the lid of it was all broken and a plastic thing got into the hole where it was suppose to come out of.</li>
            <li> They call this 6 ounce bottle a 90 day, which is totally false.  </li>
            <li> I read some other reviews stating that they got a bad or &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, especially considering this is a 3 month supply.</li>
            <li> So sorry they changed the product.</li>
            <li> Only thing to help my terrible skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product is a life saver.  </li>
            <li> the one I received from the seller had a weird label that sort of just rinsed off.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if I want to purchase with Amazon anymore with such an horrible experience.</li>
            <li> After I hade my son I had crazy hormones raging through my body</li>
            <li> I also have terrible hormonal acne, all around the chin that is unbelievably hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I had really bad chin and forehead acne.</li>
            <li> It was just all bad (combination skin)</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find it for that price now.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff.  So sorry they changed the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I feel like I get a mini scrub every night!</li>
            <li> This is a reorder.  My daughter loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it has worked wonderful for me except when I got it in the mail the lid of it was all broken and a plastic thing got into the hole where it was suppose to come out of.</li>
            <li> This is a SCAM! The safety wrapping was removed and this product expired 04/2016. Shame on you!</li>
            <li> I have been a Proactiv user for the past 2 years but when I realized I could get it cheaper on here I started to make all of my Proactiv purchases on amazon. I purchased from this seller on March 2nd and started using it just 3 days ago because that&#x27;s when I ran out of my original Proactiv. Long story short these people are crooks.. The bottle arrived with Chinese writing on it and I know for a fact that the originals are in English.. I also purchased the face mask which was 85% watered down. My face has broken out to the fullest and I will be filing a complaint.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a decade. Only thing to help my terrible skin.</li>
            <li> very speedy delivery. Couldn&#x27;t ask for any better</li>
            <li> Aside from the cost I really like Proactiv.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product for her face and acne because it does not dry out her skin. Great price on Amazon and it keeps my daughters face clear of acne.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, at a competitive price. Expect to find it priced much higher at a Proactiv kiosk. Furthermore, I found it to be legitimately Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected!!! Received sooner than expected. . .</li>
            <li> Great product. Price...not so much.</li>
            <li> I had really bad chin and forehead acne. It was just all bad (combination skin) I used a lot of other stuff and this is the only thing that works for me. I will be using this for a long time. I first got all three..mother .. Cream all that, but I don&#x27;t think I really need all of that. I just like the face wash. If you have a lot of acne or a lil .. It just works great.</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found that calms my Rosacea.  I use it every morning in the shower.  If I forget for even one day the Rosacea flares up.</li>
            <li> Have used this for close to 10 years.  I noticed a difference after two or three days.  Haven&#x27;t washed my face with soap since starting to use Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Great product have been using for years.</li>
            <li> Used this for many years.  When I don&#x27;t I definitely break out.  Not too drying.  I swear it helps with fine lines, too!</li>
            <li> This has really helped my chin acne that I have developed as a menopausal woman.  When I ran out I could tell the difference.  It keeps my skin a lot clearer.  I love the light dermobrasion feeling.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product is a life saver.  When I run out, after about 3-4 days, I know it.  My skin goes back to its original oily nasty ways, but when I have it...it&#x27;s all good.  The only reason I give 4 and not 5 stars is their day rating.  They call this 6 ounce bottle a 90 day, which is totally false.  I use about a dime to nickel size and this will maybe last 45 days.  I really wish they would adjust this misleading part of their listings, and not create termed expectations for use.  With that, I&#x27;ve been using ProActive for 10 years now and I LOVE IT!  This is only thing I use though...the rest of the Proactive family are super harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought that with old age and gray hair that I would at least get a clear complexion. But No- I&#x27;m 58 years old and much to my dismay I still get those occasional stress break outs. Starting using proactive about 16 years ago when I was having stress break outs and had 3 weeks to get cleared up before a wedding- and it worked without over drying my skin.  I don&#x27;t need the full regiment every day, maybe wash with this 3-4 times per week and use the other treatments as needed.</li>
            <li> I love Proactiv, I&#x27;ve used it for years and have amazing skin.  It is WAY cheaper to order it off of Amazon than buying it in the packs that they send you.  Plus I always use Steps 1 and 2 way before I use Step 3 so it just makes sense to order them seperately.</li>
            <li> Product was just as listed. the bottle was new with the plastic shrink wrap still in place. the expiration date was 2016!!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this is the 3ed bottle only problem is it sometimes dries out the skin to much.</li>
            <li> Ur only buyimg the cleanser n not the complete proactive set so why the hell makes these ppl thimk to charge this much?? I mean really! Ur a fool if u actually spend this much on face wash</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> I love proactive and I will continue to use it. But I received a huge bottle that was already expired. I don&#x27;t think anyone should pay that much money for something that isn&#x27;t new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this proactive.  I just started using it again and my skin couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Took about 3 days to ship out which was longer that I had expected. Love the actual product itself. I&#x27;ve been using the proactiv cleanser for over 3 years and I have had my ups and down with this cleanser but my face can&#x27;t live without it no matter how hard I try to find other alternatives, I always go back to this cleanser. The expiration date btw is 4/16</li>
            <li> This product works great... However, you do need to give it time (a couple of weeks) to clear up your skin.  But then it will KEEP your skin clear if you continue to use it.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying this product 2 years ago from the &amp;#34;Proactiv Club&amp;#34; because I had too much product. I ran out of the cleanser a few months ago and stated to break out again (I am over 50). Then once the heat of the summer hit, I was breaking out. Was thrilled to be able to buy 2 cleansers from Amazon w/o having to re-engage my Proactiv membership.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Proactiv customer for years now.  Great product that always does the job so well..  Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> works really well if u use it. I got this for my son does not use correct way but it still works! I have used this for years</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product!! I have used it for 14 years. I am NEVER without it. I shopped Amazon because I needed it shipped in one day and QVC wasn&#x27;t providing me that option. Ultimately FedEx screwed up the delivery and I paid an additional $18 in shipping for nothing , I didn&#x27;t recieve it when they were to deliver. Amazon is not to fault for any of this, but I only ever  ship UPS.  In the future if I can&#x27;t be guaranteed UPS , I will continue to order from QVC. This is a terrific product that my teenage daughter now also uses!</li>
            <li> it works but I thought it was a little strange the one I received from the seller had a weird label that sort of just rinsed off. that has never happened to any of the other proactive bottles I purchased. It made me wonder if this was really proactive but I have been using it for a while and it seems to be working ok</li>
            <li> I love proactive. It helps keep my acne under control.</li>
            <li> This does an EXCELLENT JOB washing my face! It hands down is the best product for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that THERE ARE NO DINOSAURS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very very heart breaking as a cool dinosaur design could have been added anywhere on the white bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Attached is the dinosaur I would have used for the image on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another cool option/feature that could have been added is whenever you squeeze the bottle it would make a cool dinosaur rawring noise out of the little hole. This would make me wonder if there are little dinosaurs in every bottle making my face wash cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, until Proactive fixes their marketing strategy and starts adding dinosaurs on their bottles, I will only be giving this product one star.</li>
            <li> I have been using proactive since I was a Teen. ( I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s now) recently they have changed their 3 piece system, and I personally am not found of it. After I hade my son I had crazy hormones raging through my body and I broke out everywhere, So I went back to using proactive to calm my skin down.&lt;br /&gt; I really like ordering it through Amazon, because I don&#x27;t use the other 2 pieces in the normal kit like the toner and lotion, they irritated  my skin or break me out even more. When I go to a proactive sales person they only want to sell you the kit, not the soap, so I prefer to order from here..... and the price is better!&lt;br /&gt;It is somewhat drying and can bleach your eyebrows if you&#x27;re not careful. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, just when I start to break out and it works like a champ for my problem face!</li>
            <li> This is a very good cleanser.  However, it is very pricey.  I believe there are other drugstore products that would perform as well.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY GIRLS. IT WORKS WONDERS ON THEIR FACE. I WILL BE PURCHASING IT AGAIN REAL SOON. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use proactive system anymore, but I still use this facewash religiously. Nothing makes my face feel clean like this.</li>
            <li> Use it daily!  Love it and love that Amazon sells it so I don;t have to sign up for auto refills.</li>
            <li> PROACTIVE ALWAYS WORKS.  A PLEASURABLE EXPERIENCE.  FAST SHIPPING.  I WILL RETURN.</li>
            <li> I really like it. I have not found anything comparable.</li>
            <li> Been using proactive for 10 years, super product, in short, this cleaner works!</li>
            <li> I wish this was a little cheaper because I&#x27;m a broke college student but this product works for me. I don&#x27;t use the other things, which is why I only buy the renewing cleanser by itself. Great and fast delivery and an awesome-working product!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of products, most are to strong for my skin and break me out.  This alone with the Original Revitalizing Toner keeps my skin looking beautiful and free of break outs.</li>
            <li> great product and fast</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for about 6 months and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It removed all of the dead skin cells. A really good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Always satisfied with this product, my face is completely clear - decent price, like the 90 day supply, and it shipped in time.</li>
            <li> Great product, my daughter loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Accomplish my expectations</li>
            <li> Best Product by this company!</li>
            <li> Harsh on your skin but it clears the acne. It does not help with cystic acne, blackheads or whiteheads, though.</li>
            <li> I use this a couple times a week and it works great. When I use 1 to 3 on my skin. I can see the skin renewing it self.</li>
            <li> Fast service and the product works</li>
            <li> This cleanser changed my skin and my life! I&#x27;ve never had acne but I would get one or two really bad pimples that would last forever and scar. I tried every product from neutrogena to  Clinique and after those failed attempts I gave in to the proactiv but only the cleanser. Skin does better without too many steps! I&#x27;ve used it for 3 yrs and only got maybe 5 pimples total (not kidding). I will never change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for people saying it contains harsh ingredients, look them up. It contains sodium PCA, sodium hyaluronate, sorbitol, and urea all of which moisturize the skin and keep it healthy</li>
            <li> I have not found one person that has not loved this product.  It clears up the blemishes within one day and the skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Great size for the Proactiv Renewing Cleanser.  Fast shipping and product was as described.  I use this product while taking a shower.  It works great, then I complete with Step 2 and 3 after my shower in front of mirror.  I believe Proactiv is a quality product that works for me for about 10 yrs now.  I would recommend this product as a 3 Step process.</li>
            <li> great product and very effective. I use it once a day for every day now and all my skin problem was gone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product didn&#x27;t smell the same as some we purchased before. The &amp;#34;use before (date)&amp;#34; was not on the bottom so I believe it was out of date.</li>
            <li> i usually always have a good experience with amazon. so ive never written a rating for there was nothing to complain about. but i received this item 8/8/12. and the bottle is meant for 90 days of use, that is if you use it morning and night. but i notcied that the experaion date is for 11/12. that&#x27;s not even 90 days. and i was only planning to use it once a day so ill be throwing it away before the bottle is empty. this purchase was a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactive for years! I love it and don&#x27;t use anything else. I use this in the shower and use neutrogena face wipes to wipe off my make up every night. I don&#x27;t use the whole pack just the face wash because the face wash alone works just fine! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or make it too oily. Love it and wouldn&#x27;t change! Product came sealed and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I recieved my package on time. However the expiry is 11/12 which is 3 months from now. This is too short for a 6Oz bottle. So most of it will get wasted since i&#x27;ll have to dispose it in 3 months.</li>
            <li> it works great but I think if you have acne it&#x27;s more of a hormone imbalance and you&#x27;ll need to take something orally. It never completely gets rid of my skin problems</li>
            <li> Wish i had read the reviews before buying...got it on 8/28/12 and it expires 11/12...not enough time to use it!</li>
            <li> Great price for this product - love being able to buy this product individually...</li>
            <li> My son is very happy with Proactiv, but he only likes the Step 1 product. I don&#x27;t understand why the price fluctuates so much when I am buying it every two months or so, but I will keep buying it, because it has done a great job of clearing up his acne and keeping it away.</li>
            <li> My son a regular ProActiv user and he bought this because I saw the cheap price. It has been a easy way to control acne for him. Now, with this stuff he has burns under both of my eyes after just three days of use. It looks like I will not be buying proactiv from amazon again.</li>
            <li> Seriously Proactiv, why did you change the formula? Proactiv Plus is no good... :-( I wasted a good deal of money trying that stuff out only to go back to this formula. THIS is by far the best cleansing face wash I have EVER used. It really works. Only thing is, be sure to moisturize with oil-free moisturizer after you tone so your face doesn&#x27;t dry out. When using this regularly,(I personally use this in the mornings and Clean and Clear(green bottle) at night and no longer have those annoying, under the skin breakouts. Thank You Proactiv for this formula!!!!!! There&#x27;s nothing like the joy of a clear face and the confidence it gives you.</li>
            <li> I started using this to see if it would help my recently very oily skin and minor acne.  It leaves skin feeling nice because of the grit exfoliate.  I found I had other hormone issues anyway...buy it did an ok job...wish i&#x27;d bought a smaller size though.</li>
            <li> I had never had acne growing up. Around 30-31 years old, I started to have adult acne. I tried everything out there for years. Finally, I gave this a try. Thank Goodness, because it is the only thing that cured it. I use the regular proactive wash and toner. I don&#x27;t have any acne issues now.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t irritate dry skin.</li>
            <li> My kids use Proactiv projects all the time.</li>
            <li> this stuff works very well. clear my skin with in one week.</li>
            <li> Daughter says works great for her</li>
            <li> This one was must have for a person that I love. Proactiv is the best on the market for people with skin problems &amp; this deal threw Amazon was just amazing..Recommend others to buy it if they have a problem or know a Loved one that has a skin problem.</li>
            <li> Proactive is the only thing that wooks on my skin and won&#x27;t break it out. Your skin looks and feels like you had a professional taking care of your skin after using about 3-4 days it&#x27;s that good. My daughter uses it aiso and shes a red head at her skin looks GREAT. Amozon, I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
            <li> Received the order on time and in good shape. I am pleased with my order. Very handy in the larger size too.</li>
            <li> ITS MORE MARKET HYPE, THAN EVER, PLEASE DON&#x27;T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU HEAR ON THE ADVERTS ON THE TELEVISION, ITS PLAIN NON SENSE. MY WIFE WASHED HER FACE IN WATER THAT CONTAINED ROUGH SKIN LEMON AND GOT BETTER RESULTS, RESEARCH ROUGH SKIN LEMON, YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d quit using this stuff for about 6 months without any real breakouts but recently had to start using it again because I have a stressful job which was making me break out like crazy. I also have terrible hormonal acne, all around the chin that is unbelievably hard to get rid of. proactiv is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that gets rid of my severely inflamed acne and consistently keeps it away with regular use. granted, it did take a full 4 months for it to COMPLETELY rid my face of acne. it may work faster for other people....</li>
            <li> Great size at a great price! Thanks for offering this product via Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and delivered as promised. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product worked great for a while... This was not my first time buying Proactiv... but for some reason, it now dosn&#x27;t seem to work as well... I do find myself after having used Proactive for about 8 months breaking out now like I did before.  All in all however, thank you for the quick delivery, the item was un-expired, and came in very quick manner!</li>
            <li> I like it I am a repeat user.  It works.  My skin looks healthy.  I am satisfied.  I like it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with the small bottles. If you use proactive daily get the BIG bottle</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this!  She brags about the significant improvement she&#x27;s seen with it.  Her skin really does look cleaner and clearer!  I decided to try it for myself.  It worked wonders on my rectal acne!</li>
            <li> This product has made my skin look better than it has. I would recommend it to people having skin issues.</li>
            <li> I received my product in September only to find that it expires in October. Very disappointed, especially considering this is a 3 month supply. They really need to state these things (i.e. expiration dates) in the description. Thank goodness I only bought one. I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I live by my Pro Activ system so I love this stuff! Not too expensive and I like that I could just by a single bottle off of Amazon instead of the whole kit.</li>
            <li> Proactive product! What&#x27;s not to like? Just some of the most remarkable acne medication ive ever come in contact with...bar-none.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I can purchase this on amazon in  MUCH larger amounts is just incredible. Worth every penny. Try the mask!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and purchase without having to sign up for a monthly renew. It&#x27;s nice to order only when you need the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some of the other reviews are talking about, this works as well as the stuff I bought directly from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t want to order two other products to get this one product from Proactiv, it&#x27;s nice to be able to order it from someplace else.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years!  A product that deserves respect.  Acne no more!</li>
            <li> Authentic product, professionally packaged, quick delivery. I ordered two bottles and expiration date for both are April of 2016. I had none of the problems the other buyers had, however, beware that this is the new proactiv+ formula</li>
            <li> ProActiv is the best face wash ever.  I highly recommend it to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li> Came in time, brand new.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews stating that they got a bad or &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; product.  I&#x27;m happy to say mine was the real deal.  I gave this product a 5 star review because the proactiv cleanser has always worked for me, and I prefer the choice of ordering via amazon so that I don&#x27;t have to purchase the entire &amp;#34;3 step system&amp;#34;.  The other products I personally feel are things I can buy in any drugstore.  Also, purchasing this way gives me the freedom of deciding when I order (since I do have prime I know I&#x27;ll get it in 2 days).  Overall, a great product on it&#x27;s own, but I truly hate proactiv&#x27;s &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; and I am much happier purchasing thru amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser that gets rid of my blackheads on my nose.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It works and everything but after not using it for a week you start to break out more so I think I&#x27;m gunna stick to clean and clear lmao ✋</li>
            <li> Proactive Cleanser is really good and I have used it for a long time. Very good product. Recently switched to Skingenixx Cleanser because it has lots of ingredient that Proactiv does not, like collagen &amp; aloe [[ASIN:B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]]. Well, I have to say, the Skingenixx is the better product. The Proactiv is good, but the Skingenixx is on another level! Try them both and see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Clare&#x27;s up just about anything.</li>
            <li> Great product and I love the large size.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible purchase that I have ever had with Amazon.  I just received the item today (8/3), and the item is expiring in 11/12!!!  With a 90 days use product, how can they sell something that is expiring in less than 90 days????!  Now that I looked back, there is actually another customer that had the same problem too.  Even worse, I bought more than 1, and there is no way I can finish using them before they expire.  I mean, I shouldn&#x27;t even be forced to use something immediately after I purchased them.  It might be cheaper than other listing, but expiring items is like trash!  Seriously, do not trust this seller, and absolutely do not buy this item.  I don&#x27;t even know if I want to purchase with Amazon anymore with such an horrible experience.</li>
            <li> I love proactiv and the price of this bottle was great. Too bad I can&#x27;t find it for that price now.</li>
            <li> Works for me and my wife and we have different skin types. Would recommend this to everyone.</li>
