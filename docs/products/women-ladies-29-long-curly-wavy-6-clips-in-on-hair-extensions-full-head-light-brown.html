            <li>I ordered the light brown, it matched my hair perfect.</li>
            <li>Feel like I got more than I paid for!</li>
            <li>They were absolutely nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice, secure clips but</li>
            <li>i would need to get 1 more or</li>
            <li>so it blended in much better.</li>
            <li>So I just placed and order for 2 more sets</li>
            <li>and I plan to order more.</li>
            <li>I received these in the mail today, and was very excited to wear them.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>The extension is full, thick, beautiful, and matches my hair color perfectly!</li>
            <li>We bought it as a gag thinking it would be fun and were pretty impressed by what turned out to be a very real looking piece.</li>
            <li>very pretty hair extensions, already order 2 more.</li>
            <li>Quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I liek it, it is very pretty and very full</li>
            <li>I was very surprised it actually matched my hair color perfectly</li>
            <li>Loved how it was only one piece to clip in</li>
            <li>I also plan to trim them for a more naturally looking layered look!!</li>
            <li>but nice color and pretty soft:)&lt;br /&gt;Not shiny at all, looks really natural.</li>
            <li>my back which i really liked</li>
            <li>The extensions are sooo pretty and the hair looks so good; a bit too long</li>
            <li>Matched my hair perfectly, it was a little long for me, but after a slight trim they worked and looked great.  </li>
            <li>i love the length though they sent me dark brown not the light brown and to make it a full head</li>
            <li>but when I do I will certainly write another review and add a photo!</li>
            <li>It seems to be exactly what I was hoping.</li>
            <li>then I thought, my hair is only shoulder length, so I&#x27;m going to order 2 more to layer them up.</li>
            <li>Also came in 3 days earlier then said! :)</li>
            <li>so I straightened them and they ARE real hair because they didn&#x27;t melt.</li>
            <li>and I really like them</li>
            <li>They Are very full and very long.</li>
            <li>and I was not expecting that I love the length since I&#x27;m taller it does not look too, too long on me and seem somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>They seem to be decent quality although I&#x27;m sure they will not last super,super long</li>
            <li>Not even the right color, took forever getting here, looks like my horse&#x27;s tail, probably done better cutting it off and try to wear it! :)</li>
            <li>Color looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I asked for flaxen hair and received light brown which looks dark brown .</li>
            <li>I actually cut about four inches off to make it look a little more of a natural length.</li>
            <li>So thick and full!</li>
            <li>the hair itself is very shiny and not very bendable</li>
            <li>but i ordered the light brown and it looks DARK DARK brown...</li>

            <li> Matched my hair perfectly, it was a little long for me, but after a slight trim they worked and looked great.  People couldn&#x27;t tell I had extensions in and when I told them everyone wanted them too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get them.  They are terrible.</li>
            <li> i love the length though they sent me dark brown not the light brown and to make it a full head i would need to get 1 more or 2 if i wasn&#x27;t doing a layered look though the lenth was all the way down  my back which i really liked</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail today, and was very excited to wear them. They came with extra clips and a hair tie. They Are very full and very long. Good quality. Pretty good for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> These extensions were amazing!!!! So thick and full! They come curly so I straightened them and they ARE real hair because they didn&#x27;t melt. They look great either way!!! Loved how it was only one piece to clip in so it blended in much better. Great quality and great price!!!!</li>
            <li> I liek it, it is very pretty and very full however I will probably have a hard time matching the color.</li>

            <li> Very nice, secure clips but the hair itself is very shiny and not very bendable</li>
            <li> I ordered on set and I really like them I just wish it was thicker..But you can&#x27;t beat the price..So I just placed and order for 2 more sets so I can stack them. I also plan to trim them for a more naturally looking layered look!!</li>
            <li> Not even the right color, took forever getting here, looks like my horse&#x27;s tail, probably done better cutting it off and try to wear it! :)</li>
            <li> Came a little late but they apologized, gave me a refund and let me keep the extensions. They were absolutely nice. The extensions are sooo pretty and the hair looks so good; a bit too long but that&#x27;s no biggie, I&#x27;ll just cut them a bit.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loved it. The quality of the hair blew her away. We bought it as a gag thinking it would be fun and were pretty impressed by what turned out to be a very real looking piece.</li>
            <li> very pretty hair extensions, already order 2 more. Great price.</li>
            <li> Reeeeally happy with the product. Feel like I got more than I paid for! Quality is fantastic. Color looks very natural. Not shiny at all.. It&#x27;s a little heavy and prepare for it to be very very long. I actually cut about four inches off to make it look a little more of a natural length. Definitely would buy from them again!</li>
            <li> it does not have 29&#x27;&#x27; long.</li>
