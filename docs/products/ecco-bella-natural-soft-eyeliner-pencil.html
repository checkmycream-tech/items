            <li>I ordered this eyeliner in \\&quot;Velvet\\&quot; and it is absolutely great!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the best eyeliner pencil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>If it can be made darker that would be the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great price, too!</li>

            <li>Nice product and color.</li>
            <li>This is the best non toxic eyeliner pencil I have found so far!  </li>
            <li>I love most Ecco Bella products and their eyeliner pencil is top notch!</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>Nice and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It went on light, but I was able to darken it!</li>
            <li>very happy has become my eyeliner of choice, rubs off easily but what do you expect from a natural product</li>
            <li>Better than others I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly and stays on..love it!</li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I love to support cruelty-free companies that use high quality, vegan ingredients that really work and look great!</li>
            <li>great natural eyeliner and clean ingredient list!</li>
            <li>which was a HUGE struggle considering that many &amp;#34;environmentally friendly&amp;#34; products just don&#x27;t seem to work as well.  </li>
            <li>The price is great, it has no heavy scent.</li>
            <li>I am awaiting a replacement, thanks to Amazon&#x27;s good customer service and immediate resolution.</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite makeup brand, love it, thank you!</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly as well!</li>
            <li>Love it, goes on smoothly, lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smear to the top of my eyelid like other brands do, and has a great rating on ewg.org.</li>
            <li>But it is too light</li>
            <li>It feels comfortable on and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>The color is smooth and rich.</li>
            <li>My favorite natural eyeliner, easily!</li>
            <li>It has rich pigment, and can be used to create a defined line, or smudged for a smokey eye look if you choose.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and smoothly it glides on!</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be near as good as the traditional eyeliners I&#x27;ve used since the ingredients are better.</li>
            <li>Nice dark black is perfect for me (brown hair and brown eyes).  </li>
            <li>I just wanted a safe natural alternative and this is it!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different organic makeup lines and this is the best organic eyeliner so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and I find that it sharpens easily with my eyeliner pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and stays on without smudging better than the last several eyeliner pencils I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>its smooth and soft when applied which I like, I wish it came in a self sharpening pencil</li>
            <li>It worked better when I used a trick I saw when working back stage at a play with a makeup</li>
            <li>but overall nice, i will buy it again since i am transitioning to natural makeup.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product twice now, i love this long wearing, creamy eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li>think dirty -- which is pretty good!!</li>
            <li>The problem with it is that any time I try to sharpen the pencil, the whole point breaks off.</li>
            <li>Very melty, not like it</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and also I noticed when wearing it compared to commercial eyeliner</li>
            <li>Thanks Ecco Bella.</li>
            <li>It does a great smudged line, but can make a sharp, defined line when freshly sharpened and a little</li>
            <li>It works just as well as big-name brands, and it is much better to be putting on our bodies than some of the chemicals that come in other products.  </li>
            <li>However Ecco Bella&#x27;s pencil goes on very smoothly and is extremely dark.</li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive and this is way better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these pencils for your eyebrows, but order a shade lighter than what you would think</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and this is my first natural makeup I bought with a group of others as well.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy but the picture makes it look like a dark brown</li>
            <li>I usually apply Maybelline Color Tattoo (toxic) with a brush because the effect is softer and more natural.</li>
            <li>I have used natural product based eyeliners before, but they were usually not dark enough or wore off very fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to add organic and natural products to my shelf</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and skin and felt no irritation.</li>
            <li>The only eyeliners I&#x27;ve had that didn&#x27;t smear really hurt my eyes and gave me headaches.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it crumbling or not sharpening, but it is a soft pencil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true black.</li>
            <li>cool- stick it in the freezer for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s expensive when you lose an inch or more after trying over and over to get a point!</li>
            <li>On Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database, it scores a 1, meaning with the information available there are very few ingredient concerns for health hazards.  </li>

            <li> I purchased other Ecco Bella products with this item, same positive result.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: When the box was delivered, the cap was missing from the pencil</li>
            <li> You can smudge it for a variety of effects, and because it is so highly pigmented, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t much different than other brands, my eyes still itch  and turn red every time I apply it.</li>
            <li> It is also extremely inexpensive compared to other natural eye liner products.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is natural eye liner and would not contain harsh chemicals i suppose.</li>
            <li> It goes on very easily, is very dark and wears off about the same as the toxic big name eyeliners.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the next shade down</li>
            <li> It glides on softly without dragging on the delicate tissues around the eye.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I tried their violet pencil and it&#x27;s harder to apply than velvet color.</li>
            <li> I applied it few times but it did not stay for long.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like some other alternatives.</li>
            <li> Would not use anything else other than something that contains nothing &amp;#34;bad for you.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Does not seem to be quite as dark or go on with the concentrated color as other eyeliners.  </li>
            <li> I like the seal color too for a dark brown.</li>
            <li> and i did not get the dark line i was hoping for.</li>
            <li> albeit color is too dark.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s literally black black.</li>
            <li> I have replaced all of my cosmetics with less &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; products-</li>
            <li> however, sharpening is a mess</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy or faint as some other eyeliners are.</li>
            <li> Will need to practice to make the line less harsh.</li>
            <li> It does smudge a little bit,  hence 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
            <li> And the velvet color is oh so dark!  </li>
            <li> I wish it would stay on a little longer.</li>
            <li> I bought it in black and it is very black.</li>
            <li> I shy away from pencils because I dont want to tug at the sensitive eye area and cause wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear eyeliner everyday</li>
            <li> I cannot stand dry, hard liners that pull at the delicate skin around eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dumped all personal products with questionable ingredients... which happened to be everything in my makeup drawer as well as toothpaste, shampoo, soaps, conditioners and lotions.  </li>
            <li> They draw on the eyelid very smoothly - no pulling.  </li>
            <li> One stroke is all you need to make a thin line or thicker one, depending one your style but you will not be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great natural eyeliner and clean ingredient list!</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner have found does not run</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Ecco Bella Velvet Natural Soft Eyeliner Pencil for a few weeks now, and I have to say that it is the easiest eyeliner pencil that I have ever used. It goes on very smoothly and stays on without smudging better than the last several eyeliner pencils I&#x27;ve had. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have used natural product based eyeliners before, but they were usually not dark enough or wore off very fast.  This pencil was very surprising.  It goes on very easily, is very dark and wears off about the same as the toxic big name eyeliners.  I am going to buy another one for my purse and one for my travel bag. It is also extremely inexpensive compared to other natural eye liner products.</li>
            <li> It went on light, but I was able to darken it! I&#x27;m trying to add organic and natural products to my shelf and this got a rating of 4 on the app think dirty -- which is pretty good!! I love it!</li>
            <li> The problem with it is that any time I try to sharpen the pencil, the whole point breaks off. Get&#x27;s expensive when you lose an inch or more after trying over and over to get a point!</li>
            <li> I researched countless cosmetics companies in order to find cruelty-free (no animal testing!), vegan products (no animal ingredients!), and also referenced each ingredient at the cosmetics safety database (where we can find out how harmful each ingredient is ~ or isn&#x27;t ~ to our bodies and the environment). Ecco Bella&#x27;s ethics &amp; ingredients passed my test! I ordered this eyeliner in \\&quot;Velvet\\&quot; and it is absolutely great! I love how soft and smoothly it glides on! I cannot stand dry, hard liners that pull at the delicate skin around eyes. It has rich pigment, and can be used to create a defined line, or smudged for a smokey eye look if you choose. This is the ONLY eyeliner I will buy again ~ I love it, and I love to support cruelty-free companies that use high quality, vegan ingredients that really work and look great! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Check out the Ecco Bella website for LOTS more products for face, eyes, lips ~ WONDERFUL STUFF!!! This is one of my FAVORITE companies since my research!</li>
            <li> Really good eye pencil. It&#x27;s smooth and creamy but the picture makes it look like a dark brown but it&#x27;s literally black black. I ordered the next shade down and it&#x27;s perfect. I highly recommend these pencils for your eyebrows, but order a shade lighter than what you would think</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use.  Better than others I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner pencil I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t tug my eyelids off when I apply it and it doesn&#x27;t smudge. Yeah, I found my HG eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Love it, goes on smoothly, lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smear to the top of my eyelid like other brands do, and has a great rating on ewg.org. Nice dark black is perfect for me (brown hair and brown eyes).  I like the seal color too for a dark brown.</li>
            <li> Very melty, not like it</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly and stays on..love it!</li>
            <li> They draw on the eyelid very smoothly - no pulling.  No qualms about buying this product again.  I only buy organic whenever possible.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is natural eye liner and would not contain harsh chemicals i suppose. But it is too light and i did not get the dark line i was hoping for. I applied it few times but it did not stay for long. If it can be made darker that would be the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dumped all personal products with questionable ingredients... which happened to be everything in my makeup drawer as well as toothpaste, shampoo, soaps, conditioners and lotions.  TIP:  Keep it in the fridge to harden the tip for easier application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different organic makeup lines and this is the best organic eyeliner so far.  It feels comfortable on and goes on smooth.  It is long lasting and easy to wash off.  It does smudge a little bit,  hence 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
            <li> very happy has become my eyeliner of choice, rubs off easily but what do you expect from a natural product</li>
            <li> this is a nice eyeliner, lasts on the eyes, but does not spread as i would like! but overall nice, i will buy it again since i am transitioning to natural makeup.</li>
            <li> Just got it today and tried it out. It goes on smoothly and also I noticed when wearing it compared to commercial eyeliner it doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes! It&#x27;s natural and this is my first natural makeup I bought with a group of others as well. I just wanted a safe natural alternative and this is it! I&#x27;m so happy. Oh and I remove my makeup with coconut oil is a great makeup remover :)</li>
            <li> I shy away from pencils because I dont want to tug at the sensitive eye area and cause wrinkles. However Ecco Bella&#x27;s pencil goes on very smoothly and is extremely dark. I removed it with coconut oil. Will need to practice to make the line less harsh. I usually apply Maybelline Color Tattoo (toxic) with a brush because the effect is softer and more natural. I&#x27;ve bought Ecco Bella blush for my mom and it&#x27;s another great product ... albeit color is too dark. Definitely buy this pencil if you want to save your eyes from wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I tried their violet pencil and it&#x27;s harder to apply than velvet color.</li>
            <li> The description says its \\&quot;vegan\\&quot; and made with vegetable oils, but beeswax is listed with the ingredients. Beeswax is technically not vegan, although it may not bother some people who are looking for a vegan product.</li>
            <li> Smooooooth.  This eyeliner goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I bought it in black and it is very black. One stroke is all you need to make a thin line or thicker one, depending one your style but you will not be disappointed. The price is great, it has no heavy scent. I use organic baby shampoo to remove my makeup but need to use additional remover for this one though. I don&#x27;t wear eyeliner everyday so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I purchased other Ecco Bella products with this item, same positive result.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: When the box was delivered, the cap was missing from the pencil so I don&#x27;t know if it was just my luck or if the cap is a poor fit and would come off all the time.  I am awaiting a replacement, thanks to Amazon&#x27;s good customer service and immediate resolution.</li>
            <li> Cant believe the price on this. I have tried more expensive and this is way better. Doesnt irritate my eyes and stays put.</li>
            <li> I love most Ecco Bella products and their eyeliner pencil is top notch! It&#x27;s not messy or faint as some other eyeliners are. It lasts most of the day. I&#x27;m very happy with it. The product arrived quickly as well!</li>
            <li> its smooth and soft when applied which I like, I wish it came in a self sharpening pencil however, sharpening is a mess and I lose some of the pencil. Nice product and color.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations given the product description. I have sensitive eyes and skin and felt no irritation. The color is smooth and rich. Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural and this eyeliner doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like some other alternatives. It does smear a bit, however, but I&#x27;m not a makeup expert and don&#x27;t use multiple products together - so this may be par for the course for eyeliners. The only eyeliners I&#x27;ve had that didn&#x27;t smear really hurt my eyes and gave me headaches. So there&#x27;s that?</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be near as good as the traditional eyeliners I&#x27;ve used since the ingredients are better. This eyeliner outperforms every one I&#x27;ve ever tried. Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite natural eyeliner, easily! Sharpens well and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  It works just as well as big-name brands, and it is much better to be putting on our bodies than some of the chemicals that come in other products.  On Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database, it scores a 1, meaning with the information available there are very few ingredient concerns for health hazards.  I have replaced all of my cosmetics with less &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; products- which was a HUGE struggle considering that many &amp;#34;environmentally friendly&amp;#34; products just don&#x27;t seem to work as well.  Not the case with this eyeliner.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it crumbling or not sharpening, but it is a soft pencil. It does a great smudged line, but can make a sharp, defined line when freshly sharpened and a little cool- stick it in the freezer for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expect from eye-liner</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice now, i love this long wearing, creamy eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t much different than other brands, my eyes still itch  and turn red every time I apply it. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite makeup brand, love it, thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best non toxic eyeliner pencil I have found so far!  It glides on softly without dragging on the delicate tissues around the eye.  And the velvet color is oh so dark!  You can smudge it for a variety of effects, and because it is so highly pigmented, a little goes a long way. Great price, too!</li>
            <li> Overall, I like it.  Does not seem to be quite as dark or go on with the concentrated color as other eyeliners.  It worked better when I used a trick I saw when working back stage at a play with a makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sharpening the pencil she warmed the tip between her fingertips for 10-20 seconds which softened it and made smoother darker application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?  Possibly, still looking around.</li>
            <li> Would not use anything else other than something that contains nothing &amp;#34;bad for you.&amp;#34;  Thanks Ecco Bella. Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great. It&#x27;s soft and I find that it sharpens easily with my eyeliner pencil sharpener. It&#x27;s a true black.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I wish it would stay on a little longer. I would say I have to re-apply 2x daily for work and such. Then again for evening wear.</li>
