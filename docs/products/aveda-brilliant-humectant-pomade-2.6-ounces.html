            <li>Like the rest of the \\&quot;Brilliant\\&quot; line of products, the fragrance is so vile, that even if the product was brilliant, I would die of asphyxiation.</li>
            <li>I will never purchase another Brilliant line prosuct again.  </li>

            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>an fell in love.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a very pleasant aroma that is pleasant and not strong at all.</li>
            <li>Excellent control on my grey hair.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it helps it retain moisture.  </li>
            <li>The product smells really good, is very affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day.</li>
            <li>Strong hold.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is often fly away in my dry climate.  </li>
            <li>but that is fine for me.   </li>
            <li>It works just fine</li>
            <li>Although I should have just bought it from Nordstrom.com since they also have free shipping and it was a couple of dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li>I use John Frieda&#x27;s Smooth conditioner in the shower before the L&#x27;Oreal gel.</li>
            <li>and I use a finger tip&#x27;s dab, emulsify it in my palms, and then smooth it over my hair with my palms.  </li>
            <li>This humectant is so great as a final touch to curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I love uses this right after I get a touch-up or during the winter months in AZ.</li>
            <li>etc..i really like this!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;neat clean</li>
            <li>Sure, if you use too much, you get a greasy effect.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every other humectant or pomade gel brand that is available, and absolutely NONE even come close to Aveda Brilliant Humectant</li>
            <li>I have used many, many products and always go back to this!!</li>
            <li>unwashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The product showed up at my house quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Many are deterred by the price thinking it is too high, but one jar lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li>Less stores around that sell Aveda, happy to know I can find it online.</li>
            <li>Way back when, I used to love Brilliant Pomade (that came in a little pump bottle)</li>
            <li>Great Alternative to all that heavy oily stuff I used to use.</li>
            <li>Burns on your nape aren&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li>I use this product every day and really enjoy the light hold this product offers.   </li>
            <li>A dime-sized amount rubbed in the hands to warm and loosen the product is enough for a head of shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li>And, because you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time, making it a good bargain for the price.  </li>
            <li>and I love the product I have no other issues with this product.</li>
            <li>The directions say to apply to dry hair, but I find it works best applied to wet hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t think it did very much for me.</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s great for holding those hard edges on kinky hair.</li>
            <li>it on your arm first.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to:  adds a lot of shine and smooths flyaway hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>When I put the Anti-humectant Aveda product on my wet hair, if I don&#x27;t heat-style my hair, frankly, my hair still curls up, and I still get some nice smell &amp; shine benefits from that</li>
            <li>great for somewhat thick hair like mine...</li>
            <li>Hair Stylist used this product on my hair for the first time about 15 years ago, and I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>This works perfect when my hair is dry or when I&#x27;m stretching my relaxer for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I find that this pomade is very light without any sticky residue and doesn&#x27;t flake or dry out my hair.    </li>
            <li>It actually gets absorbed into my hair while keeping it down and feeling good.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, wavy hair, and it gets extremely curly when I keep up with my trims.</li>
            <li>I have loved this product for years, and am finding it increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li>So, don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>Not buying again, I&#x27;d rather use real coconut organic pressed oil in my hair...</li>
            <li>This product works really well for my hair.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really see the need to buy both products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the whole jar thinking it would start working</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li>I get very frizzy hair and lots of split</li>
            <li>I really do think the Humectant works.  </li>
            <li>And it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>I wish it was around when I was in high school!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products that leave my hair looking oily and</li>
            <li>I almost literally can&#x27;t live without Aveda Humectant!</li>
            <li>Emulsify in hands and smooth over dry hair.</li>
            <li>It just gets more and more expensive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>I think the aroma is very pleasing:  natural and non-chemical.  </li>
            <li>Nothing gives my hair a sheen without heavy loading and dulling out like most pomades I have tried do.</li>
            <li>It makes my very dry hair look better, as well as actually helping to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you live in a humid part of the world, anti-humectant would be the way to go.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado, so its super dry, and I need the humidity</li>
            <li>I rub in a small amount and my hair looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>I have very think straight hair that tends to be on the dry side.   </li>
            <li>I also trust it because Aveda uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have quite the hold that a wax product offers</li>
            <li>I would categorize the hold as a soft hold that shapes the hair how you would like.   </li>
            <li>For my hair, which is very wavy rather than kinky, this product defines the curl well and controls frizz, especially in summer humidity.</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and very coily (for those of you who are familiar with black textured hair, the term is nappy).   </li>
            <li>You need very little to make this product help your hair look fabulous.</li>
            <li>I is exactly what I expected and need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped putting products full of harsh chemicals on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my hair&#x27;s curls feeling soft and natural, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>and it is the only one I&#x27;ve found that lasts for several days and really works.</li>
            <li>Then when you are getting ready for bed, I just rinse my hair quickly at the sink, dry it down with a towel in seconds, and whatever is left,  is all out of my hair in seconds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and right after I blow dry</li>
            <li>It last a long time because if you use to much your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li>After some serious issues with dry and breaking hair, using just this after washing has helped bring my hair back to its healthy state.</li>
            <li>However, the jar I got smelled &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and did not have the usual fresh fragrance I am used to.  </li>
            <li>but Brilliant provides moisture in dry climates or when the weather turns the air dry - hot or cold, without making it dull.</li>
            <li>Definitely not a hard or spiky hold that other products create.  </li>

            <li> I really do think the Humectant works.  </li>
            <li> And it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> I wish it was around when I was in high school!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products that leave my hair looking oily and</li>
            <li> I almost literally can&#x27;t live without Aveda Humectant!</li>
            <li> Emulsify in hands and smooth over dry hair.</li>
            <li> It just gets more and more expensive.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I think the aroma is very pleasing:  natural and non-chemical.  </li>
            <li> Nothing gives my hair a sheen without heavy loading and dulling out like most pomades I have tried do.</li>
            <li> It makes my very dry hair look better, as well as actually helping to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you live in a humid part of the world, anti-humectant would be the way to go.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, so its super dry, and I need the humidity</li>
            <li> I rub in a small amount and my hair looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have very think straight hair that tends to be on the dry side.   </li>
            <li> I also trust it because Aveda uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have quite the hold that a wax product offers</li>
            <li> I would categorize the hold as a soft hold that shapes the hair how you would like.   </li>
            <li> For my hair, which is very wavy rather than kinky, this product defines the curl well and controls frizz, especially in summer humidity.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and very coily (for those of you who are familiar with black textured hair, the term is nappy).   </li>
            <li> You need very little to make this product help your hair look fabulous.</li>
            <li> I is exactly what I expected and need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped putting products full of harsh chemicals on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my hair&#x27;s curls feeling soft and natural, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> and it is the only one I&#x27;ve found that lasts for several days and really works.</li>
            <li> Then when you are getting ready for bed, I just rinse my hair quickly at the sink, dry it down with a towel in seconds, and whatever is left,  is all out of my hair in seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and right after I blow dry</li>
            <li> It last a long time because if you use to much your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> After some serious issues with dry and breaking hair, using just this after washing has helped bring my hair back to its healthy state.</li>
            <li> However, the jar I got smelled &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and did not have the usual fresh fragrance I am used to.  </li>
            <li> but Brilliant provides moisture in dry climates or when the weather turns the air dry - hot or cold, without making it dull.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a hard or spiky hold that other products create.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to my dry hair and it really defines my curl and cuts down on the frizz.</li>
            <li> Asia the climate goes from totally dry in the winter to humidity central in the summer, so this helps protect my hair from the extremes.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair, only washing it every 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have tired many others because this one is pricey, but I come back and a little dab will do ya!  </li>
            <li> Very strongly scented, which isn&#x27;t unpleasant but may take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> took way too long to recieve product but recieved&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am never without a jar of this in my medicine cabinet, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I also tried the hairspray -- it is sticky and not natural looking or feeling.     </li>
            <li> but I think it had been on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li> I have wavvy hair and have had issues with frizz when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Helps with frizzy, dry, fly-away hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly  and dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry corse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I like the way it leaves my hair after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> and because you use just a little it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> If you have thick naturally curly that is dry and prone to frizz</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> I put it in while my hair is very wet, then towel it dry.</li>
            <li> the humidity it absorbs makes it frizzy and rough.</li>
            <li> Adds the wet looks and piecey look to a haircut or style.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium textured and this product was way too heavy for me and totally weighed my hair down.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this ever day and for 20.00 lasting 18 months you are looking at $1.11 a month for a product that is a must for thick, curly, frizzy dry hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some of the other critics of this product are talking about.  </li>
            <li> Other products tend to flatten my hair, accentuating the fact that the ends are still curling and sticking out.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheesy for 410.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize such a small purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> I was being very careful to follow every word...</li>
            <li> Just a little bit is needed, and you apply it by rubbing a small amount in your fingers and palms, and then apply it from the front and sides, working your way back and downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is way to strong :(</li>
            <li> The Aveda pomade is a mess.</li>
            <li> This made my hair a greasy, oily mess.  </li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way, so one jar lasts me for a couple of months at least.</li>
            <li> My understanding is that this product is for dry hair, which mine is (the ends at least) but it was way too oily and greasy for me.  </li>
            <li> Use just a little to help manage your curls.  </li>
            <li> I just put a little on my finger and rub my hands together and then put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I used ever so little, but it created limp, lifeless and oily looking hair.</li>
            <li> At any rate, I am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus I am minus the $22.53 amount spent.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel greasy, heavy and</li>
            <li> I use whether or not I am leaving hair curly or have used round brush.</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny but the pamade dried it out.</li>
            <li> I also use the Anti-humectant for everyday use during the summer months in AZ.</li>
            <li> I struggled with my curly/wavey/frizzy hair for years, wanting to enhance the curl, but tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> Aveda Briilliant is expensive and a BIG letdown.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the results were not the same.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get past the toxic, medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> It does not get hard or greasy.</li>
            <li> Will not make hair \\&quot;hard or crunchy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I paid $25 for it in a salon, duh.</li>
            <li> One jar lasts at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Used this product for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> however, wherever I go, I&#x27;m now addicted to this product.  </li>
            <li> It also has tiny crystals of something in it that are annoying to work with.</li>
            <li> I thought it would create slick appearance,  but made my hair curl and looked terrible the following day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it makes your hair real hard at times.</li>
            <li> Did not realize until I opened product that I had the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Either you sent the wrong item or I inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging.</li>
            <li> I am stuck with the wrong item now that I opened the jar.</li>
            <li> Maybe I chose the wrong product,  but it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This product is a fake and not sanctioned by Aveda.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> but it still made my hair look dirty and unkempt.  </li>
            <li> and it gets into my eyes, very weird</li>
            <li> It smells that bad.     </li>
            <li> Yes, the stench is that bad.</li>
            <li> and I would hate to be without it.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and now I have the WORST chemical burn rash on my neck.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It smells great and it helps keep my hair wavy in the humidity.  Although I should have just bought it from Nordstrom.com since they also have free shipping and it was a couple of dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> Another Aveda product that is wonderful  I makes my hair shine and I would hate to be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is very dry and very coily (for those of you who are familiar with black textured hair, the term is nappy).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use this to twist my hair into curly spirals after washing and conditioning.  It smooths my hair and makes it easier to handle.  Most importantly, it helps it retain moisture.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Asia the climate goes from totally dry in the winter to humidity central in the summer, so this helps protect my hair from the extremes. however, wherever I go, I&#x27;m now addicted to this product.  I also trust it because Aveda uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Aveda Briilliant is expensive and a BIG letdown. It makes my hair feel greasy, heavy and the humidity it absorbs makes it frizzy and rough. I don&#x27;t like the way it smells. I paid $25 for it in a salon, duh. Never again. I don&#x27;t see the point of it. I used it and used it, thinking maybe it might build up and finally work or maybe I was not using enough of it, but no, it didn&#x27;t work. It also has tiny crystals of something in it that are annoying to work with. I think those are not supposed to be in there, but they are in my jar.     I use John Frieda&#x27;s Smooth conditioner in the shower before the L&#x27;Oreal gel. For styling, I like a product by L&#x27;Oreal called Lightheaded Melting Gel Strong hold. It does not get hard or greasy. I put it in while my hair is very wet, then towel it dry. I also use it to &#x27;touch up&#x27; frizz. The Aveda pomade is a mess.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple of decades.</li>
            <li> I have wavvy hair and have had issues with frizz when my hair is dry. I do not like the glossy type products, since I just think they make your hair look greasy. I have dry hair, only washing it every 3 days. I just had some of this in my hair, toss it around and it looks great.  I have used many, many products and always go back to this!!</li>
            <li> Way back when, I used to love Brilliant Pomade (that came in a little pump bottle) and I used it frequently.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I bought this and now I have the WORST chemical burn rash on my neck. It&#x27;s disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;And it burns like hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any product of this nature. Not sure what&#x27;s in this but I can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test it on your arm first. Burns on your nape aren&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some of the other critics of this product are talking about.  I&#x27;ve loved this for years.  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to:  adds a lot of shine and smooths flyaway hair.  It&#x27;s not meant to be a mousse, hairspray, or gel.  Sure, if you use too much, you get a greasy effect.  So, don&#x27;t use too much.  I have shoulder-length hair and I use a finger tip&#x27;s dab, emulsify it in my palms, and then smooth it over my hair with my palms.  The effect is instant:  great shine and smooth locks.  And, because you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time, making it a good bargain for the price.  I think the aroma is very pleasing:  natural and non-chemical.  Sometimes I use the stuff just for the nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;   I was attempting to order Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade, but received Aveda Brilliant Humectant Pomade. The packaging is so similiar. Did not realize until I opened product that I had the wrong item. Either you sent the wrong item or I inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging. I was being very careful to follow every word... so I wonder. ... does Aveda srill make the anti-Humectant Pomade. I am stuck with the wrong item now that I opened the jar. At any rate, I am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus I am minus the $22.53 amount spent.</li>
            <li> took way too long to recieve product but recieved&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;neat clean</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I have been using it for years. Helps with frizzy, dry, fly-away hair. Emulsify in hands and smooth over dry hair. Will not make hair \\&quot;hard or crunchy\\&quot;. Less stores around that sell Aveda, happy to know I can find it online. It&#x27;s a must have! I use whether or not I am leaving hair curly or have used round brush. Highly recommend!! Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Awesome :)</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described and expediently.  Perfect transaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.  It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my hair&#x27;s curls feeling soft and natural, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day and really enjoy the light hold this product offers.   I have very think straight hair that tends to be on the dry side.   I apply this to my moist hair after showering.  I find that this pomade is very light without any sticky residue and doesn&#x27;t flake or dry out my hair.    It doesn&#x27;t have quite the hold that a wax product offers but that is fine for me.   I would categorize the hold as a soft hold that shapes the hair how you would like.   Definitely not a hard or spiky hold that other products create.  The smell is a very pleasant aroma that is pleasant and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> For the price its Boo-Boo..I don&#x27;t get the hype of this product. It&#x27;s non-greasy, ok great I guess..??? -but nothing more to add it didn&#x27;t add anything better to my hair. Not buying again, I&#x27;d rather use real coconut organic pressed oil in my hair...which I do now.</li>
            <li> This made my hair a greasy, oily mess.  I have no idea who&#x27;s supposed to use this product.  My hair is medium textured and this product was way too heavy for me and totally weighed my hair down.  I tried using the tiniest amount but it still made my hair look dirty and unkempt.  My understanding is that this product is for dry hair, which mine is (the ends at least) but it was way too oily and greasy for me.  I can&#x27;t imagine who would use this product.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for my hair.  I would recommend it.  I have curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy</li>
            <li> This product is perfect with curly hair -  even on days with high humidity.  Use just a little to help manage your curls.  and because you use just a little it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, wavy hair, and it gets extremely curly when I keep up with my trims. I DID love the smell and feel of this product. However, I didn&#x27;t think it did very much for me. When I put the Anti-humectant Aveda product on my wet hair, if I don&#x27;t heat-style my hair, frankly, my hair still curls up, and I still get some nice smell &amp; shine benefits from that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really see the need to buy both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say to get this if you are a curly girl who NEVER straightens her hair. Otherwise, go with the Anti-humectant only, skip this, and save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of frizz-reducing products, and keep coming back to this one after 15 years!  All curly hair is different.  For my hair, which is very wavy rather than kinky, this product defines the curl well and controls frizz, especially in summer humidity. Other products tend to flatten my hair, accentuating the fact that the ends are still curling and sticking out. I use this on days when I&#x27;m letting my hair go curly but not for straightening. I almost literally can&#x27;t live without Aveda Humectant!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped putting products full of harsh chemicals on my hair.  In keeping with eating properly, I also use products on my body that won&#x27;t harm me.  After some serious issues with dry and breaking hair, using just this after washing has helped bring my hair back to its healthy state.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and will use nothing else !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best for thinning hair - makes it look fuller and is easier to manage.</li>
            <li> The product smells really good, is very affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day. I highly recommend trying it. I will make it part of my daily hairdress (grooming) for life!</li>
            <li> very disappointed. Maybe I chose the wrong product,  but it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.  I thought it would create slick appearance,  but made my hair curl and looked terrible the following day.</li>
            <li> great for somewhat thick hair like mine...my hair is short (lisa rinna) cut so this is perfect for shaping,etc..i really like this!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past. When I saw it on amazon i purchased it. I thought it would have the same results . Unfortunately the results were not the same. I used the whole jar thinking it would start working but it did not.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years. I get compliments all the time on how it smells, too. You only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjuction with their universal style cream and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz and the curls stay together without looking &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A great product and I haven&#x27;t been without it for years!</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. It makes your hair look healthy. It makes split ends and frizzy hair disappear. It shapes your hairstyle. It last a long time because if you use to much your hair will look greasy. I just put a little on my finger and rub my hands together and then put it in my hair. Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> love this for after blow drying to give lose ends taming</li>
            <li> causes my eyes to get blurry if i sweat and it gets into my eyes, very weird</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It makes my hair look and feel much healthier. It makes my very dry hair look better, as well as actually helping to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; my hair.. Just a little bit is needed, and you apply it by rubbing a small amount in your fingers and palms, and then apply it from the front and sides, working your way back and downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Hair Stylist used this product on my hair for the first time about 15 years ago, and I have been using it ever since. I have tried every other humectant or pomade gel brand that is available, and absolutely NONE even come close to Aveda Brilliant Humectant Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way, so one jar lasts me for a couple of months at least. I get very frizzy hair and lots of split ends so I actually must use this product. It takes all of that dryness away and lasts all day. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or clumpy. It actually gets absorbed into my hair while keeping it down and feeling good. Then when you are getting ready for bed, I just rinse my hair quickly at the sink, dry it down with a towel in seconds, and whatever is left,  is all out of my hair in seconds. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is often fly away in my dry climate.  If you use the correct amount (about a pea sized portion emulisified between my hands) it makes my hair manageable all day.  The directions say to apply to dry hair, but I find it works best applied to wet hair before blow drying. One jar lasts at least 6 months.  I have tried so many other products that leave my hair looking oily and unwashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The product showed up at my house quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I have used Aveda Brilliant for 15 yrs. Nothing gives my hair a sheen without heavy loading and dulling out like most pomades I have tried do. I have tired many others because this one is pricey, but I come back and a little dab will do ya!  ith the others my hair needs to be washed daily but Brilliant provides moisture in dry climates or when the weather turns the air dry - hot or cold, without making it dull. I really do think the Humectant works.  My hair is curly  and dry.</li>
            <li> great for the humid weather, holds my hair well without leaving it sticky!</li>
            <li> the product came in time! I don&#x27;t like how it makes your hair real hard at times. I do think it&#x27;s great for holding those hard edges on kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for years, and am finding it increasingly hard to find. A dime-sized amount rubbed in the hands to warm and loosen the product is enough for a head of shoulder-length hair. I apply it to my dry hair and it really defines my curl and cuts down on the frizz. And it lasts the whole day. Very strongly scented, which isn&#x27;t unpleasant but may take some getting used to. I am never without a jar of this in my medicine cabinet, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I put it on my curly hair after it dries. Makes the curls form together and keeps the ends nice. Calms frizzies.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works great on curly hair</li>
            <li> I struggled with my curly/wavey/frizzy hair for years, wanting to enhance the curl, but tame the frizz. I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (20?) and it is the only one I&#x27;ve found that lasts for several days and really works. I wish it was around when I was in high school! I love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> I have dry corse, curly hair. My hair was shiny but the pamade dried it out.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t do my hair without it. Used this product for at least 10 years. It just gets more and more expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent delivery and I love the product I have no other issues with this product. I is exactly what I expected and need.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for curls.  Smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I like the way it leaves my hair after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Excellent control on my grey hair.</li>
            <li> This humectant is so great as a final touch to curly hair.  I LOVE it.  I live in Colorado, so its super dry, and I need the humidity -- humectant works well.  If you live in a humid part of the world, anti-humectant would be the way to go.</li>
            <li> If you have thick naturally curly that is dry and prone to frizz this product is amazing!! Many are deterred by the price thinking it is too high, but one jar lasts quite some time. I bought a jar over 1.5 years ago and am just now getting to the bottom of the just. You need very little to make this product help your hair look fabulous. I used this ever day and for 20.00 lasting 18 months you are looking at $1.11 a month for a product that is a must for thick, curly, frizzy dry hair.</li>
            <li> Works like it should... Adds the wet looks and piecey look to a haircut or style. Nice product, works great.  Nice price, nice size.  Would buy again, if needed. Thank you,</li>
            <li> This product is a fake and not sanctioned by Aveda.  Plus Aveda sells it cheaper.</li>
            <li> This pomade made my hair anything but manageable. I used ever so little, but it created limp, lifeless and oily looking hair. After two strikes, I&#x27;m returnuing ir to Aveda, where I purchased it. Thank goodness they stand by their products and have a return policy.      Like the rest of the \\&quot;Brilliant\\&quot; line of products, the fragrance is so vile, that even if the product was brilliant, I would die of asphyxiation. It smells that bad.     I also tried the hairspray -- it is sticky and not natural looking or feeling.     I will never purchase another Brilliant line prosuct again.  I just can&#x27;t get past the toxic, medicinal smell. How this passed focus groups is beyond me, as my entire family made me re-wash my hair because they could not bear to be in the same room with me.  And frankly, I could not bear to be in the same room with myself. Yes, the stench is that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and right after I blow dry my  I rub in a small amount and my hair looks fabulous! Great Alternative to all that heavy oily stuff I used to use. This leaves my hair float and bouncy.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this product but I also paid $(.99 for - Gift-wrap: The Ultimate Gift Wrap - Designer Jhaneen. When I asked my sister about it she didn&#x27;t know what I was talking about . She looked at the invoice and it said it was gift wrapped. This gift wrapping consisted of a basic manila bag lined with bubble plastic. Pretty cheesy for 410. Don&#x27;t get the gift wrap. you&#x27;ll be sorry. This might belong in Amazon shipping.but consider fancy wrapping to be part of the gift.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Aveda products and this humectant has a great scent and does the job to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; my flyaways and make my hair look sleek and clean.</li>
            <li> Shaped very quickly, smells great in my Loc&#x27;s.  I used the product after I washed my Loc&#x27;s for retwisting and it held nicely.  I didn&#x27;t realize such a small purchase for the money. Will definitely continue to use</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and found it very effective.  It also adds a lot of shine to my hair.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The smell is way to strong :(</li>
            <li> Aveda Brilliant Humectant Pomade is great at controlling your hair &amp;#34;fly-aways&amp;#34; and isn&#x27;t greasy. Not to mention,it smells good too</li>
            <li> I love uses this right after I get a touch-up or during the winter months in AZ. I have relaxed hair. This works perfect when my hair is dry or when I&#x27;m stretching my relaxer for a few weeks. I also use the Anti-humectant for everyday use during the summer months in AZ. I have posted a review on that purchase as well. If you are unsure about making the purchase stop by the store in your area. I was given a sample an fell in love.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time for my hair and I love it.  However, the jar I got smelled &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and did not have the usual fresh fragrance I am used to.  It works just fine but I think it had been on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff.  A little goes a long way.</li>
