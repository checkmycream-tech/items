            <li>After trying for months to get sexy, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>Better off just getting the serum and a designer mascara instead.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the revitalash eyelash conditioner</li>
            <li>You can do much better with the drug store brands.</li>
            <li>and I love love love it.  </li>
            <li>i thought this mascara would compliment it, but it is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I saw happy people, who were meeting other happy people via text message.</li>
            <li>formula itself is ok, because it doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on smoothly...</li>
            <li>It applies easily and does not get clumpy or gloppy.  </li>
            <li>Also, it can be rubbed off extremely easily causing \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS AND SEE A HUGE IMPROVEMENT</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump up and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It separates and defines beautifully and stays on well all day long.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited,</li>
            <li>For the price of the mascara and some relatively positive reviews, I was expecting something A LOT better.</li>
            <li>This mascara is like all others that volumize, nothing special.</li>
            <li>So I decided to go on online and try some remedies for sexy eyes, in hopes that I would be able to text other sexy people.</li>
            <li>It was worth a shot, but I cant tell the difference.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice, but the consistency is runny and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li>I wore it out the first time I noticed people staring at my eyes</li>
            <li>It runs easily, gets all over both my upper and lower lids when being applied.</li>
            <li>is nice black</li>
            <li>And it really makes my lashes look fuller.   </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the hype to this mascara.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, but I really can&#x27;t see much of a difference in thickening, lengthening, or growth.</li>
            <li>but really I didnt see a difference.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot revitalash, thanks.</li>
            <li>This works very well for what it is intended.</li>
            <li>Get great results put it on looks like u are wearing false eye lashes</li>
            <li>but that doesn&#x27;t feel much different than some of the other good mascaras I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you can spend more, go with MAC Haute &amp; Naughty!</li>
            <li>I love it, especially with no flaking and it makes my lashes look very long.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff religiously, and when I say religiously, think of a Buddhist lighting their incense, every day, sometimes twice, and wishing that these lashes would grow so that I could be as sexy as the girls on the texting commercial.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply but it takes a few weeks to see results.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this mascara a couple of weeks, but really do like it.   </li>
            <li>So far the tube I have has lasted 2 months, with no decrease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with using the plain Revitalash conditioner at night, and my favorite \\&quot;non-conditioning\\&quot; mascara for daily wear.</li>
            <li>&quot;  my eyelashes become stuck together very easily and are very hard to separate.  </li>
            <li>Shortly after realizing that this was not a Loreal or Revlon commercial, I got back on track to realize that I needed these lashes if I was going to text other sexy people.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product that really works.  I will always use it since I have very short thin eyelashes without it.  It is easy to apply but it takes a few weeks to see results.  The tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am using this mascara along with the Revitalash conditioner.  I simply love this mascara.  It applies easily and does not get clumpy or gloppy.  Since I&#x27;ve not been using it long enough to see the benefits of longer or thicker lashes, I can&#x27;t testify to that.  However, even if it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes thicker, it is a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I have only used this mascara a couple of weeks, but really do like it.   It doesn&#x27;t clump up and goes on smoothly.  And it really makes my lashes look fuller.   Since I wear contact lenses, some mascaras irritate my eyes, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because I use and like, the Revitalash eyelash conditioner.  This mascara claims to condition your eyelashes while you&#x27;re wearing it.  That may be so, but I am not impressed with the way this mascara goes on and the way my lashes look while wearing it.  Although it is not \\&quot;clumpy,\\&quot;  my eyelashes become stuck together very easily and are very hard to separate.  When this mascara dries, my eyelashes are stuck together as if I had used glue as mascara.  It is certainly not the worst mascara I have every tried, but nowhere near as good as some of the other similarly priced brands available.  I&#x27;m going to stick with using the plain Revitalash conditioner at night, and my favorite \\&quot;non-conditioning\\&quot; mascara for daily wear.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the hype to this mascara. It runs easily, gets all over both my upper and lower lids when being applied. I&#x27;ve been using mascara for 20 years and never had that trouble in the past. It doesn&#x27;t clump, but I really can&#x27;t see much of a difference in thickening, lengthening, or growth. It&#x27;s just plain mascara. I will save my money and stick with my Loreal with collagen. It makes my eyes POP and costs waaaaaaaay less!</li>
            <li> After trying for months to get sexy, I decided to try this. It all came to me on a lonely night while watching late night television. I saw happy people, who were meeting other happy people via text message. The girls were all so pretty and happy that they were fullfilling their life with these sexy text messages. Anyways, long story short, I found the one thing they all had in common, thanks to my dvr I could rewind the commercial and watch the ad over and over. The one thing they all had in common was long eyelashes. They all had these eyelashes and I almost thought that I was watching a eyelash commercial. Shortly after realizing that this was not a Loreal or Revlon commercial, I got back on track to realize that I needed these lashes if I was going to text other sexy people. So I decided to go on online and try some remedies for sexy eyes, in hopes that I would be able to text other sexy people. Well I ordered this and I was so excited, but really I didnt see a difference. I used this stuff religiously, and when I say religiously, think of a Buddhist lighting their incense, every day, sometimes twice, and wishing that these lashes would grow so that I could be as sexy as the girls on the texting commercial. It didn&#x27;t work, and I am still stuck watching late night TV, alone, thanks a lot revitalash, thanks.</li>
            <li> Goes on the lashes great and doesn&#x27;t clump.I Would buy this poduct again. Hasn&#x27;t been enough time to see if lashes are longer.</li>
            <li> I had to throw this away as it just never got dry, the slightest touch resulted in smudges.&lt;br /&gt;when I wore it out the first time I noticed people staring at my eyes, I thought I must look good: until I saw my &#x27;panda bear&#x27; reflection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why they would make a mascara so useless.</li>
            <li> This mascara is like all others that volumize, nothing special. Dissappointed as I thought maybe this one would make a big difference and it didn&#x27;t. Oh well, back to the drug store!</li>
            <li> Im not impressed with this mascara. It didnt do anything. It was worth a shot, but I cant tell the difference.</li>
            <li> For the price of the mascara and some relatively positive reviews, I was expecting something A LOT better. Unfortunately, this mascara does nothing to distinguish it from drugstore brands. The brush is nice, but the consistency is runny and takes forever to dry. Also, it can be rubbed off extremely easily causing \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;. Better off just getting the serum and a designer mascara instead.</li>
            <li> I used the RevitaLash eyelash serum and that stuff is amazing! The mascara, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the brush. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just not using it correctly, but it&#x27;s difficult to use because it&#x27;s thinner in the middle and the ends are a little thicker (sort of hourglass shape. It&#x27;s hard to tell fr the pic) and mascara gets all over my lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula itself is ok, because it doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on smoothly... but that doesn&#x27;t feel much different than some of the other good mascaras I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay to have this again</li>
            <li> I did notice lash growth, however the mascara runs pretty bad. It also smears by the end of the day as well as flakes off. I was told if I would use the primer it wouldn&#x27;t do that. Great product if you are indoors but if you are outside with a chance of watery eyes avoid!</li>
            <li> This mascara make my eyelash straight down, I use an eyelash curler, but when I apply this mascara right after, my eyelashes go down like a mini blind. is nice black it almost looks like paint if you smear it though. I would probably stay away from it though</li>
            <li> I love it, especially with no flaking and it makes my lashes look very long. It separates and defines beautifully and stays on well all day long.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS AND SEE A HUGE IMPROVEMENT MY LASHES ARE GROWING THICKER</li>
            <li> I love this mascara...I used to travel 20 miles to our hospital&#x27;s cosmetic surgery center to purchase it, but then found it on Amazon...I am definitely a regular customer and will continue to use it. Great coverage and keeps my lashes conditioned...</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used, along with the primer. It makes lashes look longer, no clumping, and no smearing. So far the tube I have has lasted 2 months, with no decrease. I am very happy with it. I do not believe the purpose is to actually grow longer thicker lashes - that is a different product. This works very well for what it is intended.</li>
            <li> Very good for people who don&#x27;t have alot eye lashes.  It really does work, Slow but it works.  Love it. Will keep buying the product and others in the same line.</li>
            <li> If you want long lashes back or have never had them, this is the product and is quite a steal.  The merchant shipped promptly and I was very pleased with the results from this great new product!</li>
            <li> I love the revitalash eyelash conditioner so I gave this a try. I was disappointed. You can do much better with the drug store brands. L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous is great. If you can spend more, go with MAC Haute &amp; Naughty! Way better than this product!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I use this with the revitalash primer and my lashes look amazing. I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Get great results put it on looks like u are wearing false eye lashes but they are yours. I recommend</li>
            <li> I do not want this at all. Because I want a item to let my eyelash grow up. Even this is a mascara, is does not has good quality.</li>
            <li> Seems to be about the same as other mascaras.Women are always looking to have thicker longer lashes. Still waiting.Thank you Sondra Cantor</li>
            <li> I use Revitalash lash conditioner and I love love love it.  It works great.  i thought this mascara would compliment it, but it is just ok.  I wouldn&#x27;;t spend the money on it again.</li>
            <li> Everyone notices my eyelashes. They can&#x27;t believe they are real - they are very long and thick. I have very deep set eyes and didn&#x27;t have short eyelashes, but they were hard to see.  I don&#x27;t even have to use an eyelash curler anymore!!!!  I will never stop using this product. I&#x27;ve had a few friends write down the website or go to Amazon for this product.</li>
