            <li>Super satisfied.</li>
            <li>Nice in large purse - organized</li>
            <li>My planner items fit prefect in this bag.</li>
            <li>I ordered the pink organizer and have found it incredibly helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also incredibly cheap</li>
            <li>Prefect fit for all of my purses..</li>
            <li>It can fit almost all my purses.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>IT ALSO IT IS MADE OUT OF CHEAP MATERIAL AND</li>
            <li>it is light weight.  </li>
            <li>actually this was given as part of a gift and the recipient is quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I cut a piece of cardboard to fit in the bottom</li>
            <li>Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Great for my diaper bag to keep my personal stuff separate from the baby stuff.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap organization solution for the purse.</li>
            <li>As it is these were cheap and will hopefully serve their purpose.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wait for sure.</li>
            <li>For $3.99 plus free shipping, I&#x27;m not complaining.  </li>
            <li>Lots and lots of room and really light.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t complaining about that because it was free</li>
            <li>You can barely fit anything in it.</li>
            <li>Also, doesn&#x27;t fit in my purse well</li>
            <li>Material is cheap.</li>
            <li>and it is free shipping...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some reviews that the material was cheap, but I disagree.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit a binder in it.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought two of these, and they both are really great.</li>
            <li>love love love it!!will be ordering more in different colors</li>
            <li>You can only bring so much on a plane so its best you manage to pack it all into one bag.</li>
            <li>So far, so good though</li>
            <li>in my purse right now love hope they have again</li>
            <li>I love how it keeps everything right</li>
            <li>This is very handy especially when it comes to trips.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>I should have read the dimension.... but overall very handy and keeps my purse organized and makes switching purses a breeze.</li>
            <li>I can find all of my things, quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Received faster then expected and looks great but made cheaply, one pocket had the edging come off on the 2nd day I had it, otherwise it works great</li>
            <li>This fits perfectly in my handbag and no more embarrassing searches looking for the one thing that&#x27;s always at the bottom.</li>
            <li>It was cute at first</li>
            <li>I was excited to get it.  </li>
            <li>So, I originally bought this bag for couponing.</li>
            <li>There are more pockets than I actually need, I&#x27;d totally missed the snaps on the ends so that was a very pleasant surprise, helping this organizer fit into my thinner bags.</li>
            <li>Cheap and super practical.</li>
            <li>This came a lot sooner then expected and is great.  </li>
            <li>This pink one is great, and it has a lot of pockets and storage.</li>
            <li>This bag organizer is so cute, and it holds so much stuff.</li>
            <li>Honestly good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>Love this so much</li>
            <li>spend a good amount for one that will last</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the colors are cool</li>
            <li>This really is just to flimsy and to many pockets and stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is a good thing the handles aren&#x27;t a necessity as one of mine ripped out from the nylon lining the 2nd time that I handled it.  </li>
            <li>I would want something like this if it was supported better and stood up straight in my purse</li>
            <li>so much I bought more for friends at Christmas.</li>
            <li>It was cool.</li>
            <li>Overall good product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny,  maybe good for a make up bag.</li>
            <li>I thought this qould be a great way to change purses quickly, but it seems like it is harder for me to find anything.  </li>
            <li>Shipped relatively quickly for something that was coming from hong kong.</li>
            <li>The gray one arrived quickly and is working well for me.</li>
            <li>it looks just like picture, it came quickly.</li>
            <li>I received quick delivery and the item was as described.  </li>
            <li>I love it Lots of pockets more than I expected It is cheap but still durable and giftable.</li>
            <li>The delivery is very fast!</li>
            <li>It was a good price and it is well made so I didn&#x27;t mind that it took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li>Love my new organzier use it all around the house..</li>
            <li>very usefull when doing project, easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>Tore easily, but I wasn&#x27;t upset since it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly what it is!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Love my little purse organizer, it&#x27;s easy to switch our purses without have to reorganize everything :)</li>
            <li>It has so many different compartments and is easy to store and find things.</li>
            <li>It has so many pockets that are different sizes which makes it so easy to put things where you need them.</li>
            <li>This is a great little bag organizer.</li>
            <li>great little organizer on ly problem was them handle sewn in side frayed apart in about a week</li>
            <li>You can fit so much in there.</li>
            <li>I love the way it fits inside my purse and it&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Its worth buying.</li>
            <li>Took a while to get here but was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Good bag, needs longer straps and a way to close the center compartment.</li>
            <li>Gave the extra one to my friend and.shes thrilled too.</li>
            <li>Love it so much bought 4 more in different colors!</li>
            <li>product is definitely worth the money to give it a shot to see if you like it or not.  </li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice but handles r not lo g enough</li>
            <li>I love it, it came with free shipping so it took forever to actually get here.  </li>
            <li>This is nice and big fits inside my purse and has oodles of pockets for everything.</li>
            <li>It is highly durable and the zippers are strong and reliable.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, well made, light, durable, fits easily in other bags, holds a lot of items.</li>
            <li>Now items that normally get lost at the bottom of the purse are easy to find.</li>
            <li>It arrived pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday, very handy everytime</li>
            <li>Other wise it seems to work</li>
            <li>Price is right also</li>
            <li>The bag is just the right size for putting in  my purse.</li>
            <li>It is a great little organizer and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>Just beware, if you&#x27;re paying more than a few dollars for this item or you&#x27;re expecting a heavy duty, will take a beating, and looks like a designer insert, you&#x27;re better off making your own or finding one you&#x27;re willing to pay more for.</li>
            <li>It is good size for an average sized purse.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a little extra carry around bag</li>
            <li>Love it, can find it easy because of the pink!  </li>
            <li>Fits in any middle sized bag, resistant, easy to clean and organize.</li>
            <li>However, it ships quickly and arrives in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Super small but good for in and out coupon runs</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li>Very fast ship.</li>
            <li>Holds more than I expected and the little front pockets are great for pens scissors stapler etc.</li>

            <li>Love the extra space this provides!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>It is larger than I was expecting but that is ok.  </li>
            <li>Love it for my big bags!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly as they advertised it.</li>
            <li>I received this item exactly as it is shown on the picture.</li>
            <li>Would like a couple more for crafts and such!</li>
            <li>I wish this would be better quality because I definitely need an organizer for my purse.  </li>
            <li>came fast and you see what you get!</li>
            <li>It was either someone&#x27;s first attempt at sewing or</li>
            <li>It could be used for many different things</li>
            <li>Mine looks exactly like the picture  </li>
            <li>Will definitely help me keep my purse more organized.</li>
            <li>Has enough pockets to keep me satisfied and I can just grab the loops pull it out and insert it into another purse</li>
            <li>For the price of this item it is well worth the money and actually better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that won&#x27;t show up, unless of course you enjoy doing that, which in that case you can just me some money :)</li>
            <li>Overall product good, but wish it was bigger</li>
            <li>Overall a nice bag, will have to work on sewing the handles on a little better.</li>
            <li>this took a long time to show up, but I was pleased with its size and the number of pockets.</li>
            <li>Might be good to hold small toiletries when traveling too</li>
            <li>Loved this however my only complaint was that the handles are coming unattached the more I use it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the product and it helps with organizing my purse, however, part of the seam edging along the top of the mesh pockets has come undone leaving the raw edge exposed.  </li>
            <li>wow, now I can switch purses quickly.</li>
            <li>and I can easily take the insert out and put it into another bag, if necessary.  </li>
            <li>I have a few Mylinka bags that are beautiful but larger than what I&#x27;m used to carrying.  </li>
            <li>Easily inserts into mid to large sized purses.  </li>
            <li>It holds everything in place, in my large purse.</li>
            <li>Everyone with these large bags or totes without dividers need one of these.</li>
            <li>I use it to carry a large NKJ Bible (not being pompous, just wanting you to know the capacity of this organizer) and</li>
            <li>This item tends to be floppier in my purse than I would like and if you don&#x27;t have the items in it balanced out by weight, the insert just tips over if it is in a purse that is too large for the insert or when you pull it out of your bag to look for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the purse i bought this for is a large purse</li>
            <li>, it is quite large.</li>
            <li>and i plan on getting a few more!</li>
            <li>It looks large enough to fit a coupon binder inside</li>
            <li>Great design, just wish it was a little larger.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother me too much because I wasn&#x27;t planning on putting much in there to begin with and the zipper on the opposite side was fine and worked well.</li>
            <li>It is fairly large so it would not fit into smaller purses, but is best for the larger bags.  </li>
            <li>Even though its cheap it will last if you take care of it and not over stuff it.</li>
            <li>Very durable and works for my project</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is very roomy.</li>
            <li>Iloved this so much that I bought one for my mother in law</li>
            <li>It doesnt stand up as straight as Id</li>
            <li>Very roomy, yet compact.  </li>
            <li>i sew for a living and it does hold absolutely every thing</li>
            <li>everything has a place and it organizes more than I expected</li>
            <li>This product is better than expected.  </li>
            <li>very cheeply maid wouldn&#x27;t get it ...</li>
            <li>This organizes my whole purse.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had it because i COULD REALLY USE IT  </li>
            <li>REALLY NEED IT.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how much easier it is now.</li>
            <li>Pink is my favorite color and the purse I bought it for is fuchsia.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product 100%!</li>
            <li>I really like the bag.</li>
            <li>I use to for my nail products and it is very spacious and everything fits.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really tuck in well.</li>
            <li>This organizer is very spacious.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love these pink bags</li>
            <li>so I thought I would go ahead and buy one of these to test out since the cost isn&#x27;t too much to throw away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like all the pockets that it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Very usable during my couponing.</li>
            <li>It fits what I need to carry along with me each day, has a load of pockets on either side, plus the center compartment along with the two side zipper top compartments.  </li>
            <li>this thing makes it so much easier to carry everything and organize my purse.</li>
            <li>It appears very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very deceiving,From the photo it makes you think you can hold lots of things in it.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for 8 months and has held up very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I had to really look for it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful in keeping things where you want them.  </li>
            <li>and she loves it just as much as I do</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Holds up much better than expected.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>This organizer makes it possible to separate personal and work-related items in an organized and effective way.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy duty zippers and plenty of pockets for all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; we carry.  </li>
            <li>in my tote perfect-made very well-love the larger zippers so much easier to use-holds more than I thought it would-perfect for my suitcase as well -will be ordering more as gifts-also want a few for craft and sewing supplies-need another one for bathroom -don&#x27;t pass this up -don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order 3 more for other things.</li>
            <li>They were even better than I had expected them to be!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty color, large enough for everything I use daily, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly large so you would need a large purse to use it in,, but it has all the pockets and places you could need and can be lifted out by the handles when you just throw something in because you don&#x27;t have the patience right now to put it back where it goes</li>
            <li>it is good quality but the size is not good for a purse</li>
            <li>Wish it had more structure to the sides to keep it from being flimsy once it is down inside your purse.  </li>
            <li>It is a little smaller (which could be a good thing) than I thought.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t hold more, in fact it holds less then</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and I got it mainly for that reason, plus it looked like it had a lot of pockets.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next time, I would make sure to purchase a larger one.</li>
            <li>Lots of pockets and 2 zipper sections, plus the main compartment.</li>
            <li>But it is SUPER tiny.</li>
            <li>The zippers stick a little but other than that it&#x27;s a great piece</li>
            <li>I really carry this bag nearly every where I go and has plenty of storage for all kinds of things!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these for quite sometime but never wanted to spend the high amount on one.  </li>
            <li>I think too many people have a rich mans appetite on a poor mans budget, or</li>
            <li>This little insert helped me to be able to keep things in my backpack organized</li>
            <li>work for me, easily change to  other purses or bag.</li>
            <li>I am absoutely buying a few more.</li>
            <li>Problem was that after only 2 weeks of use, the stitching came apart and the bag was no longer useful.  </li>
            <li>This is to be my bath accessories bag for a trip to Japan and with all the small separate compartments, on the outside, it&#x27;s perfect and the inside is big enough for my travel towel and hair towel!!</li>
            <li>I have a few of these and keep getting more.</li>
            <li>Cute and easy to open, lots of storage for such a little bag.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought it was going to be, but super cute and helpful, especially for all my loose papers and coupons!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to reach down searching in my purse because everything is easy to access.  </li>
            <li>I live in the US where we have to earn a 5 star.</li>
            <li>I change purses all the time, all I have to do is pick it up and put it in the new purse.</li>
            <li>You can fit stuff in the middle and then there are two zipper compartments to put things that could potentially spill.</li>
            <li>The idea behind this product is great; however, I wish this would last longer.  </li>
            <li>Bigger than I expected, but still fits in my purse and sure solves the problem of where to put your pen.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much my only issue with the bag.</li>
            <li>I use everything is always in exactly the same spot!</li>
            <li>Works ok for small to medium purses.</li>
            <li>all the little things I need and is easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>The zippers do get a little stuck but fixes easily</li>
            <li>This is so cheaply made I put my stuff in it one morning as I changed purses and when I dropped change down there it all feel out.</li>
            <li>Item is a little smaller than I expected, other than that it was perfect.</li>
            <li>It worked as expected and came quickly.</li>
            <li>and I love to organize, but after less then a week the seams started coming apart and the sides totally ripped!</li>
            <li>There is more room than in a previous similar organizer that is sold by a home party purse company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seams are at first glance are adequate, but I&#x27;m not sure how well they will hold</li>
            <li>Too big for even a large purse.</li>
            <li>it is... and the item they have inside the makes it appear as though its large enough to carry items...</li>
            <li>Overall you could lose this in a large bag.</li>
            <li>There were no signs of fraying or little threads unraveling and the zippers did not buckle and continued to operate smoothly.</li>
            <li>Little and cheap quality</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>Also the pink is pretty!&#x27;</li>
            <li>Thought it would be a little bigger but was pleased nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was much faster than the Est. standard.</li>
            <li>The insert is too soft and does not hold its shape.  </li>
            <li>It is much smaller than I thought it was and doesn&#x27;t look much like the photo advertised.</li>
            <li>Soft sided for expansion.  </li>
            <li>and the bottom of bag was completely ripped.</li>
            <li>very neat for organizing larger totes or work bags</li>
            <li>I wish it had a longer carrying strap, but i really do like all the different compartments.</li>
            <li>She is a Real Estate Agent and always has lots of papers and objects floating around her big bag...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable and I really can&#x27;t compliment this organizer enough.  </li>
            <li>notebook to church with my pens, highlighters, etc., with so much room for anything extra</li>
            <li>really think it is a personal preference as to whether a person will like one of these or not.  </li>
            <li>I am able to put at least 3 coupon holders in it with ease.  </li>
            <li>My 2 years old son can&#x27;t even play with it....</li>
            <li>Delivery took longer than I expected but was worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>I would have  been furious to pay that kind of money for so poor of a product.</li>
            <li>the only thing is I think the handles r a bit too short but other than that I love them</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a little while to get, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>Small handles make it easy to remove</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quilted and it makes it a little thick but otherwise, pretty nice</li>
            <li>It was fine but way too small for my purse.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t love about their bags is they generally only come with two small and one zip pocket.  </li>
            <li>Though it was a little smaller than I expected, still very helpful :)</li>
            <li>If you can catch it at the same price I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend to any women out there who uses a big bag.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for what it is, a simple inexpensive way of organizing any objects...</li>
            <li>It is designed to fit inside a small - medium sized purse.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She uses the large center area for a little folding divider full of coupons, she keeps pens, highlighter, scissors, paper clips, her keys, etc.</li>
            <li>Was not big enough to hold much at all.</li>
            <li>The makeup I use all the time I put in the center, the stuff I rarely use I put in the zipper sections and my brushes and such go in the pockets in the front.</li>
            <li>But it was such a low price that I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Its not small, however, it has snaps, to make it smaller, if needed.</li>
            <li>If always has to full length zippers on either side and a open center which can be made into 2 different sizes.</li>
            <li>I put my wallet &amp; agenda in the large middle slot where the handles are, my lipstick and lip glosses in 2 outer slots, compact mirror in one of the nets, my 2 mineral face mists in another slot, large body spray &amp; lotion in the middle and a ton of other stuff</li>
            <li>Love the bag, it has a lot of pockets and room for my stuff, but the handles broke on day 2 of use, which makes it a little harder to grab it out of my big bag &amp; go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wide in the center (see Pics) but also has a large zipper compartment on either side as well as many small compartments on both sides</li>
            <li>No more endless searching in those big bags, keeping everything secure and right where I want it is such a time saver!</li>
            <li>Much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>Yes, all of this apparent from the picture.  </li>
            <li>Ots ok, not great</li>
            <li>On other sites these retail for around $40 for the exact same product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super small......</li>
            <li>They actually hold a lot with two zipper compartments and a large center with lots of pockets on the sides  </li>
            <li>There are lots of outer pockets to store smaller items and a large center space for wallets and such.  </li>
            <li>Though one of the zipper started gettin stuck not long after I had received it.</li>
            <li>Was very small that originally thought .</li>
            <li>This bag was not the right size for my small gym bag.</li>
            <li>Cheap, not good for big purses.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected as far as size and it took FOREVER to arrive!</li>
            <li>The stitching is crooked but for only a few dollars, it will work for exactly what it is needed for.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is the outside pockets seem kind of small, but maybe that is just because I have a larger phone.</li>
            <li>I live the color, It is very pink.</li>
            <li>just not great for huge purses.. it leans and falls</li>

            <li> I ordered the pink organizer and have found it incredibly helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also incredibly cheap</li>
            <li> Prefect fit for all of my purses..</li>
            <li> It can fit almost all my purses.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> IT ALSO IT IS MADE OUT OF CHEAP MATERIAL AND</li>
            <li> it is light weight.  </li>
            <li> actually this was given as part of a gift and the recipient is quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I cut a piece of cardboard to fit in the bottom</li>
            <li> Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for my diaper bag to keep my personal stuff separate from the baby stuff.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap organization solution for the purse.</li>
            <li> As it is these were cheap and will hopefully serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the wait for sure.</li>
            <li> For $3.99 plus free shipping, I&#x27;m not complaining.  </li>
            <li> Lots and lots of room and really light.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t complaining about that because it was free</li>
            <li> You can barely fit anything in it.</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t fit in my purse well</li>
            <li> Material is cheap.</li>
            <li> and it is free shipping...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews that the material was cheap, but I disagree.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fit a binder in it.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought two of these, and they both are really great.</li>
            <li> love love love it!!will be ordering more in different colors</li>
            <li> You can only bring so much on a plane so its best you manage to pack it all into one bag.</li>
            <li> So far, so good though</li>
            <li> in my purse right now love hope they have again</li>
            <li> I love how it keeps everything right</li>
            <li> This is very handy especially when it comes to trips.</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> I should have read the dimension.... but overall very handy and keeps my purse organized and makes switching purses a breeze.</li>
            <li> I can find all of my things, quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Received faster then expected and looks great but made cheaply, one pocket had the edging come off on the 2nd day I had it, otherwise it works great</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly in my handbag and no more embarrassing searches looking for the one thing that&#x27;s always at the bottom.</li>
            <li> It was cute at first</li>
            <li> I was excited to get it.  </li>
            <li> So, I originally bought this bag for couponing.</li>
            <li> There are more pockets than I actually need, I&#x27;d totally missed the snaps on the ends so that was a very pleasant surprise, helping this organizer fit into my thinner bags.</li>
            <li> Cheap and super practical.</li>
            <li> This came a lot sooner then expected and is great.  </li>
            <li> This pink one is great, and it has a lot of pockets and storage.</li>
            <li> This bag organizer is so cute, and it holds so much stuff.</li>
            <li> Honestly good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this so much</li>
            <li> spend a good amount for one that will last</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the colors are cool</li>
            <li> This really is just to flimsy and to many pockets and stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is a good thing the handles aren&#x27;t a necessity as one of mine ripped out from the nylon lining the 2nd time that I handled it.  </li>
            <li> I would want something like this if it was supported better and stood up straight in my purse</li>
            <li> so much I bought more for friends at Christmas.</li>
            <li> It was cool.</li>
            <li> Overall good product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny,  maybe good for a make up bag.</li>
            <li> I thought this qould be a great way to change purses quickly, but it seems like it is harder for me to find anything.  </li>
            <li> Shipped relatively quickly for something that was coming from hong kong.</li>
            <li> The gray one arrived quickly and is working well for me.</li>
            <li> it looks just like picture, it came quickly.</li>
            <li> I received quick delivery and the item was as described.  </li>
            <li> I love it Lots of pockets more than I expected It is cheap but still durable and giftable.</li>
            <li> The delivery is very fast!</li>
            <li> It was a good price and it is well made so I didn&#x27;t mind that it took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> Love my new organzier use it all around the house..</li>
            <li> very usefull when doing project, easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> Tore easily, but I wasn&#x27;t upset since it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly what it is!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Love my little purse organizer, it&#x27;s easy to switch our purses without have to reorganize everything :)</li>
            <li> It has so many different compartments and is easy to store and find things.</li>
            <li> It has so many pockets that are different sizes which makes it so easy to put things where you need them.</li>
            <li> This is a great little bag organizer.</li>
            <li> great little organizer on ly problem was them handle sewn in side frayed apart in about a week</li>
            <li> You can fit so much in there.</li>
            <li> I love the way it fits inside my purse and it&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Its worth buying.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here but was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Good bag, needs longer straps and a way to close the center compartment.</li>
            <li> Gave the extra one to my friend and.shes thrilled too.</li>
            <li> Love it so much bought 4 more in different colors!</li>
            <li> product is definitely worth the money to give it a shot to see if you like it or not.  </li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice but handles r not lo g enough</li>
            <li> I love it, it came with free shipping so it took forever to actually get here.  </li>
            <li> This is nice and big fits inside my purse and has oodles of pockets for everything.</li>
            <li> It is highly durable and the zippers are strong and reliable.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, well made, light, durable, fits easily in other bags, holds a lot of items.</li>
            <li> Now items that normally get lost at the bottom of the purse are easy to find.</li>
            <li> It arrived pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, very handy everytime</li>
            <li> Other wise it seems to work</li>
            <li> Price is right also</li>
            <li> The bag is just the right size for putting in  my purse.</li>
            <li> It is a great little organizer and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Just beware, if you&#x27;re paying more than a few dollars for this item or you&#x27;re expecting a heavy duty, will take a beating, and looks like a designer insert, you&#x27;re better off making your own or finding one you&#x27;re willing to pay more for.</li>
            <li> It is good size for an average sized purse.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a little extra carry around bag</li>
            <li> Love it, can find it easy because of the pink!  </li>
            <li> Fits in any middle sized bag, resistant, easy to clean and organize.</li>
            <li> However, it ships quickly and arrives in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Super small but good for in and out coupon runs</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li> Very fast ship.</li>
            <li> Holds more than I expected and the little front pockets are great for pens scissors stapler etc.</li>
            <li> Will buy more in different colors!</li>
            <li> Love the extra space this provides!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> It is larger than I was expecting but that is ok.  </li>
            <li> Love it for my big bags!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly as they advertised it.</li>
            <li> I received this item exactly as it is shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> Would like a couple more for crafts and such!</li>
            <li> I wish this would be better quality because I definitely need an organizer for my purse.  </li>
            <li> came fast and you see what you get!</li>
            <li> It was either someone&#x27;s first attempt at sewing or</li>
            <li> It could be used for many different things</li>
            <li> Mine looks exactly like the picture  </li>
            <li> Will definitely help me keep my purse more organized.</li>
            <li> Has enough pockets to keep me satisfied and I can just grab the loops pull it out and insert it into another purse</li>
            <li> For the price of this item it is well worth the money and actually better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that won&#x27;t show up, unless of course you enjoy doing that, which in that case you can just me some money :)</li>
            <li> Overall product good, but wish it was bigger</li>
            <li> Overall a nice bag, will have to work on sewing the handles on a little better.</li>
            <li> this took a long time to show up, but I was pleased with its size and the number of pockets.</li>
            <li> Might be good to hold small toiletries when traveling too</li>
            <li> Loved this however my only complaint was that the handles are coming unattached the more I use it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product and it helps with organizing my purse, however, part of the seam edging along the top of the mesh pockets has come undone leaving the raw edge exposed.  </li>
            <li> wow, now I can switch purses quickly.</li>
            <li> and I can easily take the insert out and put it into another bag, if necessary.  </li>
            <li> I have a few Mylinka bags that are beautiful but larger than what I&#x27;m used to carrying.  </li>
            <li> Easily inserts into mid to large sized purses.  </li>
            <li> It holds everything in place, in my large purse.</li>
            <li> Everyone with these large bags or totes without dividers need one of these.</li>
            <li> I use it to carry a large NKJ Bible (not being pompous, just wanting you to know the capacity of this organizer) and</li>
            <li> This item tends to be floppier in my purse than I would like and if you don&#x27;t have the items in it balanced out by weight, the insert just tips over if it is in a purse that is too large for the insert or when you pull it out of your bag to look for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the purse i bought this for is a large purse</li>
            <li> , it is quite large.</li>
            <li> and i plan on getting a few more!</li>
            <li> It looks large enough to fit a coupon binder inside</li>
            <li> Great design, just wish it was a little larger.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother me too much because I wasn&#x27;t planning on putting much in there to begin with and the zipper on the opposite side was fine and worked well.</li>
            <li> It is fairly large so it would not fit into smaller purses, but is best for the larger bags.  </li>
            <li> Even though its cheap it will last if you take care of it and not over stuff it.</li>
            <li> Very durable and works for my project</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is very roomy.</li>
            <li> Iloved this so much that I bought one for my mother in law</li>
            <li> It doesnt stand up as straight as Id</li>
            <li> Very roomy, yet compact.  </li>
            <li> i sew for a living and it does hold absolutely every thing</li>
            <li> everything has a place and it organizes more than I expected</li>
            <li> This product is better than expected.  </li>
            <li> very cheeply maid wouldn&#x27;t get it ...</li>
            <li> This organizes my whole purse.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had it because i COULD REALLY USE IT  </li>
            <li> REALLY NEED IT.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how much easier it is now.</li>
            <li> Pink is my favorite color and the purse I bought it for is fuchsia.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product 100%!</li>
            <li> I really like the bag.</li>
            <li> I use to for my nail products and it is very spacious and everything fits.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really tuck in well.</li>
            <li> This organizer is very spacious.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love these pink bags</li>
            <li> so I thought I would go ahead and buy one of these to test out since the cost isn&#x27;t too much to throw away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like all the pockets that it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Very usable during my couponing.</li>
            <li> It fits what I need to carry along with me each day, has a load of pockets on either side, plus the center compartment along with the two side zipper top compartments.  </li>
            <li> this thing makes it so much easier to carry everything and organize my purse.</li>
            <li> It appears very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very deceiving,From the photo it makes you think you can hold lots of things in it.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for 8 months and has held up very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but I had to really look for it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful in keeping things where you want them.  </li>
            <li> and she loves it just as much as I do</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Holds up much better than expected.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> This organizer makes it possible to separate personal and work-related items in an organized and effective way.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy duty zippers and plenty of pockets for all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; we carry.  </li>
            <li> in my tote perfect-made very well-love the larger zippers so much easier to use-holds more than I thought it would-perfect for my suitcase as well -will be ordering more as gifts-also want a few for craft and sewing supplies-need another one for bathroom -don&#x27;t pass this up -don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order 3 more for other things.</li>
            <li> They were even better than I had expected them to be!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty color, large enough for everything I use daily, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly large so you would need a large purse to use it in,, but it has all the pockets and places you could need and can be lifted out by the handles when you just throw something in because you don&#x27;t have the patience right now to put it back where it goes</li>
            <li> it is good quality but the size is not good for a purse</li>
            <li> Wish it had more structure to the sides to keep it from being flimsy once it is down inside your purse.  </li>
            <li> It is a little smaller (which could be a good thing) than I thought.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t hold more, in fact it holds less then</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and I got it mainly for that reason, plus it looked like it had a lot of pockets.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next time, I would make sure to purchase a larger one.</li>
            <li> Lots of pockets and 2 zipper sections, plus the main compartment.</li>
            <li> But it is SUPER tiny.</li>
            <li> The zippers stick a little but other than that it&#x27;s a great piece</li>
            <li> I really carry this bag nearly every where I go and has plenty of storage for all kinds of things!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these for quite sometime but never wanted to spend the high amount on one.  </li>
            <li> I think too many people have a rich mans appetite on a poor mans budget, or</li>
            <li> This little insert helped me to be able to keep things in my backpack organized</li>
            <li> work for me, easily change to  other purses or bag.</li>
            <li> I am absoutely buying a few more.</li>
            <li> Problem was that after only 2 weeks of use, the stitching came apart and the bag was no longer useful.  </li>
            <li> This is to be my bath accessories bag for a trip to Japan and with all the small separate compartments, on the outside, it&#x27;s perfect and the inside is big enough for my travel towel and hair towel!!</li>
            <li> I have a few of these and keep getting more.</li>
            <li> Cute and easy to open, lots of storage for such a little bag.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it was going to be, but super cute and helpful, especially for all my loose papers and coupons!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to reach down searching in my purse because everything is easy to access.  </li>
            <li> I live in the US where we have to earn a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I change purses all the time, all I have to do is pick it up and put it in the new purse.</li>
            <li> You can fit stuff in the middle and then there are two zipper compartments to put things that could potentially spill.</li>
            <li> The idea behind this product is great; however, I wish this would last longer.  </li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected, but still fits in my purse and sure solves the problem of where to put your pen.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much my only issue with the bag.</li>
            <li> I use everything is always in exactly the same spot!</li>
            <li> Works ok for small to medium purses.</li>
            <li> all the little things I need and is easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> The zippers do get a little stuck but fixes easily</li>
            <li> This is so cheaply made I put my stuff in it one morning as I changed purses and when I dropped change down there it all feel out.</li>
            <li> Item is a little smaller than I expected, other than that it was perfect.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected and came quickly.</li>
            <li> and I love to organize, but after less then a week the seams started coming apart and the sides totally ripped!</li>
            <li> There is more room than in a previous similar organizer that is sold by a home party purse company.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seams are at first glance are adequate, but I&#x27;m not sure how well they will hold</li>
            <li> Too big for even a large purse.</li>
            <li> it is... and the item they have inside the makes it appear as though its large enough to carry items...</li>
            <li> Overall you could lose this in a large bag.</li>
            <li> There were no signs of fraying or little threads unraveling and the zippers did not buckle and continued to operate smoothly.</li>
            <li> Little and cheap quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cheap looking.  </li>
            <li> Also the pink is pretty!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a little bigger but was pleased nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was much faster than the Est. standard.</li>
            <li> The insert is too soft and does not hold its shape.  </li>
            <li> It is much smaller than I thought it was and doesn&#x27;t look much like the photo advertised.</li>
            <li> Soft sided for expansion.  </li>
            <li> and the bottom of bag was completely ripped.</li>
            <li> very neat for organizing larger totes or work bags</li>
            <li> I wish it had a longer carrying strap, but i really do like all the different compartments.</li>
            <li> She is a Real Estate Agent and always has lots of papers and objects floating around her big bag...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable and I really can&#x27;t compliment this organizer enough.  </li>
            <li> notebook to church with my pens, highlighters, etc., with so much room for anything extra</li>
            <li> really think it is a personal preference as to whether a person will like one of these or not.  </li>
            <li> I am able to put at least 3 coupon holders in it with ease.  </li>
            <li> My 2 years old son can&#x27;t even play with it....</li>
            <li> Delivery took longer than I expected but was worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> I would have  been furious to pay that kind of money for so poor of a product.</li>
            <li> the only thing is I think the handles r a bit too short but other than that I love them</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little while to get, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Small handles make it easy to remove</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quilted and it makes it a little thick but otherwise, pretty nice</li>
            <li> It was fine but way too small for my purse.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t love about their bags is they generally only come with two small and one zip pocket.  </li>
            <li> Though it was a little smaller than I expected, still very helpful :)</li>
            <li> If you can catch it at the same price I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend to any women out there who uses a big bag.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for what it is, a simple inexpensive way of organizing any objects...</li>
            <li> It is designed to fit inside a small - medium sized purse.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She uses the large center area for a little folding divider full of coupons, she keeps pens, highlighter, scissors, paper clips, her keys, etc.</li>
            <li> Was not big enough to hold much at all.</li>
            <li> The makeup I use all the time I put in the center, the stuff I rarely use I put in the zipper sections and my brushes and such go in the pockets in the front.</li>
            <li> But it was such a low price that I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Its not small, however, it has snaps, to make it smaller, if needed.</li>
            <li> If always has to full length zippers on either side and a open center which can be made into 2 different sizes.</li>
            <li> I put my wallet &amp; agenda in the large middle slot where the handles are, my lipstick and lip glosses in 2 outer slots, compact mirror in one of the nets, my 2 mineral face mists in another slot, large body spray &amp; lotion in the middle and a ton of other stuff</li>
            <li> Love the bag, it has a lot of pockets and room for my stuff, but the handles broke on day 2 of use, which makes it a little harder to grab it out of my big bag &amp; go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wide in the center (see Pics) but also has a large zipper compartment on either side as well as many small compartments on both sides</li>
            <li> No more endless searching in those big bags, keeping everything secure and right where I want it is such a time saver!</li>
            <li> Much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Yes, all of this apparent from the picture.  </li>
            <li> Ots ok, not great</li>
            <li> On other sites these retail for around $40 for the exact same product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super small......</li>
            <li> They actually hold a lot with two zipper compartments and a large center with lots of pockets on the sides  </li>
            <li> There are lots of outer pockets to store smaller items and a large center space for wallets and such.  </li>
            <li> Though one of the zipper started gettin stuck not long after I had received it.</li>
            <li> Was very small that originally thought .</li>
            <li> This bag was not the right size for my small gym bag.</li>
            <li> Cheap, not good for big purses.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected as far as size and it took FOREVER to arrive!</li>
            <li> The stitching is crooked but for only a few dollars, it will work for exactly what it is needed for.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the outside pockets seem kind of small, but maybe that is just because I have a larger phone.</li>
            <li> I live the color, It is very pink.</li>
            <li> just not great for huge purses.. it leans and falls</li>
            <li> Delivery was slow, but worth it</li>
            <li> The other side however did, but once I zipped it completely, I realized that now I cannot open it.</li>
            <li> It is very well made and the pink shows up easily in dark purse interiors.</li>
            <li> I think it would be too small for a gym bag or something that large.</li>
            <li> so it will work with large and small bags.</li>
            <li> it took a little longer the normal to receive it in the the mail</li>
            <li> Its really not what i expected i ordered the pink and black color one and the one i got is a light pink with gray the bags and everything is the same..</li>
            <li> Lets see how long it will last me.</li>
            <li> Long lasting!</li>
            <li> yes, it takes a long time for delivery because it comes internationally</li>
            <li> does not give a good discription of what your getting, disappointed</li>
            <li> Maybe all three will be used in my purses, as I don&#x27;t believe that they will last very long.</li>
            <li> The pink is feminine but I might order a darker color next time just in case I would have possible stains from ink or lipstick, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of an expensive handbag line who&#x27;s name is based on a wheeled box pulled by horses.  </li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> This bag is a lot smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> This is smaller than I expected and kinda flimsy.</li>
            <li> It took quite a long time to arrive, but all I can say is, it was wotth</li>
            <li> Quite a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;t smaller than I expected it to be</li>
            <li> Took wayyy to long to get here, I forgot I even bought it.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time.</li>
            <li> Item much smaller than expected, color is lighter than picture, its not black and pink its grey and black.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a little larger option as I use it for the tote bags I bring to work - not my tiny purse.  </li>
            <li> I now want to buy a smaller version for my other purses.  </li>
            <li> This product took a very long time to get to me.</li>
            <li> I have washed this once in cold  water on delicate and then hung to dry with good results.</li>
            <li> I use mine to juggle between 3 diaper bags and its big enough to hold a few packs of wipes and some diapers.</li>
            <li> Size is not what I expected its very very small, It&#x27;s only about 5 inches high and 12 wide , I bought it to hold a binder</li>
            <li> I bought this organizer and it is true-to-color pink and grey.</li>
            <li> I got the pink and grey.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to arrive, and mine already has loose stitching.</li>
            <li> For your smaller, thinner bags, it can snap down to become thinner but still keeps you organized.</li>
            <li> Everything fits, but to the loose structure of the bag and the open middle pocket I&#x27;m not sure yet how well this will work for me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Well, one day a product very similar to this (if not the same thing, I&#x27;m not sure) came into being.  </li>
            <li> small pink on outside gray on inside will use to switch from purse to larger handbag&#x27; 12 slots</li>
            <li> My purse used to be such an unorganized mess.  </li>
            <li> I paid less than $8.00 for this product, which is why I&#x27;m not terribly upset that the item I received was sewn haphazardly.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger, but it&#x27;s about the size of a medium cosmetic bag.  </li>
            <li> I think it should be bigger or at least make the picture smaller.</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these organizers--one in gray and two in pink.</li>
            <li> The two pink ones that I ordered as gifts have yet to arrive, and I&#x27;ve gotten virtually no response from the seller.</li>
            <li> Just as expected for price.  </li>
            <li> This ended up being a lot studier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Even if I could have had an expected arrival at customs and a tracking number for within the US.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> This was not what i expected.</li>
            <li> Made it harder for me to keep organized to find stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in pink to match my 2 tote bags that I would be using it in, but I recieved an orange one....</li>
            <li> I expected to put one in my purse, keep one for traveling, and give one away.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Yes it what I expected</li>
            <li> does not add any extra weight to my already heavy purse.</li>
            <li> - it wasn&#x27;t glaringly obvious and as someone who has sewn before, I know I would have done a far worse job trying to work with nylon/nylon-like fabrics.</li>
            <li> A long time ago, I used small boxes that I would get small items in such as a Tylenol box and such to organize my purse or handbag.  </li>
            <li> I find that I have my items slipping out into the other areas of my handbag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> helpful in organizing my purse and other items</li>
            <li> like but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not what is looks like in picture!</li>
            <li> Nicer than I expected!</li>
            <li> I purchased two and use the other to organize items in my carry on bag when I travel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She bought this bag to keep coupons in, as well as all the other stuff she needs to carry with her</li>
            <li> It seems to be well constructed and I am anxious to see how it holds up with daily use in my bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not a pretty as the picture.</li>
            <li> It takes purses I never used due to lack of pockets and pulled them out of what I thought was permanent retirement.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is a matter of customs from other countries</li>
            <li> Its about a foot wide and half a foot tall and does help keep my purse organized.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal... but just somewhat disappointed that it happened so quickly.  </li>
            <li> above all, it&#x27;s of very low quality, the hand of the bag is broken after a slight pull.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a hard bottom, I inserted a smaller organizer I purchased inside of this one.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose well, but I&#x27;m not sure of the durability in the long run.  </li>
            <li> and you have to find it in the dark cavern that is my purse.  </li>
            <li> As I opened the package, I must say item appeared presentable, it felt soft and had cushioning in between, but when I tried to zip it, one of the teeth was broken, so the zipper didn&#x27;t go all the way.</li>
            <li> It folds down when in the purse.</li>
            <li> It has a slit going down the the side.</li>
            <li> The organizer measures close to an inch taller on one side and gradually slopes down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been down that road and won&#x27;t bother with it again.</li>
            <li> I do home visits as part of my job and often find mysel needing a paperclip or some white-out or some other little piece of office equipment.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these, one I will use for my couponing and the other will be kept in the car to hold my little peoples items.&lt;br /&gt;Great size for purse and car</li>
            <li> With shipping (at the time) it was less than 5.00.</li>
            <li> Purses or tote bags never have enough pickets, and everything ends up all jumbled and difficult to find, so this helps immensely.  </li>
            <li> It is quite roomy, and was less than $4.00, so I will use it till it falls apart.</li>
            <li> There is a slight &#x27;off&#x27; to some of the stitching</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to spend half the day switching things over.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find myself sifting through a disorganized mess.</li>
            <li> The handles are pretty thin and weak.  </li>
            <li> This bag sucks it is to small not big like advertised</li>
            <li> Inside fabric is too loose, so sometimes it is hard to find your items</li>
            <li> The side zippers were sticking a little bit but, have since eased up.</li>
            <li> but I thought it was a little bulky as a purse insert/organizer.  </li>
            <li> Lots of little pockets and zipper areas to organize your purse.</li>
            <li> Picture is larger than actual one, difficult to get in and out of if small purse.</li>
            <li> I can carry it by its little handles wherever I want to sit and put my makeup on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has lots and lots of little compartments.</li>
            <li> Well, this is quite the organizational little gadget.  </li>
            <li> I would either tuck the flaps in or cut them off depending if the box needed a little sturdying up or not.  </li>
            <li> This product takes a little while to arrive because it ships from over seas.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little flimsy, wish it was stiffer material and shipping</li>
            <li> However, while the product I received has all of the features shown in the picture and described, the craftsmanship leaves a little something to be desired.  </li>
            <li> Little flimsy</li>
            <li> Not meant for heavy items, wish the handles were a little longer.</li>
            <li> So I got a pouch with one zipper half way closed and the other completely closed but unable to be opened.</li>
            <li> I have used mine a few times..</li>
            <li> what a waste</li>
            <li> are snaps to keep the organizer narrow, or you can pop the snaps and expand&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now it takes just a few seconds to switch bags and transfer all my things into it.</li>
            <li> Took about a month to arrive and sometimes the plastic zipper gets stuck on itself while zipping it shut, but that&#x27;s not uncommon and its not enough a problem to be a bother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;e been using it for a few weeks now, and I have found that it helps me find my things easier.</li>
            <li> This is waste of money</li>
            <li> Waste of money.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few reviews talking about the quality</li>
            <li> If i&#x27;m on the go and just need to carry a few things.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a few weeks after ordering as mentioned.</li>
            <li> Like i said i thought it would be a bit bigger other than that nothing else is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> i have a lot of purses but HATE changing them because of moving everything and then having to learn where this or that is now that its in a new purse...and with this everything is in the SAME spot every time you change your purse so so convient</li>
            <li> No more messy purse, everything has it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> No more black hole of a purse!</li>
            <li> For the price, this little device CANNOT be beat!  </li>
            <li> There are lots of little pockets here and there for everything!  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as small as it was.</li>
            <li> Not sure I was charged for this</li>
            <li> Too small and waist of my money.</li>
            <li> No more digging to find things in the bottom of my purse.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> So small but took forever to ship over a month and got it zipper started coming unstitched ...and Handel&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> in the small pockets.  </li>
            <li> The tool kit has some screwdrivers, tape measure, and fastening devices to carry around for small jobs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more searching around for the things I need.</li>
            <li> No more having to dump my purse just to find my keys.</li>
            <li> This is kinda small and floppy.  </li>
            <li> No more searching for all the items at the bottom.</li>
            <li> It does its job and has lots of pockets to keep small things in.</li>
            <li> No more digging all over a tote bag for these items.  </li>
            <li> and this organizer was way to small.  </li>
            <li> **! way too small compared to the photo, and</li>
            <li> I decided to just deal with the broken zipper other than having to deal with a return to China.</li>
            <li> The material this is made of is not very good.  </li>
            <li> This is too hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was slow</li>
            <li> It has a very thin sheet of stuffing in each outside wall behind the pockets.</li>
            <li> When it finally came it was in the wrong color!</li>
            <li> No more digging for what I want!</li>
            <li> I like changing my handbag often and usually that would mean accidentally leaving things behind in each bag.  </li>
            <li> but I hate having to fix a new item.  </li>
            <li> But too bad the middle compartment doesn&#x27;t zip.</li>
            <li> But it seemed impossible to track and took a long time to deliver.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the value for the price (to the point I&#x27;m actually worried about the working conditions of the people manufacturing it : ( )</li>
            <li> Not really happy with the product i got from the price i paid for it</li>
            <li> I personally find the handles a bit annoying and am trying to decide whether or not to just cut them off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sewing is poor quality on the exterior.</li>
            <li> Her review:&lt;br /&gt;This is made of thin material like a wind breaker jacket.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, one of the zippers was broken.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Handles too thin.</li>
            <li> Though it is extremely difficult  to unzip or rezip.</li>
            <li> So irritating!</li>
            <li> The purchaser won&#x27;t be sorry they bought this.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color......  </li>
            <li> The picture is deceptive and the bag is useless.</li>
            <li> People thought I was crazy doing that.  </li>
            <li> NOT TO MENTION MY EVERY EXPENSIVE LIPGLOSS AND PAIR OF MY CONTACTS!</li>
            <li> NOT TO BAD</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy it again but for te money it wasn&#x27;t bad!</li>
            <li> I hated this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Much smaller than pictured</li>
            <li> Wish I kept it for myself!</li>
            <li> good one!  good price as well!</li>
            <li> One of the zippers did not work when it arrived.</li>
            <li> good for price. I ordered another one.</li>
            <li> Love my new organzier use it all around the house..thank you</li>
            <li> My planner items fit prefect in this bag. Lightweight! I carry it with me every where.</li>
            <li> Too big for even a large purse. Ended up using it as a make up bag.</li>
            <li> Cheap and super practical. Fits in any middle sized bag, resistant, easy to clean and organize. It&#x27;s padded so things won&#x27;t easily break or squish inside. I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink organizer and have found it incredibly helpful. I do home visits as part of my job and often find mysel needing a paperclip or some white-out or some other little piece of office equipment. This organizer makes it possible to separate personal and work-related items in an organized and effective way. I have washed this once in cold  water on delicate and then hung to dry with good results. There were no signs of fraying or little threads unraveling and the zippers did not buckle and continued to operate smoothly. The pink is feminine but I might order a darker color next time just in case I would have possible stains from ink or lipstick, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> great item that I can change purses easily...and find things quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it - it&#x27;s perfect for my purse</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself and one for my sister as a Christmas gift. I have used mine a few times.. I also coupon and this is perfect for helping me keep organized while changing between a diaper bag and purse :) I love it Lots of pockets more than I expected It is cheap but still durable and giftable. Even though its cheap it will last if you take care of it and not over stuff it. I am totally happy with this and my sister loved it!!  Shipping was much faster than the Est. standard.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as stated, happy with</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> This fits into my tote bag perfectly.  It keeps everything organized.  I no longer have to dig for my keys or my phone.  There&#x27;s a pocket for everything.</li>
            <li> I bought it for couponing organization, works well.</li>
            <li> The insert is too soft and does not hold its shape.  It folds down when in the purse.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as small as it was.</li>
            <li> very usefull when doing project, easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> A great handy product for the price!</li>
            <li> Awesome, shipped quickly and matched description.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very-well made &amp; well thought out. Haven&#x27;t used yet but sure I will like it.</li>
            <li> just as showen works great</li>
            <li> This bag organizer is so cute, and it holds so much stuff. I&#x27;m the most unorganized person and I can finally find all my stuff in my purse. It&#x27;s also excellent for traveling. You can fit stuff in the middle and then there are two zipper compartments to put things that could potentially spill. OR you can put your wallet in there for safe keeping. Shipped relatively quickly for something that was coming from hong kong. It&#x27;s also incredibly cheap, I was about to order them from yesstyle.com and they&#x27;re selling them for $29.99.</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these organizers--one in gray and two in pink. The gray one arrived quickly and is working well for me. The two pink ones that I ordered as gifts have yet to arrive, and I&#x27;ve gotten virtually no response from the seller.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for... Only lasted a couple of weeks before things started coming apart.</li>
            <li> Not sure I was charged for this but I did not receive it and still haven&#x27;t today. Cute Idea. ,</li>
            <li> This bag is a lot smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> perfect for what i need it</li>
            <li> This is very handy especially when it comes to trips. You can only bring so much on a plane so its best you manage to pack it all into one bag.</li>
            <li> really good for the price.  Durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The straps are to flimsy,  the straps broke on the second day that I had it. That&#x27;s pretty much my only issue with the bag.</li>
            <li> Just as expected for price.  Takes a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> Wear easy. Within a yr. It has to go to the  trash can.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Keeps trunk semi  organized</li>
            <li> looks much larger than  it is... and the item they have inside the makes it appear as though its large enough to carry items...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two... what a waste</li>
            <li> Love it! Product is great! Works in most purses! Lots of pockets and room. Will buy more in different colors!</li>
            <li> Yeah baby! This fits perfectly in my handbag and no more embarrassing searches looking for the one thing that&#x27;s always at the bottom.</li>
            <li> wanted for support inside my purse it is a nightmare and flimsy</li>
            <li> Too small and waist of my money. I purchased it for couponing but it is still in the envelope.  Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Very durable and works for my project</li>
            <li> Was very excited about my purchase, but the deliver by date came and went and I still have nothing to show for it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that won&#x27;t show up, unless of course you enjoy doing that, which in that case you can just me some money :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this bag. It has so many different compartments and is easy to store and find things. It works great for my coupon storage and for makeup and travel items. I am absoutely buying a few more.</li>
            <li> I love this bag for my purse! It holds everything in place, in my large purse. I can find all of my things, quickly and easily. It is a great little organizer and you can&#x27;t beat the price! Love it!</li>
            <li> Was not big enough to hold much at all.</li>
            <li> Love this. Excellent especially for price. Simple to move items bag to bag.</li>
            <li> I love the price on it. Got this item at the end of Sep. and now we are in Nov. . It has a slit going down the the side. You get what you pay for! Good Luck!!</li>
            <li> Love the extra space this provides!</li>
            <li> I order these every time they reduce the price---super great for everything from purses to tote bags to diaper bags to cars. Holds way more than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> Good quality and size for the amount of money you pay. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Dissappointing size looks bigger in pics. Not really happy with the product i got from the price i paid for it</li>
            <li> Great ,holds a lot ,nice pink color. Easy to pick out of purse and put into another purse . Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; the delivery was quick also!</li>
            <li> This ended up being a lot studier than I expected. The side zippers were sticking a little bit but, have since eased up. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> in my purse right now love hope they have again</li>
            <li> Picture makes the bag appear to be a lot bigger</li>
            <li> Best thing I have bought for my  purse. If you have any purse that is open in the middle this is a great organizer. It has so many pockets that are different sizes which makes it so easy to put things where you need them. If always has to full length zippers on either side and a open center which can be made into 2 different sizes. I was enjoying mine so much my best friend had to get one and she loves hers too.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome insert!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for all your items to be stored in a purse or bag.  Very cute and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love the color and how it helps keep everything organized in my purse. No more digging to find things in the bottom of my purse. It also makes it easy to change purses. Just take it out and put it in another purse.</li>
            <li> The item itself is absolutely lovely and functional. The delivery is very fast!</li>
            <li> Using it for my art supplies!  Great idea!</li>
            <li> This is a great little bag organizer. Does exactly what I wanted it to do. No more messy purse, everything has it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> I like the bag and it was at a great deal. But it seemed impossible to track and took a long time to deliver. I would have been more at ease if I was able to track it. Even if I could have had an expected arrival at customs and a tracking number for within the US.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised. Fits perfect in purse. Has many compartments and zipper compartments I never noticed when ordering.</li>
            <li> what a great product!! helpful in organizing my purse and other items</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in the console of my car to keep it organized. It was a perfect fit</li>
            <li> Love this purse organizer. Took awhile to arrive but didn&#x27;t mind the wait. It&#x27;s a good quality product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It arrived pretty quickly. Within a week. It is much smaller than I thought it was and doesn&#x27;t look much like the photo advertised. However I do like it and I will be able to use it for my craft organisation. I just wish it were a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> It was cheaply made, but it hasn&#x27;t broken yet. I like it. Lots of pockets and pouches, perfect for makeup.</li>
            <li> This bag sucks it is to small not big like advertised</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Prefect fit for all of my purses..</li>
            <li> Very nice product. You won&#x27;t do better than this for the money. I use it to corral my planner and pens. Works great.</li>
            <li> Love it. Would like to see more sizes 😆</li>
            <li> it wasnt what i thought it would be thought it would actually be somewht big and i havent used yet</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. However, I do not use it as a purse insert, but as a makeup bag. It works perfect for that! The makeup I use all the time I put in the center, the stuff I rarely use I put in the zipper sections and my brushes and such go in the pockets in the front. I even have some of my perfumes in the outside pockets. It is very roomy. I would totally recommend this product and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Very nicely made, good sized, perfect for putting in a large purse or bag.  I also got one in blue.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Very useful. very good quality. Its a space saver.Has so many pockets. Super satisfied. if you like organization, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> ok, wouldn&#x27;t work for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. I am enjoying it so much.&lt;br /&gt;I am getting a lot of use from it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It can fit almost all my purses. This is an amazing buy. you will definitely not regret it. This size is perfect for medium-large size purses. It has 2 cloth handles that allow you to easily slip out the insert &amp; switch it to another. Iloved this so much that I bought one for my mother in law</li>
            <li> this is amazing i love it i use it for couponing and its the best. I take it with me everywhere</li>
            <li> This product took a very long time to get to me. Much longer than I expected. When it finally came it was in the wrong color! But since no one sees it INSIDE my purse I kept it anyway. It doesnt stand up as straight as Id like but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Very roomy, yet compact.  Soft sided for expansion.  Easily inserts into mid to large sized purses.  Would recommend to try</li>
            <li> Strap broke day I got it no use of it it went to trash</li>
            <li> The zippers do not work well. Other wise it seems to work okay. Though it is extremely difficult  to unzip or rezip. It holds quite a bit.</li>
            <li> it looks just like picture, it came quickly. It has lots of pockets for all kinds of things! Might be good to hold small toiletries when traveling too</li>
            <li> work for me, easily change to  other purses or bag.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it was going to be, but super cute and helpful, especially for all my loose papers and coupons!</li>
            <li> This is so very, very light weight that you won&#x27;t even notice it in your handbag.  It is larger than I was expecting but that is ok.  There are lots of outer pockets to store smaller items and a large center space for wallets and such.  Small handles make it easy to remove and I find myself swapping handbags more often since it is so easy and quick to do so; allowing me to enjoy them more.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly!  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it for my big bags!</li>
            <li> i sew for a living and it does hold absolutely every thing great little organizer on ly problem was them handle sewn in side frayed apart in about a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no bigger then a change purse. very disappointed! Absolutely not what is looks like in picture! Totally feel ripped off!!</li>
            <li> Super small but good for in and out coupon runs</li>
            <li> Love this is my purse! Keeps everything organized great product</li>
            <li> Price was good and the idea is great but I thought it was a little bulky as a purse insert/organizer.  I thought this might work okay as it had so many pockets but I didn&#x27;t like the padded zip compartments nor the handles (got in the way).  Not the fault of the seller - just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I own lots of big bags and this insert is perfect to keep everything in place. Plus, when you decide to change bags, all you have to do is take it out and put it on the next one!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the cheap price for what I received, love it. Great for organizing stuff in my purse. Lots of pockets, purses can never have enough pockets.</li>
            <li> Love this pouch its amazing. You can fit so much in there.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!!  I have a purse without compartments and this fits perfectly inside and keeps things organized.</li>
            <li> I love the way it fits inside my purse and it&#x27;s not heavy at all. It&#x27;s lightweight material is durable and the pockets are perfect for holding all my things. The zippers stick a little but other than that it&#x27;s a great piece and I may order another one to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> This Is really nice..to have i will buy more soon. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted and is so easy to change purses now....everything has a place and it organizes more than I expected</li>
            <li> I love this pouch!  Perfect!  I was going to use it for my purse.  I got a purse with lots of pockets while waiting for it to get here.  I use it for makeup now.  All in it&#x27;s own section.</li>
            <li> This is smaller than I expected and kinda flimsy. Won&#x27;t buy it again but for te money it wasn&#x27;t bad!</li>
            <li> It was cute at first and I love to organize, but after less then a week the seams started coming apart and the sides totally ripped! So irritating!</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Nice product, well made, light, durable, fits easily in other bags, holds a lot of items. Would buy again. :)</li>
            <li> This product was just what I was looking for.  I like changing my handbag often and usually that would mean accidentally leaving things behind in each bag.  This is a great way to get organized. Speedy delivery also.</li>
            <li> I have a few Mylinka bags that are beautiful but larger than what I&#x27;m used to carrying.  I like my purse to be organized and this insert is awesome.  So far it has held up nicely and amazingly it holds everything I ever carry.  It sure makes switching purses easy.</li>
            <li> Only got one of three</li>
            <li> Ots ok, not great but it gets the job done. I use it fir couponing. Tge threading is ok, cpuld be so much better.  Lets see how long it will last me.</li>
            <li> This is much smaller than I thought it would be. It is designed to fit inside a small - medium sized purse.</li>
            <li> great quality for the price I paid. I wish I ordered more. Delivery was slow, but worth it</li>
            <li> Tore easily, but I wasn&#x27;t upset since it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> The best eyeshadow!  Long lasting!</li>
            <li> not as big as I thought, but will work it will help organize my purse.. just not what I thought</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this, I carry a large, roomy bag, and this fits perfect, its laege, and not made of cheap plastic, its great, for organization, for a large bag. Its not small, however, it has snaps, to make it smaller, if needed. But I have mine unsnapped. Its worth buying.</li>
            <li> Little and cheap quality</li>
            <li> Nice item to use in your purse or by itself.  Took a while to get here but was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> nice size for in the purse I bought it for.  Quite sturdy especially for the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> it ripped as i took it out of the Packaging, but hey it does the job. Honestly good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these, one I will use for my couponing and the other will be kept in the car to hold my little peoples items.&lt;br /&gt;Great size for purse and car</li>
            <li> Uuumm its nice, I&#x27;m still rocking it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  It keeps everything neat and organized.  It also makes changing purses so easy. Just grab the two loops at the top and pull out.  Love this so much Iordered a second one.</li>
            <li> This was not what i expected. Cheaply made. Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Love it! Seems to be made well with lots of room. Can&#x27;t wait to use it! Nicer than I expected!</li>
            <li> This product is better than expected.  Nice heavy duty zippers and plenty of pockets for all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; we carry.  I like the color too.</li>
            <li> This is so cheaply made I put my stuff in it one morning as I changed purses and when I dropped change down there it all feel out. I looked at to why and the bottom of bag was completely ripped. Not the netting part but the actual bag.</li>
            <li> Decent product; GREAT price. The quality wasn&#x27;t superb, but it&#x27;s functional; and it was very cheap. Over all I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Lots of little pockets and zipper areas to organize your purse. Picture is larger than actual one, difficult to get in and out of if small purse.</li>
            <li> got one for me and one for a friend - great to keep your bag neat and clean</li>
            <li> NEVER EVER BUY THIS IT TAKE FOREVER FOR IT TO GET IT ALSO IT IS MADE OUT OF CHEAP MATERIAL AND THE STRAP OF IT BROKE AND I LOST MY PHONE AND IT GOT STOLEN I ALSO LOST $10 IN MY PHONE CASE NOT TO MENTION MY EVERY EXPENSIVE LIPGLOSS AND PAIR OF MY CONTACTS! DONT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I really love it!!  Great construction, color and it is light weight.  I also love the handles, which makes it easy to switch from one tote to another.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually use it as a purse organizer.  It has plenty of pockets and sits up nicely so I use it as an organizer on my passenger seat in my car.  (I drive a lot for my job so my passenger seat tends to collect work related stuff, pens, snacks, etc).  I purchased two and use the other to organize items in my carry on bag when I travel.</li>
            <li> Nice in large purse - organized</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mom and she loves it. very neat for organizing larger totes or work bags</li>
            <li> These are great when you love you use a big purse.  It keeps everything in place so you do not have to dig constantly for what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.  Great purchase</li>
            <li> Very cute handbag! Using it to carry my coupon file envelopes while I shop! Though it was a little smaller than I expected, still very helpful :)</li>
            <li> It took quite a long time to arrive, but all I can say is, it was wotth the wait!I can put my basics inside, and everytime I change purse, I know I wont forget anyrhing!</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer for your purse.</li>
            <li> So small but took forever to ship over a month and got it zipper started coming unstitched ...and Handel&#x27;s...very cheeply maid wouldn&#x27;t get it ...spend a good amount for one that will last</li>
            <li> Works for what I needed it.  Wish it had a hard bottom, I inserted a smaller organizer I purchased inside of this one.</li>
            <li> While I like having this many-pocketed bag insert, it took forever to ship. It took FOUR weeks to get.  So what if it came from China?  Don&#x27;t most things?  I would have preferred a little larger option as I use it for the tote bags I bring to work - not my tiny purse.  So far, so good though because I know where everything is now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  I am a fan of larger purses, and the one I have been using has no pockets.  This organizes my whole purse.  Would by it over and over!!</li>
            <li> I live the color, It is very pink. It is very well made, It is one of the best buys I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> These are great for gifts or for your own use.  So easy to change purses now...</li>
            <li> My wife can&#x27;t be arsed to write a review, so I&#x27;m doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She bought this bag to keep coupons in, as well as all the other stuff she needs to carry with her when she&#x27;s shopping for deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses the large center area for a little folding divider full of coupons, she keeps pens, highlighter, scissors, paper clips, her keys, etc. in the small pockets.  Her billfold and glasses/sunglasses go in the zippered pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, she&#x27;s fairly happy with it, but she wishes it had a mesh pocket on the side for a water bottle.  She&#x27;ll sew one on sooner or later.</li>
            <li> Product is just as the picture shows, its a bit smaller than what I need for my purse.  I should have read the dimension.... but overall very handy and keeps my purse organized and makes switching purses a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have seen these in avon books for over $10. This is a great item for the price &amp; i don&#x27;t think you could find it anywhere cheaper. I&#x27;m glad that I decided to buy this. I use it for finger nails polish exc. &amp; it wirks perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Good bag, needs longer straps and a way to close the center compartment. Quite a bit smaller than I expected. For the price I will find a use for it.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  It has a pocket for everything I need.  I had a purse with a built in organizer and I loved it.  Now I can change purses with ease and bring everything I need with me in one swoop.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good purse organizer. I love the two zipper compartments. The only complaint I have is the outside pockets seem kind of small, but maybe that is just because I have a larger phone.</li>
            <li> I did not receive it yet.So can rate it yet.Wish I had it because i COULD REALLY USE IT  REALLY NEED IT.</li>
            <li> I received quick delivery and the item was as described.  It is slightly larger than I pictured but that way I can use it in my tote bag for all my extra pens, clips and cords.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Hold a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> Its really not what i expected i ordered the pink and black color one and the one i got is a light pink with gray the bags and everything is the same.. in the picture it looks so cute and it doesnt actually look like that.. but it did organized my purse and i found it helpul..</li>
            <li> I love it and i plan on getting a few more!</li>
            <li> small pink on outside gray on inside will use to switch from purse to larger handbag&#x27; 12 slots</li>
            <li> Received it in a timely manner.  Not meant for heavy items, wish the handles were a little longer.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase - this has done wonders for me being able to find things quickly in my purse.  I am amazed at how much easier it is now.</li>
            <li> I really liked it. It fit into my purse perfectly. Pink is my favorite color and the purse I bought it for is fuchsia.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to zip up and not be opened on the top. I also thought it would be bigger</li>
            <li> these are awesome for our bags, should have got more</li>
            <li> just as stated!  love it, will use as a coupon organizer, great asset to my many other organizers.  thank you!</li>
            <li> actually this was given as part of a gift and the recipient is quite happy with it. she likes it.</li>
            <li> Came on the day it was promised. It was exactly as they advertised it. Good size, can be compact Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received this item exactly as it is shown on the picture. No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Nice bag for the price. Would buy again,</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, I should have ordered more.</li>
            <li> It does keep things organized, but makes my purse heavier now.</li>
            <li> It was fine but way too small for my purse.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price</li>
            <li> It looks large enough to fit a coupon binder inside but it is not. It is about a 1/4 of the size.</li>
            <li> But too bad the middle compartment doesn&#x27;t zip. It&#x27;s a nice traveling bag, the sides do zipped so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I love these!  They take forever to ship here from China, but they are awesome.  I use one as a makeup case, one as an artists box, and one as a tool tote (totally girly though).  I cut a piece of cardboard to fit in the bottom so the insert sits up on its own and put anything I want in it.&lt;br /&gt;  The inside holds my makeup, while in the outside pockets, the makeup brushes and tubes of eyeliner and mascara stand upright.  I can carry it by its little handles wherever I want to sit and put my makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;  The inside of my artist&#x27;s box holds tubes of paint and I have brushes organized in the side pockets with the bristles up so they don&#x27;t get smooshed.&lt;br /&gt;  The tool kit has some screwdrivers, tape measure, and fastening devices to carry around for small jobs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never actually inserted one in my purse or tote, but you can do that too.  I love these!</li>
            <li> Because I carry a big purse it&#x27;s perfect.  Lots of pockets for your make up, I even put my cell phone in the outside pocket. It works great.</li>
            <li> Overall happy with the purchase. Though one of the zipper started gettin stuck not long after I had received it.</li>
            <li> I put everything in this bag including my wallet and then just stick in my purse. this makes it a lot easier to find stuff like my glasses or pen. I don&#x27;t have to reach down searching in my purse because everything is easy to access.  I highly recommend this product 100%!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Gave the extra one to my friend and.shes thrilled too. Everyone with these large bags or totes without dividers need one of these. Price is right also</li>
            <li> Perfect for my supplies.  I wish it had a longer carrying strap, but i really do like all the different compartments.</li>
            <li> Great for my diaper bag to keep my personal stuff separate from the baby stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product ! Works great for a lot of things. Use one for make up. Use one for stuff around the house. Use one for your purse. Great for every thing! Organize and lots of room I it. You will be impressed . J</li>
            <li> It works for what I needed it for but you can tell it is made very cheap fits everything neat and orderly</li>
            <li> I have just about everything I have in my purse in this organizer.  Which makes it very easy to change purses.  I really love the convienence.</li>
            <li> I really like the bag. I use to for my nail products and it is very spacious and everything fits.</li>
            <li> Took about a month to receive but I am very happy with this product! I plan on using it as a mothers day present for my mom.. She is a Real Estate Agent and always has lots of papers and objects floating around her big bag... i am sure she will love it!</li>
            <li> Loved this however my only complaint was that the handles are coming unattached the more I use it. I have had this product for about a year, and washed it too. Love how easy it makes transferring bags</li>
            <li> Looks exactly what it is! I use it as a makeup bag. Love it so much bought 4 more in different colors! Great bag to organize beauty products</li>
            <li> My opinion on this organizer is mixed.&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;has a place for everything&lt;br /&gt;the colors are cool&lt;br /&gt;it is very simple to pull out and put in another handbag&lt;br /&gt;there are snaps to keep the organizer narrow, or you can pop the snaps and expand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad&lt;br /&gt;not a fan of the handles to pull it out.They don&#x27;t really tuck in well. I personally find the handles a bit annoying and am trying to decide whether or not to just cut them off.&lt;br /&gt;it does have a lot of pockets for storage, but the nylon does not seem to hold items in place. I find that I have my items slipping out into the other areas of my handbag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my opinion is: if there was a way to combine this organizer and the Kangaroo Keeper that would make the ideal organizer.</li>
            <li> For the price, this little device CANNOT be beat!  Wishing I would have bought more than one.  Only downside was it took almost 1 month to arrive...</li>
            <li> Love my little purse organizer, it&#x27;s easy to switch our purses without have to reorganize everything :)</li>
            <li> The bag is just the right size for putting in  my purse. I like the pockets and organizing ability but do not like the plastic zippers.</li>
            <li> Very good item for 3$. Use it to put my lotions in. Very handy! Would like a couple more for crafts and such!</li>
            <li> This organizer is very spacious. It material is strong and fit many things! very good for my big bags. Great</li>
            <li> i love all the pockets and compartments..I&#x27;ve had it for months and it is still holding up ..just not great for huge purses.. it leans and falls</li>
            <li> Turned the giant pile of &#x27;stuff&#x27; at the bottom of my work bag into a neatly organized area.  No more digging for what I want!</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller (which could be a good thing) than I thought.  I still will use it.  It has lots and lots of little compartments.</li>
            <li> i thought it was bigger thsn it is, but i like it nonetheles and it serves its purpose. it&#x27;s roomy too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Cosmetic organizer and saw this one. It was inexpensive and I got it mainly for that reason, plus it looked like it had a lot of pockets.&lt;br /&gt;It took forever to arrive! Once I got it I took my time trying to organize all my make-up into it, I&#x27;m an organized person but cluttered, so I was looking for easy here. Everything fits, but to the loose structure of the bag and the open middle pocket I&#x27;m not sure yet how well this will work for me when I travel. I will say everything is easily reached and I can see where it all is. It&#x27;s all got a separate pocket where it belongs, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who is constantly chaining purses. She loves it and nothing else matters.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for a couponer like me!</li>
            <li> Being a female with a lot of purses and one who likes to switch them out from time to time; this has made it easier to transfer from to another.</li>
            <li> Makes changing bags very easy, love it.</li>
            <li> Love the bag, it has a lot of pockets and room for my stuff, but the handles broke on day 2 of use, which makes it a little harder to grab it out of my big bag &amp; go. Overall a nice bag, will have to work on sewing the handles on a little better.</li>
            <li> This is the purchase I was waiting for!!!! I love it love it love it!!!! It will make my transition easier from bag to bag!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love these pink bags</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my Purse Organizer.  I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these for quite sometime but never wanted to spend the high amount on one.  When I saw the great price being offer for this one I jumped on the deal and bought this one for me and another for my daughter in-law.  These are great to use either in your purse or by it&#x27;s self as a coupon holder when I&#x27;m shopping.</li>
            <li> Have ordered several of these for myself and for gifts. They&#x27;re very useful and well made!</li>
            <li> Size is not what I expected its very very small, It&#x27;s only about 5 inches high and 12 wide , I bought it to hold a binder and there&#x27;s no way .</li>
            <li> i know i didnt read how big the bag was cause when i got it i thought it e alot bigger then it actualy was .but its still a nice bag ty have a great day</li>
            <li> I love staying organized. This keeps my bigger bags perfectly organized. No more searching around for the things I need. Now it takes just a few seconds to switch bags and transfer all my things into it. I love all the compartments! Different sizes, some with zippers. For your smaller, thinner bags, it can snap down to become thinner but still keeps you organized. I cant recommend this product enough. No more endless searching in those big bags, keeping everything secure and right where I want it is such a time saver!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of a budgeting page on FaceBook. With shipping (at the time) it was less than 5.00. If you can catch it at the same price I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great concept and I was excited to get it.  Problem was that after only 2 weeks of use, the stitching came apart and the bag was no longer useful.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> it is good quality but the size is not good for a purse</li>
            <li> Well, this is quite the organizational little gadget.  My purse is known as &amp;#34;the abyss,&amp;#34; any and all help was welcomed!&lt;br /&gt;It has many pockets and sections for organizing everything.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is being to find my phone!!</li>
            <li> This really is just to flimsy and to many pockets and stuff.  Made it harder for me to keep organized to find stuff.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail, very excited. As I opened the package, I must say item appeared presentable, it felt soft and had cushioning in between, but when I tried to zip it, one of the teeth was broken, so the zipper didn&#x27;t go all the way. The other side however did, but once I zipped it completely, I realized that now I cannot open it. It is stuck. Ugh! So I got a pouch with one zipper half way closed and the other completely closed but unable to be opened.</li>
            <li> helps me stay more than organized</li>
            <li> look exactly like the picture , great product.</li>
            <li> Easily moves between bags and stores many things well. Took about a month to arrive and sometimes the plastic zipper gets stuck on itself while zipping it shut, but that&#x27;s not uncommon and its not enough a problem to be a bother. I use mine to juggle between 3 diaper bags and its big enough to hold a few packs of wipes and some diapers.</li>
            <li> Love this organizer for all my bottomless hobo bags.  I simply pull it out and drop it in when I want to change my purse.  Wish it had more structure to the sides to keep it from being flimsy once it is down inside your purse.  Nice size side pockets that fit my iPod and phone.  Nice hide away zipper compartments for spare keys, coupons, etc.</li>
            <li> This is very handy and very useful to have.  I&#x27;d recommed for people who have tote bags to keep 1-2 of these at hand in their closets.  I bought this organizer and it is true-to-color pink and grey. It&#x27;s durable and I really can&#x27;t compliment this organizer enough.  I use it to carry a large NKJ Bible (not being pompous, just wanting you to know the capacity of this organizer) and notebook to church with my pens, highlighters, etc., with so much room for anything extra I stuff in it in the course of the day. It is highly durable and the zippers are strong and reliable.  The purchaser won&#x27;t be sorry they bought this.</li>
            <li> Finally, everything in my purse is organized! I love that I can switch purses so quickly and easily! Better yet, it doesn&#x27;t matter which purse I use everything is always in exactly the same spot!</li>
            <li> This came a lot sooner then expected and is great.  I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Cool purse organizer! A pocket for everything and keeps my purse from becoming this bottomless pit of junk I have to dig through overtime I am looking for something.</li>
            <li> I carry many things in my purse so decided to order this to organize everything.  The idea behind this product is great; however, I wish this would last longer.  The handles fell off after about two weeks of use.  The sewing is poor quality on the exterior. The zipper broke after about a week.  I wish this would be better quality because I definitely need an organizer for my purse.  I did like the idea of having everything in this purse organizer because it is easier to change all my belongings from one purse to another.</li>
            <li> came fast and you see what you get! I use it and love it! I going to buy another one in blue! And the price is great!</li>
            <li> A long time ago, I used small boxes that I would get small items in such as a Tylenol box and such to organize my purse or handbag.  I would either tuck the flaps in or cut them off depending if the box needed a little sturdying up or not.  People thought I was crazy doing that.  Well, one day a product very similar to this (if not the same thing, I&#x27;m not sure) came into being.  My daughter told me about it.  I did not purchase anything as my boxes were working pretty good.  Eventually, my boxes started weakening so I thought I would go ahead and buy one of these to test out since the cost isn&#x27;t too much to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think it is a personal preference as to whether a person will like one of these or not.  The handles are pretty thin and weak.  However, you shouldn&#x27;t need to use them too often.  It is a good thing the handles aren&#x27;t a necessity as one of mine ripped out from the nylon lining the 2nd time that I handled it.  Maybe it was the 1st time but I noticed it had happened on the 2nd time I went to pull it out to find something.  This item tends to be floppier in my purse than I would like and if you don&#x27;t have the items in it balanced out by weight, the insert just tips over if it is in a purse that is too large for the insert or when you pull it out of your bag to look for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely worth the money to give it a shot to see if you like it or not.  I really like all the pockets that it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I have started saving up my vitamin &amp; Tylenol type boxes again.  Somehow, the boxes seem to work better for me.  I don&#x27;t know how they stand up any better than this insert does, but they seemed to.</li>
            <li> This bag is the perfect size. I mostly use these to carry my coupon albums. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Small..not what I imagined!</li>
            <li> Purchased the inserts to use for my coupons.  Thought it would be a little bigger but was pleased nonetheless.  I am able to put at least 3 coupon holders in it with ease.  I purchased 2 to that I could give to a friend.  Next time, I would make sure to purchase a larger one.</li>
            <li> Zipper does not work well.  But it was such a low price that I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> This product takes a little while to arrive because it ships from over seas. However, it ships quickly and arrives in a reasonable amount of time. The price is good and it is a great way to organize your stuff. I am a nursing student and purchased mine to store all of my clinical/lab supplies. It has tons of inner and outer pockets. I love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this. Her review:&lt;br /&gt;This is made of thin material like a wind breaker jacket. It has a very thin sheet of stuffing in each outside wall behind the pockets. For the price of this item it is well worth the money and actually better quality than I expected. It seems to be well constructed and I am anxious to see how it holds up with daily use in my bag. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap organization solution for the purse. It is good size for an average sized purse. I think it would be too small for a gym bag or something that large.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these for gifts. They did arrive within the time frame stated. They were packaged properly. The product itself does not look as good as the picture. It was either someone&#x27;s first attempt at sewing or they just didn&#x27;t care what the finished product looked like. The stitching isn&#x27;t straight, they had difficulty with thread tension, and fabric is uneven. On other sites these retail for around $40 for the exact same product. They even use the same photo. I would have  been furious to pay that kind of money for so poor of a product. As it is these were cheap and will hopefully serve their purpose. I won&#x27;t be gifting these though. Save your money and sew your own.</li>
            <li> This always have all of my stuff organize, I can find everything when I need it! It is the best thing i have bought</li>
            <li> too handy! I love it! I change my purse in 3 seconds!</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color......  I ordered this in pink to match my 2 tote bags that I would be using it in, but I recieved an orange one....&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it serves it&#x27;s purpose, for the price.  I&#x27;t smaller than I expected it to be, it&#x27;s a little flimsy, wish it was stiffer material and shipping took a while but it does come from China so that&#x27;s understandable.</li>
            <li> Cute and easy to open, lots of storage for such a little bag.  Perfect for my &amp;#34;in car&amp;#34; travel needs.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! It cost only $3.48 including shipping, that&#x27;s nuts. It is absolutely perfect! There are so many pockets, spaces, 2 zippered pockets and it hold everything!! I put my wallet &amp; agenda in the large middle slot where the handles are, my lipstick and lip glosses in 2 outer slots, compact mirror in one of the nets, my 2 mineral face mists in another slot, large body spray &amp; lotion in the middle and a ton of other stuff and I still have space and haven&#x27;t used the zipper pockets yet. It takes a while to get to you because it comes from china but it&#x27;s worth the wait for sure. There are snaps on both ends so you can make it smaller or larger. It&#x27;s inside my Louis Vuitton Cabas mezzo and fits perfectly with room still on both sides of the inside of my bag so it will work with large and small bags. A must buy ladies!</li>
            <li> Great product; arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Love the bag! Took awhile to get is the only reason for the four star rating.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger, but it&#x27;s about the size of a medium cosmetic bag.  It&#x27;s also not a pretty as the picture.</li>
            <li> My purse used to be such an unorganized mess.  I carry everything except the kitchen sink.  This organizer is the perfect size for my purse.  Has plenty pockets to store all your items nicely.  No more having to dump my purse just to find my keys.</li>
            <li> Love this it has so many more pockets then It seems like it does in the picture!!! Also the pink is pretty!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Quality is nice and fits well inside my purses.</li>
            <li> Very usable during my couponing. A great organizer.</li>
            <li> love using this for scrapbooking!!</li>
            <li> Great product . Was very small that originally thought .</li>
            <li> Not what I expected as far as size and it took FOREVER to arrive!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good product</li>
            <li> This is kinda small and floppy.  I would want something like this if it was supported better and stood up straight in my purse so I could put something in easiley.  This is too hard to use.  finding a place to put something while on the go should be simpler.  You have to stop and try to find a slot you can spread apart  and put your item in without it collapsing.  I just didn&#x27;t like using it at all.</li>
            <li> Great design, just wish it was a little larger.</li>
            <li> The picture makes the bag look bigger but when it came in the mail, it was a lot smaller. I use it all the time, I love it. I think it should be bigger or at least make the picture smaller.</li>
            <li> A great item to sort items in my large purses.  I now want to buy a smaller version for my other purses.  It is very well made and the pink shows up easily in dark purse interiors.</li>
            <li> My purse is forever organized!</li>
            <li> For $3.99 plus free shipping, I&#x27;m not complaining.  It fits what I need to carry along with me each day, has a load of pockets on either side, plus the center compartment along with the two side zipper top compartments.  One zipper gets stuck each time I use it, so that would be why I&#x27;m giving this three out of five stars.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty color, large enough for everything I use daily, and easy to use.  This makes pocketbook-switching a snap.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a stocking gift and it seems to be a convenient way to organize your purse . The receiver was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is super nice for having more pockets and some organization for your purse. Lots of pockets and 2 zipper sections, plus the main compartment.</li>
            <li> The stitching is crooked but for only a few dollars, it will work for exactly what it is needed for. This is to be my bath accessories bag for a trip to Japan and with all the small separate compartments, on the outside, it&#x27;s perfect and the inside is big enough for my travel towel and hair towel!!</li>
            <li> I guess for the price it&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s a little cheap looking.  Kinda puffy like a winter jacket.  But it serves its purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a nylon handbag insert.  It has various pockets and zippers. Yes, all of this apparent from the picture.  However, while the product I received has all of the features shown in the picture and described, the craftsmanship leaves a little something to be desired.  I paid less than $8.00 for this product, which is why I&#x27;m not terribly upset that the item I received was sewn haphazardly.  The organizer measures close to an inch taller on one side and gradually slopes down.  The seams are at first glance are adequate, but I&#x27;m not sure how well they will hold given there appears to have been some issues with thread tension when the item was assembled.  It serves its purpose well, but I&#x27;m not sure of the durability in the long run.  Overall I&#x27;m happy,especially considering the item arrived almost two weeks ahead of the shipping estimate.  Just beware, if you&#x27;re paying more than a few dollars for this item or you&#x27;re expecting a heavy duty, will take a beating, and looks like a designer insert, you&#x27;re better off making your own or finding one you&#x27;re willing to pay more for.</li>
            <li> Well Made, does the job. terrific price.  Excellent service</li>
            <li> Took wayyy to long to get here, I forgot I even bought it. It suprisedme when it finally got here. When it got here it was a.little flimay for my taste...but it was. heap so what can I say.</li>
            <li> The material this is made of is not very good.  The seams are separating and the fabric is fraying</li>
            <li> This is so easy to move things from one bag to another- and keep it all together and organized.  Purses or tote bags never have enough pickets, and everything ends up all jumbled and difficult to find, so this helps immensely.  I liked mine so much I bought more for friends at Christmas.</li>
            <li> Loved it . Perfect for a little extra carry around bag</li>
            <li> Works as intended and advertised</li>
            <li> I change purse a lot and this is perfect for placing all of my things neatly and organized in one place. I just pull it out of one purse and put it in another. No more searching for all the items at the bottom. I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, very handy everytime Im in a hurry to change into a different bag.</li>
            <li> I go from my boyfriends house to my house a lot so this is really great to have all my makeup and face wash and stuff that i need.</li>
            <li> Worked just as it says it would. Shipping took a long time.</li>
            <li> These are great. This is my second one. Lots and lots of room and really light.</li>
            <li> love this product. i highly recommend to any women out there who uses a big bag.  it took a little longer the normal to receive it in the the mail but it was worth the wait. this thing makes it so much easier to carry everything and organize my purse.</li>
            <li> This is great!  There are lots of little pockets here and there for everything!  It appears very sturdy.  I&#x27;e been using it for a few weeks now, and I have found that it helps me find my things easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold all of my planner stuff. When it arrived, one of the zippers was broken. I didn&#x27;t bother me too much because I wasn&#x27;t planning on putting much in there to begin with and the zipper on the opposite side was fine and worked well. I decided to just deal with the broken zipper other than having to deal with a return to China. I&#x27;ve been down that road and won&#x27;t bother with it again. Shipping was slow but I wasn&#x27;t complaining about that because it was free and I knew it was coming from China. Expect to get it about 3 weeks after ordering. It has been handy for holding my planner things and goes in and comes out easily from the bag I keep it in. It does its job and has lots of pockets to keep small things in.</li>
            <li> I use this bag for work now it&#x27;s perfect fits all the little things I need and is easy to carry around. Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I love it. It is so easy to find stuff now. I don&#x27;t have to dig around. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great for organizing material in your purse. It is very cheap too!</li>
            <li> This is a convenient bag for everything.  I holds all my items, especially my makeup</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought it would  be....but works out ok for the price and no shipping fees.</li>
            <li> My 2 years old son can&#x27;t even play with it.... It&#x27;s super small...... I won&#x27;t recommended EVER again!!!! This is waste of money</li>
            <li> Its amazing. Love it. It work for what i wanted out for.  I&#x27;m going to order 3 more for other things.</li>
            <li> the only thing is I think the handles r a bit too short but other than that I love them</li>
            <li> Awesome. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Was exactly what I expected. Helps me organize things iny purse. Delivery took longer than I expected but was worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased when I got these in the mail. They were even better than I had expected them to be!</li>
            <li> I use this organizer in several tote bags to organize my leather calendar, pens, makeup, and cell phones.  No more digging all over a tote bag for these items.  Great invention!  Sturdy material, easy to use pockets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  okay...but wish it had stiffer sides. Kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it. I did this review last night!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing is awsome perfect for travel!! I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my honeymoon to make it easier to organize everything for the plane!</li>
            <li> Very deceiving,From the photo it makes you think you can hold lots of things in it. But it is SUPER tiny. Totally not what I was expecting. You can barely fit anything in it. Waste of money.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this because it just doesn&#x27;t stay upright well. I wish it were firmer. Also, doesn&#x27;t fit in my purse well and my purse is medium-sized.</li>
            <li> Nice but handles r not lo g enough</li>
            <li> Love it to organize my coupons but has fallen apart already</li>
            <li> I need one of these for every purse I own. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. It takes purses I never used due to lack of pockets and pulled them out of what I thought was permanent retirement. You MUST own one - it makes the unusable turn into FAVORITE bags!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome bag and very well made! I really carry this bag nearly every where I go and has plenty of storage for all kinds of things!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy, good seller, I will buy another time</li>
            <li> Cheap, not good for big purses. Material is cheap. Works ok for small to medium purses. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this bag I would love to get this bag again my friends love it to they want one</li>
            <li> Ordered Jan 5th and still not received.  They did give refund.  Maybe it is a matter of customs from other countries but I do like being told I have give a 5 star.  I live in the US where we have to earn a 5 star.</li>
            <li> This bag was not the right size for my small gym bag. The sizing is my own fault though for making a guess on sizing. The product itself matches the picture in color and design. IT is durable and has plenty of organizing pockets, so I now use it in my purse. Its about a foot wide and half a foot tall and does help keep my purse organized. It arrived on time and I have had no problems with the product.</li>
            <li> This had so many uses. I personally used it to put my coupons in. I was able to either put it in my purse or carry as is.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to arrive, and mine already has loose stitching. It is quite roomy, and was less than $4.00, so I will use it till it falls apart.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this bag! Its perfect for my coupons! Holds more than I expected and the little front pockets are great for pens scissors stapler etc. It could be used for many different things but this is what I chose to use it for :)</li>
            <li> I think I can sum it up...for the price it is a wonderful product...this can be used for ANYTHING and that is the beauty of the product!...yes, it takes a long time for delivery because it comes internationally and it is free shipping...I think too many people have a rich mans appetite on a poor mans budget, or something like that?...what do you people expect for the price???...I think it is awesome for the price...it looks better than a plastic bag and has so many organized pockets!...I would highly recommend this for what it is, a simple inexpensive way of organizing any objects...I use a couple in my bathroom for storing all my facial products together and another for makeup...nice for your purse and travel too.</li>
            <li> great for a women who like to switch purses just put your belongings in the handbag insert. pull your insert out of one purse and place inside another purse an go.easy as 1,2,3.</li>
            <li> I can put everything in here I need and now I can change purses whenever the mood strikes me and in seconds.</li>
            <li> Nice handbag insert.  Lots of pouches and pockets.  I have had mine for 8 months and has held up very well.  Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!  I have never given a review, but this company deserves the praise.  I feel that I got exactly what a was looking for at a great price!</li>
            <li> Love it, can find it easy because of the pink!  Shipped very fast.  Holds all of my &amp;#34;gadgets&amp;#34; in my purse, easy to find</li>
            <li> Well made. Bigger than I expected, but still fits in my purse and sure solves the problem of where to put your pen. Everything I have stands up where I can just pick it out of my purse. I don&#x27;t change purses, but if you did...this would be a life saver. Hard-working product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this item it is great and useful  I rated it 5 because the use I get with it</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product and it helps with organizing my purse, however, part of the seam edging along the top of the mesh pockets has come undone leaving the raw edge exposed.  Not a big deal... but just somewhat disappointed that it happened so quickly.  I still like the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered a different color but I still love it. You have room for just about everything. It also arrived sooner than stated.</li>
            <li> I like the prduct&#x27;s design.I am able to use it for what I intended it for. It helps with organization.</li>
            <li> the best thing ever!!</li>
            <li> i have a lot of purses but HATE changing them because of moving everything and then having to learn where this or that is now that its in a new purse...and with this everything is in the SAME spot every time you change your purse so so convient</li>
            <li> This is a very good item. It fits nicely in any of my bags and since i do change purses a good deal, it is super easy to just pick it up and place in whatever bag i choose that day. The zippers do get a little stuck but fixes easily</li>
            <li> I am giving these as gifts this year and everyone is loving them so far.&lt;br /&gt;Love all the color options</li>
            <li> larger than I thought -fits in my tote perfect-made very well-love the larger zippers so much easier to use-holds more than I thought it would-perfect for my suitcase as well -will be ordering more as gifts-also want a few for craft and sewing supplies-need another one for bathroom -don&#x27;t pass this up -don&#x27;t be fooled by price it&#x27;s an awesome organizer</li>
            <li> Very fast ship. Color as described. Picture is somewhat deceptive I don&#x27;t believe I could hold a book as pictures inside the middle flap. The handles are flimsy. Overall you could lose this in a large bag.</li>
            <li> does not give a good discription of what your getting, disappointed</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my sister-in-law and she loves it! I can&#x27;t wait to get one for my diaper bag and my purse!</li>
            <li> Looks pretty good in person in comparison to the picture.</li>
            <li> I like and if helps keeps my purse organized but it has to go in a purse it is not as big as I thought so it doesn&#x27;t hold more, in fact it holds less then my purse but it does the job</li>
            <li> SMALLER THAN I TOUGHT BUT I LIKE IT... size looks bigger in pics NOT TO BAD AT ALL it will work for keeping track of all my stuff while at the beach and out of the bottom of my bag.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of an expensive handbag line who&#x27;s name is based on a wheeled box pulled by horses.  What I don&#x27;t love about their bags is they generally only come with two small and one zip pocket.  I lose everything in even their smallest bags.  This organizer is perfect.  I love how it keeps everything right where I put it and its no longer a chore to switch bags on a whim.</li>
            <li> I use this to carry my coupon stuff in while I am out doing my coupons&lt;br /&gt;I love it it has lots of room so before I leave the house I pack it for what I need for that day</li>
            <li> I love it, it came with free shipping so it took forever to actually get here.  It was cool. Im in no rush BUT when I got it the handle came undone almost on the second time I used it.  I love the idea of it but I hate having to fix a new item.  I did but i think that is kind of bogus.  I would give it a try because it is really handy.</li>
            <li> Love these bags. Multipurpose. Have ordered several</li>
            <li> It took a while to get here.  Mine looks exactly like the picture  but the purse i bought this for is a large purse and this organizer was way to small.  No tearing or anything like that.  Overall good product.  It is now just used for a smaller purse,  perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Will definitely help me keep my purse more organized. I love how many pockets it has. Love the zippers too.</li>
            <li> I like this insert but it doesn&#x27;t fit into most of my purses, it is quite large. It was a good price and it is well made so I didn&#x27;t mind that it took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> This works great for keeping everything organized in my bags. Even transfers easy from bag to bag!</li>
            <li> Perfect as a cosmetic bag for home!</li>
            <li> I bought three of these.  I expected to put one in my purse, keep one for traveling, and give one away.  When they arrived I was pleased to see the size of these.  There is more room than in a previous similar organizer that is sold by a home party purse company.&lt;br /&gt;The first time that I unsnapped one of these it broke and they aren&#x27;t made of a very good quality fabric.  Maybe all three will be used in my purses, as I don&#x27;t believe that they will last very long.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Yes it what I expected</li>
            <li> Great item! I love it. Took a while and had wish there was a tracking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few reviews talking about the quality so I&#x27;ll try to update as I use this. I&#x27;ve had it about a week now and so far it&#x27;s perfect. Yes. There is a slight &#x27;off&#x27; to some of the stitching but I had to really look for it - it wasn&#x27;t glaringly obvious and as someone who has sewn before, I know I would have done a far worse job trying to work with nylon/nylon-like fabrics. So the stitching isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker for me. There are more pockets than I actually need, I&#x27;d totally missed the snaps on the ends so that was a very pleasant surprise, helping this organizer fit into my thinner bags. Will come back to review it again after a month or so of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a little while to get, but it was worth it! Couldn&#x27;t beat the value for the price (to the point I&#x27;m actually worried about the working conditions of the people manufacturing it : ( )</li>
            <li> No more black hole of a purse! Everything now has it&#x27;s own spot and I don&#x27;t find myself sifting through a disorganized mess. I felt like Mary Poppins with a purse that had no bottom. The gadget keeps my purse organized and makes switching purses a breeze!</li>
            <li> s***! way too small compared to the photo, and above all, it&#x27;s of very low quality, the hand of the bag is broken after a slight pull.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM, JUST WHAT YOU SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE. USE MINE DAILY. And the price was great also..</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer.  It&#x27;s very helpful in keeping things where you want them.  It is fairly large so it would not fit into smaller purses, but is best for the larger bags.  I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Love my bag. I use it every time I go shopping.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality. I&#x27;ve read some reviews that the material was cheap, but I disagree. I got the pink and grey.</li>
            <li> Works great I love it.</li>
            <li> The product is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I couldn&#x27;t fit a binder in it.  It&#x27;s tiny,  maybe good for a make up bag.</li>
            <li> Lots of pockets for organizing</li>
            <li> I have a few of these and keep getting more. They are great for traveling and throwing in a purse or backpack. They actually hold a lot with two zipper compartments and a large center with lots of pockets on the sides  My husband uses them on trips to keep things separated.</li>
            <li> medium size - I use it in my diaper bag and it&#x27;s great. I especially love the zippered pockets in it.</li>
            <li> wow, now I can switch purses quickly.</li>
            <li> As described and works well as a purse insert.</li>
            <li> This is nice and big fits inside my purse and has oodles of pockets for everything.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Use it every day</li>
            <li> Inside fabric is too loose, so sometimes it is hard to find your items</li>
            <li> this is great, hold 3 coupons file folders.  I love it.</li>
            <li> NICE FOR MY TABLET/KINDLE AND CHARGER</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quilted and it makes it a little thick but otherwise, pretty nice</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t have handle and was way smaller then I would have ever thought was the size of my wallet</li>
            <li> I used this to organize my work bag and ordered one for my friend and she loves it just as much as I do</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> So, I originally bought this bag for couponing. Now I use it for everything. If i&#x27;m on the go and just need to carry a few things. When it&#x27;s that time of the month and  I need to carry my feminine products. It&#x27;s wide in the center (see Pics) but also has a large zipper compartment on either side as well as many small compartments on both sides It&#x27;s a great bag and has held up very well. I think it&#x27;s been almost 2 years since I bought it and it&#x27;s still in great condition,</li>
            <li> nice and would buy agin</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this bag! I take it w/ me everywhere. It has a lot of pockets which helps keep me organized.</li>
            <li> this took a long time to show up, but I was pleased with its size and the number of pockets. Now i can easily find things in my purse and changing purses to match my outfit is no longer a chore.</li>
            <li> Would give this a 0.  Poor quality.  Ripped in no time at all just sitting in purse.</li>
            <li> i love the color i cant wait for it to be here on the 16th of march 2015:)</li>
            <li> Great purse organizer perfect size and lightweight. Would buy this again. Nice and friendly vendor. Thanks</li>
            <li> I thought this qould be a great way to change purses quickly, but it seems like it is harder for me to find anything.  I think I just need a better purse.</li>
            <li> I hated this product. It took forever to arrive &amp; when I put my items in it; both handles broke. Will never order anything from China again.</li>
            <li> I received this bag on time and with great expectation.  I have always been a lots of pockets purse person but my sister bought me a fantastic hand-made bohemian type hobo bag that works great with my wheelchair.  Problem, just one big pocket and I can never find anything.  This bag is the answer to that.  It is fairly large so you would need a large purse to use it in,, but it has all the pockets and places you could need and can be lifted out by the handles when you just throw something in because you don&#x27;t have the patience right now to put it back where it goes and you have to find it in the dark cavern that is my purse.  It can also cause run-on sentences.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for organizing a large purse and for quickly and easily switching between purses. I like that it has two zippered pockets and several external pockets to hold a cell phone, lipstick, pens, etc. Now items that normally get lost at the bottom of the purse are easy to find.</li>
            <li> Holds up much better than expected.</li>
            <li> This item was as advertised. Little flimsy but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Love this organizer.  It keeps my purse organized.  Arrived in a few weeks after ordering as mentioned.</li>
            <li> I actually bought two of these, and they both are really great. This pink one is great, and it has a lot of pockets and storage. It is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I change purses all the time, all I have to do is pick it up and put it in the new purse. everything is in it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Fits great in my purse and easy to use, tons of storage. does not add any extra weight to my already heavy purse.</li>
            <li> Looks like a nice size work bag, but in reality, it is a make up size bag.  The picture is deceptive and the bag is useless.</li>
            <li> its so helpful took a while to get to me tho</li>
            <li> It worked as expected and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Item much smaller than expected, color is lighter than picture, its not black and pink its grey and black. Overall product good, but wish it was bigger</li>
            <li> Has enough pockets to keep me satisfied and I can just grab the loops pull it out and insert it into another purse so I don&#x27;t have to spend half the day switching things over.</li>
            <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose.  Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Wifey now has a lot of room as a coupon holder</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! Easy to move from purse to purse or tote.</li>
            <li> Like i said i thought it would be a bit bigger other than that nothing else is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for organizing my make-up, for travel &amp; home.</li>
            <li> Received faster then expected and looks great but made cheaply, one pocket had the edging come off on the 2nd day I had it, otherwise it works great I love all the pockets it has... Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Handles too thin. Broke</li>
            <li> Fit my needs perfectly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size. Things fit great. It does shift in my purse and ends up on it&#x27;s side a lot, but everything always stays in it.</li>
            <li> I love it! Great for being more organized</li>
            <li> Nice bag for the money.</li>
            <li> Item is a little smaller than I expected, other than that it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and quite handy.</li>
            <li> I actually got this to use in the bottom of my nursing bag.  I am a home health nurse and I take a lot of equipment and supplies with me when I go to a patient&#x27;s home.  This little insert helped me to be able to keep things in my backpack organized and I can easily take the insert out and put it into another bag, if necessary.  I like the size and the number of pockets it has.  The pockets can be used for several different things.</li>
            <li> love love love it!!will be ordering more in different colors</li>
