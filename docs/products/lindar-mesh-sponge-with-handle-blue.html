            <li>: This is still the best one out there</li>
            <li>Work great.</li>
            <li>On a bright note, it does work well and when I scrub a dub dub in the tub it brings me so much joy.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as good as the manufacturers can do - I know that because what I want isn&#x27;t made anymore.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it because I know it wont feel good.</li>
            <li>He loves it, very handy when you don&#x27;t have full range of mobility!</li>
            <li>so I was super happy to find these online.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go so cheap on me, guys!</li>
            <li>Should have paid more and got a better product.</li>
            <li>Best to avoid or order multiple (since they&#x27;re cheap).</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to most everyone, but it&#x27;s fantastic for and elderly person.</li>
            <li>They break too easily.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size and dry out quickly between showers.</li>
            <li>Nice size mesh, but the handles are very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I liked the scrubbing head, but the handle was very flexible</li>
            <li>Too many cheap imports flooding the store right now.</li>
            <li>Nice soft sponge.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and the seller is to be commended on that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your gentle it may work fine</li>
            <li>Not even worth refund hassle for product replacement.</li>
            <li>I will find another one of a different brand because I really enjoyed it for the time that I had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>better off buying a quality wooden handled loofa</li>
            <li>product is easy to use for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>for it to work really well</li>
            <li>Handle to much flex.</li>

            <li>Very wimpy.</li>
            <li>The only thing to be aware of, as I initially wasn&#x27;t, is that the mesh sponge does not cover the entire circumference.  </li>
            <li>I believed this item was for washing between my toes and was surprised when it turned out to be much larger.</li>
            <li>I received the wrong color item when I ordered, not a huge deal but the vendor was very easy and quick to resolve my issue.</li>

            <li> I received the wrong color item when I ordered, not a huge deal but the vendor was very easy and quick to resolve my issue.</li>
            <li> is a decent design, but I wish I could get a very similar design that Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond used to carry a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to scrub your back with the exposed stick as I did.</li>
            <li> Snapped in half washing my back after 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I was being as gentle as I could knowing how weak the handles are.</li>
            <li> It was almost identical except that it had much thicker plastic and wasn&#x27;t as susceptible to getting thin cracks that would propagate and after a couple of years had to be tossed.</li>
            <li> The handle broke in less than a month and a half.</li>
            <li> The mesh sponge with handle broke in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> Works well, I have trouble reaching and it enables me to get at all the areas I need to.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking it would be green or even flamingo colored.</li>
            <li> After a few months use, it came all unraveled.</li>
            <li> The handles are thin and bend even under slight pressure.</li>
            <li> The brush itself was shorter than I had expected, in addition the plastic handle broke within a month making this brush useless.</li>
            <li> but it was not good for my needs.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>

            <li> Nice soft sponge.  It seems well made.  Wish the cord was a&lt;br /&gt;bit longer to hand it in the shower.  But that&#x27;s minor.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice size mesh, but the handles are very flimsy. The handles are thin and bend even under slight pressure. The handle snapped on the second use. I was being as gentle as I could knowing how weak the handles are.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong color item when I ordered, not a huge deal but the vendor was very easy and quick to resolve my issue. The brush itself was shorter than I had expected, in addition the plastic handle broke within a month making this brush useless. If your gentle it may work fine but it was not good for my needs.</li>
            <li> Works well, I have trouble reaching and it enables me to get at all the areas I need to.  The only thing to be aware of, as I initially wasn&#x27;t, is that the mesh sponge does not cover the entire circumference.  Just be careful not to scrub your back with the exposed stick as I did.</li>
            <li> Bottom Line Up Front: This is still the best one out there but it isn&#x27;t as good as the manufacturers can do - I know that because what I want isn&#x27;t made anymore. It was shipped quickly and the seller is to be commended on that.&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent design, but I wish I could get a very similar design that Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond used to carry a few years ago. It was almost identical except that it had much thicker plastic and wasn&#x27;t as susceptible to getting thin cracks that would propagate and after a couple of years had to be tossed. I&#x27;d pay extra for the sturdier design. Really. Don&#x27;t go so cheap on me, guys!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of them and, they both cracked in a matter of weeks. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  Snapped in half washing my back after 3 days.  Sponge is tied on with some string. I&#x27;d avoid.</li>
            <li> I believed this item was for washing between my toes and was surprised when it turned out to be much larger.</li>
            <li> this brush is blue. I was thinking it would be green or even flamingo colored. in Addition you have to get it&lt;br /&gt;wet for it to work really well and we are in a drought. This thing should come with some jugs of water. On a bright note, it does work well and when I scrub a dub dub in the tub it brings me so much joy. I named it Billy</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like the local pharmacies carry these anymore so I was super happy to find these online. They are the perfect size and dry out quickly between showers. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Fell apart on the second use. Handle to much flex. Not even worth refund hassle for product replacement. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this sponge, she uses it all of the time. I would suggest this to most everyone, but it&#x27;s fantastic for and elderly person.</li>
            <li> They break too easily. Too many cheap imports flooding the store right now. Best to avoid or order multiple (since they&#x27;re cheap).</li>
            <li> Ordered a blue one for my boyfriend for Christmas, and received a purple instead of the blue one. He&#x27;s not picky but ordered a blue one!</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend after he had shoulder surgery! He loves it, very handy when you don&#x27;t have full range of mobility!</li>
            <li> After a few months use, it came all unraveled. It was flimsy from the start and I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I liked the scrubbing head, but the handle was very flexible so I couldn&#x27;t apply much pressure. After only a month or two, the handle shattered while I was using it.</li>
            <li> I have had to amend my my review. The handle broke in less than a month and a half. I will find another one of a different brand because I really enjoyed it for the time that I had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous Review:&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It soaps up well and stays soapy.&lt;br /&gt;2. It reaches well to my back.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is not scratchy--soft mesh.&lt;br /&gt;4. It is made well enough that it looks like it will last for a while.</li>
            <li> The mesh sponge with handle broke in less than a week.  I will not be ordering from this company ever again.</li>
            <li> The slightest bit of pressure on the handle and it snaps...better off buying a quality wooden handled loofa</li>
            <li> Very wimpy. Haven&#x27;t used it because I know it wont feel good. Should have paid more and got a better product.</li>
            <li> Work great. Just what i needed</li>
