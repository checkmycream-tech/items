            <li>I love the strawberry smell mostly.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo does give my hair more body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first shampoo and conditioner set that I have used that 1. smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love these items and will order again</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair light and easy to work with!</li>
            <li>The very first time I tried this shampoo I already saw the difference!</li>
            <li>My hair is baby, fine, thin and this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel great and smells great too.</li>
            <li>I also like their sulfate free.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair silky smooth, with volume and helps prevent it from getting tangles.</li>
            <li>I have used this particular kind for a while</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>She is particular about hair products, so this is like the Betty Crocker seal of approval for hair care!  :-)</li>
            <li>Helps my hair grow fast and healthy.</li>
            <li>and although a bit pricey it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>PERFECT, I have thin hair and this shampoo helps a lot.</li>
            <li>My husband was actually sniffing my hair the other day after church, because he said it smelled so great!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Smells really fruity, not the biggest fan if that</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I really like them.  </li>
            <li>So far I notice my hair having more volume to it by using the shampoo only on my scalp and the conditioner on the ends of my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more than I like to spend, but the quality and overall feeling after using it is worth it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>When it gets to a certain length, it tends to \\&quot;rat\\&quot; up in the back underneath with knots and is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only purchase it really from amazon</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 5 year old daughter</li>
            <li>She has thin hair (not thinning), and this works very nicely to gentle clean and give it that extra volume she needs.  </li>

            <li> My felt soft and shiny and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> it still comes out feeling stringy and dry.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I blowed dried my hair after using it and it was salon-soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo with a few negative comments.</li>
            <li> The formula is thick and lathers well.</li>
            <li> But mine did not come with pumps, which is a little sad.  </li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars if the pump on the conditioner hadn&#x27;t been broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and can NEVER get it to hold a curl or have volume but since using this shampoo/conditioner, its a night &amp; day difference.</li>
            <li> Seriously - don&#x27;t hesitate, get it!</li>

            <li> Love this product, and it was a great value. Would have given 5 stars if the pump on the conditioner hadn&#x27;t been broken upon arrival.</li>

            <li> I love the product and the smell is amazing.  But mine did not come with pumps, which is a little sad.  But I guess I get a work out by lifting the bottle, turning it over, and  putting it back</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it. It makes my hair too flyaway. I thought it would give me more volume. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love bed head products. They make my hair shiny and manageable. And I love the smell. I also like their sulfate free.</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo ever! I have thin hair and can NEVER get it to hold a curl or have volume but since using this shampoo/conditioner, its a night &amp; day difference. I won&#x27;t use anything else. Very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> I love the strawberry smell mostly.  The shampoo does give my hair more body.  The conditioner is nice.  My hair is shiny, but a bit blow away at times.</li>
            <li> Ive used this for a couple years now.  I only purchase it really from amazon cause you cant beat the price.  Plus it beats having to go to the mall.  Where this set alone would cost me over 50.00.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> No joke!! The very first time I tried this shampoo I already saw the difference! I blowed dried my hair after using it and it was salon-soft and shiny. I teased my hair a bit and the volume was incredible! Great product and although a bit pricey it is worth every penny. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo with a few negative comments. I&#x27;m happy to say it is wonderful. I bought it for my 5 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, long hair. When I use regular shampoo and conditioner (even the 10 or 15 dollar \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; brands) it still comes out feeling stringy and dry. When it gets to a certain length, it tends to \\&quot;rat\\&quot; up in the back underneath with knots and is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first shampoo and conditioner set that I have used that 1. smells amazing! and 2. leaves my hair silky smooth, with volume and helps prevent it from getting tangles. It&#x27;s a little more than I like to spend, but the quality and overall feeling after using it is worth it! Seriously - don&#x27;t hesitate, get it!</li>
            <li> This is great!  Leaves my hair clean and bouncy.  My husband was actually sniffing my hair the other day after church, because he said it smelled so great!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. My felt soft and shiny and not weighed down. I have thin blonde hair and it&#x27;s perfect. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Love the product - great purchase experience</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff and the fact that it is sulfate-free! So far I notice my hair having more volume to it by using the shampoo only on my scalp and the conditioner on the ends of my hair! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> PERFECT, I have thin hair and this shampoo helps a lot. I have issues with a lot of shampoos causing hair to fall out or just make my hair thinner, but this shampoo does not. It adds volume and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> It is a great product at a good price.  My loves it and uses it all of the time.  She has thin hair (not thinning), and this works very nicely to gentle clean and give it that extra volume she needs.  That is as deep as I can but I can tell you that she is happy.  She is particular about hair products, so this is like the Betty Crocker seal of approval for hair care!  :-)</li>
            <li> Love these items and will order again</li>
            <li> I love this product. Healthy for the hair smells good. No sulfate! Helps my hair grow fast and healthy. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is great it smells so good you want to eat it, I also love it because it helps give you more volume!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is great. It smells like strawberry bubblegum. It does add extra volume to my hair. The formula is thick and lathers well. Highly recommend, will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> THANK GOD, I finally got my purchase. Smells amazing.....can&#x27;t wait to start using it.</li>
            <li> I got my order Sooner than it was suppose to come! I am happy&lt;br /&gt;With the price and quality</li>
