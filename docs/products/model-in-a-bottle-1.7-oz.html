            <li>The Skindanavia product is a better for your skin.</li>
            <li>I order Skindinavia  for oily skin hope I get better results.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t all that satisfied with the results</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do the job, and if u try to put powder over top</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than UD because it doesn&#x27;t make you shiny like UD</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be a nice, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be a nice, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>overall though Amazing!!</li>
            <li>so you get 4 more ounces for another 20 bucks, two ounces free, I guess.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>My face gets oily very quickly.</li>
            <li>Okay maybe just a tiny bit, but nothing to the extent that I previously experienced.</li>
            <li>My skin easily gets oily and makeup melts off within the hour, but with this spray it lasted all day until i wash it off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong</li>
            <li>At all.oo strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been useing it since works great with bare minerals .</li>
            <li>Here is a link what i got without the free brushes that this link i give you what they are in giving away  </li>
            <li>I love the smell too, it smells like roses but in a fresh way.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and is light weight.</li>
            <li>:) now the one downfal is the strong scent it puts off and lingers evn over my dolce light blue and thats a strong scent!</li>
            <li>makes me feel clean</li>
            <li>This product is good but for the price, it&#x27;s not enough in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even had it for a full week yet</li>
            <li>so I have a full bottle and can&#x27;t get it to spray.</li>
            <li>Good thing is, you will never have to maneuver the bottle to get last remaining liquid of the bottle</li>
            <li>and it works average to great.  </li>
            <li>wasnt worth calling and changing</li>
            <li>I has made my makeup last through summer days, a funeral and my own wedding.</li>
            <li>It does make your makeup stay fresh.</li>
            <li>It keeps it fresh for about 12 hours.</li>
            <li>My friends laugh at me but my eyes water alot and have to touch up my eyeliner quite alot..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go a day without it, it sets your makeup perfectly, I never have to powder my nose, and it smells delicious, just feels fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this, kind of like a perfume but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Just a couple of blots with the blotting paper and my face still looked fresh, like it first looked when I put on my makeup that morning.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I first tried it, I was a bit scared.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it one more time in the middle just in case.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>the first I ever heard of it was on Oprah Winfrey.</li>
            <li>My make-up really stayed on for hours and hours with no touch-ups!</li>
            <li>my make up was still flawless few minor touch ups</li>
            <li>better than Urban Decay in my opinion</li>
            <li>delivery was pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>Make sure your mascara is completely dry before spraying.</li>
            <li>I saw this on t.v and decided to try it and fell in love with this spray , my make up really does stay on all day long.</li>
            <li>Idont leave the house even when I&#x27;m sick without a perfect face full of makeup.</li>
            <li>Better than any other brands out there for sure...however, need to close your eyes when spraying due to chemical is very strong.</li>
            <li>really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Got it really fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I did not try it on a super hot day outside yet</li>
            <li>and this other website had it for $15 plus another $5 for shipping and add the tax on top of that.</li>
            <li>I made sure to test it on a hot day to see how long it would last.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to only use only one spray, if you use more your face will feel to tight.</li>
            <li>wet at first after spraying it, but that feeling goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I am rating it as three stars  because my expectations were high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Keeps your makeup on all day in just a few spritzes, but make sure not to get it in your eyes:</li>
            <li>I have to moisturize and while my cheeks feel fine, my T-zone becomes extremely oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I used it for my overdone makeup for Halloween (normal makeup but extra heavy) and it held it even through three bouts of tears (due to a recent loss of my best friend) and my makeup stayed put!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying out new products</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and buy urban decay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used oil blotting papers and made them completely clear.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how far to spray it and</li>
            <li>It worked for me and I was pleasantly surprised by how matte my faced looked, as opposed to looking like I put vegetable oil on my face on purpose.</li>
            <li>It worked for me and I was pleasantly surprised by how matte my faced looked, as opposed to looking like I put vegetable oil on my face on purpose.</li>
            <li>Now that I have a 3 month old baby girl and don&#x27;t have time to re-apply makeup throughout the day I just spray it on in the morning</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes my makeup last.  </li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;m picky about its the fact it doesn&#x27;t help with oil control that much, it does somewhat not entirely.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying the sensitive skin to add to my kit</li>
            <li>Once to the left, once in the middle, and once to the right.</li>
            <li>ONLY reason it was given a  four was becasue of the new bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily in my T-zone and dry around my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have a combination of oily to dry skin and this product made my skin look very shiny and oily</li>
            <li>However, whenever I would use primer (tarte to be exact), it made my face extremely shiny.</li>
            <li>The one i received was a plastic blue bottle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It comes in regular and one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the only thing I would say is that if you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t get this one I would go with the sensitive skin one only because it is scented so it could cause irritation.</li>
            <li>I use a high end primer,moisurizer and other products.</li>

            <li> The one i received was a plastic blue bottle for sensitive skin. Seems to me like an off brand. Here is a link what i got without the free brushes that this link i give you what they are in giving away  [...] I didnt call the copy because i actually paid$13.79 before tax and shipping. and this other website had it for $15 plus another $5 for shipping and add the tax on top of that. wasnt worth calling and changing but i thought i would warn others that this is not what you get.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. It&#x27;s very oily in my T-zone and dry around my cheeks. I have to moisturize and while my cheeks feel fine, my T-zone becomes extremely oily throughout the day. I&#x27;ve used oil blotting papers and made them completely clear. It&#x27;s horrible! I&#x27;ve also set my makeup in the morning with powder, but that doesn&#x27;t last long enough. My face gets oily very quickly. It&#x27;s so annoying. I decided to look for something that lasted longer, so I searched around on Amazon.com and found this setting spray. At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but I decided to give it a try. Anything to get rid of the oil on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it, I was a bit scared. I didn&#x27;t know how far to spray it and how many times. I decided to spray it at arm&#x27;s length and three times. Once to the left, once in the middle, and once to the right. I sprayed it one more time in the middle just in case. I kept my eyes closed for about 30 seconds so that my eyes didn&#x27;t burn. Then the test began. I made sure to test it on a hot day to see how long it would last. Well let me tell you, it was great! I had no oiliness after many, many hours. Okay maybe just a tiny bit, but nothing to the extent that I previously experienced. Just a couple of blots with the blotting paper and my face still looked fresh, like it first looked when I put on my makeup that morning. The paper didn&#x27;t become transparent! And to be fair, I did have my makeup on for well over eight hours. That&#x27;s a really long time. Normally my face would be oilier than french fries at a fast food restaurant after less than half that time (bad analogy, but hopefully you get the point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face felt tight and a little wet at first after spraying it, but that feeling goes away quickly. Make sure your mascara is completely dry before spraying. You may feel strange because of the wetness, but don&#x27;t worry. Your makeup won&#x27;t run. Trust me! I&#x27;ve read in other reviews that people didn&#x27;t like the fragrance. Well I liked it. It&#x27;s not too strong and I found it to be a nice, clean fragrance. I&#x27;ve used it five times (15-20 sprays) and a little over an inch of it is gone in the bottle. I can see that it could last 300 sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do recommend this product. It worked for me and I was pleasantly surprised by how matte my faced looked, as opposed to looking like I put vegetable oil on my face on purpose. That&#x27;s not cute. At all.oo strong and I found it to be a nice, clean fragrance. I&#x27;ve used it five times (15-20 sprays) and a little over an inch of it is gone in the bottle.

            <li> Excellent. Fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I has made my makeup last through summer days, a funeral and my own wedding. Your makeup doesn&#x27;t move! Yea for none moving makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Better than any other brands out there for sure...however, need to close your eyes when spraying due to chemical is very strong.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love this stuff!  I used it for my overdone makeup for Halloween (normal makeup but extra heavy) and it held it even through three bouts of tears (due to a recent loss of my best friend) and my makeup stayed put!  I was amazed by that.  I&#x27;ll always have this on hand!</li>
            <li> i love the product . it makes my makeup stay all day. delivery was pretty fast too. got my product in time for party</li>
            <li> Worked amazing! Need to repurchase😁😁😁</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Got it really fast.  Was exactly as described. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The make-up artist for my wedding day introduced me to this product.  It is the greatest!  Two or three spritz on your face and your make-up lasts all day long.  Now that I have a 3 month old baby girl and don&#x27;t have time to re-apply makeup throughout the day I just spray it on in the morning and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.  I love this product and wouldn&#x27;t leave home with out it.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. Just make sure to only use only one spray, if you use more your face will feel to tight.It does make your makeup stay fresh.</li>
            <li> Keeps my makeup in place for hours. I have even slept in it and it looks good when I wake up. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> My favorite go to setting spray keeps my makeup on all day wit no touch ups...I love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I saw this on t.v and decided to try it and fell in love with this spray , my make up really does stay on all day long.</li>
            <li> This product is good but for the price, it&#x27;s not enough in the bottle.  They say you get three hundred sprays but you have to spray your face from a distance at least 4 or 5 times; that means I have to buy a bottle every three weeks?  No!  I haven&#x27;t even had it for a full week yet and it&#x27;s halfway gone!  So I don&#x27;t like the deal you get for the money.  I&#x27;m trying out new products and they all are expensive.  Skindanavia has one that works great and the cost is $40 for 6 ounces so you get 4 more ounces for another 20 bucks, two ounces free, I guess.  The Skindanavia product is a better for your skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps your makeup on all day in just a few spritzes, but make sure not to get it in your eyes: Keep your eyes shut til its all the way dry. Got some in my eyes and it burned and made them tear up and cause smudges as the mist wasnt all the way set. It literally is like hairspray for your face so your face does get like a tight feeling to it after applying this. Also has a VERY strong perfume smell. Otherwise, it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I heard so much great reviews on this product from beauty gurus on youtube. I am rating it as three stars  because my expectations were high and it did not meet. I have a combination of oily to dry skin and this product made my skin look very shiny and oily,I NEVER wore bronzer with this product.I used it for a week and tried different ways of applying to see if it would make a difference, it didn&#x27;t .My make up lasted just as long with model in a bottle as it would without it. Model in a bottle claims that you do not need touch ups threw out your day but i still had to touch up. My face felt stiff and it wasn&#x27;t heat resistant.I order Skindinavia  for oily skin hope I get better results. On the good side I did like the smell of this product but I will not be purchasing it again, its not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bottle didn&#x27;t have a straw to pull fluid through so I have a full bottle and can&#x27;t get it to spray. Worthless</li>
            <li> I really like this the first I ever heard of it was on Oprah Winfrey. I&#x27;ve been useing it since works great with bare minerals .</li>
            <li> I have been using Model in a Bottle for 2 years and I can&#x27;t live without it, I wish I knew about it for my wedding day 3 years ago.  I can&#x27;t go a day without it, it sets your makeup perfectly, I never have to powder my nose, and it smells delicious, just feels fresh and clean.  BUY IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the urban decay all-nighter spray and I wasn&#x27;t all that satisfied with the results so I turned to Model in a Bottle since I&#x27;ve heard from the Youtube gurus that this was a great product.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! My make-up really stayed on for hours and hours with no touch-ups!</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews on this stuff and finally decided to order it and I&#x27;m glad I did and I&#x27;m not dissapointed at all.  This stuff really makes my makeup last.  I did not try it on a super hot day outside yet but I will and I hope it works!</li>
            <li> I love this product it does keep my make up on longer.It keeps it fresh for about 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It works, your makeup stays in place all day. I use this product every day. Saw Model in a Bottle on Oprah and can&#x27;t go a day with out using it.</li>
            <li> Makeup stays loong time! I love it, I don&#x27;t leave my house without spraying my makeup with this.  If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;m picky about its the fact it doesn&#x27;t help with oil control that much, it does somewhat not entirely. overall though Amazing!! Def repurchasing because I&#x27;m almost out!</li>
            <li> It is not good at all. Spend a little more and buy urban decay.  It doesn&#x27;t do the job, and if u try to put powder over top you get bubbles on ur face.  Save ur money.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My makeup stays on all day without coming off on my cell phone screen etc.</li>
            <li> This product is off the charts. Beats Victoria Secrets Prime/make up spray and Ben Nye spray. ONLY reason it was given a  four was becasue of the new bottle. You get less spray. Good thing is, you will never have to maneuver the bottle to get last remaining liquid of the bottle</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best make-up setting spray. It goes on beautifully and dries quickly. It comes in regular and one for sensitive skin. Great value.</li>
            <li> Works great! It lasts all day. I had my wisdom teeth pulled out and cried like a baby after but when I looked in the mirror my make up was still flawless few minor touch ups I was hysterical lol still looked fab :) now the one downfal is the strong scent it puts off and lingers evn over my dolce light blue and thats a strong scent! Love the quality hate the smell, might try urban decay next time! Xox</li>
            <li> I use this everyday I wear makeup. I even use it with BB cream and it does a great job. I love the smell too, it smells like roses but in a fresh way. the only thing I would say is that if you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t get this one I would go with the sensitive skin one only because it is scented so it could cause irritation. I plan on buying the sensitive skin to add to my kit I like it much better than UD because it doesn&#x27;t make you shiny like UD can do to some people. but I love this stuff. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Does it work? You tell me...I haven&#x27;t notice any change with my makeup lasting longer. It also has a stronger smell than my American Eagle Perfume.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my makeup all the time. I use a high end primer,moisurizer and other products. Idont leave the house even when I&#x27;m sick without a perfect face full of makeup. The summers here are torture so I hated all the touchups. This is AWESOME!!! My friends laugh at me but my eyes water alot and have to touch up my eyeliner quite alot..I went all day,even had a cold and with my eyes watering and blowing my nose my makeup stayed put! Dont hesitate...if you hate touchups this is for you! The only thing Ididnt like is the smell..yuck. Maybe you can work on that but it wont stop me from using it!!</li>
            <li> The bottle works well without using any primer, my make up did stay all night while I danced. However, whenever I would use primer (tarte to be exact), it made my face extremely shiny.</li>
            <li> Amazing makeup setting spray. It is not sticky and is light weight. My skin easily gets oily and makeup melts off within the hour, but with this spray it lasted all day until i wash it off.</li>
            <li> It sets my makeup, has a matte finish my face does get a little oily in the end of the day but I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, kind of like a perfume but not overwhelming. makes me feel clean and it works average to great.  better than Urban Decay in my opinion</li>
