            <li>But it&#x27;s still very cute and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The pillow is very comfortable.  </li>

            <li>When people come over they comment on the cool design.</li>
            <li>Its incredibly comfortable (I use it as a cushion to make my hard chair more comfortable) and came out of the bag with a pleasant woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>The best part is it is actually very firm, which feels really nice on your back when you sit on the couch or in a softer chair.</li>
            <li>kids really think it&#x27;s cool!</li>

            <li>so realistic!!</li>
            <li>In reality, the inner circles are more orange than the picture.  </li>
            <li>The outer cover is a soft cheap material with a zipper, making it removable.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was wanting and expecting.</li>
            <li>Does not have any give to it, should be used for back support more than anything.  </li>
            <li>large size goes anywhere for a rustic look.</li>
            <li>The colors are not represented very well on the picture.  </li>
            <li>Is that real?  </li>
            <li>I bought this cushion for a modern adirondack chair.</li>
            <li>Really clever . .</li>
            <li>soft beads inside.</li>

            <li> Really clever . .</li>
            <li> soft beads inside.</li>
            <li> From a little distance away, the pillow looks quite a bit realistic</li>
            <li> I also think it would work well for family members that sometimes have a harder time getting up from a couch.</li>
            <li> also labeling a product which nearly completely is made from synthetic materials to be &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34; is not exactly a good description for this product.</li>
            <li> The foam is also cut so that the pillow has sharp edges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Rolls down the hall when you drop it, too round.</li>
            <li> Very thin material probly won&#x27;t last long but kids cats and visitors can&#x27;t leave it alone</li>
            <li> It is quite a bit firm and keeps its shape.</li>
            <li> I agree that &amp;#34;fake log disc, smells a bit&amp;#34; is harsh, but that would be the plain facts.</li>
            <li> as other customers complained, the pillow smells of plastic / chemicals.</li>
            <li> The item was forced inside a firm plastic baggie for shipping, so it somewhat disfigured the foam, allowing the fabric to sag a little on each side.</li>
            <li> Not glad I bought this</li>
            <li> Really hard pillow.  </li>
            <li> The pillow is also hard, coincidentally, as a log.</li>
            <li> Very hard pillow.</li>
            <li> Foam inserts smell terribly and are nearly impossible to clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to rest your head on this because you will be uncomfortable.  </li>

            <li> This does look like a slice of log and works great with the camo sheets. The item was forced inside a firm plastic baggie for shipping, so it somewhat disfigured the foam, allowing the fabric to sag a little on each side. Other than that, we are very pleased with the look it brings to the room.</li>
            <li> The pillow is very comfortable.  The colors are not represented very well on the picture.  In reality, the inner circles are more orange than the picture.  But it&#x27;s still very cute and comfortable.  In a room where color matching is not an issue, the pillow works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~ Fools friends into thinking you keep logs on the couch when they just enter the house and see this from afar.&lt;br /&gt;~ Anti-singe laptop tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;~ Rolls down the hall when you drop it, too round.</li>
            <li> Very thin material probly won&#x27;t last long but kids cats and visitors can&#x27;t leave it alone lol</li>
            <li> Very hard pillow. Decorative use only.</li>
            <li> Its incredibly comfortable (I use it as a cushion to make my hard chair more comfortable) and came out of the bag with a pleasant woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> Perfect pillow for our cabin! this is not a pillow for comfort but a great decoration</li>
            <li> so realistic!! soft beads inside. kids really think it&#x27;s cool! large size goes anywhere for a rustic look. love it!</li>
            <li> As described.  Just wasn&#x27;t my style.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. The outer cover is a soft cheap material with a zipper, making it removable. The Foam inside seems to be a very standard foam. It is quite a bit firm and keeps its shape. The foam is also cut so that the pillow has sharp edges. From a little distance away, the pillow looks quite a bit realistic</li>
            <li> Really clever . . bought 2 and love the rustic look!  Others want to know where I got them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was wanting and expecting. This is a nice pillow.</li>
            <li> This pillow is high quality and looks great. When people come over they comment on the cool design. The best part is it is actually very firm, which feels really nice on your back when you sit on the couch or in a softer chair. I am thinking about using one at work. I also think it would work well for family members that sometimes have a harder time getting up from a couch. Thumbs up. Makes a nice gift that is different from the norm.</li>
            <li> Really hard pillow.  Does not have any give to it, should be used for back support more than anything.  Don&#x27;t expect to rest your head on this because you will be uncomfortable.  It is advertised as such.  Not glad I bought this, I immediately put it in my garage.</li>
            <li> Love the pillow it looks great! Took quite a while for shipping because it came from overseas.</li>
            <li> as other customers complained, the pillow smells of plastic / chemicals. also labeling a product which nearly completely is made from synthetic materials to be &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34; is not exactly a good description for this product. I agree that &amp;#34;fake log disc, smells a bit&amp;#34; is harsh, but that would be the plain facts.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, fun pillow in our cabin</li>
            <li> Very high quality, well made, excellent graphic. We have three of these in a log cabin decorated room, and they add a nice touch besides being very comfortable. Very good price.</li>
            <li> Is that real?  No it&#x27;s a pillow.  Over and over when guests visit...just love them</li>
            <li> My husband is in the Forestry profession and also likes to hunt and spends lots of time in the outdoors.  He likes the pillow.</li>
            <li> Cute, fun, inexpensive pillow</li>
            <li> I bought this cushion for a modern adirondack chair. It looks great! I have had lots of compliments. And it is comfortable too!</li>
            <li> This pillow is adorable! It doesn&#x27;t have the smelly factory scent, and it will look perfect with my camping theme in my classroom. My kindergartners will love this!</li>
            <li> Looks nice on our guest bedroom log bed</li>
            <li> Catches everyone&#x27;s eye on the rocker, so unique!</li>
