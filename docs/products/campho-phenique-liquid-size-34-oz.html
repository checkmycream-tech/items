            <li>It is great for acne, sunburn, insect bites and has to be THE product for mouth sores.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>;  This stuff is old-line, but you can&#x27;t find anything better for cuts and scrapes and fever blisters.  </li>
            <li>Better buy it while you can.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Campho for years for mouth sores (canker sores, blisters, cuts, etc) and love it.  </li>
            <li>The smell and taste can be a bit overwhelming, but I&#x27;ve come to love it because I know how well the product works to relieve pain and spur healing in tender areas.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this stuff smells</li>
            <li>Love the smell, reminds me of hiking/camping with my dad.</li>
            <li>Heals wounds amazing fast!</li>
            <li>Great medicine in a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>I have used this item before; its always a pleasuure to find and being able to get it in a super fast time frame :)</li>
            <li>Thanks, fast shipping, I been using Campho-Phenique Liquid forever, it is good for everything.</li>
            <li>old school and hard to find, works great on bug bites and so much more, good stuff, thanks for having avail for us !!!</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s good for minor first-aid.</li>
            <li>Was delighted to find it online and such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Kind of a short time period to use a bottle of antiseptic</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and soooooo glad to have some finally.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Recent decades have brought many new products, but I haven&#x27;t found any that work this well.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I have shingles and it really soothes and heals the blisters and the rash.  </li>
            <li>Quickly dries it up and heals at the same time.</li>
            <li>Same as it has been for the last 40 years or more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it works consistently enough to rate it any higher than 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Also, because this product isn&#x27;t made for use on acne.</li>
            <li>My grandmother taught me about this old product, in the &#x60;60&#x60;s.</li>
            <li>As nearly as I can tell, this is just like the Campho Phenique that&#x27;s been around for years.  </li>
            <li>I have had cold sores since I was 5 years old and as an experienced tester of different remedies</li>
            <li>Not exactly something I&#x27;d wear out on a first date,</li>
            <li>A great product that has become impossible to find locally, thank you.</li>
            <li>After many years of trying to find it in stores, I finally thought to look online (duh!).</li>
            <li>Fabulous to get rid of cold sores fast.</li>

            <li> Fabulous to get rid of cold sores fast.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s been around so long, and it&#x27;s cheaper on amazon than my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Usually takes only a few days and your lip is completely back to normal vs weeks.</li>
            <li> So, Amazon pulled through, and now we&#x27;re setup for quite a while as this stuff can be used sparingly and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Aside from the nostalgic properties it actually works really well.</li>
            <li> It actually works a lot better than some of today&#x27;s products, but you&#x27;ll have to work around the oil base, that can get all over things if you don&#x27;t take care.</li>
            <li> Get a cut, or scrape, put this on quickly, and I&#x27;ve NEVER had an infection, regardless of how dirty the cut.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find Campho Phenique anywhere around me (New Hampshire), so to the internet</li>
            <li> use this all my life hope they ever change it, like they MESS!</li>
            <li> My wife always used this for cold sores, but we couldn&#x27;t find this in any of our local drugstores.  </li>
            <li> Cold sore is gone within a few days.  </li>
            <li> This has gotten so expensive....</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with product .</li>
            <li> As soon as the cold sore starts use the campho-phenique....</li>
            <li> I get some bad flareups and this stuff stops the cold sore in its tracks.</li>
            <li> every thing els up when they change! :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> received in great condition thank you</li>
            <li> My grandmother taught me about this old product, in the &#x60;60&#x60;s. Told me to try it for my face-blemish. It&#x60;s good for minor first-aid. Has healing propertie&#x60;s, etc. Arrived on time and well packaged. I recommend this seller, also.</li>
            <li> Great product and will always use it.</li>
            <li> been using this product for over 40 years, works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for. ..thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks, fast shipping, I been using Campho-Phenique Liquid forever, it is good for everything.</li>
            <li> good very good product</li>
            <li> My wife always used this for cold sores, but we couldn&#x27;t find this in any of our local drugstores.  So, Amazon pulled through, and now we&#x27;re setup for quite a while as this stuff can be used sparingly and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fabulous to get rid of cold sores fast. Use a medicated lip balm after the campho-phenique. Bingo! Cold sore is gone within a few days.  As soon as the cold sore starts use the campho-phenique....it works.</li>
            <li> As nearly as I can tell, this is just like the Campho Phenique that&#x27;s been around for years.  It actually works a lot better than some of today&#x27;s products, but you&#x27;ll have to work around the oil base, that can get all over things if you don&#x27;t take care.</li>
            <li> Like my grandmother always said, &amp;#34;If it works, don&#x27;t fix it.&amp;#34;  This stuff is old-line, but you can&#x27;t find anything better for cuts and scrapes and fever blisters.  I went to look for it in several places just recently, but it appears they&#x27;ve removed this product from the shelves for whatever reason.  Better buy it while you can.</li>
            <li> Get a cut, or scrape, put this on quickly, and I&#x27;ve NEVER had an infection, regardless of how dirty the cut.  Does not work for deep injuries.  Has a temporary moderate anesthetic effect, too.</li>
            <li> Growing up in the 1950s, I can tell you this product was part of every mother&#x27;s medicine cabinet. Recent decades have brought many new products, but I haven&#x27;t found any that work this well. After many years of trying to find it in stores, I finally thought to look online (duh!). I bought one for myself and one for a family member w/ occasional acne. It is great for acne, sunburn, insect bites and has to be THE product for mouth sores.</li>
            <li> Still works just like when grandma use to put it on scrapes!  Heals wounds amazing fast!</li>
            <li> Great medicine in a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find Campho Phenique anywhere around me (New Hampshire), so to the internet I came.

            <li> I have used this item before; its always a pleasuure to find and being able to get it in a super fast time frame :)</li>
            <li> I have shingles and it really soothes and heals the blisters and the rash.  I use alot of it and can&#x27;t buy it at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> use this all my life hope they ever change it, like they MESS! every thing els up when they change! :(</li>
            <li> I have had cold sores since I was 5 years old and as an experienced tester of different remedies this is the best. I get some bad flareups and this stuff stops the cold sore in its tracks. Quickly dries it up and heals at the same time. Usually takes only a few days and your lip is completely back to normal vs weeks. Abreva has nothing on this period and you will save yourself tons of money. For me Abreva never worked.</li>
            <li> Could not locate the liquid Campho Phenique in local pharmacies.  Was delighted to find it online and such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as an acne spot treatment because I read that someone else had used this for acne &amp; they swore by it.  It works okay.  It does tend to try out the cystic pimples a bit, and helps decrease swelling.  Overall, it&#x27;s okay.  I don&#x27;t use it all the time though becauue I don&#x27;t feel that it works consistently enough to rate it any higher than 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Also, because this product isn&#x27;t made for use on acne.</li>
            <li> This has gotten so expensive....wonder why?</li>
            <li> Love the way this stuff smells it works great!</li>
            <li> Same as it has been for the last 40 years or more</li>
            <li> best all around for anything</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Love the smell, reminds me of hiking/camping with my dad. Not exactly something I&#x27;d wear out on a first date, but if she likes the smell of campho-phenique she gets bonus points. Aside from the nostalgic properties it actually works really well. There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s been around so long, and it&#x27;s cheaper on amazon than my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and soooooo glad to have some finally.</li>
            <li> Cannot find another one. They must not make it anymore.  Such a shame!</li>
            <li> A great product that has become impossible to find locally, thank you.</li>
            <li> old school and hard to find, works great on bug bites and so much more, good stuff, thanks for having avail for us !!!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with product . Expiration  date is 11/13 . Kind of a short time period to use a bottle of antiseptic</li>
    </ol>
