            <li>after i tried this amazing product, i reordered.  </li>
            <li>So happy to have found these convenient wipes available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Everyone I gave them to really liked them.</li>
            <li>do remove makeup, but not completely--particularly eye makeup, even the non-waterproof kind.</li>
            <li>They leave your skin feeling nicely moisturized afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These wipes are very mild and pleasantly scented.</li>
            <li>Individually wrapped make up remover wipes are perfect for our beach vacation rental- good price/sheet too.</li>
            <li>Great for morning, quick wipe off of face.  </li>
            <li>Good scent, not \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; and easy to keep a package in her schoolbag.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, this is especially nice.</li>
            <li>They are also great after walking around on a hot day on vacation or even at home.</li>
            <li>No Alcohol, Fragrance Free, non greasy residue is what I love!</li>
            <li>I love these cloths.</li>
            <li>Love these things.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>well worth it - a good value.  </li>
            <li>But I have flown many times with these wipes in my carry-on without a problem.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you do not use makeup or suffer from problem skin it would be okay.  </li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>The name says it all - so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love to travel with these in my overnight bag</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to get out another one in these cases, to make sure it&#x27;s getting everything off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, I could do without it or with an even lighter one.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite face wipes ever.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re refreshing and don&#x27;t leave a residue on my face afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Individually wrapped towelettes are perfect to take to the gym, traveling, or anyplace.</li>
            <li>Singles for on the go :)&lt;br /&gt;Great for planes, weekends, gym bag, etc.</li>
            <li>If you have any blemishes, they will show more after you use the cloth.</li>
            <li>I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to submerge my hands in water to wash my face, so I purchased this pack of 4.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different disposable make-up remover cloths and these are just the best.</li>
            <li>They are excellent for oily and sensitive skin and leave you feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s great to have this product as an option for taking along for ANY time during which access to or use of a sink might be an issue (e.g. spending the night in a hospital waiting room, or in the hospital room of a loved one, or at a friend-of-a-friend&#x27;s home, or while on an extended road trip, or after a long flight, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>But in a pinch, after surgery, they were convenient and did the job pretty good.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for my travel; at home I use the multi-pack, but if I use them to travel, the sealer doesn&#x27;t stay tacky and the towelettes dry out.  </li>
            <li>Just a clean feeling!  </li>
            <li>I love the light scent and the way it leaves my face feeling.</li>
            <li>Have used these for many years, great buy for quick soothing facial cleansing with no resulting dryness or irritation, handy for purse or travel</li>
            <li>They really are SO refreshing! :)</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>The cloths feel good, smell good (faintly of citrus) and are wonderful for a quick clean up.</li>
            <li>Love the clean feeling from this product</li>
            <li>These give me a quick refreshing.</li>
            <li>[it works great for neck, etc., of course, but my facial skin is waaaay</li>
            <li>leaves no residue so its great for use with my medical device.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice size for your whole face.  </li>
            <li>Great on the go facial cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Even my cat wants me to wipe her face with them, and they don&#x27;t sting the eyes and they have a nice odor to them.  </li>
            <li>i have an oily complexion and these do the trick to keep my face clean and oil free during the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are just about as truly fragrance and residue free as you might hope for, and they leave my face feeling clean and refreshed when I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a long time user and the price great.</li>
            <li>No clogged pores, no irritated skin, no dryness, no smelly anything - just clean, moist, refreshed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A quick and easy way to clean your face quickly and give yourself a pick-me-up.  </li>
            <li>They are refreshing and clean very well.  </li>
            <li>Also, &amp; impressively, use on one side of the cloth doesn&#x27;t result in stuff simply being absorbed all the way through - which allows me to use quadrants on one side of the cloth, &amp; then I fold it, &amp; use the remaining (&amp; unused) sides to gently clean the skin over &amp; below my (closed) eyes (something the chemicals in many cloths would render problematic), &amp; then my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great for travel as you don&#x27;t have to take the whole box with you, only what you need for that trip.</li>
            <li>These are super handing when you are traveling and don&#x27;t want to pack eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that can break out very easily I have been using Basis cleanse Gel for years</li>
            <li>They are gentle for sensitive skin, very effective in removing make-up, and as they are individually packaged they are easy to pop into a purse or luggage for travel.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re refreshing and completely non-greasy and non-drying.</li>
            <li>But it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Nice to find a wipe that simply cleans without any residue.</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t smell, and they do a great job of getting good holding mascara off after pressing down slightly on my lashes for about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Maybe not the most &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; though since it adds more waste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have a lovely fresh scent that dissipates pretty quickly, and they&#x27;re large enough to use on your face and chest.  </li>
            <li>Also, the cloths are very gentle and non drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely does the job--your face will feel clean and fresh, and the  cloth is pleasantly cool against your skin.  </li>
            <li>Of course a regular purchaser would notice the HUGE PRICE HIKE!</li>
            <li>Consistent quality over the years.  </li>
            <li>Love these facial wipes!</li>
            <li>We love the Basis Cleansing Cloths because they are individually wrapped which keeps each cloth moist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been trying to find a refreshing facial cloth to use after my hot yoga classes.  </li>
            <li>i love this facial cleansing cloths</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but if that is your sole purpose, I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I also love the individual wrapping--great for traveling, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the part I like: I really love that these come individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t care for the smell, it is actually better than my Burt&#x27;s Bee wipes smell, but I don&#x27;t care for it , to me it is perfumey.  </li>
            <li>These are simply the best such facial wipes I have found, and my friends who I have shared them with agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft, refreshing, non-irritating, will take off make-up easily, and does not leave your skin dry or sticky.  </li>
            <li>use that triggered my testing this product at all (especially after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews) was for a loved one to use after returning home from surgery, given that they would not be able to stand up much for a few weeks after said surgery, &amp; thus washing their face was going to be an issue.  </li>
            <li>(this truly is a unisex product - it doesn&#x27;t smell feminine or masculine - it&#x27;s just *clean* &amp; *refreshing*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great on the go item for quick facial care in a to go packing, for those times when a sink is not available.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin completely clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>In addition to using them as face wipes, I use them to wipe off my hands, phone, shopping cart, and pretty much anything else.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to keep in my yoga bag to use after hot yoga classes -- and really like them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I buy always in large quantities, just in case.</li>
            <li>These whips are \\&quot;nice\\&quot; large size with a nice smell and like a heavy towel.</li>
            <li>Large enough for entire face, durable, and handy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They also work really well without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for keeping in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily complexion</li>
            <li>Are the individual wipes still available?</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin, so I never have any breakouts or issues with dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a toner after this and noticed it seems to cleanse better than a lot of the other cloths on the market.</li>
            <li>I bought Basis cleansing cloths to clean my face and remove makeup following hand surgery.</li>
            <li>This product ended up allowing her to clean her face conveniently &amp; effectively, &amp; to feel refreshed afterwards - the psychological boost that this product indirectly allowed was something the manufacturers might never have had in mind, but it really made a difference, &amp; without it, she would have felt a difficult-to-describe stress that was outright avoided, thanks to the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effectiveness of this product allows me to conveniently clean my face during overnight stays when visiting family - there are times when washing my face in the standard way is something I&#x27;d like to avoid if possible, due solely to its effect on my hair (rinsing, specifically</li>
            <li>They are also gentle enough that I&#x27;m comfortable using on my young daughter.</li>
            <li>These super convenient, individually wrapped cloths have ended my search.  </li>
            <li>I bought these cloths mainly for travel and for having in my purse in case I need to touch up makeup, etc between work and dinner at night or something.</li>
            <li>I really love all the Basis products, especially the facial cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li>I also love the individual packaging and the order I just placed had no individual wipes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re also super convenient for travel, especially if you&#x27;re taking a carry-on bag and are worried about liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;VERY highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Cloths are very soft and ingredients are very gentle--great for sensitive skin, or really any skin type.</li>
            <li>They do not leave my face dry, but clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I use the Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths for more sensitive spots and initial makeup removal before using my prescription wash.    </li>
            <li>The fact that these cloths are individually wrapped keeps them each moist and fresh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Importantly, it cleans well, &amp; the cloth is moist enough that it does not dry out quickly, &amp; allows one to truly clean the entire face without the cloth &#x27;running out&#x27;, &amp; without the cloth ripping or falling apart (the way some products do).  </li>
            <li>I pop a few in my carry on before a long flight, and am able to easily freshen up my face/neck without going to the bathroom and trying to balance above the sink.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and gentle and thorough cleansing cloths with delicate fragrance</li>
            <li>given the all-encompassing does-it-right nature of this product, it truly does allow for multi-faceted use, &amp; even for folks who have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They remove my makeup well and are very soft.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>[&amp; usually not neatly so]).  </li>
            <li>While this one isn&#x27;t on the exact same level as those were, they are close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and these don&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>*, *very* sensitive), &amp; without leaving any kind of smell behind</li>
            <li>This product has helped her face become smooth and little to no blemises.</li>
            <li>If we need to go somewhere very early in the morning (&amp; there are over a dozen people spending the night, &amp; nowhere near enough time for everyone to have major access to showers, etc.), or if I&#x27;d like to accompany someone for a brief early morning errand, etc., utilizing these cleansing cloths (at night before sleeping, &amp; then in the morning, to feel refreshed) allows me to have clean skin &amp; not have my hair look ridiculous during the relevant outing (I know that sounds laughable, but it&#x27;s true! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything at the store</li>
            <li>They work well for my 3 year old grandson&#x27;s sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like using it on more delicate parts of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>When I used Olay&#x27;s sensitive skin moist wipes, I still had to rinse afterward</li>
            <li>Lives you skin feeling soft supple and refreshed no matter where you are.</li>
            <li>I travel frequently and no matter what I&#x27;ve done</li>
            <li>But it is astringent and, if you have a sensitive face, it will sting.  </li>
            <li>Generally I&#x27;m a big fan of the basis skin care, especially because of the otherworldly fresh lemongrass scent.</li>
            <li>it does a good cleaning job without any residue left behind.</li>
            <li>GREAT product that leaves one feeling clean &amp; refreshed, works with sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling dry, doesn&#x27;t leave behind a scent, utilizes a cloth that does not dry out or fall apart while using it, &amp; is definitely a product to keep in mind for anyone for whom temporary or permanent disability or temporary resource access interferes with standard &amp;/or convenient use of soap &amp; water -- &amp; is something which our family learned was terrific for use with a post-surgery patient at home when their mobility was limited.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in the southern humidity</li>
            <li>They are not wrapped individually which makes them very handy--I can toss just a couple in my purse, as opposed to others in a larger packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually had to follow up with some alcohol to clean my pores.</li>
            <li>Adequately wet and large.  </li>
            <li>These are ok but not great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a few Basics products in the past, and have liked them all.  </li>
            <li>this product just plain gets it ALL right.  </li>
            <li>I use Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths primarily as a makeup remover and secondarily for in between washes.    </li>
            <li>This product surprised me - I&#x27;d seen &#x27;alcohol-free&#x27; mentioned with such products before, only to find that something within the product *still* resulted in dryness, etc. -</li>
            <li>I will also use these as a quick cheat to see me through the first few hours of the morning if I am taking a late shower.  </li>
            <li>If you are trying to avoid some compounds know that the wipes contain Methylparben; Propylparaben and a few more compounds that I am not sure about.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good scent, not \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; and easy to keep a package in her schoolbag.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, this is especially nice.</li>
            <li> They are also great after walking around on a hot day on vacation or even at home.</li>
            <li> No Alcohol, Fragrance Free, non greasy residue is what I love!</li>
            <li> I love these cloths.</li>
            <li> Love these things.</li>
            <li> but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It is refreshing and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> well worth it - a good value.  </li>
            <li> But I have flown many times with these wipes in my carry-on without a problem.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if you do not use makeup or suffer from problem skin it would be okay.  </li>
            <li> love this product.  </li>
            <li> The name says it all - so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love to travel with these in my overnight bag</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to get out another one in these cases, to make sure it&#x27;s getting everything off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, I could do without it or with an even lighter one.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite face wipes ever.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re refreshing and don&#x27;t leave a residue on my face afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Individually wrapped towelettes are perfect to take to the gym, traveling, or anyplace.</li>
            <li> Singles for on the go :)&lt;br /&gt;Great for planes, weekends, gym bag, etc.</li>
            <li> If you have any blemishes, they will show more after you use the cloth.</li>
            <li> I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to submerge my hands in water to wash my face, so I purchased this pack of 4.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different disposable make-up remover cloths and these are just the best.</li>
            <li> They are excellent for oily and sensitive skin and leave you feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s great to have this product as an option for taking along for ANY time during which access to or use of a sink might be an issue (e.g. spending the night in a hospital waiting room, or in the hospital room of a loved one, or at a friend-of-a-friend&#x27;s home, or while on an extended road trip, or after a long flight, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> But in a pinch, after surgery, they were convenient and did the job pretty good.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my travel; at home I use the multi-pack, but if I use them to travel, the sealer doesn&#x27;t stay tacky and the towelettes dry out.  </li>
            <li> Just a clean feeling!  </li>
            <li> I love the light scent and the way it leaves my face feeling.</li>
            <li> Have used these for many years, great buy for quick soothing facial cleansing with no resulting dryness or irritation, handy for purse or travel</li>
            <li> They really are SO refreshing! :)</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> The cloths feel good, smell good (faintly of citrus) and are wonderful for a quick clean up.</li>
            <li> Love the clean feeling from this product</li>
            <li> These give me a quick refreshing.</li>
            <li> [it works great for neck, etc., of course, but my facial skin is waaaay</li>
            <li> leaves no residue so its great for use with my medical device.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice size for your whole face.  </li>
            <li> Great on the go facial cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Even my cat wants me to wipe her face with them, and they don&#x27;t sting the eyes and they have a nice odor to them.  </li>
            <li> i have an oily complexion and these do the trick to keep my face clean and oil free during the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are just about as truly fragrance and residue free as you might hope for, and they leave my face feeling clean and refreshed when I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a long time user and the price great.</li>
            <li> No clogged pores, no irritated skin, no dryness, no smelly anything - just clean, moist, refreshed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A quick and easy way to clean your face quickly and give yourself a pick-me-up.  </li>
            <li> They are refreshing and clean very well.  </li>
            <li> Also, &amp; impressively, use on one side of the cloth doesn&#x27;t result in stuff simply being absorbed all the way through - which allows me to use quadrants on one side of the cloth, &amp; then I fold it, &amp; use the remaining (&amp; unused) sides to gently clean the skin over &amp; below my (closed) eyes (something the chemicals in many cloths would render problematic), &amp; then my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are great for travel as you don&#x27;t have to take the whole box with you, only what you need for that trip.</li>
            <li> These are super handing when you are traveling and don&#x27;t want to pack eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that can break out very easily I have been using Basis cleanse Gel for years</li>
            <li> They are gentle for sensitive skin, very effective in removing make-up, and as they are individually packaged they are easy to pop into a purse or luggage for travel.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re refreshing and completely non-greasy and non-drying.</li>
            <li> But it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Nice to find a wipe that simply cleans without any residue.</li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t smell, and they do a great job of getting good holding mascara off after pressing down slightly on my lashes for about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Maybe not the most &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; though since it adds more waste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have a lovely fresh scent that dissipates pretty quickly, and they&#x27;re large enough to use on your face and chest.  </li>
            <li> Also, the cloths are very gentle and non drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely does the job--your face will feel clean and fresh, and the  cloth is pleasantly cool against your skin.  </li>
            <li> Of course a regular purchaser would notice the HUGE PRICE HIKE!</li>
            <li> Consistent quality over the years.  </li>
            <li> Love these facial wipes!</li>
            <li> We love the Basis Cleansing Cloths because they are individually wrapped which keeps each cloth moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been trying to find a refreshing facial cloth to use after my hot yoga classes.  </li>
            <li> i love this facial cleansing cloths</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but if that is your sole purpose, I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I also love the individual wrapping--great for traveling, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the part I like: I really love that these come individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t care for the smell, it is actually better than my Burt&#x27;s Bee wipes smell, but I don&#x27;t care for it , to me it is perfumey.  </li>
            <li> These are simply the best such facial wipes I have found, and my friends who I have shared them with agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft, refreshing, non-irritating, will take off make-up easily, and does not leave your skin dry or sticky.  </li>
            <li> use that triggered my testing this product at all (especially after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews) was for a loved one to use after returning home from surgery, given that they would not be able to stand up much for a few weeks after said surgery, &amp; thus washing their face was going to be an issue.  </li>
            <li> (this truly is a unisex product - it doesn&#x27;t smell feminine or masculine - it&#x27;s just *clean* &amp; *refreshing*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great on the go item for quick facial care in a to go packing, for those times when a sink is not available.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin completely clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> In addition to using them as face wipes, I use them to wipe off my hands, phone, shopping cart, and pretty much anything else.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to keep in my yoga bag to use after hot yoga classes -- and really like them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I buy always in large quantities, just in case.</li>
            <li> These whips are \\&quot;nice\\&quot; large size with a nice smell and like a heavy towel.</li>
            <li> Large enough for entire face, durable, and handy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They also work really well without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for keeping in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily complexion</li>
            <li> Are the individual wipes still available?</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin, so I never have any breakouts or issues with dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a toner after this and noticed it seems to cleanse better than a lot of the other cloths on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought Basis cleansing cloths to clean my face and remove makeup following hand surgery.</li>
            <li> This product ended up allowing her to clean her face conveniently &amp; effectively, &amp; to feel refreshed afterwards - the psychological boost that this product indirectly allowed was something the manufacturers might never have had in mind, but it really made a difference, &amp; without it, she would have felt a difficult-to-describe stress that was outright avoided, thanks to the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effectiveness of this product allows me to conveniently clean my face during overnight stays when visiting family - there are times when washing my face in the standard way is something I&#x27;d like to avoid if possible, due solely to its effect on my hair (rinsing, specifically</li>
            <li> They are also gentle enough that I&#x27;m comfortable using on my young daughter.</li>
            <li> These super convenient, individually wrapped cloths have ended my search.  </li>
            <li> I bought these cloths mainly for travel and for having in my purse in case I need to touch up makeup, etc between work and dinner at night or something.</li>
            <li> I really love all the Basis products, especially the facial cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li> I also love the individual packaging and the order I just placed had no individual wipes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re also super convenient for travel, especially if you&#x27;re taking a carry-on bag and are worried about liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Cloths are very soft and ingredients are very gentle--great for sensitive skin, or really any skin type.</li>
            <li> They do not leave my face dry, but clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I use the Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths for more sensitive spots and initial makeup removal before using my prescription wash.    </li>
            <li> The fact that these cloths are individually wrapped keeps them each moist and fresh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Importantly, it cleans well, &amp; the cloth is moist enough that it does not dry out quickly, &amp; allows one to truly clean the entire face without the cloth &#x27;running out&#x27;, &amp; without the cloth ripping or falling apart (the way some products do).  </li>
            <li> I pop a few in my carry on before a long flight, and am able to easily freshen up my face/neck without going to the bathroom and trying to balance above the sink.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and gentle and thorough cleansing cloths with delicate fragrance</li>
            <li> given the all-encompassing does-it-right nature of this product, it truly does allow for multi-faceted use, &amp; even for folks who have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They remove my makeup well and are very soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> [&amp; usually not neatly so]).  </li>
            <li> While this one isn&#x27;t on the exact same level as those were, they are close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and these don&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> *, *very* sensitive), &amp; without leaving any kind of smell behind</li>
            <li> This product has helped her face become smooth and little to no blemises.</li>
            <li> If we need to go somewhere very early in the morning (&amp; there are over a dozen people spending the night, &amp; nowhere near enough time for everyone to have major access to showers, etc.), or if I&#x27;d like to accompany someone for a brief early morning errand, etc., utilizing these cleansing cloths (at night before sleeping, &amp; then in the morning, to feel refreshed) allows me to have clean skin &amp; not have my hair look ridiculous during the relevant outing (I know that sounds laughable, but it&#x27;s true! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything at the store</li>
            <li> They work well for my 3 year old grandson&#x27;s sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like using it on more delicate parts of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> When I used Olay&#x27;s sensitive skin moist wipes, I still had to rinse afterward</li>
            <li> Lives you skin feeling soft supple and refreshed no matter where you are.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and no matter what I&#x27;ve done</li>
            <li> But it is astringent and, if you have a sensitive face, it will sting.  </li>
            <li> Generally I&#x27;m a big fan of the basis skin care, especially because of the otherworldly fresh lemongrass scent.</li>
            <li> it does a good cleaning job without any residue left behind.</li>
            <li> GREAT product that leaves one feeling clean &amp; refreshed, works with sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling dry, doesn&#x27;t leave behind a scent, utilizes a cloth that does not dry out or fall apart while using it, &amp; is definitely a product to keep in mind for anyone for whom temporary or permanent disability or temporary resource access interferes with standard &amp;/or convenient use of soap &amp; water -- &amp; is something which our family learned was terrific for use with a post-surgery patient at home when their mobility was limited.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in the southern humidity</li>
            <li> They are not wrapped individually which makes them very handy--I can toss just a couple in my purse, as opposed to others in a larger packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually had to follow up with some alcohol to clean my pores.</li>
            <li> Adequately wet and large.  </li>
            <li> These are ok but not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few Basics products in the past, and have liked them all.  </li>
            <li> this product just plain gets it ALL right.  </li>
            <li> I use Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths primarily as a makeup remover and secondarily for in between washes.    </li>
            <li> This product surprised me - I&#x27;d seen &#x27;alcohol-free&#x27; mentioned with such products before, only to find that something within the product *still* resulted in dryness, etc. -</li>
            <li> I will also use these as a quick cheat to see me through the first few hours of the morning if I am taking a late shower.  </li>
            <li> If you are trying to avoid some compounds know that the wipes contain Methylparben; Propylparaben and a few more compounds that I am not sure about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are much nicer for cleaning hands while traveling than other brands of wipes that make your hands (or car) smell funny or leave sticky residue behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, &amp; what ultimately makes this product stand out so far above &amp; beyond its peers, is the fact that in addition to all of what I&#x27;ve mentioned, it does all of this without making the skin feel dry or tight (something many of its peers utterly fail to accomplish) - I still marvel at this, after cleaning my face with these.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s inevitable that the aspects of hair closest to the face end up getting wet, etc.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for when you want to refresh your face after a long airplane ride.</li>
            <li> They are very hard to find in local stores (or impossible, really, at present), so I&#x27;m grateful for their availability here at Amazon, and at such a good price too.</li>
            <li> Due to acne prone skin, I have prescription facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would buy them again as they tend to dry out my face.</li>
            <li> No need to use face lotion after either because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> They work well for my winter dry skin and my teenagers are now using these as well to cleanse their faces to help prevent acne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does this product do everything one would expect it to do, but it does so without irritating the skin in any way (&amp; the skin on my face is *very</li>
            <li> I would give three stars for the convenience of the single wipe packaging, the softness and the fact that it does what it claims and removes my makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the small packets each individual towel comes in means that they won&#x27;t dry out the way that a larger package of 30 towels always seems to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it seems as though peers of this product at times attempt to moisten in a way that ends up clogging pores or otherwise leaving the skin feeling a bit odd (&amp; in my case, nearly all would typically still leave the skin dry &amp; tight, &amp; the moistening component would be something which both clogged my pores &amp; triggered a breakout) - but not this product...</li>
            <li> I opened up the boxes and stuffed a few of each into Christmas stockings for my female family members.  </li>
            <li> but that may just be a mental thing with me because of the package warning.  </li>
            <li> They are also thick and soft, almost lik a premium baby wipe.</li>
            <li> To work around TSA restrictions during travel, I previously took dry cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li> BUT NO MORE, because now the price is well over double what I used to pay for a package of 4 boxes with 20 wipes per box.</li>
            <li> I put one of these for every night I am away, and it simplifies the number of other sundries I need to pack.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;For one, they are extremely functional.</li>
            <li> you have been disappointed by every &amp;#34;facial cleansing wipe&amp;#34; you have tried, imho you owe yourself one more chance to find what you have been looking for in these.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish they were just slightly textured, not with bumps, but with a pattern or ridges for when I do have thicker make-up on.</li>
            <li> or my face would feel tight and itchy.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but</li>
            <li> (As a off-topic hint, for that, I buy the eye makeup wipes and put the number I need for a trip in a little snack size bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tough enough to stand up to my stubble, too.</li>
            <li> I used to refill travel size bottles of my make up remover, but after a few leaks all over everything else in my cosmetics, I changed to this method.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakout or dried out my face.  </li>
            <li> All three of those pale in comparison to these Basis cloths.</li>
            <li> Even tough mascara comes off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even recommended by my dermatologist--no added chemicals that could be irritating to skin.</li>
            <li> I like face wipes, but hate that they dry out if they are in a multipack.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These Basis wipes are great and convenient. I have been buying them for years. BUT NO MORE, because now the price is well over double what I used to pay for a package of 4 boxes with 20 wipes per box. What gives? Of course a regular purchaser would notice the HUGE PRICE HIKE!</li>
            <li> These are ok but not great. I don&#x27;t think I would buy them again as they tend to dry out my face. I will opt for ones that input moisture.</li>
            <li> i have an oily complexion and these do the trick to keep my face clean and oil free during the day. been using them for years.</li>
            <li> after i tried this amazing product, i reordered.  it does a good cleaning job without any residue left behind. would recommend for all skin types</li>
            <li> I love these cloths. They&#x27;re refreshing and completely non-greasy and non-drying. If they ever stop making this product, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do! I buy always in large quantities, just in case. Maybe they&#x27;ll sell out some day because I bought them all. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Consistent quality over the years.  They are very nice for travel or when you need to freshen up on the go!</li>
            <li> Love these things. Perfect for a day when I want to sit at home and not shower first thing. I can still get stuff done but feel like i&#x27;ve washed my face.  They are great for airplane too - when you fall asleep on plane and want to freshen up before you see your family. So easy to use. Moist , no residue. No need to use face lotion after either because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Good for after gym too.  Good to remove eye makeup too. Try the Basis face wash too - it&#x27;s divine!</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a cloth when I wake up in the morning.  I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything at the store but this is my favorite.  It is refreshing and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  I&#x27;ve used a toner after this and noticed it seems to cleanse better than a lot of the other cloths on the market.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my travel; at home I use the multi-pack, but if I use them to travel, the sealer doesn&#x27;t stay tacky and the towelettes dry out.  I put one of these for every night I am away, and it simplifies the number of other sundries I need to pack.  I used to refill travel size bottles of my make up remover, but after a few leaks all over everything else in my cosmetics, I changed to this method.  If you travel, they&#x27;re essential</li>
            <li> I have used Basis face cleanser for over 25 years.  I was delighted to find the face cloths!  They are excellent for travel and for a quick freshen up.  They work well for my 3 year old grandson&#x27;s sensitive skin and he can use them himself.  They do not leave my face dry, but clean feeling.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love these facial wipes! Large enough for entire face, durable, and handy. Great for travel too.</li>
            <li> Love these!  I opened up the boxes and stuffed a few of each into Christmas stockings for my female family members.  I kept one box for myself.  Great for purse, traveling, glove compartment.  Soft, refreshing, non-irritating, will take off make-up easily, and does not leave your skin dry or sticky.  A quick and easy way to clean your face quickly and give yourself a pick-me-up.  A little pricey, but well worth it - a good value.  Everyone I gave them to really liked them. I intend to buy more!</li>
            <li> I have always had some problem skin and these wipes never disappoint my skin.  It will take all my make up off, my sweat, I have used them on my legs and my arms.  The individual packed wipes are so convenient for a purse, gym bag, or even a wallet for a guy.  I have recommended these to all my nephew, and nieces who have acne prone skin and lead an athletic lifestyle. No Alcohol, Fragrance Free, non greasy residue is what I love!</li>
            <li> I use Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths primarily as a makeup remover and secondarily for in between washes.    Due to acne prone skin, I have prescription facial cleanser but I don&#x27;t like using it on more delicate parts of my face and neck.  I use the Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths for more sensitive spots and initial makeup removal before using my prescription wash.    I will also use these as a quick cheat to see me through the first few hours of the morning if I am taking a late shower.  When I used Olay&#x27;s sensitive skin moist wipes, I still had to rinse afterward or my face would feel tight and itchy.  Basis Facial wipes don&#x27;t cause this reaction on my skin.      To work around TSA restrictions during travel, I previously took dry cleansing cloths.  But I have flown many times with these wipes in my carry-on without a problem.  In the future I may face a situation where they balk, but until I do I will continue to take these in my travel case as well.    The 4 star is because I don&#x27;t know that I would recommend using these as the sole means of facial cleansing.  Perhaps if you do not use makeup or suffer from problem skin it would be okay.  Other than that, these are wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product surprised me - I&#x27;d seen &#x27;alcohol-free&#x27; mentioned with such products before, only to find that something within the product *still* resulted in dryness, etc. - but that&#x27;s NOT the case with this product - this product is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this product do everything one would expect it to do, but it does so without irritating the skin in any way (&amp; the skin on my face is *very*, *very* sensitive), &amp; without leaving any kind of smell behind (this truly is a unisex product - it doesn&#x27;t smell feminine or masculine - it&#x27;s just *clean* &amp; *refreshing*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Importantly, it cleans well, &amp; the cloth is moist enough that it does not dry out quickly, &amp; allows one to truly clean the entire face without the cloth &#x27;running out&#x27;, &amp; without the cloth ripping or falling apart (the way some products do).  Also, &amp; impressively, use on one side of the cloth doesn&#x27;t result in stuff simply being absorbed all the way through - which allows me to use quadrants on one side of the cloth, &amp; then I fold it, &amp; use the remaining (&amp; unused) sides to gently clean the skin over &amp; below my (closed) eyes (something the chemicals in many cloths would render problematic), &amp; then my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, &amp; what ultimately makes this product stand out so far above &amp; beyond its peers, is the fact that in addition to all of what I&#x27;ve mentioned, it does all of this without making the skin feel dry or tight (something many of its peers utterly fail to accomplish) - I still marvel at this, after cleaning my face with these.  And it seems as though peers of this product at times attempt to moisten in a way that ends up clogging pores or otherwise leaving the skin feeling a bit odd (&amp; in my case, nearly all would typically still leave the skin dry &amp; tight, &amp; the moistening component would be something which both clogged my pores &amp; triggered a breakout) - but not this product... this product just plain gets it ALL right.  No clogged pores, no irritated skin, no dryness, no smelly anything - just clean, moist, refreshed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  It&#x27;s WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And given the all-encompassing does-it-right nature of this product, it truly does allow for multi-faceted use, &amp; even for folks who have very sensitive skin (this is the ONLY cleansing cloth that has ever &#x27;worked&#x27; with my face [it works great for neck, etc., of course, but my facial skin is waaaay sensitive]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A use that triggered my testing this product at all (especially after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews) was for a loved one to use after returning home from surgery, given that they would not be able to stand up much for a few weeks after said surgery, &amp; thus washing their face was going to be an issue.  This product ended up allowing her to clean her face conveniently &amp; effectively, &amp; to feel refreshed afterwards - the psychological boost that this product indirectly allowed was something the manufacturers might never have had in mind, but it really made a difference, &amp; without it, she would have felt a difficult-to-describe stress that was outright avoided, thanks to the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effectiveness of this product allows me to conveniently clean my face during overnight stays when visiting family - there are times when washing my face in the standard way is something I&#x27;d like to avoid if possible, due solely to its effect on my hair (rinsing, specifically - it&#x27;s inevitable that the aspects of hair closest to the face end up getting wet, etc. [&amp; usually not neatly so]).  If we need to go somewhere very early in the morning (&amp; there are over a dozen people spending the night, &amp; nowhere near enough time for everyone to have major access to showers, etc.), or if I&#x27;d like to accompany someone for a brief early morning errand, etc., utilizing these cleansing cloths (at night before sleeping, &amp; then in the morning, to feel refreshed) allows me to have clean skin &amp; not have my hair look ridiculous during the relevant outing (I know that sounds laughable, but it&#x27;s true! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s great to have this product as an option for taking along for ANY time during which access to or use of a sink might be an issue (e.g. spending the night in a hospital waiting room, or in the hospital room of a loved one, or at a friend-of-a-friend&#x27;s home, or while on an extended road trip, or after a long flight, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GREAT product that leaves one feeling clean &amp; refreshed, works with sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling dry, doesn&#x27;t leave behind a scent, utilizes a cloth that does not dry out or fall apart while using it, &amp; is definitely a product to keep in mind for anyone for whom temporary or permanent disability or temporary resource access interferes with standard &amp;/or convenient use of soap &amp; water -- &amp; is something which our family learned was terrific for use with a post-surgery patient at home when their mobility was limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have used these for many years, great buy for quick soothing facial cleansing with no resulting dryness or irritation, handy for purse or travel</li>
            <li> The name says it all - so refreshing. The cloths feel good, smell good (faintly of citrus) and are wonderful for a quick clean up. I take them along whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> Individually wrapped make up remover wipes are perfect for our beach vacation rental- good price/sheet too. My dermatologist even recommends basis</li>
            <li> I am a long time user and the price great. I love to travel with these in my overnight bag and they are wonderful for camping trips.</li>
            <li> We love the Basis Cleansing Cloths because they are individually wrapped which keeps each cloth moist. Also, the cloths are very gentle and non drying to the skin. They are great for travel as you don&#x27;t have to take the whole box with you, only what you need for that trip. We have been using these cloths for over 10 years now.</li>
            <li> Great on the go item for quick facial care in a to go packing, for those times when a sink is not available.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that can break out very easily I have been using Basis cleanse Gel for years but when I found this singles I had to have them they are so quick and great! Lives you skin feeling soft supple and refreshed no matter where you are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been trying to find a refreshing facial cloth to use after my hot yoga classes.  These super convenient, individually wrapped cloths have ended my search.  They are moist, clean smelling (without being in any way overpowering), and are a perfect size and thickness.  I&#x27;ve used Alba, Simple, and Neutrogena cleansing cloths.  All three of those pale in comparison to these Basis cloths.</li>
            <li> These are super handing when you are traveling and don&#x27;t want to pack eye makeup remover. They are great for removing mascara. They don&#x27;t do a thorough job cleansing skin, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to. They will do in a pinch though if you just want to get the makeup off before bed and put off a proper cleansing until morning.</li>
            <li> Love the clean feeling from this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to fulfill the void of a good face wipe since L&#x27;Oreal got rid of the ones I used to use all the time. While this one isn&#x27;t on the exact same level as those were, they are close. I don&#x27;t feel like I have to wash my face after, they don&#x27;t smell, and they do a great job of getting good holding mascara off after pressing down slightly on my lashes for about 10 seconds. I don&#x27;t feel as though I have to scrub my face either to get makeup off. My only complaint is I wish they were just slightly textured, not with bumps, but with a pattern or ridges for when I do have thicker make-up on. Sometimes I have to get out another one in these cases, to make sure it&#x27;s getting everything off. A texture would help this.</li>
            <li> i love this facial cleansing cloths they just great i always put one in my pocket i also have a box of 20 in my car these cleansing cloth are great</li>
            <li> I bought these cloths mainly for travel and for having in my purse in case I need to touch up makeup, etc between work and dinner at night or something. I like face wipes, but hate that they dry out if they are in a multipack. I don&#x27;t use them often enough to buy a big package, so I like these, which are individually wrapped. I pop a few in my carry on before a long flight, and am able to easily freshen up my face/neck without going to the bathroom and trying to balance above the sink. They are also great after walking around on a hot day on vacation or even at home. They really are SO refreshing! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do remove makeup, but not completely--particularly eye makeup, even the non-waterproof kind. It&#x27;s OK, but if that is your sole purpose, I would look elsewhere. (As a off-topic hint, for that, I buy the eye makeup wipes and put the number I need for a trip in a little snack size bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, I could do without it or with an even lighter one.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite face wipes ever. Generally I&#x27;m a big fan of the basis skin care, especially because of the otherworldly fresh lemongrass scent. But Basis has outdone itself with these wipes. FABULOUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, they are extremely functional. They are not wrapped individually which makes them very handy--I can toss just a couple in my purse, as opposed to others in a larger packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also work really well without drying out my skin. In addition to using them as face wipes, I use them to wipe off my hands, phone, shopping cart, and pretty much anything else. Even tough mascara comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend these highly enough. I&#x27;ve sent a couple boxes to friends and everybody that is tried them vows they will never switch back to anything else. Give them a try.</li>
            <li> leaves no residue so its great for use with my medical device.  Leaves skin completely clean and soft.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleansing cloth/pad I&#x27;ve continued to use, and have been for years!  No fragrances, no filmy or sticky feeling after use. Just a clean feeling!  Cloths are very soft and ingredients are very gentle--great for sensitive skin, or really any skin type. Even recommended by my dermatologist--no added chemicals that could be irritating to skin. I also love the individual wrapping--great for traveling, etc. and no drying out of the cloths at the bottom of the container!  Maybe not the most &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; though since it adds more waste. But it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and no matter what I&#x27;ve done I always feel oily on and around my face. These give me a quick refreshing. Tough enough to stand up to my stubble, too.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for keeping in my purse.  Its a nice size for your whole face.  I have very oily complexion and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakout or dried out my face.  I would recommend for when you want to refresh your face after a long airplane ride.</li>
            <li> Great on the go facial cleansing.  Adequately wet and large.  Love them!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a wipe that I like as well as the Burt&#x27;s Bee wipes but with a smell I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the part I like: I really love that these come individually wrapped.  I bought them thinking that they would be great for travel and to keep in my purse.  They remove my makeup well and are very soft. I wear a mineral powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second the parts I don&#x27;t like.  I personally don&#x27;t care for the smell, it is actually better than my Burt&#x27;s Bee wipes smell, but I don&#x27;t care for it , to me it is perfumey.  And I feel like I have to rinse after I use them, but that may just be a mental thing with me because of the package warning.  The package these come in warns to keep out of reach of children and to avoid contact with eyes. So I feel like I need to rinse.  If you are trying to avoid some compounds know that the wipes contain Methylparben; Propylparaben and a few more compounds that I am not sure about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would give three stars for the convenience of the single wipe packaging, the softness and the fact that it does what it claims and removes my makeup. But I don&#x27;t like them well enough to buy them again.</li>
            <li> Best cleansing cloths ever!</li>
            <li> I work in the restaraunt industry and greasy kitchens make you feel gross especially if you are on a double. I got these specifically because they were individually packed so you can carry them even in your pocket if needed. I will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found these convenient wipes available from Amazon.  They are refreshing and clean very well.  I use these daily to remove makeup and lotion from my face and neck.  They work well for my winter dry skin and my teenagers are now using these as well to cleanse their faces to help prevent acne.  Nice to find a wipe that simply cleans without any residue.</li>
            <li> I really love all the Basis products, especially the facial cleansing cloths.  They&#x27;re refreshing and don&#x27;t leave a residue on my face afterwards.  I also like them because they&#x27;re convenient as I can take them anywhere.  Even my cat wants me to wipe her face with them, and they don&#x27;t sting the eyes and they have a nice odor to them.  Since I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, this is especially nice.</li>
            <li> Great for morning, quick wipe off of face.  Refreshing.  Use heaver cleaner at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I have been using these wipes for years. I love the light scent and the way it leaves my face feeling. I also love the individual packaging and the order I just placed had no individual wipes. Just the packages with bulk wipes. Are the individual wipes still available?</li>
            <li> Individually wrapped towelettes are perfect to take to the gym, traveling, or anyplace. Gentle on the skin, so I never have any breakouts or issues with dryness. A perfect 10</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few Basics products in the past, and have liked them all.  I ordered these to keep in my yoga bag to use after hot yoga classes -- and really like them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a lovely fresh scent that dissipates pretty quickly, and they&#x27;re large enough to use on your face and chest.  They leave your skin feeling nicely moisturized afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the small packets each individual towel comes in means that they won&#x27;t dry out the way that a larger package of 30 towels always seems to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also super convenient for travel, especially if you&#x27;re taking a carry-on bag and are worried about liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and these don&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Singles for on the go :)&lt;br /&gt;Great for planes, weekends, gym bag, etc.</li>
            <li> These are simply the best such facial wipes I have found, and my friends who I have shared them with agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are just about as truly fragrance and residue free as you might hope for, and they leave my face feeling clean and refreshed when I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been disappointed by every &amp;#34;facial cleansing wipe&amp;#34; you have tried, imho you owe yourself one more chance to find what you have been looking for in these.</li>
            <li> These are much nicer for cleaning hands while traveling than other brands of wipes that make your hands (or car) smell funny or leave sticky residue behind.</li>
            <li> Definitely does the job--your face will feel clean and fresh, and the  cloth is pleasantly cool against your skin.  But it is astringent and, if you have a sensitive face, it will sting.  If you have any blemishes, they will show more after you use the cloth.</li>
            <li> These wipes are very mild and pleasantly scented. They are excellent for oily and sensitive skin and leave you feeling clean and refreshed.  They are also thick and soft, almost lik a premium baby wipe. I live in the southern humidity so I always keep a pack of these in my car for she sweltering days that leave you feeling waterlogged with sweat. They are also gentle enough that I&#x27;m comfortable using on my young daughter. I love these wipes!</li>
            <li> I take these riding in the saddle bags they work great to freshen up with</li>
            <li> The fact that these cloths are individually wrapped keeps them each moist and fresh.  They&#x27;re the best cleansing cloths I have found.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and gentle and thorough cleansing cloths with delicate fragrance</li>
            <li> I bought Basis cleansing cloths to clean my face and remove makeup following hand surgery. I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to submerge my hands in water to wash my face, so I purchased this pack of 4. They do a pretty good job. When wearing makeup, I found I needed two cleansing cloths. They don&#x27;t do as thorough a job as soap, water, and washcloth though. I usually had to follow up with some alcohol to clean my pores. But in a pinch, after surgery, they were convenient and did the job pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different disposable make-up remover cloths and these are just the best. They are gentle for sensitive skin, very effective in removing make-up, and as they are individually packaged they are easy to pop into a purse or luggage for travel. They are very hard to find in local stores (or impossible, really, at present), so I&#x27;m grateful for their availability here at Amazon, and at such a good price too.</li>
            <li> These whips are \\&quot;nice\\&quot; large size with a nice smell and like a heavy towel. I was looking for the neutrogena or oil of olay and these two do not make them&lt;br /&gt;in a indiviual wrap item for my purse,car ! I found these and said I try them ...I order 4 boxes 2 to give away and two for my self I will deff order again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin. This product has helped her face become smooth and little to no blemises. Good scent, not \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; and easy to keep a package in her schoolbag.</li>
