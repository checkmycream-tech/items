            <li>It strips excess oil very well and is best with a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how effective it&#x27;s been in getting rid of the mites, though the strained vision that prompted my trip to the optometrist has improved.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo seems really effective in what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>It smells soooo good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with that &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; feeling like most shampoos do .</li>
            <li>Everyone liked my hair.</li>
            <li>However, in the days after trying this shampoo, my scalp felt nice and flake-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am using this in combo with Jojoba Oil sold on Amazon by Leven Rose.</li>
            <li>Not girly nice but really nice.</li>
            <li>, it cleans oily hair very well, let scalp feeling wonderful and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Kind of worked.</li>
            <li>That had me kind of nervous</li>
            <li>Although the Tea Tree Oil Shampoo  from Maple Holistics smells spectacular and made my hair feel fresh,I found that after about a week of using it my scalp felt a bit oily.</li>
            <li>After shampooing, I used the Maple Holistics conditioner, and that made my hair really nice, but I had to use a lot of conditioner.</li>

            <li>The product is great but deserves a better quality label that doesn&#x27;t scratch easily.</li>

            <li>Make sure to follow the instructions on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It turns out most people have them, so you might want to look into it too.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I just got my hair colored and was looking for color safe shampoo.</li>
            <li>I swear my name to it, it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the fact that it worked within weeks of continuous use.</li>
            <li>so I feel like I&#x27;m using more then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dandruff for so many days</li>
            <li>My scalp feels way better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about 2 weeks now and am still quite pleased.</li>
            <li>but I will be sure to try it on them, too.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo it got rid of my dandruff</li>
            <li>and i really like that it has tea tree oil because that&#x27;s great for the hair</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the lavender smell because it&#x27;s not empowering!</li>
            <li>You cant ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>But I still like it :)</li>
            <li>and I could feel healthy for my hair.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to come across this product.  </li>
            <li>I’m glad someone recommended this product.</li>
            <li>so i will hopefully  purchase  more soon.</li>
            <li>, i ordered again and this time purchased  3 bottles, i really love it for all my families</li>
            <li>Smells okay</li>
            <li>and I am SO pleased.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it does seem to be a bit more drying than the winter blend.</li>
            <li>I love how refreshed I feel after I use it.</li>
            <li>and we both love it.</li>
            <li>We love the smell</li>

            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth and will definatley managable!</li>
            <li>I bought these products not to make my hair look like the commercialized beauties we see on magazines or TV but to be healthy.</li>
            <li>We love the maple holistics products.</li>
            <li>we would but it more often).</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>I got it as a gift from a friend because she knows how much I love the smell of tea tree.</li>
            <li>The trick is finding which ones work for you, but once you figure that out, rotate, I would say, 3 or more brands.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the lavender smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have been exercising more and sweating more causing breakouts on my scalp and hairline.</li>
            <li>Sure, head and shoulders did the trick</li>
            <li>and then i followed the instructions, rinsed my hair and it was like magic.</li>
            <li>Glad I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Opening the product smells overwhelmingly like pine or some sort of foliage smell (i guess tea tree oil smell?)</li>
            <li>but it smells ok.</li>
            <li>Really fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I would love to know more about the ingredients -- perhaps the company could submit to EWG for their review?</li>
            <li>I love how it makes her hair feel and smell.</li>
            <li>I chose the sage shampoo since that seemed to give the best potential to address his condition.  </li>
            <li>, I fell in Love.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to keep putting in more and more</li>
            <li>I love this n</li>
            <li>Wish they made more conditioners as well.</li>
            <li>Glad I stumbled onto this brand and product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of tea tree oil, this shampoo will endear itself to you as it has me.</li>
            <li>i tried so many products....</li>
            <li>I LOVE this Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product more than once</li>
            <li>and it really satisfied me.</li>
            <li>but I am flake free!  </li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>id love to try it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>But now, I&#x27;m dandruff free!</li>
            <li>but I tried a vinegar rinse after washing and the static was gone.  </li>
            <li>Soon, we started to notice plaques of &amp;#34;crust&amp;#34; on his head that were covering most of the top of his head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After just a couple of uses, it was noticeably better than ever.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll keep on buying for sure.</li>
            <li>I am free of dandruff in just a month!</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s more to that.</li>
            <li>I love how this shampoo makes my hair smell like this for 2 days.</li>
            <li>The sent is lovely but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Things have gotten better with continued use of this product, and I&#x27;m thinking that the issues that I still have with my hair will work themselves out over time and with more use.</li>
            <li>but I tend to like this one better because of the lavender ingredient</li>
            <li>many years of itchy.scalp and dandruff</li>
            <li>Love feeling of my scalp after use..</li>
            <li>But I like this shampoo better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still drying my hair out, and I&#x27;m losing the motivation to keep trusting that it might get better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still drying my hair out, and I&#x27;m losing the motivation to keep trusting that it might get better.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re patient you&#x27;ll be glad you used this shampoo.</li>
            <li>one wash helped my scalp feel better.</li>

            <li>Much better with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Just one testament among many.</li>

            <li>Plus all of the benefits I&#x27;ve tried so many products for me and my daughter and</li>

            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos strip hair and necessitate the use of conditioner, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks now and love it -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just over the top in love with this shampoo and at what it did to my hair and scalp.</li>

            <li>Satisfied</li>
            <li>From many reviews, customers stated a tingling feeling</li>
            <li>I once meet difficulty to order from Kiehl&#x27;s web site, so tried Maple Holistics Shampoo for Oily, Itchy &amp; Greasy Hair with Organic Rosemary, Peach Kernel and Jojoba, and I find I quite love it.</li>
            <li>I also tried this Tea Tree one, and I love it, too.</li>
            <li>I also love the way my hair feels after washing.</li>
            <li>so I plan to stick with this and continue healthy eating and supplements.</li>
            <li>My sister told me about this,actually she showed me.her hair and face kept looking better each time I saw</li>

            <li>I love the way this smells as well.</li>
            <li>A lot of natural products with tea tree don&#x27;t smell great, but I really liked this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna have to order some more soon.</li>
            <li>and I went on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li>After using a sample of this shampoo for 2 weeks, I am very much satisfied with my reduced dandruff problem and also hair loss problem.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is effective, feels good while I&#x27;m letting it sit in my hair for the couple of minutes suggested, and I don&#x27;t need to use a whole pile of it every wash.</li>
            <li>This then produces the amazing result of healthier, fast growing hair!!!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as it says and your scalp will tingle pleasantly after using...</li>
            <li>I tried this product based on the positive reviews and have to say it is amazing!  </li>
            <li>and after several uses, my scalp quit itching and my hair looks better than ever!!!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells amazing, it is definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel clean and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells very clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the amazing products!</li>
            <li>it smells great and is real soft after i blowdry my hair.</li>
            <li>end result was pretty surprising.</li>
            <li>Notably, it does not smell intensely like tea tree oil (which is nice), and yet seems quite effective and non-drying.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent choice for managing and restoring dry hair.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and cleans well, just don&#x27;t know that it helps as much as we would have liked.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much to this wonderful shampoo!!!!!</li>
            <li>It had great slip and I was able to glide through my natural hair easily.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed that I just placed an order for more shampoo for him and added other products for our family to the order.</li>
            <li>Great for a guy and the young men in my house like it to.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so healthy and dandruff free since forever.</li>
            <li>So far this shampoo has worked great for me.love it..</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the smooth texture and the way it leaves my hair feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it works on dandruff and calms an itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this shampoo so far has been great.</li>
            <li>So far the shampoo works great.</li>
            <li>I have seen results faster than expected &amp; the smell is wonderful as well.</li>
            <li>this shampoo smells great and makes your hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and it makes my hair smell good, too.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t rate the product fairly, but I wanted to make a note that that this does contain Argan Oil (which I did not see listed on the Amazon ingredient page).</li>
            <li>It really helped with my scalp and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I read the description, it sounded good, I have been using it for a a couple weeks now and it does its job very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not intensely UNpleasant, however, it IS very strong.</li>
            <li>It is very nice that it is all natural with organic ingredients, but I bought it because it claims to help dandruff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to keep using this and see how healthy my hair becomes.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a bit pricey at first glance but boy am I glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo, it leaves your hair nice and shiny and gets rid of dandruff lightning fast.</li>
            <li>The salon brand I was using is more economical, but I feel better using Maple Holistics because I know it&#x27;s healthier for my hair.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m still struggling with losing lots of strands of hair and very mild dandruff.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair and scalp feel healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>Love the tingly clean feeling when I&#x27;m done washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it, after just a couple of uses the scalp has calmed, the hair is clean.</li>
            <li>Since it is available at Amazon with free shipping, it is much more convenient for me to order.</li>
            <li>My hair splits easily</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a decent foaming agent so more isn&#x27;t necessarily better; using the minimum effective amount is important.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong of tea tree (it smells kinda like vics vapor rub to me)</li>
            <li>and i strongly recommend this product fro those who have dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but nothing special .</li>
            <li>feel very clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the biggest thing I noticed - it smells clean (not the chemical clean but the outdoor spring kind of clean).</li>
            <li>Not only is great with improving my dandruff, it leaves my hair light and silky smooth!</li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth and soft and it stays that way the whole day using just this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash rinse and repeat faithfully to get the full effect of its healing qualities.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with Maple Holistics and am going back to look for more product!</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo twice and my hair feels so full and healthy.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it leaves your hair feeling really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo , keeps my head clean and clear of dandruff.</li>
            <li>Great product, leaves my hair clean, soft and with no dandruff.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST DANDRUFF SHAMPOO ON THE MARKET HANDS DOWN.</li>
            <li>They smell amazing and make my hair feel so soft!! :)</li>
            <li>I have tried this shampoo previously and it smells and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It is a fine product from a fine company.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for an itchy scalp and it has helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t comfortable scrubbing my hair or any part on my body (for that matter) with strong chemicals that were never meant for my body which my body in turn - rejects anyways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healing properties can be noticed rather quickly, and it has a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>When you use it, your hair feels amazingly clean- like SWEAKY clean!</li>
            <li>His psoriasis is absolutely getting better!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling frizzy or weighed down, rather, my hair feels light, free flowing and smelling of delightful tea tree oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good an dis quite effective for dry scalp!</li>
            <li>Not only is it sulphur free, it lathers great &amp; truly conditions my hair &amp; scalp.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a more natural one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 3 months now and it has made a HUGE change.</li>
            <li>I stopped having huge masses of hair in the drain after every shower and the hair that stayed on my head has thickened up noticeably.  </li>
            <li>Huge flakes would fall out of my hair when I take of my shirt or hoodie, and it&#x27;s visible too because my hair is brown.</li>
            <li>smoothly lavender, it just relaxes me!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Wanted a tea tree oil to help treat my dandruff while remaining free of parabens etc.  </li>
            <li>I have light dandruff sometimes</li>
            <li>This shampoo fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>and I also don&#x27;t ever hear him complain about flakes or his head itching, which in my opinion is a double win for me.</li>
            <li>I am happy to finally have found something that works for my hair!</li>
            <li>BUT I wanted a shampoo that wasn&#x27;t filled with chemicals and stumbled upon Maple Holistic Tea tree oil shampoo.</li>
            <li>smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this with the Silk 18 conditioner and the combination is fantastic.</li>
            <li>She loves that it takes care of her issues and says that is smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>He suggested I switch to a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>have been so happy with this product that I even decided to get a different product in the Maple Holistics line for my boyfriend to try.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a sulphate free shampoo (I got a Brazilian Blowout) that would help me out</li>
            <li>After applying it, it feels nice on the scalp and it appears to be working very well for controlling dandruff.</li>
            <li>The bonus to Maple Holistics shampoo, is that it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say my color faded slower, which I was hoping for since it is sulfate free -</li>
            <li>I want to avoid SLS which is in all commonly available shampoos.</li>
            <li>It feels almost light and airy.</li>
            <li>I have 4c hair that is styled in free form dreadlocks.  </li>
            <li>Although I use this shampoo in conjunction with their Silk 18 conditioner, my hair is smooth and tangle-free even before conditioning.</li>
            <li>like it ) makes my hair so smooth , so dandruff  after this shampoo</li>
            <li>and it is for sure worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I was told tea tree will help the health of my scalp, so I ordered this fabulous shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I was sent a free gift of this shampoo from the company.</li>
            <li>but this shampoo makes my hair frizz free and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Dont think you have to buy Big brand names to have a great product.</li>
            <li>Also it has the good smell plus its all natural thats why i decide to get this product</li>
            <li>I chose to try this out based on it being natural and holistic, as well as all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>This has kept my color looking good so far.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product!!!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it also softens my hair, as my hair is mostly gray and coarse</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This is good since sulfates strip away natural oils on your head and parabens have been linked to hormone disruption.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this is a good product.</li>
            <li>and she loved it as she has completely gray hair</li>
            <li>Sometimes I do get dry scalp and this product really helps, but it is also great for every day cleansing, it&#x27;s scent is very refreshing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but damn, is it worth every cent! :D</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this shampoo, makes my hair feel soft and clean!!</li>
            <li>Besides the smell, I love how it keeps my hair smooth, soft and very easy to brush.</li>
            <li>It worked really well!!!</li>
            <li>It helped with my dandruff so much!!!</li>
            <li>Works for me, thanks!!!</li>
            <li>It has given me a very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>It leaves our hair feeling clean, smelling nice, and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>Is the original still available?</li>
            <li>The tea tree isn&#x27;t super strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>The kind that is not irritating to the nose but really sweet  with a citrusy hint.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo lathered up very nicely for me and left my hair feeling exceptionally clean after washing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone dealing with any kind of scalp irritation or dandruff issues.</li>
            <li>As opposed to most anti-dandruff shampoos, this is very gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fairly strong and kind of masculine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that it contains botanical ingredients and no harsh ingredients or parabens, and that it is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>After using it a second time, I can see that it&#x27;s working nicely!</li>
            <li>Original Review:  </li>
            <li>Iordered the tea tree shampoo and was instantly excited by the smell when I took off the safety seal.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you notice is the smell, which is really refreshing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I was absolutely excited to use this product after I read the reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I first started out with their conditioner and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I received this shampoo on monday and have been using it for the past 3 days and already am impressed with it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very dense, medium-long hair.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t really need to use that much to get a good lather going.  </li>
            <li>I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, and this is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used that actually addresses my scalp issues.</li>
            <li>Smells great and cleared up my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>My scalp tends to get dry, so this was a great product to sooth my irritated skin.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a mild fragrance, and is sulpher- free, a plus in my book.  </li>
            <li>No drying, just clean.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo gets my hair clean and leaves my purple intact to shine another day.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil shampoo always makes my hair feel so clean</li>
            <li>I love natural products and try to use more of them in my routine.</li>
            <li>My scalp is itchy after using &amp; my hair does not feel clean.</li>
            <li>I can feel how it purifies the scalp and leaves the hair clean and shinny.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stand not feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of the bottle, the fantastic smell, and how gentle it is on your scalp and skin.</li>
            <li>knowing that they use clean ingredients doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a head and shoulders user for many years, and wanted to find something more natural to treat my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so clean afterwards; it gets rid of all the tangles too.</li>
            <li>I used to have dry scalp and hair and this shampoo has been doing a great job at keeping it moisturized and  clean since day 1.</li>
            <li>My scalp also feels clean.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t really clean my hair, but it also won&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>It smells great without any heavy perfumes, and it makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I got the same tingle and results as the stronger scented tea trees, but with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The shampoo came a day sooner than I anticipated, was a pleasant surprise and just in time I used the last of mine and needed it that day.</li>
            <li>I wish I had a positive review like most others but this shampoo just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>I have purchased this directly from maple holistics, I love the product!</li>
            <li>This shampoo seemed to dry out my scalp even more and cause more itching and more dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I am used to using the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo, which costs me $28 every week or so.</li>
            <li>My hair gets very dry during the winter and thinks works great at keeping the flakes at bay.</li>
            <li>It is still nice and refreshing, but not quite as strong as other tea tree products.</li>
            <li>With bright purple tresses, regular shampoo STRIPS out my color, even those marketed as color boosting!</li>
            <li>the shampoo itself smells okay, but the things it does for your hair really make up for it</li>
            <li>This is a really good product, I&#x27;m going to try different one now the one for greasy hair.</li>
            <li>This leaves your head feeling cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s overall a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>It really changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li>My hair is generally healthy, but I&#x27;ve colored it and appreciate how gentle this shampoo is.</li>
            <li>However, after I use this, my mind was totally changed because Lavender smell was good</li>
            <li>I might try another lavender shampoo and if its not as good i&#x27;ll go back to this one.</li>
            <li>I love it, It helps out so much with our condition we were having with our hair.</li>
            <li>I looked around on Amazon and liked that this was all natural and did not include sulfates.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it really help my scalp when it was so itchy</li>
            <li>and I still have a good bit left.</li>
            <li>It took a about 3 applications for my hair and scalp to get the full effect</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and how fast it works.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and leaves my scalp moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very relaxing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It cleans it gently so that your scalp can produce a healthy balance of sebum.</li>
            <li>It probably takes longer than just a week to get the full result.</li>
            <li>I received a full sized bottle to sample.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate a safe shampoo that treats dandruff.</li>
            <li>I decided on this shampoo because I was starting to get dandruff, and I think it was a good decision.</li>
            <li>I also really like the smell, which is mostly rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many other shampoos I have used have a very chemically smell, and this one does not - the lavender, rosemary and tea tree oil make for a great scent.  </li>
            <li>Great substitute (and in my opinion superior choice) for those looking for an alternative to head and shoulders or other similar shampoos.</li>
            <li>, my hair felt soft and it smelled great, i like the fact that it is all natural!</li>
            <li>(my face is usually pretty sensitive) and I got kind of a burning/ cooling sensation there more than the rest of my scalp (kind of like putting vick vaporrub on - similar sensation).</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed with the tree oil shampoo is the light clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>Its a great value for the price as well as retail stores charge an arm and a leg for other Tea Tree Shampoo&#x27;s and those don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband for mild dandruff.</li>
            <li>Cleared up mild dandruff caused by eczema</li>
            <li>Super bummed that it didn&#x27;t work for my dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I had mild dandruff and once I started this shampoo, dandruff was gone.</li>
            <li>I only bought 1 bottle to try it and since the first wash, it was amazing results!</li>
            <li>Shampoo has a mild scent.</li>
            <li>I have mild dandruff and this cleared it up really quickly without stripping my hair.</li>
            <li>She gets mild dandruff in the wintertime and swears that this is a heaven send.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so mild, it doesn&#x27;t even smell like an anti-dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li>I don;t have dandruff but what made me totally fall in love with this shampoo  is the super lovely smell.</li>
            <li>It feels super</li>
            <li>Smells great and left his hair nice and shiny and controls his dry skin that he sometimes gets in the winter time.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and am sure the results will only get better.</li>
            <li>have used a lot of shampoos and hair treatments but of no use.&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo gave me extraordinary results reduced hair fall</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a little damaged and this shampoo is doing beautiful things for me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a great all natural alternative to chemical filled standard dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural shampoos and most do not rinse well and leave my hair with a lot of residue and a very itchy scalp after one day.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every other day and so far the shampoo has been excellent in controlling dandruff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks and it started working the very first time.  </li>
            <li>Clean, refreshing, and natural...</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the thought of it being completely organic, if there&#x27;s such a thing anymore.</li>
            <li>This shampoo took away my dandruff and left my hair feeling so healthy and clean!</li>
            <li>He is comfortable, it smells great, we really have no complaints (other than the fact that we wish it was cheaper -</li>
            <li>I love it, and it has already sprouted out loads of new &#x27;baby hairs&#x27;</li>
            <li>Previously I used the Sage Shampoo with great results.  </li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t dry my hair out, and I love that it&#x27;s natural and full of good ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I recommend a good hydrating condition with use of this shampoo as it tends to dry my hair out some.</li>
            <li>It keeps the head fresh and free of dandruff and it&#x27;s priced very well too!</li>
            <li>My only faults with this were that the smell wasn&#x27;t very strong nor did it leave my scalp feeling super tingly clean.  </li>
            <li>Better than any dandruff shampoo on the market, I have VERY sensitive skin and this shampoo</li>
            <li>On the positive side I like the scent, and after using it for over a week it appears to keep my light dandruff under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much!!</li>
            <li>I am still working on my first bottle!</li>
            <li>Has a unique feature that aids in healing scalp disorders with consistent usage without drying out the scalp itself.</li>
            <li>I was instantly impressed with the feeling it left after the first use, and it cleared up the majority of the dandruff by the second use!  </li>

            <li>This shampoo smells great and is very soothing for a dry, itchy scalp in the winter.</li>
            <li>It really leaves my hair soft, strong, healthy, and manageable.</li>

            <li>It left my hair feeling amazing and my dandruff is nolonger a problem.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing line of&lt;br /&gt;Products</li>
            <li>I looked for alternatives and wanted something natural and safe for color treated hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the purchase if you have scalp or dandruff issues.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>He says (and we can clearly see) that this product managed to eliminate most of the dandruff from his hair.</li>
            <li>cause no irritation and is well worth every penny</li>
            <li>It left my hair smelling great and feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>It has so many natural.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li>This shampoo is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something more natural to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>so thats a nice extra bonus</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s all good after I use the Silk 18 shampoo by the same company (http://www.amazon.com/SALE-Natural-Conditioner-Maple-Holistics/dp/B00L1KFQKC/ref&#x3D;pd_bxgy_bt_img_y)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 stars and I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>I was exspecting more considering the smell, but was still pleasently surprised.  </li>
            <li>So far I have really enjoyed this shampoo just with</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I found an anti-dandruff shampoo that brought me back in time over thirty years.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews for products, but I felt obligated to let people know that this shampoo works unlike anything else we had tried, including prescription</li>
            <li>|There&#x27;s a distinct level of tea tree oil scent that I like</li>
            <li>but I figured if it worked, it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>So far I like the product and will probably buy more for me and my husband.</li>
            <li>Reading the label i love the fact its practically all natural.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely purchasing my own bottle.</li>
            <li>So far, I love this shampoo and will be reordering.  </li>
            <li>My scalp and hair feel so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only reason I deduct one star is it&#x27;s kind of pricey.</li>
            <li>leaves hair fresh but still dandruff</li>
            <li>No flakes, not dry feeling, pretty happy with the result so far.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new dandruff shampoo that was more gentle and yet more efficient at the same time; luckily I found it!</li>
            <li>It smells really good and within a few uses I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is a unique and lasting scent; you&#x27;ll surely have people asking you what products you use,</li>
            <li>I have mild dandruff and this shampoo really helps!</li>
            <li>Conventional shampoos really irritate me (too many chemicals), so I was really pleased to find this fantastic alternative.</li>
            <li>Only did 4 stars because I used some other new products during blow dry and straightening and they may have had a great hand in the great results!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying other products from this company, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>Moving right now is out of the question.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of foam.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gives the right amount of scent.</li>
            <li>Yes, I received it right on time with my Amazon prime.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have have dandruff problem right now</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I needed something that would help with dandruff and my sore itchy scalp, and wouldn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural oils; I must say so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I use it not only in my own hair but that of my daughters , her first reaction was &amp;#34</li>
            <li>I really  wanted a shampoo  that would clean her hair and hopefully help keep lice away.</li>
            <li>It got my hair and scalp SQEAKY clean, really.  </li>
            <li>Really helped with my dandruff and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and I think my hair is a little healthier, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work super well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the major dandruff shampoo brands, apple cider vinegar, the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method, coconut oil, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was effective at combatting the issue and also smelled GOOD and not nearly as medicinal as other products I had tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in search of a shampoo that is natural with no sulfates and LATHERS and makes my hair feel clean afterwards WITH NO ITCHY SCALP!</li>
            <li>The smell is great too, not like the usual tea tree smell.  </li>
            <li>My scalp feels calm for the first time</li>
            <li>There are many companies engaged in &amp;#34;greenwashing,&amp;#34; and Maple Holistics is apparently one of them.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help with dandruff and scalp problems, but it makes my hair look a whole lot better!</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a sweet, earthy smell and leaves my hair felling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Nothing better than being pure and washing with natural products.</li>
            <li>and while I am happy to say it is a fairly subtle, natural smell, it just isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to cheap chemical filled shapoo</li>
            <li>I have found this shampoo to really help how quickly my hair gets greasy, and has definetly helped with my scalp acne.</li>
            <li>and I hoped that this tea tree oil shampoo would be at least as effective or better.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it leaves my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair smell so nice after they dry.</li>
            <li>This shampoo was a delight left my head feeling good and was not terribly expensive while remaining natural.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does smell and feel great, and it only takes a small amount to wash, I just wish it helped more with the flaking.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and fine hair; it works well for me.  </li>
            <li>I loved the idea of tea tree oil, but my hair&#x27;s hydration is vital to me since I flat iron and color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of tea tree oil, but my hair&#x27;s hydration is vital to me since I flat iron and color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little bit lathers up really good</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo, it&#x27;s natural and decent.</li>
            <li>The scent of tea tree oil is very refreshing and the shampoo feels very easy on my scalp unlike other shampoos that make your scalp feel dry.</li>
            <li>It might work somewhat for more mid dandruff.</li>
            <li>This lack of lather is the only thing I do not like about this shampoo as I like a bit more suds when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is has many medicinal uses, it is applied to the skin for infections such as acne, fungal infections of the nail, lice, scabies, athlete&#x27;s foot (tinea pedis), and ringworm.</li>
            <li>I will definitely  purchase more.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was tickled by the tingly feeling from the tea tree</li>
            <li>As i will keep using it i will write more review based on different shampoo&#x27;s i used by maple holistics.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair with this every 2-3 days and since starting I have gotten compliments about how healthy  my hair is.</li>
            <li>All those factors considered (including the price), it still works very well in treating dandruff and itchy scalp in no time!</li>
            <li>Two months later they are still gone and my scalp is healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really helps my contact dermatitis/ dandruff issues!</li>
            <li>Thanks Maple Holistics!  </li>
            <li>Within the first 2-3 days of using the Tea Tree shampoo,I noticed a difference in my scalp.</li>
            <li>Got rid of that itchy scalp feeling altogether after first time.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to people looking for a better product to use on their hair.</li>
            <li>You will need to use a couple of times before seeing a change, but once you do, it will be consistent.</li>
            <li>Overall using the shampoo has been okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this another month before I raise the rating any higher.</li>
            <li>I did really like the Argan Oil Conditioner!</li>
            <li>Firstly it is comprised of top quality organic oils(Tea Tree, Rosemary, Lavender), but those oils are all essential to stimulate blood flow to the head and thereby the transport of nutrients to the scalp.</li>
            <li>There was a noticeable improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>I will say that this product if used exactly as sold will work wonders.  </li>
            <li>then you should most definitely try this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite prone to dryness, so I don&#x27;t exactly blame the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Both proucts did exactly what they said they would.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance,Organic and works as expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone to try this product!!</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>I was uncertain trying this shampoo for the first time and knowing nothing about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;a supporting conditioner is needed.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed how my&lt;</li>
            <li>Funny how things work out sometimes...</li>
            <li>I first used this, I was struck by the odor.</li>
            <li>By adding the extra, it foamed up, and I was able to scrub.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems to work better than head and shoulders, and about the same as T-gel.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this product</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first time using it.</li>
            <li>First of all, I cannot stand the smell of tea tree</li>
            <li>It will last you thats for sure.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have ever tried a tea tree oil shampoo before.</li>
            <li>Smells funny, didn&#x27;t help with dandruff, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, I would not recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>This shampoo comes with the whole package!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would urge anyone interested in avoiding high-hazard ingredients in their cosmetics to look up each ingredient before buying.</li>
            <li>I finally have healthy hair again.</li>
            <li>That review was for the first bottle I ordered.</li>
            <li>first day i noticed a big difference my hair feel healthy</li>
            <li>I just love it and I;m never going back to H&amp;S.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this winter has disappeared and my hair is very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and am going to be a loyal user of the Maple Holistics brand.</li>
            <li>I have dry natural curly hair and makes my hair beautiful and wow the smell.</li>
            <li>There are many new additives and the natural oils have gone from being the 8th ingredient to the 18th or 20 something.</li>
            <li>Looks like a keeper so far!!!!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle enough to clean my roots and skull, it has medium foaming and leaves a light, relaxing herbal smell.  </li>
            <li>Putting aloe vera gel or pure aloe vera on to sit before a second shampoo seemed to help the scalp feel better and get rid of flaking dryness.</li>
            <li>After the bottle ran out, I was trying to use up some other leftover shampoos we had lying around  (mostly popular brand name anti-dandruff shampoos, which still work for my Dad).</li>
            <li>I have decided to switch from Kiehl&#x27;s Amino Acid (the only good hair product for me in Kiehl&#x27;s) to Maple Holistics, which are easier to order and has more choices and usually cheaper.</li>
            <li>I used to have a very itchy, dry scalp with occasional dandruff, but now with using the Tea tree oil shampoo , my scalp feels great.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft or clean.</li>
            <li>Feels clean and helps with break outs near my hair line.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo ,my scalp and hair felt so clean, and still  manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a ton, which is a good thing since the bottle is pretty small.  </li>
            <li>well I used many different dandruff shampoos as well as try baking soda and nothing has really worked well.</li>
            <li>so it can be more accessible to the general public.</li>
            <li>The fact that is is paraben and sulfate free, as well as cruelty-free, is definitely a major plus.</li>
            <li>Maybe that has more to do with head size, but the original quarter suggestion produced little lather, and was ending up getting my hands stuck in my hair rather than allowing me to work my fingers along my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have long fine straight but full hair.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed positive results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard positive things about it</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised as my hair is very clean and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>think my favourite part (other than the smell) was that it did such a great job without having any chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>This tea tree shampoo really stopped any flaking after the first use.</li>
            <li>, I pretty much had no choice but to use this.</li>
            <li>I only shampoo my hair every other day and it keeps my hair from getting too oily on the days I don&#x27;t shampoo which is great.</li>
            <li>and I can safely say that after a month or so, my scalp was no longer dry and the dandruff went away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so my hair tends to be dry and have a static issue during the winter.</li>
            <li>Like most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos your hair may feel a bit dry after you use it.</li>
            <li>I experience dry scalp most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it works for some individuals, but it certainly did not help my condition.</li>
            <li>I was curious and excited it compare it to my Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year now, particularly for hot, itchy scalp when traveling through SE Asia.  </li>
            <li>This is nice stuff, but a little pricey for the amount you get (8 oz).</li>
            <li>I laughed at first because, seriously.</li>
            <li>highly recommend anyone looking to get rid of dandruff to give this a try first.</li>
            <li>This a great shampoo for little to moderate dandruff.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little to build a great lather and it cleans well.</li>
            <li>so I purchased Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff with Jojoba &amp; Organic Spikenard for him and have seen a great improvement when he is using it regularly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended you guys!</li>
            <li>It has an aromatic smell that I really like..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my hair and helps with dandruff.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my hair very well</li>
            <li>It really helps relieve itching on my scalp.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can really feel the improvement.</li>
            <li>Not only is my scalp flake free</li>
            <li>Thanks Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels so much healthier and my hair is softer than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use much (quarter size in my hand) to wash my hair well.</li>
            <li>The scent is natural and fresh.</li>
            <li>The Maple Holistics shampoo is a creamy pearly color and lathers up really well.  </li>
            <li>And it was gentle on their hair.  </li>
            <li>the directions say so that my whole scalp is getting shampooed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the company SLS free version next and see how that goes.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve battled dandruff my whole life.</li>
            <li>I will buy this again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but if it takes dandruff away and lice i dont really mind.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Cleans well,  but doesn&#x27;t really fix my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>It took about 2-3 weeks to really get things in check.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my dandruff.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while now, I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My scalp is also very oily.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t shedding as much as when I used Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>not only does it leave my hair dandruff free and silky</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a shampoo that smells  fresh, earthy-clean, and natural</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I feel so much relief</li>
            <li>It has a very invigorating smell, must be the Tea tree.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I was suffering from light to moderate dandruff.  </li>
            <li>It treats dandruff really well and nourish the scalp.</li>
            <li>plus I really feel like its helped my hair grow quicker.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a similar product with LIGHT conditioning</li>
            <li>All the itchiness were gone after a month of straight use.</li>
            <li>but it has a way of really removing them and treating my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m really bummed.  </li>
            <li>he uses it too fast.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Everyone at home really likes this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and my hair felt lightweight and different when I got done washing it.</li>
            <li>up really well when you wash rinse repeat.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so it really soaks into my scalp.</li>
            <li>I rotate between this one and the SLS free Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo from Trader Joes since that one is 16oz for only $3.99 in the store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really struggling with the fact that this seems to STRIP my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders for my dandruff, but it didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I also found that the price was really reasonable as you do not have to use a ton of the product to get the job done.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil is really nourishing</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from dandruff!</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair...</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this again since it really did not work for me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really works.  </li>
            <li>I used this as directed throughout last winter and this spring and it worked fabulously.</li>
            <li>It has no sulfates like the &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; and name brand shampoos but does the job with gentle cleaning and leaving softness and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle on my colored hair.  </li>
            <li>the rosemary and lavender are very soothing</li>
            <li>I bought this because of my dandruff, but it really does heal skin blemishes too...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the cut on my scalp healed much faster than the one on my arm after some use of this.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see how much it&#x27;ll lather up.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I think it was very helpful, and I&#x27;m giving it a thumbs</li>
            <li>Much as before.  </li>
            <li>One: I wish this came in a larger size or was available through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>I have so much hair</li>
            <li>and I use so much shampoo</li>
            <li>- I could really use a discount of some sort.</li>
            <li>The old standby&#x27;s like Selson Blue works better .</li>
            <li>It has many natural ingredients (such as lavender and rosemary) that I&#x27;ve seen recommended to soothe the scalp and help control hair loss.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light compare to other shampoos I have tried before.  </li>
            <li>It did an Amazing job of completely transforming her hair from dried, damaged, and dandruff ridden to clean, soft, with lots of body.  </li>
            <li>Like real lavender, not the overly perfume-y, doctored up lavender found in so many other things.  </li>
            <li>It is priced more reasonably than some other therapeutic shampoos I have bought from clinics.  </li>
            <li>Many products contain far too many different chemicals in them which serve no useful purpose.  </li>
            <li>I mix with my favorite shampoo for my hair since I have extremely curly hair and need the Moroccan oil products for hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t end up any better than all the other stuff I have tried.  </li>
            <li>We received this last week and we already see a significant improvement in her dandruff.</li>
            <li>Although the Sage shampoo worked better for me, this one is up to the high standards of the Maple Holistics, where all of ingredients are chosen carefully and for the reason.  </li>
            <li>so i thought i would try this, and I&#x27;ve seen great results, my hair is less itchy and dry!</li>
            <li>Cleaned my hair and scalp , left it clean for 2 days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use if you dye your hair and your scalp gets a little dry or sore from that.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a pleasant scent and does not leave hair dry as other shampoos often do.</li>
            <li>That along with past hair-loss issues and dandruff issues lead me to this amazing product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to say that this shampoo delivers in just one week of use (at least for me).</li>
            <li>I am not saying it is not a good shampoo, just that it doesn&#x27;t smell good.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have with this shampoo is the smell, but aside from that I&#x27;ve truely converted to this product.</li>
            <li>young son came home from summer camp one day and we started to notice his hair was matted; we assumed it was just drying funny from the pool.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly even though my daughter and the little girl shared the same bed and pillow my daughter didn&#x27;t get lice.</li>
            <li>New staple product in my beauty regimen!</li>
            <li>I now use this every other day and I am happy I can now wear black w/o the worry of flakes shedding out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel sleek and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>, I can wear black again :)</li>
            <li>Tea Tree Shampoo is aimed at people with mild to moderate dandruff and scalp blemishes.</li>
            <li>At first I was pretty iffy about trying a different shampoo because my hair has been &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; to another shampoo.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I am not crazy about is it doesn&#x27;t really lather that</li>
            <li>have ordered 2 additional bottles and will always be sure to pack this for my travel abroad and have enough for daily home use.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate dandruff.  </li>
            <li>all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a decent amount of lather, unlike a lot of anti-dandruff shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be the only thing among many I have tried that is actually working to treat my dandruff.</li>
            <li>I have tried all types of shampoos that are supposed to treat mild to moderate dandruff, but they never seem to work.</li>
            <li>Giving three stars since it was decent shampoo but didn&#x27;t get rid of my dandruff and itching.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Tea Tree oil, but so many products capture only the smell and none of the benefits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if this didn&#x27;t strip my hair so badly I&#x27;d be more inclined to keep on keeping on, but I feel like unless your hair is chock full of chemicals from hairspray or treatments, this is just too harsh for daily -or</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if this didn&#x27;t strip my hair so badly I&#x27;d be more inclined to keep on keeping on, but I feel like unless your hair is chock full of chemicals from hairspray or treatments, this is just too harsh for daily -or</li>
            <li>I love tea tree in general, but this shampoo helped my really dry scalp in the winter.</li>
            <li>after one use my hair already feels softer &amp; I have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend trying this shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a high quality shampoo that works well.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a couple of times, but I already notice a difference in less dandruff, and feeling good about using a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Might be nice to use in-between my other shampoos, but it alone does not do enough to keep my dandruff at bay.</li>
            <li>I recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants a natural, organic product for mild to moderate dandruff.</li>
            <li>I turned to tea tree oil as a natural lice deterrent, but the medicine-y smell of the pure oil was almost unbearable.</li>
            <li>I have guttate psoriasis, and it&#x27;s hard to find an effective shampoo.</li>
            <li>My scalp and hair felt clean and cool and my hair was a bit more fluffy than usual.</li>
            <li>My hair felt really clean after washing it with this and there was even less hair loss after the first use.</li>
            <li>This natural shampoo really helped me out when I had a cyst on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>am chemically sensitive and absolutely cannot use just any shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It was just normal.</li>
            <li>While the infestation is pretty much under control, this 4-5 month experience has actually traumatized me.  </li>
            <li>I have rarely had a breakout since on my back or my scalp.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does have tea tree in it and normally I would avoid tea tree because I am not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>Two other pros for this particular shampoo is that the jojoba makes my hair shiny and it also is free from sulfates and parabens.</li>
            <li>I get REALLY dried out in the winter (I guess its because I wear a hat to stay warm a lot) and the tea tree oil and lavender do just the trick to get me back to normal!</li>
            <li>I know products all work differently for everyone, but if I was looking for a product line that might actually live up to it&#x27;s hype, this one is worth a try in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and manageable after use, but I am also using a maple holistics conditioner, which i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product actually WORKS for dandruff, and makes my hair feel super soft.  </li>
            <li>a great all natural shampoo with none of the harsh ingredients found in almost every other shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;be been habituated to wash my hair every other day, but by the end of day one, my hair gets really greasy, itchy, and full of dandruffs.</li>
            <li>also love that this product is economical, and a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li>I am not easily swept into miracle cures, nor do I have a strong opinion of holistic vs modern.</li>
            <li>I decided to finally write a review AFTER using the WHOLE ENTIRE BOTTLE to truely share my experience from beginning to end with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought her a new one and another one for myself.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to shampoo.</li>
            <li>and i can see new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>He is 15 years old and very self conscious about dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Some natural shampoos make my hair difficult to comb through, but this one works and smells great.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and my scalp gets mild dandruff during the winter.</li>
            <li>The smell is not your typical strong tea tree aroma that bothers some people.</li>
            <li>this has gotta be one of the best available for people like me who have terrible dandriff.</li>
            <li>and I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>It has a very natural lavender smell.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo in combination with the silk 18 conditioner make my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find the ingredients list very different from the first bottle I reviewed.</li>
            <li>My head feels somewhat more relaxed after using it too, though I&amp;#34;m not sure</li>
            <li>but it does seem to be working because the itch is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should be aware that this is low suds shampoo.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly dandruff, but something similar, and though I tried every over-the-counter product, nothing worked--until I tried this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, BPA free/recyclable, not wasteful, made in the USA, and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use a ton of product in my hair, so I was really surprised to feel the build up washing</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the first one that has actually made a difference!</li>
            <li>First time I actually got a compliment on how shiny my hair was!</li>
            <li>I am excited to try other Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am leaving a &amp;#34;4.5&amp;#34; is because this product did not meet every expectation but it did do exactly what it said it was going to do.</li>
            <li>Eventually I purchased a bottle of the Tea Tree shampoo (the one with rosemary) from Maple Holistics and wow was there a difference!  </li>
            <li>I have moderate dandruff, and decided to give this a go as most other dandruff shampoos did not keep it well under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not had a chance to use it multiple times, but I am looking forward to seeing how it does with consistent use.</li>
            <li>My other Tea Tree shampoo of only $8.00 works much better.  </li>
            <li>But this helped more than my usual head and shoulders for some reason, maybe the ingredients?</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time last month</li>
            <li>I would def recommend for natural hair!  </li>
            <li>This tee tree oil shampoo is the first shampoo I have found that controls my teen son&#x27;s dandruff.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who loves buying natural, but also needs something that truly works!</li>
            <li>Natural is the way to go!</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time last night</li>
            <li>I am fairly sensitive to smells and also find this shampoo scent to be subtle and nice.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have dandruff, however the winter cold tends to cause flakes and this shampoo was great at curing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downside for me is the smell - I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have heavy dandruff, but generally use a dandruff shampoo to keep my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need a stronger shampoo, but I&#x27;m not sure why it worked magically in the beginning and then stopped working completely.      </li>
            <li>, my dandruff flared up so much I had to switch back to my normal dandruff</li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps my hair looking healthy and natural without the greasy look and doesn&#x27;t look dried out!</li>
            <li>It feels gentle on the scalp and has really helped the winter dry scalp scene.</li>
            <li>I, like any health fanatic, am constantly on the hunt for healthy alternatives to everything!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mellower than the pure essential oil.  </li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;m actually growing new hair!!</li>
            <li>have scalp acne and a little dandruff have used this 3x and can tell a huge difference already</li>
            <li>I think sulfate free shampoo helped with hair loss a little and hair felt a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>I am 27, and have spent all of my life with oily fine hair, and moderate acne.  </li>
            <li>After using this for about 4 weeks, I had to go back to my old product (Philip B anti-flake relief shampoo and Borghese Restorativo Conditioning Rinse) because I had large flakes.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about ordering this shampoo, but I am SO happy that I went through with the purchase!</li>
            <li>Instead it has a pleasantly mild scent and lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li>Customer service was extremely helpful and quick with replies and shipping.</li>
            <li>so I have to use a little more than recommended on the label, but I still make it last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>This product would be great for anyone who suffers from dry/itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I need to only use it one to two times in order to calm my scalp and keep my dandruff from acting up or reoccurring.</li>
            <li>This product can easily clear the scalp without drying my hair.</li>
            <li>and so far I haven&#x27;t had to scratch once.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>could get this soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable while taking the flakes away.</li>
            <li>but my hair is SO shiny and soft after each use.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and was pleasantly surprised with how well it cleaned and worked.</li>
            <li>It helps, but doesn&#x27;t give me complete relief.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and my scalp felt invigorating when I use this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely ordering from them in the future.</li>
            <li>Still fighting the battle, we purchased this looking for a natural route that will help the damage I had done with the chemical lice treatment.  </li>
            <li>This has done just that so far.</li>
            <li>Removed dandruff completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go so far as to say</li>
            <li>I have been using this for almost 3 months now and so far, I don;t experience</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend trying this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Also for an added bonus,it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and therefore I thought too old for cradle cap</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural</li>
            <li>I have been consuming this bottle for nearly 2 months now.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked but we ran out a week ago</li>
            <li>Got this to help manage my three year old&#x27;s seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find an all natural solution for dandruff.</li>
            <li>the fact is it&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>So far this has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>And I know using this all natural product</li>
            <li>I gave it 10 days to work, like their website suggested, until the dandruff went away completely.  </li>
            <li>Does really work on moderate dandruff.</li>
            <li>I have been using it with the silk conditioner, and my hair looks soft and shiny without being weighed down...and</li>
            <li>My hair was soft even after t-shirt drying for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>As far as Shampoo&#x27;s go</li>
            <li>I tried this and was pleasantly surprised with how well it worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasted me a couple months so far</li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo and conditioner and my dandruff didn&#x27;t get any better and in fact, got worse, because I stopped using my old shampoo and conditioner which at least was moderately effective.  </li>
            <li>My old products reduced my dandruff but hadn&#x27;t eliminated it</li>
            <li>Completely sold</li>
            <li>so this won&#x27;t go far---</li>
            <li>My six year old uses the shampoo for some scalp issue and loves it.</li>
            <li>Problem is being a six year old</li>
            <li>The fact that the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients are all organic and natural is what sold me on trying the&lt;</li>
            <li>my hair shiny, soft, and styleable.</li>
            <li>hair is soft with no frizz..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that the grease I get from the natural oils in my hair lessened any, but the flakes did not return.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that the grease I get from the natural oils in my hair lessened any, but the flakes did not return.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is very watery and will only relieve dandruff for about 12 hours before you have to wash again.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a natural shampoo that would not break me out and didn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Also, my hair is so soft and has been since using both of these</li>
            <li>The packaging looks professional</li>
            <li>You will be pleasantly surprised by the scent and the effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I had a flaky scalp prior to using this shampoo but within two weeks of using it, it really cleared up my scalp.</li>
            <li>and she said it made it so soft feeling.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of the natural sebum that you scalp produces.</li>
            <li>Until I began using this shampoo, my hair always felt completely fried a week or two after dyeing.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp and issues with inflammation.  </li>
            <li>My dandruff was completely gone</li>
            <li>My scalp does not itch nearly as much, and my hair is definitely not a greasy.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and in the winter my head itches a lot.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil shampoo has eliminated this problem almost completely.</li>
            <li>It really works for me and the entire family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product once so far today</li>
            <li>Since I gave birth I get sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I get a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I tried this out and it made my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>So, I was skeptical but ordered it just because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>but I have long curly sorry to say beautiful hair and</li>
            <li>Though there is not much new hair growing, the loss of existing hair is very much reduced.</li>
            <li>I have had dry scalp for a long time and tried many different products and none of them have worked as well as this one.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly satisfied with the results that it has shown in just the past couple of days!</li>
            <li>Naturally, it may not help all, but compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried this really has proven to work very well.  </li>
            <li>I have dry curly thinning hair and for the first time in forever, my head doesn&#x27;t itch</li>
            <li>It costs A LOT more than the stuff I was using, but my scalp is much less dry and itchy, and there&#x27;s no dandruff.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin especially in the winter</li>
            <li>I would love for someone to tell me the ingredients are the same and just more broken down and I misunderstood.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed and after using it for a few times I have not even a trace of dandruff flakes on my head.</li>
            <li>Finally a NATURAL Dandruff Shampoo that works and isn&#x27;t blue and full of unknown chemicals.</li>
            <li>I am always surprised when I find all natural products that are equally (if not more) effective compared to the other toxic stuff we&#x27;re all used to.</li>
            <li>I think this would work very well if you have slightly dry scalp, but if you have moderate dryness and flakiness, you probably would not get as much benefit.</li>
            <li>This shampoo made my hair feel clean but dried out my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>For a long time I was looking for a gentle, natural dandruff preventing shampoo and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>and this is light enough not to weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>This ingredient is classified as a high hazard on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Database.</li>
            <li>I simply used this product as instructed and styled as normal using my other regular products and my hair was full, soft, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was very little dandruff, my hair was silky smooth and there was no breakage or itching in the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products in the past and almost always it&#x27;s either too strong or too weak...</li>
            <li>I had previously used a bit of coal tar shampoo on the affected areas to control that, and recently learned that coal tar is not entirely safe (great - 25 years later!)</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment on its long term effects yet</li>
            <li>I started using it on my kids and they have NEVER encountered lice and they love how it tingles lightly on their scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and now hubby isn&#x27;t afraid to use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>Lately I have been researching and switching to more organic and natural based products for items such as toothpaste, deodorant, etc.</li>
            <li>(i think my hair is somewhat sensitive in general)</li>
            <li>Not sure if I like that or not but definitely enjoy the scalp feel.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from dandruff for a long time, ever since puberty really</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on them three times and their scalp is nearly back to normal.</li>
            <li>After just one washing, the infuriating little psoriasis patch I have at the very front of my hairline was somehow...changed (in a good way!).</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shinny and smooth but not oily, and just a little bit can make enough foam.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see a difference but by the 4th to 5th day, my hair was no longer dry and static decreased drastically.  </li>
            <li>Tea Tree Oil Shampoo was purchased for my daughter who recently colored her hair and it was &amp;#34;itchy.&amp;#34;  This shampoo solved her problem without changing the newly colored hair color.  </li>
            <li>Although it is quite expansive compared to other regular commercial shampoo brands on the market, it is worth a try for its high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say this helped get rid of my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>All in all - I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone looking for a natural dandruff treatment!</li>
            <li>usually dont take the time to review a product, but the one is worth it!</li>
            <li>I have mild dandruff and occasionally my scalp can get flaky especially when I mess with its normal routine.</li>
            <li>I had to use more about the amount of a half dollar to accommodate the mass of hair that I have, and no, I was not going all the way down.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend it for people who have a dry scalp!</li>
            <li>Helping so much with the itchy dry scalp I have!</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine hair, and I dye my hair every six weeks or so.</li>
            <li>It is one of the very very few that won&#x27;t trigger an allergic reaction to my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth the money</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because seriously, it&#x27;s the only thing that worked for me</li>
            <li>I was given this to try after complaining about the smell Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil left when I mixed it with shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I only use it every couple of days to keep it clear.</li>
            <li>When I use it regularly my scalp is clear of dandruff and irritation.</li>
            <li>As far as dandruff, it&#x27;s only been one use</li>
            <li>The scent is apparent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I get dandruff in the winter time, and so far (only November)</li>
            <li>She uses this daily now and has naturally rid our lice problem.  </li>
            <li>However, my husband has regular old dandruff and after a week or so of treatment...</li>
            <li>So far though I quite like this shampoo and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>now I barely ever see flakes.</li>
            <li>The directions say to leave it in for a couple minutes, but i was busy and left it in for 10 minites.  </li>
            <li>I recently Tryed this product because I&#x27;m transiting from perm to natural</li>
            <li>This product is a pleasure to use, adding a bit of luxury into your daily routine for relatively modest expense.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then the shampoo will make the skin on your hands peel especially if you have calluses.</li>
            <li>And hopefully the price will drop in the near future!</li>
            <li>Such a high-hazard ingredient, in my opinion, has no place in a product that touts its natural and organic ingredients and is made by a company with the word &amp;#34;Holistics&amp;#34; in its name.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but it is too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>If I see this product with my own eyes, I would not buy it because it is so expensive.</li>
            <li>Not sure how true that is or not</li>
            <li>recommend this product to anyone that is looking for an anti-dandruff shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell like some kind of weird medicine.</li>
            <li>but it still is kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li>My hair does seem a bit more dry all around, but it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s this shampoo or just the climate.</li>
            <li>and I loved the fact that i wasnt scratching my usual itchy scalp!!!!  </li>
            <li>Please note that I do not have other skin conditions, and have oily skin (large pores).</li>
            <li>/&gt;About my hair:&lt;br /&gt;Caucasian chemically treated&lt;br /&gt;About 22&amp;#34;-24&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Damaged, dry, and brittle&lt;br /&gt;Frequent Flat Ironing&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff, and natural oils being main issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is less pricey than other shampoos alike but works fairly fine.</li>
            <li>After the first week I noticed my hair is softer and requires less conditioner or after-product to keep it that way.  </li>
            <li>nice bonus is that I can now also go a day between washings if I choose without my hair appearing dirty, something that in the past would be unthinkable for my very fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>It has left my hair soft, hydrated, and tangle free (a characteristic usually associated with creams and conditioners).</li>
            <li>Has natural essential oils such as tea tree,lavender,and argan</li>
            <li>It also does not dry my hair</li>
            <li>I noticed a little bit more itchiness than usual, and a few more flakes ; thought it might take a bit for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;After a week and a half of using the shampoo</li>
            <li>It was really embarrassing to me because I have really dark hair</li>
            <li>smelled like old, too long in the shelf, shampoo.</li>
            <li>No more oozing plaques; just rare dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I have gad trouble with dandruff intermittently since my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>First few times, there were no bubbles lathering effect but give it a week</li>
            <li>It is not too expensive, fairly affordable unlike some of the other brands that offer the same thing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair, and helps keep my scalp clear.</li>
            <li>I had slight dandruff and was liking for a shampoo that would really works and came across this.</li>
            <li>So far I feel like it has helped with the dry and flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li>and once I dry my hair, it&#x27;s beautifully soft.</li>
            <li>Within three uses, my dry scalp and dandruff was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that tends to get dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>My dandruff is visibly less after using it every day for one week straight.</li>
            <li>The only draw back for this particular shampoo for me was the stronger than expected lavender undertone in the scent it has.  </li>
            <li>The formula of the shampoo is thick and consistent and there is a slight lather at first.</li>
            <li>I live in the country and there are a ton of ticks and other insects.</li>

            <li> I feel good about this company and its holistic approach!</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my scalp feeling wonderful, not to mention smelling nice!</li>
            <li> This did a good job of cleaning, but was not the best dry-scalp treatment that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> a great product, just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I have no irritation at all and don’t even have to use any lotion as my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that I ordered this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and feels soothing to my scalp, which is great because my scalp can sometimes feel itchy or irritated.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this stuff works as great as it does.</li>
            <li> Soothing, not overly astringent, great for those with Lupus sores on scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great, no feeling of build up</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo if you have dandruff or oily hair.</li>
            <li> Since my boyfriend started using this product it has improved his scalp condition greatly.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This product works well for dandruff and has a really great smell.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo with great smell.</li>

            <li> I’m happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> It was great</li>
            <li> It makes your scalp feel great</li>
            <li> It still deserves a 5 stars for being a great smelling dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but did not get rid of my blemishes on my scalp.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Shampoo from Maple Holistics worked great though.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look and feel great  </li>
            <li> My scalp gets flaky during the winter and this worked great at controlling the flakes.</li>
            <li> It lathers great.</li>
            <li> it gave great slip</li>
            <li> Seems great.</li>
            <li> Happy to see it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as great as I hoped (based on everyone else&#x27;s reviews).  </li>

            <li> I am very happy that they are all made by natural ingredient, and I have so many choices.</li>
            <li> Really liked using a shampoo that is sulfate free but still produced a nice lather.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff right here!</li>
            <li> It cleans beautifully and its very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me and the kids!</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance,  very lightly scented for being tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing and cleans greasy hair easily.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t that strong after you shower, which is nice.</li>
            <li> If you expect tingle and  nice strong scent maybe you should pass on this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very mild and effective solution to my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I am very impressed with the customer service the company offers, truly the fine example of the customer care we all wish to experience.</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo that actually has a pleasant smell, and</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost a year now and love it.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the instructions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It turns out most people have them, so you might want to look into it too.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I just got my hair colored and was looking for color safe shampoo.</li>
            <li> I swear my name to it, it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the fact that it worked within weeks of continuous use.</li>
            <li> so I feel like I&#x27;m using more then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff for so many days</li>
            <li> My scalp feels way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 2 weeks now and am still quite pleased.</li>
            <li> but I will be sure to try it on them, too.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it got rid of my dandruff</li>
            <li> and i really like that it has tea tree oil because that&#x27;s great for the hair</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the lavender smell because it&#x27;s not empowering!</li>
            <li> You cant ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> But I still like it :)</li>
            <li> and I could feel healthy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to come across this product.  </li>
            <li> I’m glad someone recommended this product.</li>
            <li> so i will hopefully  purchase  more soon.</li>
            <li> , i ordered again and this time purchased  3 bottles, i really love it for all my families</li>
            <li> Smells okay</li>
            <li> and I am SO pleased.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it does seem to be a bit more drying than the winter blend.</li>
            <li> I love how refreshed I feel after I use it.</li>
            <li> and we both love it.</li>
            <li> We love the smell</li>
            <li> I have tried many tea tree oil shampoos before but nothing is like this one.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth and will definatley managable!</li>
            <li> I bought these products not to make my hair look like the commercialized beauties we see on magazines or TV but to be healthy.</li>
            <li> We love the maple holistics products.</li>
            <li> we would but it more often).</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift from a friend because she knows how much I love the smell of tea tree.</li>
            <li> The trick is finding which ones work for you, but once you figure that out, rotate, I would say, 3 or more brands.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the lavender smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have been exercising more and sweating more causing breakouts on my scalp and hairline.</li>
            <li> Sure, head and shoulders did the trick</li>
            <li> and then i followed the instructions, rinsed my hair and it was like magic.</li>
            <li> Glad I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Opening the product smells overwhelmingly like pine or some sort of foliage smell (i guess tea tree oil smell?)</li>
            <li> but it smells ok.</li>
            <li> Really fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I would love to know more about the ingredients -- perhaps the company could submit to EWG for their review?</li>
            <li> I love how it makes her hair feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I chose the sage shampoo since that seemed to give the best potential to address his condition.  </li>
            <li> , I fell in Love.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to keep putting in more and more</li>
            <li> I love this n</li>
            <li> Wish they made more conditioners as well.</li>
            <li> Glad I stumbled onto this brand and product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of tea tree oil, this shampoo will endear itself to you as it has me.</li>
            <li> i tried so many products....</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product more than once</li>
            <li> and it really satisfied me.</li>
            <li> but I am flake free!  </li>
            <li> and I love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> id love to try it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> But now, I&#x27;m dandruff free!</li>
            <li> but I tried a vinegar rinse after washing and the static was gone.  </li>
            <li> Soon, we started to notice plaques of &amp;#34;crust&amp;#34; on his head that were covering most of the top of his head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a couple of uses, it was noticeably better than ever.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll keep on buying for sure.</li>
            <li> I am free of dandruff in just a month!</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s more to that.</li>
            <li> I love how this shampoo makes my hair smell like this for 2 days.</li>
            <li> The sent is lovely but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Things have gotten better with continued use of this product, and I&#x27;m thinking that the issues that I still have with my hair will work themselves out over time and with more use.</li>
            <li> but I tend to like this one better because of the lavender ingredient</li>
            <li> many years of itchy.scalp and dandruff</li>
            <li> Love feeling of my scalp after use..</li>
            <li> But I like this shampoo better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still drying my hair out, and I&#x27;m losing the motivation to keep trusting that it might get better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still drying my hair out, and I&#x27;m losing the motivation to keep trusting that it might get better.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re patient you&#x27;ll be glad you used this shampoo.</li>
            <li> one wash helped my scalp feel better.</li>
            <li> I really love it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, has a nice texture to it, leaves hair soft, and manages dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It smells way better while working, though.</li>
            <li> Much better with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just one testament among many.</li>

            <li> and I am really glad that I did.</li>

            <li> From many reviews, customers stated a tingling feeling</li>
            <li> I once meet difficulty to order from Kiehl&#x27;s web site, so tried Maple Holistics Shampoo for Oily, Itchy &amp; Greasy Hair with Organic Rosemary, Peach Kernel and Jojoba, and I find I quite love it.</li>

            <li> and I went on the hunt for something better.</li>

            <li> end result was pretty surprising.</li>
            <li> Notably, it does not smell intensely like tea tree oil (which is nice), and yet seems quite effective and non-drying.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent choice for managing and restoring dry hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and cleans well, just don&#x27;t know that it helps as much as we would have liked.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much to this wonderful shampoo!!!!!</li>
            <li> It had great slip and I was able to glide through my natural hair easily.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed that I just placed an order for more shampoo for him and added other products for our family to the order.</li>
            <li> Great for a guy and the young men in my house like it to.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so healthy and dandruff free since forever.</li>
            <li> So far this shampoo has worked great for me.love it..</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the smooth texture and the way it leaves my hair feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it works on dandruff and calms an itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this shampoo so far has been great.</li>
            <li> So far the shampoo works great.</li>
            <li> I have seen results faster than expected &amp; the smell is wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> this shampoo smells great and makes your hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and it makes my hair smell good, too.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t rate the product fairly, but I wanted to make a note that that this does contain Argan Oil (which I did not see listed on the Amazon ingredient page).</li>
            <li> It really helped with my scalp and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I read the description, it sounded good, I have been using it for a a couple weeks now and it does its job very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not intensely UNpleasant, however, it IS very strong.</li>
            <li> It is very nice that it is all natural with organic ingredients, but I bought it because it claims to help dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to keep using this and see how healthy my hair becomes.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a bit pricey at first glance but boy am I glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo, it leaves your hair nice and shiny and gets rid of dandruff lightning fast.</li>
            <li> The salon brand I was using is more economical, but I feel better using Maple Holistics because I know it&#x27;s healthier for my hair.</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m still struggling with losing lots of strands of hair and very mild dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair and scalp feel healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> Love the tingly clean feeling when I&#x27;m done washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it, after just a couple of uses the scalp has calmed, the hair is clean.</li>
            <li> Since it is available at Amazon with free shipping, it is much more convenient for me to order.</li>
            <li> My hair splits easily</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a decent foaming agent so more isn&#x27;t necessarily better; using the minimum effective amount is important.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong of tea tree (it smells kinda like vics vapor rub to me)</li>
            <li> and i strongly recommend this product fro those who have dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but nothing special .</li>
            <li> feel very clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the biggest thing I noticed - it smells clean (not the chemical clean but the outdoor spring kind of clean).</li>
            <li> Not only is great with improving my dandruff, it leaves my hair light and silky smooth!</li>
            <li> My hair feels smooth and soft and it stays that way the whole day using just this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash rinse and repeat faithfully to get the full effect of its healing qualities.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Maple Holistics and am going back to look for more product!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo twice and my hair feels so full and healthy.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it leaves your hair feeling really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo , keeps my head clean and clear of dandruff.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves my hair clean, soft and with no dandruff.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST DANDRUFF SHAMPOO ON THE MARKET HANDS DOWN.</li>
            <li> They smell amazing and make my hair feel so soft!! :)</li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo previously and it smells and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It is a fine product from a fine company.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for an itchy scalp and it has helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t comfortable scrubbing my hair or any part on my body (for that matter) with strong chemicals that were never meant for my body which my body in turn - rejects anyways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healing properties can be noticed rather quickly, and it has a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li> When you use it, your hair feels amazingly clean- like SWEAKY clean!</li>
            <li> His psoriasis is absolutely getting better!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling frizzy or weighed down, rather, my hair feels light, free flowing and smelling of delightful tea tree oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells good an dis quite effective for dry scalp!</li>
            <li> Not only is it sulphur free, it lathers great &amp; truly conditions my hair &amp; scalp.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a more natural one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 3 months now and it has made a HUGE change.</li>
            <li> I stopped having huge masses of hair in the drain after every shower and the hair that stayed on my head has thickened up noticeably.  </li>
            <li> Huge flakes would fall out of my hair when I take of my shirt or hoodie, and it&#x27;s visible too because my hair is brown.</li>
            <li> smoothly lavender, it just relaxes me!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Wanted a tea tree oil to help treat my dandruff while remaining free of parabens etc.  </li>
            <li> I have light dandruff sometimes</li>
            <li> This shampoo fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> and I also don&#x27;t ever hear him complain about flakes or his head itching, which in my opinion is a double win for me.</li>
            <li> I am happy to finally have found something that works for my hair!</li>
            <li> BUT I wanted a shampoo that wasn&#x27;t filled with chemicals and stumbled upon Maple Holistic Tea tree oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the Silk 18 conditioner and the combination is fantastic.</li>
            <li> She loves that it takes care of her issues and says that is smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> He suggested I switch to a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> have been so happy with this product that I even decided to get a different product in the Maple Holistics line for my boyfriend to try.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a sulphate free shampoo (I got a Brazilian Blowout) that would help me out</li>
            <li> After applying it, it feels nice on the scalp and it appears to be working very well for controlling dandruff.</li>
            <li> The bonus to Maple Holistics shampoo, is that it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my color faded slower, which I was hoping for since it is sulfate free -</li>
            <li> I want to avoid SLS which is in all commonly available shampoos.</li>
            <li> It feels almost light and airy.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair that is styled in free form dreadlocks.  </li>
            <li> Although I use this shampoo in conjunction with their Silk 18 conditioner, my hair is smooth and tangle-free even before conditioning.</li>
            <li> like it ) makes my hair so smooth , so dandruff  after this shampoo</li>
            <li> and it is for sure worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was told tea tree will help the health of my scalp, so I ordered this fabulous shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I was sent a free gift of this shampoo from the company.</li>
            <li> but this shampoo makes my hair frizz free and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Dont think you have to buy Big brand names to have a great product.</li>
            <li> Also it has the good smell plus its all natural thats why i decide to get this product</li>
            <li> I chose to try this out based on it being natural and holistic, as well as all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> This has kept my color looking good so far.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it also softens my hair, as my hair is mostly gray and coarse</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is good since sulfates strip away natural oils on your head and parabens have been linked to hormone disruption.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this is a good product.</li>
            <li> and she loved it as she has completely gray hair</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do get dry scalp and this product really helps, but it is also great for every day cleansing, it&#x27;s scent is very refreshing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but damn, is it worth every cent! :D</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo, makes my hair feel soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> Besides the smell, I love how it keeps my hair smooth, soft and very easy to brush.</li>
            <li> It worked really well!!!</li>
            <li> It helped with my dandruff so much!!!</li>
            <li> Works for me, thanks!!!</li>
            <li> It has given me a very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> It leaves our hair feeling clean, smelling nice, and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> Is the original still available?</li>
            <li> The tea tree isn&#x27;t super strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> The kind that is not irritating to the nose but really sweet  with a citrusy hint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo lathered up very nicely for me and left my hair feeling exceptionally clean after washing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone dealing with any kind of scalp irritation or dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> As opposed to most anti-dandruff shampoos, this is very gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fairly strong and kind of masculine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that it contains botanical ingredients and no harsh ingredients or parabens, and that it is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> After using it a second time, I can see that it&#x27;s working nicely!</li>
            <li> Original Review:  </li>
            <li> Iordered the tea tree shampoo and was instantly excited by the smell when I took off the safety seal.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you notice is the smell, which is really refreshing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I was absolutely excited to use this product after I read the reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I first started out with their conditioner and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo on monday and have been using it for the past 3 days and already am impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very dense, medium-long hair.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t really need to use that much to get a good lather going.  </li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, and this is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used that actually addresses my scalp issues.</li>
            <li> Smells great and cleared up my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My scalp tends to get dry, so this was a great product to sooth my irritated skin.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a mild fragrance, and is sulpher- free, a plus in my book.  </li>
            <li> No drying, just clean.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo gets my hair clean and leaves my purple intact to shine another day.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil shampoo always makes my hair feel so clean</li>
            <li> I love natural products and try to use more of them in my routine.</li>
            <li> My scalp is itchy after using &amp; my hair does not feel clean.</li>
            <li> I can feel how it purifies the scalp and leaves the hair clean and shinny.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t stand not feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of the bottle, the fantastic smell, and how gentle it is on your scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> knowing that they use clean ingredients doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a head and shoulders user for many years, and wanted to find something more natural to treat my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so clean afterwards; it gets rid of all the tangles too.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry scalp and hair and this shampoo has been doing a great job at keeping it moisturized and  clean since day 1.</li>
            <li> My scalp also feels clean.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t really clean my hair, but it also won&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> It smells great without any heavy perfumes, and it makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I got the same tingle and results as the stronger scented tea trees, but with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The shampoo came a day sooner than I anticipated, was a pleasant surprise and just in time I used the last of mine and needed it that day.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a positive review like most others but this shampoo just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I have purchased this directly from maple holistics, I love the product!</li>
            <li> This shampoo seemed to dry out my scalp even more and cause more itching and more dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I am used to using the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo, which costs me $28 every week or so.</li>
            <li> My hair gets very dry during the winter and thinks works great at keeping the flakes at bay.</li>
            <li> It is still nice and refreshing, but not quite as strong as other tea tree products.</li>
            <li> With bright purple tresses, regular shampoo STRIPS out my color, even those marketed as color boosting!</li>
            <li> the shampoo itself smells okay, but the things it does for your hair really make up for it</li>
            <li> This is a really good product, I&#x27;m going to try different one now the one for greasy hair.</li>
            <li> This leaves your head feeling cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s overall a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> It really changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li> My hair is generally healthy, but I&#x27;ve colored it and appreciate how gentle this shampoo is.</li>
            <li> However, after I use this, my mind was totally changed because Lavender smell was good</li>
            <li> I might try another lavender shampoo and if its not as good i&#x27;ll go back to this one.</li>
            <li> I love it, It helps out so much with our condition we were having with our hair.</li>
            <li> I looked around on Amazon and liked that this was all natural and did not include sulfates.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and it really help my scalp when it was so itchy</li>
            <li> and I still have a good bit left.</li>
            <li> It took a about 3 applications for my hair and scalp to get the full effect</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and how fast it works.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and leaves my scalp moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very relaxing and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It cleans it gently so that your scalp can produce a healthy balance of sebum.</li>
            <li> It probably takes longer than just a week to get the full result.</li>
            <li> I received a full sized bottle to sample.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate a safe shampoo that treats dandruff.</li>
            <li> I decided on this shampoo because I was starting to get dandruff, and I think it was a good decision.</li>
            <li> I also really like the smell, which is mostly rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many other shampoos I have used have a very chemically smell, and this one does not - the lavender, rosemary and tea tree oil make for a great scent.  </li>
            <li> Great substitute (and in my opinion superior choice) for those looking for an alternative to head and shoulders or other similar shampoos.</li>
            <li> , my hair felt soft and it smelled great, i like the fact that it is all natural!</li>
            <li> (my face is usually pretty sensitive) and I got kind of a burning/ cooling sensation there more than the rest of my scalp (kind of like putting vick vaporrub on - similar sensation).</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed with the tree oil shampoo is the light clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> Its a great value for the price as well as retail stores charge an arm and a leg for other Tea Tree Shampoo&#x27;s and those don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband for mild dandruff.</li>
            <li> Cleared up mild dandruff caused by eczema</li>
            <li> Super bummed that it didn&#x27;t work for my dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I had mild dandruff and once I started this shampoo, dandruff was gone.</li>
            <li> I only bought 1 bottle to try it and since the first wash, it was amazing results!</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a mild scent.</li>
            <li> I have mild dandruff and this cleared it up really quickly without stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> She gets mild dandruff in the wintertime and swears that this is a heaven send.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so mild, it doesn&#x27;t even smell like an anti-dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li> I don;t have dandruff but what made me totally fall in love with this shampoo  is the super lovely smell.</li>
            <li> It feels super</li>
            <li> Smells great and left his hair nice and shiny and controls his dry skin that he sometimes gets in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and am sure the results will only get better.</li>
            <li> have used a lot of shampoos and hair treatments but of no use.&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo gave me extraordinary results reduced hair fall</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little damaged and this shampoo is doing beautiful things for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a great all natural alternative to chemical filled standard dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural shampoos and most do not rinse well and leave my hair with a lot of residue and a very itchy scalp after one day.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and so far the shampoo has been excellent in controlling dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks and it started working the very first time.  </li>
            <li> Clean, refreshing, and natural...</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the thought of it being completely organic, if there&#x27;s such a thing anymore.</li>
            <li> This shampoo took away my dandruff and left my hair feeling so healthy and clean!</li>
            <li> He is comfortable, it smells great, we really have no complaints (other than the fact that we wish it was cheaper -</li>
            <li> I love it, and it has already sprouted out loads of new &#x27;baby hairs&#x27;</li>
            <li> Previously I used the Sage Shampoo with great results.  </li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t dry my hair out, and I love that it&#x27;s natural and full of good ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I recommend a good hydrating condition with use of this shampoo as it tends to dry my hair out some.</li>
            <li> It keeps the head fresh and free of dandruff and it&#x27;s priced very well too!</li>
            <li> My only faults with this were that the smell wasn&#x27;t very strong nor did it leave my scalp feeling super tingly clean.  </li>
            <li> Better than any dandruff shampoo on the market, I have VERY sensitive skin and this shampoo</li>
            <li> On the positive side I like the scent, and after using it for over a week it appears to keep my light dandruff under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you SO much!!</li>
            <li> I am still working on my first bottle!</li>
            <li> Has a unique feature that aids in healing scalp disorders with consistent usage without drying out the scalp itself.</li>
            <li> I was instantly impressed with the feeling it left after the first use, and it cleared up the majority of the dandruff by the second use!  </li>
            <li> and this shampoo really do help to my dandruff problem!!</li>
            <li> and this is the first product that helped!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo if you have dandruff!!!</li>
            <li> only product i&#x27;ve tried from maple holistics so was hesitant, but loved the way this shampoo left my hair clean &amp; fresh feeling without drying out or being too potent</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and is very soothing for a dry, itchy scalp in the winter.</li>
            <li> It really leaves my hair soft, strong, healthy, and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have haven&#x27;t had it long but the clean feeling on my scalp feels amazing, and</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue using this amazing product.</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s awesome that this is mostly natural and none of those harsh chemicals in mainstream brands.</li>
            <li> It works great and removes all the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and notice a great difference.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling amazing and my dandruff is nolonger a problem.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing line of&lt;br /&gt;Products</li>
            <li> I looked for alternatives and wanted something natural and safe for color treated hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth the purchase if you have scalp or dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>

            <li> It left my hair smelling great and feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> It has so many natural.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li> This shampoo is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something more natural to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> so thats a nice extra bonus</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s all good after I use the Silk 18 shampoo by the same company (http://www.amazon.com/SALE-Natural-Conditioner-Maple-Holistics/dp/B00L1KFQKC/ref&#x3D;pd_bxgy_bt_img_y)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 stars and I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I was exspecting more considering the smell, but was still pleasently surprised.  </li>
            <li> So far I have really enjoyed this shampoo just with</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I found an anti-dandruff shampoo that brought me back in time over thirty years.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews for products, but I felt obligated to let people know that this shampoo works unlike anything else we had tried, including prescription</li>
            <li> |There&#x27;s a distinct level of tea tree oil scent that I like</li>
            <li> but I figured if it worked, it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> So far I like the product and will probably buy more for me and my husband.</li>
            <li> Reading the label i love the fact its practically all natural.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely purchasing my own bottle.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this shampoo and will be reordering.  </li>
            <li> My scalp and hair feel so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only reason I deduct one star is it&#x27;s kind of pricey.</li>
            <li> leaves hair fresh but still dandruff</li>
            <li> No flakes, not dry feeling, pretty happy with the result so far.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new dandruff shampoo that was more gentle and yet more efficient at the same time; luckily I found it!</li>
            <li> It smells really good and within a few uses I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a unique and lasting scent; you&#x27;ll surely have people asking you what products you use,</li>
            <li> I have mild dandruff and this shampoo really helps!</li>
            <li> Conventional shampoos really irritate me (too many chemicals), so I was really pleased to find this fantastic alternative.</li>
            <li> Only did 4 stars because I used some other new products during blow dry and straightening and they may have had a great hand in the great results!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other products from this company, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Moving right now is out of the question.  </li>
            <li> Just the right amount of foam.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives the right amount of scent.</li>
            <li> Yes, I received it right on time with my Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have have dandruff problem right now</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I needed something that would help with dandruff and my sore itchy scalp, and wouldn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural oils; I must say so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I use it not only in my own hair but that of my daughters , her first reaction was &amp;#34</li>
            <li> I really  wanted a shampoo  that would clean her hair and hopefully help keep lice away.</li>
            <li> It got my hair and scalp SQEAKY clean, really.  </li>
            <li> Really helped with my dandruff and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and I think my hair is a little healthier, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work super well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the major dandruff shampoo brands, apple cider vinegar, the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method, coconut oil, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was effective at combatting the issue and also smelled GOOD and not nearly as medicinal as other products I had tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in search of a shampoo that is natural with no sulfates and LATHERS and makes my hair feel clean afterwards WITH NO ITCHY SCALP!</li>
            <li> The smell is great too, not like the usual tea tree smell.  </li>
            <li> My scalp feels calm for the first time</li>
            <li> There are many companies engaged in &amp;#34;greenwashing,&amp;#34; and Maple Holistics is apparently one of them.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help with dandruff and scalp problems, but it makes my hair look a whole lot better!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a sweet, earthy smell and leaves my hair felling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Nothing better than being pure and washing with natural products.</li>
            <li> and while I am happy to say it is a fairly subtle, natural smell, it just isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to cheap chemical filled shapoo</li>
            <li> I have found this shampoo to really help how quickly my hair gets greasy, and has definetly helped with my scalp acne.</li>
            <li> and I hoped that this tea tree oil shampoo would be at least as effective or better.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and it leaves my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair smell so nice after they dry.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was a delight left my head feeling good and was not terribly expensive while remaining natural.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does smell and feel great, and it only takes a small amount to wash, I just wish it helped more with the flaking.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and fine hair; it works well for me.  </li>
            <li> I loved the idea of tea tree oil, but my hair&#x27;s hydration is vital to me since I flat iron and color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of tea tree oil, but my hair&#x27;s hydration is vital to me since I flat iron and color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit lathers up really good</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo, it&#x27;s natural and decent.</li>
            <li> The scent of tea tree oil is very refreshing and the shampoo feels very easy on my scalp unlike other shampoos that make your scalp feel dry.</li>
            <li> It might work somewhat for more mid dandruff.</li>
            <li> This lack of lather is the only thing I do not like about this shampoo as I like a bit more suds when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is has many medicinal uses, it is applied to the skin for infections such as acne, fungal infections of the nail, lice, scabies, athlete&#x27;s foot (tinea pedis), and ringworm.</li>
            <li> I will definitely  purchase more.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was tickled by the tingly feeling from the tea tree</li>
            <li> As i will keep using it i will write more review based on different shampoo&#x27;s i used by maple holistics.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with this every 2-3 days and since starting I have gotten compliments about how healthy  my hair is.</li>
            <li> All those factors considered (including the price), it still works very well in treating dandruff and itchy scalp in no time!</li>
            <li> Two months later they are still gone and my scalp is healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really helps my contact dermatitis/ dandruff issues!</li>
            <li> Thanks Maple Holistics!  </li>
            <li> Within the first 2-3 days of using the Tea Tree shampoo,I noticed a difference in my scalp.</li>
            <li> Got rid of that itchy scalp feeling altogether after first time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to people looking for a better product to use on their hair.</li>
            <li> You will need to use a couple of times before seeing a change, but once you do, it will be consistent.</li>
            <li> Overall using the shampoo has been okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this another month before I raise the rating any higher.</li>
            <li> I did really like the Argan Oil Conditioner!</li>
            <li> Firstly it is comprised of top quality organic oils(Tea Tree, Rosemary, Lavender), but those oils are all essential to stimulate blood flow to the head and thereby the transport of nutrients to the scalp.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> I will say that this product if used exactly as sold will work wonders.  </li>
            <li> then you should most definitely try this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite prone to dryness, so I don&#x27;t exactly blame the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Both proucts did exactly what they said they would.  </li>
            <li> Nice fragrance,Organic and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone to try this product!!</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> I was uncertain trying this shampoo for the first time and knowing nothing about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a supporting conditioner is needed.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed how my&lt;</li>
            <li> Funny how things work out sometimes...</li>
            <li> I first used this, I was struck by the odor.</li>
            <li> By adding the extra, it foamed up, and I was able to scrub.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to work better than head and shoulders, and about the same as T-gel.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first time using it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I cannot stand the smell of tea tree</li>
            <li> It will last you thats for sure.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have ever tried a tea tree oil shampoo before.</li>
            <li> Smells funny, didn&#x27;t help with dandruff, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, I would not recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This shampoo comes with the whole package!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would urge anyone interested in avoiding high-hazard ingredients in their cosmetics to look up each ingredient before buying.</li>
            <li> I finally have healthy hair again.</li>
            <li> That review was for the first bottle I ordered.</li>
            <li> first day i noticed a big difference my hair feel healthy</li>
            <li> I just love it and I;m never going back to H&amp;S.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this winter has disappeared and my hair is very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and am going to be a loyal user of the Maple Holistics brand.</li>
            <li> I have dry natural curly hair and makes my hair beautiful and wow the smell.</li>
            <li> There are many new additives and the natural oils have gone from being the 8th ingredient to the 18th or 20 something.</li>
            <li> Looks like a keeper so far!!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle enough to clean my roots and skull, it has medium foaming and leaves a light, relaxing herbal smell.  </li>
            <li> Putting aloe vera gel or pure aloe vera on to sit before a second shampoo seemed to help the scalp feel better and get rid of flaking dryness.</li>
            <li> After the bottle ran out, I was trying to use up some other leftover shampoos we had lying around  (mostly popular brand name anti-dandruff shampoos, which still work for my Dad).</li>
            <li> I have decided to switch from Kiehl&#x27;s Amino Acid (the only good hair product for me in Kiehl&#x27;s) to Maple Holistics, which are easier to order and has more choices and usually cheaper.</li>
            <li> I used to have a very itchy, dry scalp with occasional dandruff, but now with using the Tea tree oil shampoo , my scalp feels great.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft or clean.</li>
            <li> Feels clean and helps with break outs near my hair line.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo ,my scalp and hair felt so clean, and still  manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a ton, which is a good thing since the bottle is pretty small.  </li>
            <li> well I used many different dandruff shampoos as well as try baking soda and nothing has really worked well.</li>
            <li> so it can be more accessible to the general public.</li>
            <li> The fact that is is paraben and sulfate free, as well as cruelty-free, is definitely a major plus.</li>
            <li> Maybe that has more to do with head size, but the original quarter suggestion produced little lather, and was ending up getting my hands stuck in my hair rather than allowing me to work my fingers along my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have long fine straight but full hair.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed positive results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard positive things about it</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised as my hair is very clean and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> think my favourite part (other than the smell) was that it did such a great job without having any chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> This tea tree shampoo really stopped any flaking after the first use.</li>
            <li> , I pretty much had no choice but to use this.</li>
            <li> I only shampoo my hair every other day and it keeps my hair from getting too oily on the days I don&#x27;t shampoo which is great.</li>
            <li> and I can safely say that after a month or so, my scalp was no longer dry and the dandruff went away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so my hair tends to be dry and have a static issue during the winter.</li>
            <li> Like most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos your hair may feel a bit dry after you use it.</li>
            <li> I experience dry scalp most of the time.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it works for some individuals, but it certainly did not help my condition.</li>
            <li> I was curious and excited it compare it to my Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now, particularly for hot, itchy scalp when traveling through SE Asia.  </li>
            <li> This is nice stuff, but a little pricey for the amount you get (8 oz).</li>
            <li> I laughed at first because, seriously.</li>
            <li> highly recommend anyone looking to get rid of dandruff to give this a try first.</li>
            <li> This a great shampoo for little to moderate dandruff.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little to build a great lather and it cleans well.</li>
            <li> so I purchased Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff with Jojoba &amp; Organic Spikenard for him and have seen a great improvement when he is using it regularly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended you guys!</li>
            <li> It has an aromatic smell that I really like..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my hair and helps with dandruff.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my hair very well</li>
            <li> It really helps relieve itching on my scalp.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you can really feel the improvement.</li>
            <li> Not only is my scalp flake free</li>
            <li> Thanks Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels so much healthier and my hair is softer than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use much (quarter size in my hand) to wash my hair well.</li>
            <li> The scent is natural and fresh.</li>
            <li> The Maple Holistics shampoo is a creamy pearly color and lathers up really well.  </li>
            <li> And it was gentle on their hair.  </li>
            <li> the directions say so that my whole scalp is getting shampooed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the company SLS free version next and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled dandruff my whole life.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but if it takes dandruff away and lice i dont really mind.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Cleans well,  but doesn&#x27;t really fix my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> It took about 2-3 weeks to really get things in check.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my dandruff.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while now, I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My scalp is also very oily.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t shedding as much as when I used Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> not only does it leave my hair dandruff free and silky</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shampoo that smells  fresh, earthy-clean, and natural</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I feel so much relief</li>
            <li> It has a very invigorating smell, must be the Tea tree.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was suffering from light to moderate dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It treats dandruff really well and nourish the scalp.</li>
            <li> plus I really feel like its helped my hair grow quicker.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a similar product with LIGHT conditioning</li>
            <li> All the itchiness were gone after a month of straight use.</li>
            <li> but it has a way of really removing them and treating my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really bummed.  </li>
            <li> he uses it too fast.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> Everyone at home really likes this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and my hair felt lightweight and different when I got done washing it.</li>
            <li> up really well when you wash rinse repeat.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so it really soaks into my scalp.</li>
            <li> I rotate between this one and the SLS free Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo from Trader Joes since that one is 16oz for only $3.99 in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really struggling with the fact that this seems to STRIP my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders for my dandruff, but it didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I also found that the price was really reasonable as you do not have to use a ton of the product to get the job done.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil is really nourishing</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from dandruff!</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair...</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again since it really did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works.  </li>
            <li> I used this as directed throughout last winter and this spring and it worked fabulously.</li>
            <li> It has no sulfates like the &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; and name brand shampoos but does the job with gentle cleaning and leaving softness and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle on my colored hair.  </li>
            <li> the rosemary and lavender are very soothing</li>
            <li> I bought this because of my dandruff, but it really does heal skin blemishes too...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the cut on my scalp healed much faster than the one on my arm after some use of this.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see how much it&#x27;ll lather up.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I think it was very helpful, and I&#x27;m giving it a thumbs</li>
            <li> Much as before.  </li>
            <li> One: I wish this came in a larger size or was available through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I have so much hair</li>
            <li> and I use so much shampoo</li>
            <li> - I could really use a discount of some sort.</li>
            <li> The old standby&#x27;s like Selson Blue works better .</li>
            <li> It has many natural ingredients (such as lavender and rosemary) that I&#x27;ve seen recommended to soothe the scalp and help control hair loss.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light compare to other shampoos I have tried before.  </li>
            <li> It did an Amazing job of completely transforming her hair from dried, damaged, and dandruff ridden to clean, soft, with lots of body.  </li>
            <li> Like real lavender, not the overly perfume-y, doctored up lavender found in so many other things.  </li>
            <li> It is priced more reasonably than some other therapeutic shampoos I have bought from clinics.  </li>
            <li> Many products contain far too many different chemicals in them which serve no useful purpose.  </li>
            <li> I mix with my favorite shampoo for my hair since I have extremely curly hair and need the Moroccan oil products for hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t end up any better than all the other stuff I have tried.  </li>
            <li> We received this last week and we already see a significant improvement in her dandruff.</li>
            <li> Although the Sage shampoo worked better for me, this one is up to the high standards of the Maple Holistics, where all of ingredients are chosen carefully and for the reason.  </li>
            <li> so i thought i would try this, and I&#x27;ve seen great results, my hair is less itchy and dry!</li>
            <li> Cleaned my hair and scalp , left it clean for 2 days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use if you dye your hair and your scalp gets a little dry or sore from that.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant scent and does not leave hair dry as other shampoos often do.</li>
            <li> That along with past hair-loss issues and dandruff issues lead me to this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to say that this shampoo delivers in just one week of use (at least for me).</li>
            <li> I am not saying it is not a good shampoo, just that it doesn&#x27;t smell good.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this shampoo is the smell, but aside from that I&#x27;ve truely converted to this product.</li>
            <li> young son came home from summer camp one day and we started to notice his hair was matted; we assumed it was just drying funny from the pool.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly even though my daughter and the little girl shared the same bed and pillow my daughter didn&#x27;t get lice.</li>
            <li> New staple product in my beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> I now use this every other day and I am happy I can now wear black w/o the worry of flakes shedding out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel sleek and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> , I can wear black again :)</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Shampoo is aimed at people with mild to moderate dandruff and scalp blemishes.</li>
            <li> At first I was pretty iffy about trying a different shampoo because my hair has been &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; to another shampoo.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I am not crazy about is it doesn&#x27;t really lather that</li>
            <li> have ordered 2 additional bottles and will always be sure to pack this for my travel abroad and have enough for daily home use.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate dandruff.  </li>
            <li> all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a decent amount of lather, unlike a lot of anti-dandruff shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be the only thing among many I have tried that is actually working to treat my dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have tried all types of shampoos that are supposed to treat mild to moderate dandruff, but they never seem to work.</li>
            <li> Giving three stars since it was decent shampoo but didn&#x27;t get rid of my dandruff and itching.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Tea Tree oil, but so many products capture only the smell and none of the benefits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if this didn&#x27;t strip my hair so badly I&#x27;d be more inclined to keep on keeping on, but I feel like unless your hair is chock full of chemicals from hairspray or treatments, this is just too harsh for daily -or</li>

            <li> I love tea tree in general, but this shampoo helped my really dry scalp in the winter.</li>
            <li> after one use my hair already feels softer &amp; I have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a couple of times, but I already notice a difference in less dandruff, and feeling good about using a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Might be nice to use in-between my other shampoos, but it alone does not do enough to keep my dandruff at bay.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants a natural, organic product for mild to moderate dandruff.</li>
            <li> I turned to tea tree oil as a natural lice deterrent, but the medicine-y smell of the pure oil was almost unbearable.</li>
            <li> I have guttate psoriasis, and it&#x27;s hard to find an effective shampoo.</li>
            <li> My scalp and hair felt clean and cool and my hair was a bit more fluffy than usual.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really clean after washing it with this and there was even less hair loss after the first use.</li>
            <li> This natural shampoo really helped me out when I had a cyst on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> am chemically sensitive and absolutely cannot use just any shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It was just normal.</li>
            <li> While the infestation is pretty much under control, this 4-5 month experience has actually traumatized me.  </li>
            <li> I have rarely had a breakout since on my back or my scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does have tea tree in it and normally I would avoid tea tree because I am not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> Two other pros for this particular shampoo is that the jojoba makes my hair shiny and it also is free from sulfates and parabens.</li>
            <li> I get REALLY dried out in the winter (I guess its because I wear a hat to stay warm a lot) and the tea tree oil and lavender do just the trick to get me back to normal!</li>
            <li> I know products all work differently for everyone, but if I was looking for a product line that might actually live up to it&#x27;s hype, this one is worth a try in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and manageable after use, but I am also using a maple holistics conditioner, which i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product actually WORKS for dandruff, and makes my hair feel super soft.  </li>
            <li> a great all natural shampoo with none of the harsh ingredients found in almost every other shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;be been habituated to wash my hair every other day, but by the end of day one, my hair gets really greasy, itchy, and full of dandruffs.</li>
            <li> also love that this product is economical, and a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I am not easily swept into miracle cures, nor do I have a strong opinion of holistic vs modern.</li>
            <li> I decided to finally write a review AFTER using the WHOLE ENTIRE BOTTLE to truely share my experience from beginning to end with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought her a new one and another one for myself.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to shampoo.</li>
            <li> and i can see new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> He is 15 years old and very self conscious about dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Some natural shampoos make my hair difficult to comb through, but this one works and smells great.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and my scalp gets mild dandruff during the winter.</li>
            <li> The smell is not your typical strong tea tree aroma that bothers some people.</li>
            <li> this has gotta be one of the best available for people like me who have terrible dandriff.</li>
            <li> and I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> It has a very natural lavender smell.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo in combination with the silk 18 conditioner make my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find the ingredients list very different from the first bottle I reviewed.</li>
            <li> My head feels somewhat more relaxed after using it too, though I&amp;#34;m not sure</li>
            <li> but it does seem to be working because the itch is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should be aware that this is low suds shampoo.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly dandruff, but something similar, and though I tried every over-the-counter product, nothing worked--until I tried this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, BPA free/recyclable, not wasteful, made in the USA, and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a ton of product in my hair, so I was really surprised to feel the build up washing</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the first one that has actually made a difference!</li>
            <li> First time I actually got a compliment on how shiny my hair was!</li>
            <li> I am excited to try other Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am leaving a &amp;#34;4.5&amp;#34; is because this product did not meet every expectation but it did do exactly what it said it was going to do.</li>
            <li> Eventually I purchased a bottle of the Tea Tree shampoo (the one with rosemary) from Maple Holistics and wow was there a difference!  </li>
            <li> I have moderate dandruff, and decided to give this a go as most other dandruff shampoos did not keep it well under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use it multiple times, but I am looking forward to seeing how it does with consistent use.</li>
            <li> My other Tea Tree shampoo of only $8.00 works much better.  </li>
            <li> But this helped more than my usual head and shoulders for some reason, maybe the ingredients?</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time last month</li>
            <li> I would def recommend for natural hair!  </li>
            <li> This tee tree oil shampoo is the first shampoo I have found that controls my teen son&#x27;s dandruff.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who loves buying natural, but also needs something that truly works!</li>
            <li> Natural is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night</li>
            <li> I am fairly sensitive to smells and also find this shampoo scent to be subtle and nice.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t have dandruff, however the winter cold tends to cause flakes and this shampoo was great at curing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside for me is the smell - I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have heavy dandruff, but generally use a dandruff shampoo to keep my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need a stronger shampoo, but I&#x27;m not sure why it worked magically in the beginning and then stopped working completely.      </li>
            <li> , my dandruff flared up so much I had to switch back to my normal dandruff</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my hair looking healthy and natural without the greasy look and doesn&#x27;t look dried out!</li>
            <li> It feels gentle on the scalp and has really helped the winter dry scalp scene.</li>
            <li> I, like any health fanatic, am constantly on the hunt for healthy alternatives to everything!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mellower than the pure essential oil.  </li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;m actually growing new hair!!</li>
            <li> have scalp acne and a little dandruff have used this 3x and can tell a huge difference already</li>
            <li> I think sulfate free shampoo helped with hair loss a little and hair felt a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I am 27, and have spent all of my life with oily fine hair, and moderate acne.  </li>
            <li> After using this for about 4 weeks, I had to go back to my old product (Philip B anti-flake relief shampoo and Borghese Restorativo Conditioning Rinse) because I had large flakes.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering this shampoo, but I am SO happy that I went through with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Instead it has a pleasantly mild scent and lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li> Customer service was extremely helpful and quick with replies and shipping.</li>
            <li> so I have to use a little more than recommended on the label, but I still make it last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> This product would be great for anyone who suffers from dry/itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I need to only use it one to two times in order to calm my scalp and keep my dandruff from acting up or reoccurring.</li>
            <li> This product can easily clear the scalp without drying my hair.</li>
            <li> and so far I haven&#x27;t had to scratch once.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> could get this soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and manageable while taking the flakes away.</li>
            <li> but my hair is SO shiny and soft after each use.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was pleasantly surprised with how well it cleaned and worked.</li>
            <li> It helps, but doesn&#x27;t give me complete relief.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and my scalp felt invigorating when I use this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely ordering from them in the future.</li>
            <li> Still fighting the battle, we purchased this looking for a natural route that will help the damage I had done with the chemical lice treatment.  </li>
            <li> This has done just that so far.</li>
            <li> Removed dandruff completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go so far as to say</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 3 months now and so far, I don;t experience</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend trying this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also for an added bonus,it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and therefore I thought too old for cradle cap</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural</li>
            <li> I have been consuming this bottle for nearly 2 months now.</li>
            <li> So far it has worked but we ran out a week ago</li>
            <li> Got this to help manage my three year old&#x27;s seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find an all natural solution for dandruff.</li>
            <li> the fact is it&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> So far this has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> And I know using this all natural product</li>
            <li> I gave it 10 days to work, like their website suggested, until the dandruff went away completely.  </li>
            <li> Does really work on moderate dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have been using it with the silk conditioner, and my hair looks soft and shiny without being weighed down...and</li>
            <li> My hair was soft even after t-shirt drying for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> As far as Shampoo&#x27;s go</li>
            <li> I tried this and was pleasantly surprised with how well it worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me a couple months so far</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner and my dandruff didn&#x27;t get any better and in fact, got worse, because I stopped using my old shampoo and conditioner which at least was moderately effective.  </li>
            <li> My old products reduced my dandruff but hadn&#x27;t eliminated it</li>
            <li> Completely sold</li>
            <li> so this won&#x27;t go far---</li>
            <li> My six year old uses the shampoo for some scalp issue and loves it.</li>
            <li> Problem is being a six year old</li>
            <li> The fact that the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients are all organic and natural is what sold me on trying the&lt;</li>
            <li> my hair shiny, soft, and styleable.</li>
            <li> hair is soft with no frizz..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that the grease I get from the natural oils in my hair lessened any, but the flakes did not return.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that the grease I get from the natural oils in my hair lessened any, but the flakes did not return.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is very watery and will only relieve dandruff for about 12 hours before you have to wash again.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a natural shampoo that would not break me out and didn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair is so soft and has been since using both of these</li>
            <li> The packaging looks professional</li>
            <li> You will be pleasantly surprised by the scent and the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I had a flaky scalp prior to using this shampoo but within two weeks of using it, it really cleared up my scalp.</li>
            <li> and she said it made it so soft feeling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of the natural sebum that you scalp produces.</li>
            <li> Until I began using this shampoo, my hair always felt completely fried a week or two after dyeing.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp and issues with inflammation.  </li>
            <li> My dandruff was completely gone</li>
            <li> My scalp does not itch nearly as much, and my hair is definitely not a greasy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and in the winter my head itches a lot.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil shampoo has eliminated this problem almost completely.</li>
            <li> It really works for me and the entire family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once so far today</li>
            <li> Since I gave birth I get sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I get a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I tried this out and it made my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> So, I was skeptical but ordered it just because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> but I have long curly sorry to say beautiful hair and</li>
            <li> Though there is not much new hair growing, the loss of existing hair is very much reduced.</li>
            <li> I have had dry scalp for a long time and tried many different products and none of them have worked as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> Highly, highly satisfied with the results that it has shown in just the past couple of days!</li>
            <li> Naturally, it may not help all, but compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried this really has proven to work very well.  </li>
            <li> I have dry curly thinning hair and for the first time in forever, my head doesn&#x27;t itch</li>
            <li> It costs A LOT more than the stuff I was using, but my scalp is much less dry and itchy, and there&#x27;s no dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin especially in the winter</li>
            <li> I would love for someone to tell me the ingredients are the same and just more broken down and I misunderstood.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed and after using it for a few times I have not even a trace of dandruff flakes on my head.</li>
            <li> Finally a NATURAL Dandruff Shampoo that works and isn&#x27;t blue and full of unknown chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am always surprised when I find all natural products that are equally (if not more) effective compared to the other toxic stuff we&#x27;re all used to.</li>
            <li> I think this would work very well if you have slightly dry scalp, but if you have moderate dryness and flakiness, you probably would not get as much benefit.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel clean but dried out my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> For a long time I was looking for a gentle, natural dandruff preventing shampoo and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> and this is light enough not to weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> This ingredient is classified as a high hazard on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Database.</li>
            <li> I simply used this product as instructed and styled as normal using my other regular products and my hair was full, soft, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was very little dandruff, my hair was silky smooth and there was no breakage or itching in the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products in the past and almost always it&#x27;s either too strong or too weak...</li>
            <li> I had previously used a bit of coal tar shampoo on the affected areas to control that, and recently learned that coal tar is not entirely safe (great - 25 years later!)</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really comment on its long term effects yet</li>
            <li> I started using it on my kids and they have NEVER encountered lice and they love how it tingles lightly on their scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and now hubby isn&#x27;t afraid to use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> Lately I have been researching and switching to more organic and natural based products for items such as toothpaste, deodorant, etc.</li>
            <li> (i think my hair is somewhat sensitive in general)</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like that or not but definitely enjoy the scalp feel.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from dandruff for a long time, ever since puberty really</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on them three times and their scalp is nearly back to normal.</li>
            <li> After just one washing, the infuriating little psoriasis patch I have at the very front of my hairline was somehow...changed (in a good way!).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shinny and smooth but not oily, and just a little bit can make enough foam.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see a difference but by the 4th to 5th day, my hair was no longer dry and static decreased drastically.  </li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil Shampoo was purchased for my daughter who recently colored her hair and it was &amp;#34;itchy.&amp;#34;  This shampoo solved her problem without changing the newly colored hair color.  </li>
            <li> Although it is quite expansive compared to other regular commercial shampoo brands on the market, it is worth a try for its high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say this helped get rid of my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> All in all - I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone looking for a natural dandruff treatment!</li>
            <li> usually dont take the time to review a product, but the one is worth it!</li>
            <li> I have mild dandruff and occasionally my scalp can get flaky especially when I mess with its normal routine.</li>
            <li> I had to use more about the amount of a half dollar to accommodate the mass of hair that I have, and no, I was not going all the way down.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend it for people who have a dry scalp!</li>
            <li> Helping so much with the itchy dry scalp I have!</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine hair, and I dye my hair every six weeks or so.</li>
            <li> It is one of the very very few that won&#x27;t trigger an allergic reaction to my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth the money</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because seriously, it&#x27;s the only thing that worked for me</li>
            <li> I was given this to try after complaining about the smell Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil left when I mixed it with shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I only use it every couple of days to keep it clear.</li>
            <li> When I use it regularly my scalp is clear of dandruff and irritation.</li>
            <li> As far as dandruff, it&#x27;s only been one use</li>
            <li> The scent is apparent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I get dandruff in the winter time, and so far (only November)</li>
            <li> She uses this daily now and has naturally rid our lice problem.  </li>
            <li> However, my husband has regular old dandruff and after a week or so of treatment...</li>
            <li> So far though I quite like this shampoo and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> now I barely ever see flakes.</li>
            <li> The directions say to leave it in for a couple minutes, but i was busy and left it in for 10 minites.  </li>
            <li> I recently Tryed this product because I&#x27;m transiting from perm to natural</li>
            <li> This product is a pleasure to use, adding a bit of luxury into your daily routine for relatively modest expense.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then the shampoo will make the skin on your hands peel especially if you have calluses.</li>
            <li> And hopefully the price will drop in the near future!</li>
            <li> Such a high-hazard ingredient, in my opinion, has no place in a product that touts its natural and organic ingredients and is made by a company with the word &amp;#34;Holistics&amp;#34; in its name.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but it is too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> If I see this product with my own eyes, I would not buy it because it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Not sure how true that is or not</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone that is looking for an anti-dandruff shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell like some kind of weird medicine.</li>
            <li> but it still is kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li> My hair does seem a bit more dry all around, but it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s this shampoo or just the climate.</li>
            <li> and I loved the fact that i wasnt scratching my usual itchy scalp!!!!  </li>
            <li> Please note that I do not have other skin conditions, and have oily skin (large pores).</li>
            <li> /&gt;About my hair:&lt;br /&gt;Caucasian chemically treated&lt;br /&gt;About 22&amp;#34;-24&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Damaged, dry, and brittle&lt;br /&gt;Frequent Flat Ironing&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff, and natural oils being main issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is less pricey than other shampoos alike but works fairly fine.</li>
            <li> After the first week I noticed my hair is softer and requires less conditioner or after-product to keep it that way.  </li>
            <li> nice bonus is that I can now also go a day between washings if I choose without my hair appearing dirty, something that in the past would be unthinkable for my very fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair soft, hydrated, and tangle free (a characteristic usually associated with creams and conditioners).</li>
            <li> Has natural essential oils such as tea tree,lavender,and argan</li>
            <li> It also does not dry my hair</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bit more itchiness than usual, and a few more flakes ; thought it might take a bit for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;After a week and a half of using the shampoo</li>
            <li> It was really embarrassing to me because I have really dark hair</li>
            <li> smelled like old, too long in the shelf, shampoo.</li>
            <li> No more oozing plaques; just rare dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I have gad trouble with dandruff intermittently since my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> First few times, there were no bubbles lathering effect but give it a week</li>
            <li> It is not too expensive, fairly affordable unlike some of the other brands that offer the same thing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair, and helps keep my scalp clear.</li>
            <li> I had slight dandruff and was liking for a shampoo that would really works and came across this.</li>
            <li> So far I feel like it has helped with the dry and flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li> and once I dry my hair, it&#x27;s beautifully soft.</li>
            <li> Within three uses, my dry scalp and dandruff was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to get dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My dandruff is visibly less after using it every day for one week straight.</li>
            <li> The only draw back for this particular shampoo for me was the stronger than expected lavender undertone in the scent it has.  </li>
            <li> The formula of the shampoo is thick and consistent and there is a slight lather at first.</li>
            <li> I live in the country and there are a ton of ticks and other insects.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I think it stripped out extra build up in my hair, leaving it feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> and I know that because I have tried other more expensive anti-dandruff shampoos and this is the only one that worked so far.</li>
            <li> My doctor actually recommended this to me due to the all natural products.</li>
            <li> and I already notice my head itches less than it normally does.</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the little amount of shampoo for the high price.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier due to the natural ingredients this shampoo provides.</li>
            <li> Speaking of discounts, my second complaint is that the item description claims buying two or more bottles saves 30%, but that is not actually true, unless there&#x27;s an unknown hoop to jump through to actually make that work.</li>
            <li> It also lathers very well with only a small amount and also does wonders for dandruff.</li>
            <li> I always prefer natural products in general, but they don&#x27;t always work as well as heavy synthetic chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on helping blemishes around the scalp area, I likely haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this shampoo as it says it helps with dead skin and scalp blemishes.  </li>
            <li> due to the dry climate I live in.</li>
            <li> and I can wear black clothing again without feeling self conscious!</li>
            <li> I have very long (middle of back) hair</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I do like this shampoo, especially for a dry, winter climate.</li>
            <li> I have a combo of dry at the middle and ends and some oiliness at the scalp, especially if i get sweaty at night.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair and in winter I usually get dandruff.</li>
            <li> That was just to cover scalp, and hair that lays flat against the scalp.</li>
            <li> it goes flat</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found that the shampoo totally eradicates the flakes, but I haven&#x27;t given it a long trial yet.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels much healthier and happier and my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down with build-up, like with other shampoos - it feels cleaner than ever.</li>
            <li> so this beats the old head and shoulders hands down for me.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be oily but my scalp is dry and itchy, especially in the winter..</li>
            <li> I have moderately oily hair and did not realize I had a dry, itchy scalp until trying this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to get dandruff when its growing in natural color..its odd.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a shampoo to help take care of a dry scalp or dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so far, as I am also trying another dandruff shampoo (not holistic)</li>
            <li> I love how it does not contain any weird, unknown chemicals as well.</li>
            <li> My sclap is no longer a dry itchy mess and is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and splurged and bought the most expensive shampoo of my life.  </li>
            <li> My son has very dry hair and occasionally has dandruff.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how little I needed to use to wash my hair with.   </li>
            <li> My grocery store stopped carrying the shampoo and conditioner I was using, so I just bought a random bottle of shampoo and conditioner, which I found to be a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> and I love the tips they give you on the card in the package, telling you to rinse with cold water at the end</li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients and doesn&#x27;t include any harsh chemical fillers.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky for a few days before needing a wash.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting issues with my scalp for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Used it till the bottle was empty, but it just didn&#x27;t work well enough.</li>
            <li> Came two days earlier than I expected in the mail.</li>
            <li> as I call them, that will one day grow to be as long as the rest -meaning</li>
            <li> I have long hair, permed and highlighted a while ago.</li>
            <li> Not much difference than a regular $5 shampoo if it isn&#x27;t going to help with what is promises it is supposed to help with.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d rather use something natural than harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have definitely had less dandruff, however I would add some moisture back in my hair immediately with my leave in conditioner and castor oil.</li>
            <li> When used, it left my hair feeling dry and rough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying this if you&#x27;ve used other anti-dandruff shampoos long term</li>
            <li> The other big name dandruff shampoos seem to help for a week and then seem to lose their potency.  </li>
            <li> She says she will never go back to other dandruff shampoos as they just do not compare.</li>
            <li> Due to circumstances beyond my control, I am currently living in a roach-infested residence.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, one day during a shower my regular soap (I didn&#x27;t want to use the shower gel due to the perfume triggering the itch)</li>
            <li> I get occasional dandruff due to hairspray and this product helped me out.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my moderate dandruff due to my constraint hair coloring and striping my scalp each time I color.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have found this stuff long ago!</li>
            <li> It may be a little more expensive than drug store brands</li>
            <li> The ingredients seemed natural, and well selected; it worked for a lot of people, That being said, I hoped that if anything, this product might not eliminate my dandruff completely, but at the very least improve it.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets dry, itchy and flaky during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This tea tree shampoo realblely gives results, I prefer it to head and shoulders or tar shampoo which leaves my hair dry and strawlike.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair and during the winter my scalp gets really dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> I have always had a dry scalp and nothing has ever helped until now.</li>
            <li> , my scalp began to dry out and had some dandruff.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for my two boys who both had extremely dry scalp.</li>
            <li> We sometimes follow up with conditioner as the tea tree shampoo makes his hair dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have dry scalp.</li>
            <li> so my skin gets extremely dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> If your scalp is dry and itchy, I would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I suffer from dry scalp from living in the frozen tundra that is Michigan.</li>
            <li> My hair feels lustrous and soft......not dry and brittle like I get from &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; shampoos.  </li>
            <li> The dry, itchy scalp feeling</li>
            <li> It works on dry hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> In winter my scalp gets dry, itchy and flaky.</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel dry anymore after using this product, and it cleans well.  </li>
            <li> My roots are oily but ends are dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> Caused the end of my hair to dry up even with conditioner</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I use this when my hair gets really dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect the shampoo would address the dry scalp issue after one use</li>
            <li> (washed, conditioned, blew dry, and then straightened)  </li>
            <li> Cured my incredibly dry scalp.</li>
            <li> but I still had irritated patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo because I have an extremely dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> My hair gets so tangles after they dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mainly used Head &amp; Shoulders, and the other leading brands, but I think this one worked just as well, if not better than the others.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I&#x27;ve had dry scalp problems that couldn&#x27;t be fixed with drugstore varieties of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Currently, I&#x27;m dark brunette, and last colored in September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry hair and a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> This product worked wonders on my hair, my dandruff has definitely died down since using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a bit dry for my ends, maybe I should also get the 18 silk conditioner and use them together!</li>
            <li> unfortunately, although it helped a bit, it only seemed to work the first weeks</li>
            <li> I use only a small amount letting it rest on my scalp for several minutes before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hair and scalp were so dry during the bitter winter months.</li>
            <li> I have very dry scalp in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> I let my husband use it because he has a very dry scalp, and it bothers him.  </li>
            <li> In the winter,I have a very dry and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has a very dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair gets very dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li> It stopped growing for 2 years and it was very dry.</li>
            <li> I only use it 2-3 times per week because my hair tends to a get a bit dry after everyday use but that could be just my hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my dry scalp issues have been reduced dramatically only after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff as regular shampoo, as a little bit goes a long way, and my hair feels cleaner than it&#x27;s felt with any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair always is itching and gets little white flakes in the front of my hair.</li>
            <li> have been using this shampoo regularly for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post an update in a few months after my next appointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing it a few times now &amp; an instant fan.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully,  and after 3 weeks, I saw no improvement.</li>
            <li> thing I noticed was that this shampoo made by hair slightly rough &amp; bunched up.</li>
            <li> Ever since my grandmother used to treat my cuts and scrapes with tea tree oil, as a child, I have been partial to its fragrance.</li>
            <li> Gave me back the body my hair was missing and cleared my scalp from psoriasis buildup.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and hoped that this would work for me, but it had absolutely no effect.  </li>
            <li> I guess I thought I was wearing my hair up and wet too often.  </li>
            <li> I figured that the worst-case scenario was that we would be back at square one, and we’d be out a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wet after rinsing it out in the shower, which is alot to be said for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 1.5 weeks since, and I&#x27;m just really not sold on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So rather than immediately put in the second round as recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 1.5 weeks since, and I&#x27;m just really not sold on it.</li>
            <li> but I am really not bothered by the smells of this.</li>
            <li> I had a few red itchy bumps along my hairline and an itchy scalp...</li>
            <li> After a few washes I could notice a big difference .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used is shampoo a few months back</li>
            <li> I used it for about two weeks with a minimal reduction in my symptoms.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely lighter and no longer having the heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> My hair was getting crunchy and my scalp was itchy (though partially because of winter)</li>
            <li> and it is thick and has natural curl.</li>
            <li> and I could totally feel the product working in my hair and day by day I was noticing less dandruff!</li>
            <li> Finally, I can wear black again!</li>
            <li> rather than immediately put in the second round as recommended, I actually smeared a small amount of conditioner on my hand and then ran that over just to get the silk feeling back before I finished the rinsing, because I was freaked by how dried out my hair</li>
            <li> Rinses out easily, no residue left over.</li>
            <li> , I actually smeared a small amount of conditioner on my hand and then ran that over just to get the silk feeling back before I finished the rinsing, because I was freaked by how dried out my hair</li>
            <li> Flakes from the rough winters are very minimal now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In disbelief after the first week of using the bottle, I used it three-four times a week hoping the situation would turn around, but with nearly 6/8th of the bottle gone, I&#x27;m giving up, and throwing away this product because my dandruff problem got so bad that I can&#x27;t stand it anymore.</li>
            <li> My scalp tends to be slightly oily, even with the dry flakes.</li>
            <li> but my split ends felt less dry after using this.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Dandruff can be caused by winter dryness, but also apparently by a fungus or skin infection that makes it really hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> The days I wear a black shirt, I have quite a few specks here and there by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Tea Tree Shampoo after viewing on Amazon and it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> every other wash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Selson Blue and head and Shoulders in the past</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> The Maple Holistics shampoo had none of these effects, possibly due to the lack of chemical ingredients, and now the sores seem to be healing as well.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo really works the way in, no more itchy scalps no more harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is due to the Lavender &amp; Rosemary.</li>
            <li> Does not clear dandruff away immediately, but give it a few washes...</li>
            <li> HOOKED FOR LIFE; I&#x27;m never going to buy any other brands now.</li>
            <li> I chemically color my hair usually about every 2-4 months, depending on if I go red or brown.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t that medicine smell that you get from other medicated shampoos.</li>
            <li> My scalp, neck and forehead were breaking out from the Color Proof line probably due to all the silicones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this for other people and for myself so that I remember not to purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the oil helps my hair grow faster than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> &amp; a little bit of this stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> We don;t have any other shampoo in the house but this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also got chronic illness, so I&#x27;m hesitant about other chemical-laden beauty products and &amp;#34;therapeutic&amp;#34; hair formulas.</li>
            <li> I have dandruff and due to which had a severe hair loss.</li>
            <li> and my daughter&#x27;s  lice.it leaves hair a little dry</li>
            <li> I started checking out other types of shampoo because i heard dandruff/ scalp moisturizing shampoos that use the active ingredient (pyrithione zinc (PTZ) and selenium sulfide) can lead to hair loss and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and after just three uses, the itchiness is gone, the redness is gone and there were only a few flakes remaining when my hair and scalp finally dried.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce the sores and dry skin within a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it is effective at controlling dandruff flaking without using a bunch of scary chemicals.</li>
            <li> It did leave my scalp feel not as dry and my hair not as limp.  </li>
            <li> Before using this, I would have at least one active breakout on my back</li>
            <li> Can hardly wait to try the conditioner next.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is a little pricey and a really small 8oz bottle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out or leave your scalp feeling tight like a lot of competitors&#x27; products do, since this doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad dandruff and had used a couple of different shampoos that didn&#x27;t do anything for my scalp.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the rosemary over powers the scent of the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> To me, it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The complaint I could possibly have is the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but seems like it&#x27;s going to last a few months</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It only took a few uses and no more issues.</li>
            <li> Love Tea Tree Oil and hate chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this especially  for my daughter  who has really thick and unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thick, though I had it thinned out in September when it was last colored.</li>
            <li> conditioned only from the nape of my neck down, and used a separate leave-in after towel-drying for the rest, but I am not thrilled.</li>
            <li> conditioned only from the nape of my neck down, and used a separate leave-in after towel-drying for the rest, but I am not thrilled.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is this brand seems to have less of the tea tree &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that my normal shampoo has.</li>
            <li> I ran my hands down my hair and it SQEAKED.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t weighed down and my head stopped itching.</li>
            <li> Neither of the products leaves my hair feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> This formula has relieved the itchiness of my head without weighing my hair down or drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with a dry scalp during the winter for the past couple years.  </li>
            <li> Every shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in the past never worked to moisturize my hair or to help with the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because I have thick hair that can tend to be a little oily, but I was very surprised after my hair dried by the quality of the product!</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo after reading their previous reviews.</li>
            <li> After a couple uses he saw less dandruff and his itching was relieved.  </li>
            <li> Less than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> My hair even looks less oily than it did before.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use an entire bottle of shampoo without the terrible itchy scalp syndrome, until I found this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer and less oily.</li>
            <li> since getting this product I have seen a difference, I still have slight dandruff</li>
            <li> Typical dandruff shampoos don&#x27;t help, but this shampoo seems to have cleared up my scalp problems altogether.</li>
            <li> My mom bought his for me when I mentioned to her that typical anti-dandruff shampoos no longer worked at all for me (and never worked that for me well to begin with).</li>
            <li> and my scalp is less itchy.</li>
            <li> I do feel that my scalp itches less.</li>
            <li> For those of you like me who have thick dark, long, oily hair, please avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I have had a slight problem with dry skin on my scalp in the past, it&#x27;s hard for me to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> is a little pricier than your average drugstore dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have dandruff and it gets pretty annoying to deal with, especially when other shampoos haven&#x27;t worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Long, sad, nauseating story short...  </li>
            <li> My experience in the past with dandruff shampoos are they will work for a while, but then the dandruff slowly adapts to it and comes back.</li>
            <li> Did not clean my hair well&lt;</li>
            <li> My adult daughter suffers from a medical condition which causes small sores to develop on her scalp.  </li>
            <li> little tip I picked up along the way is to switch shampoo brands every month.  </li>
            <li> Felt a little cooling.</li>
            <li> it was a little thinner texture.</li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous to try</li>
            <li> I like that it has a little tingly feeling when on in the shower</li>
            <li> smell to be a little stronger however.</li>
            <li> Was not better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little when you are using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product exclusively every other day for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought I just had a bad scalp because it would always start having sores and be really itchy after a day or two of not shampooing, but I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with that since I started using this!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had dandruff for as far back as I can remember, I am 22 now, and each winter, its bad, see I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders and</li>
            <li> Just got this product a few days ago</li>
            <li> it dried out my already damaged hair.</li>
            <li> In the shampoo it clears out dead skin cells and combats dandruff (it can also be used for lice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, and being that I have hair to my waist</li>
            <li> I really disliked this product.</li>
            <li> My aunt bought one for me because she knows I have been wanting to try a shampoo that didn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> We did the chemical treatment a few times and she started losing hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Within a few washings the itching, inflammation, and &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; were gone.</li>
            <li> It took me a few times of using this product to like it, but I think I was just getting used to how it works.</li>
            <li> was not available</li>
            <li> I had to massage in the shampoo and let it sit a few minutes to soften up the scalp, then I used my fingernails to work on getting up some of the chunks.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo when the winter blend was not available.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> a few weeks after I wrote this review.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and let the product sit in my hair for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> it is not as harsh as store brands or prescription brands.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I do wash my hair everyday or</li>
            <li> I was using Jason Dandruff shampoo for a few months and it got rid of my dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with dandruff</li>
            <li> Her scalp was so white from the flaking and after using the product for 3 days the problem was even worse.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the one I least expected to work.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel heavy and rather oily.</li>
            <li> bought this hoping to wean away from Head &amp; Shoulders because of the chemicals in H&amp;S that are likely unnecessary, and also because it is so harsh.</li>
            <li> I am also having less breakage!</li>
            <li> The slight tingle of the tea tree oil, combined with the scent of the shampoo makes you feel like your at a salon!</li>
            <li> It took a while to work (prbly because I used it every other day, so I would recommend using it everyday for two weeks and then slowly decrease from there)</li>
            <li> There is no strong smell to this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have always suffered with a dry itchy scalp especially when the weather starts to get cold.</li>
            <li> My scalp is still dry and itchy with flakes after using this a few times followed by an apple cider vinegar rinse, It almost seems worse after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad dandruff for about 6 months and it cleared up within the first week.</li>
            <li> I tried this product when I had pretty bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> I think my itchy scalp is partly from my hair dye and partly from having the heat on the past few months and the air being dryer.  </li>
            <li> I had bad build up on my scalp and was having large pieces of dandruff come off my scalp</li>
            <li> It generates very little lather when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very musty and organic, which isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, however, if you&#x27;re used to flowery frilly mass produced shelf smells like H&amp;S or Herbel Essences, it will be a drastic change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure I can afford to keep using it</li>
            <li> The bottle is a fairly small amount, but I am considering buying it in bulk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have excessive dandruff like before PLUS</li>
            <li> The past year I have had dandruff</li>
            <li> In the wintertime my scalp becomes unbelievably itchy, I&#x27;m talking -can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Been loosing few hair too!</li>
            <li> No more flakes</li>
            <li> Maybe I got the wrong product  by accident, but whatever the case is I wish I could of received what I actually ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with heavy dandruff for years and tried all sorts of anti-dandruff shampoos to alleviate the problem, but this stuff works wonders!  </li>
            <li> I have also had small patches of psoriasis on my scalp on and off for about 25 years and that has been 98% cleared up since I started using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> No more embarrassment.</li>
            <li> I got it in hopes of reducing excessive shedding (TE) and to help regrow lost hair.</li>
            <li> A little mad that I didn&#x27;t use this product earlier.</li>
            <li> I have moderate psoriasis in my scalp and tar shampoos are so unpleasantly smelling and not very effective.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and have tried everything to at least reduce it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> He suffers from psoriasis and it is a constant battle for him.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on for at least five minutes</li>
            <li> I have not liked the anti hair loss shampoos I have tried</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, and it&#x27;s gotten worse.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and shoulder length</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> No more flakes and itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> If you want a product that simply works without fail and heals your scalp this is it!</li>
            <li> no more!</li>
            <li> I also have very thin, flat hair, so I was concerned about the tradeoff of switching to this and leaving behind my volume building shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Previously, washing her hair was an ordeal since other shampoos irritated and burned the already painful areas.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various tea tree products, but found the only ones that work well had a terrible odor.</li>
            <li> and I think that the product works very well in fixing dandruff without the use of crazy artificial products like coal tar.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working on my itchy scalp, bad think is that it takes out my red color hair...</li>
            <li> Such is my case where the use results in a bad rash.</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> I get very bad dandruff and itchy skin, all times of the year and this product is amazing,and really helps heal my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hardly any itching since!  </li>
            <li> When I say worse, I mean worse than when your dandruff problem is at its peak without using any products to control it.</li>
            <li> this is expensive and a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why but after a hair perm gone wrong, it just stopped growing at all.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted to the smell of this.</li>
            <li> She has dandruff that gets worse in the winter and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> It made mine worse.</li>
            <li> and it got worse resulting in hair damage and hair</li>
            <li> and if it clears up gis dandruff then this stuff is a miracle worker (he&#x27;s had horrible dandruff for his whole life).</li>
            <li> I secretly took home her shampoo...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, made my condition worse..</li>
            <li> I am addicted to tea tree oil</li>
            <li> It waxes and wanes, getting worse through the winter months.</li>
            <li> My dandruff, to my horror, got a lot worse.</li>
            <li> It will make your dandruff three times worse.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always had irritating and itchy scalp and this shampoo helps with that a lot.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and it was not weighed-down by this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Makes Dandruff worse.</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t hurt and is non irritating.</li>
            <li> I am a guy with thick, black, and length until the base of my head...</li>
            <li> Finding shampoo&#x27;s with tea tree oil and no added harsh chemicals is very difficult these days.</li>
            <li> I ended up with flakes because sulfate-free products dried out my scalp so bad.</li>
            <li> My hair is just as bad as before :/</li>
            <li> I tried other htings that my aunt who is a nurse gave me, I can&#x27;t tell you the names because it was basically chemicals which i don&#x27;t remember, and those smelled horrible and looked like liquid &amp;#34;stool&amp;#34; (brown and thick).</li>
            <li> there was less crap in it.</li>
            <li> I had terrible dandruff these past few weeks, but this shampoo seems to be doing the trick.  </li>
            <li> My scalp does not itch no more after just 2 shampoos!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my dandruff unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shampoo has made no difference for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t cure my dandruff.</li>
            <li> However, It&#x27;s tolerable and faint.</li>
            <li> so I disagree with the reviews saying it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> all failed....</li>
            <li> There was a weird mix of reviews on smells</li>
            <li> Failed to improve the dandruff problem</li>
            <li> Im obsessed with the scent.</li>
            <li> During the winter, it gets worse because of the cold air and heat in buildings and what not.</li>
            <li> This was another needless worry.</li>
            <li> Sounds horrible, but I was careful to not break the skin.</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff issues for maybe 3 or so years and head and shoulders just wasn&#x27;t cutting it..</li>
            <li> Since cold started, my daughter was having severe itching and dandruff.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but my hair feels softer now, and not as brittle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a cold winter</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t cleared up my dandruff, which, for the price, is disappointing.</li>
            <li> It does reduce the amount of dandruff that I experience in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> My hair still felt dirty after using this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to these products, I was using Color Proof and that broke me out like crazy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cold out, and this is probably the healthiest my hair has ever looked.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.  </li>
            <li> the past when I have tried these types of products they have smelled terrible and they would sting my scalp.</li>
            <li> This bottle of shampoo was very expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically very wary of shampoos because I have yet to find one that is not drying.</li>
            <li> $15 for one bottle of shampoo is very expensive.</li>
            <li> My head hasn&#x27;t itched as bad</li>
            <li> I know the chemicals were bad for her hair but something had to be done.  </li>
            <li> I still have bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> Maybe my dandruff is really really bad.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells really bad.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this product for me because I have a really bad dandruff build up.</li>
            <li> Be forewarned though that if your scalp is this bad, then some hair may fall out as the chunks loosen.</li>
            <li> I had been using another brand which was just causing my hair to be in even bad condition than what it was before.</li>
            <li> The girl had it bad.</li>
            <li> The bumps were painful and itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have gotten the formula for severe dandruff :(</li>
            <li> One week after using it, I got pimples on my head. :(</li>
            <li> but I hate the chemical smell that it has</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My dandruff is so disgusting.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and my scalp is one of the areas I get it the worst</li>
            <li> Been having really nasty dandruff and itchy scalp problems for a while... switched from brand to brand, but NONE worked until this one.</li>
            <li> It was especially bad after swimming in chlorinated pools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I deal with having an itchy scalp and it drives me insane!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a type of dermatitis that is related to an autoimmune issue. This tea tree oil is a wonderful shampoo - smells nice in an interesting way, and cleans oily hair very well. However, I can&#x27;t say it did anything for my stubborn dermatitis. It might work somewhat for more mid dandruff.</li>
            <li> Used for 2 months. Didn&#x27;t work for my dandruff unfortunately. I ended up using a different product. It may work for others, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost a year now and love it. I have also used their conditioner which is also good</li>
            <li> I just received it and tried, it is great! feel very clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED the smell of this shampoo and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results. I have always had an issue with try scalp and after using this product I have never seen my scalp as healthy as it is now. I absolutely love tea tree oil and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever want to use another brand again. Highly recommended you guys!</li>
            <li> It has an aromatic smell that I really like.. Just got this product a few days ago so I can&#x27;t really comment on its long term effects yet but I&#x27;ve definitely noticed some improvement in my dandruff problem. My head feels somewhat more relaxed after using it too, though I&amp;#34;m not sure if its the placebo effect from reading its description or not.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: 2/5/2015&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo regularly for a few months now. unfortunately, although it helped a bit, it only seemed to work the first weeks or so that I used it and I have continued to have problems.&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product, just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have only used this once since I got it earlier this week, this shampoo has already exceeded my expectations. I have had dandruff issues for maybe 3 or so years and head and shoulders just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.. it dried out my already damaged hair. I looked for alternatives and wanted something natural and safe for color treated hair so I came upon this. It only took 1 use for me..  My head hasn&#x27;t itched as bad and I can wear black clothing again without feeling self conscious! It&#x27;s amazing. The smell is nice and best of all, it&#x27;s not harsh on your scalp. I&#x27;m excited to keep using this and see how healthy my hair becomes. I will definitely purchase this again.. it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> after one use my hair already feels softer &amp; I have high hopes for this product. As far as dandruff, it&#x27;s only been one use but it does seem to be working because the itch is almost completely gone! the shampoo itself smells okay, but the things it does for your hair really make up for it</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Shampoo is aimed at people with mild to moderate dandruff and scalp blemishes. The shampoo has a pleasant forresty scent. It will work well for men and women as the scent is pleasant, but not flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should be aware that this is low suds shampoo. It generates very little lather when I wash my hair. This lack of lather is the only thing I do not like about this shampoo as I like a bit more suds when I wash my hair. On the positive side I like the scent, and after using it for over a week it appears to keep my light dandruff under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil is derived from the leaves of the tea tree. Tea tree oil is has many medicinal uses, it is applied to the skin for infections such as acne, fungal infections of the nail, lice, scabies, athlete&#x27;s foot (tinea pedis), and ringworm. In the shampoo it clears out dead skin cells and combats dandruff (it can also be used for lice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions for use:&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Shake before use. Rinse hair, massage quarter-sized amount into the scalp, allow to stay on the hair for 2-3 minutes (2-3) before rinsing. Repeat and follow with 3 final rinses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle contains 8oz (236ml). This shampoo is made in the U.S.A. It is allergenic and BPA free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPLETE LIST OF INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Organic Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Oil, Botafl Keratin, Organic Lavandula Angustifolia Lavender) Oil, Organic Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is provided by Maple Holistics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I thought the shampoo was effective keeping my light dandruff flakes under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> This shampoo does what it says..my scalp is clean, feels great, and smells great. I applied it with gloves on in sections, and thoroughly massaged it in my scalp. It had great slip and I was able to glide through my natural hair easily. I have definitely had less dandruff, however I would add some moisture back in my hair immediately with my leave in conditioner and castor oil.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and I think my hair is a little healthier, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work super well.</li>
            <li> By using this shampoo during two days the dandruff was gone. Very good!</li>
            <li> I bought this for itchy scalp.....was not expecting a pleasant smell with anything that has tea tree oil in it!  Works exactly as it says and your scalp will tingle pleasantly after using...love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo! Makes my hair feel clean and smells amazing. It&#x27;s gentle on my hair and helps with dandruff. 100% would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I needed something that would help with dandruff and my sore itchy scalp, and wouldn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural oils; I must say so far I am very pleased. It cleaned my hair very well and so far I haven&#x27;t had to scratch once. I have natural hair and I never imagined my hair could get this soft. I will definitely  purchase more.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered with a dry itchy scalp especially when the weather starts to get cold. I have tried various tea tree products, but found the only ones that work well had a terrible odor. I tried this shampoo after reading their previous reviews. Very happy with this product. I got the same tingle and results as the stronger scented tea trees, but with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shampoo has made no difference for me. My hair is just as bad as before :/</li>
            <li> My scalp gets dry, itchy and flaky during the winter months. This tea tree shampoo realblely gives results, I prefer it to head and shoulders or tar shampoo which leaves my hair dry and strawlike. This shampoo cleans well, leaves hair soft and manageable, gets rid of itchiness and flakes and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted to the smell of this. The first time I used it I was tickled by the tingly feeling from the tea tree - I guess that was the stimulating part? I love the way my hair smells after this. I&#x27;d rather have a shampoo that smells nice any day so this beats the old head and shoulders hands down for me. It&#x27;s not cheap, and being that I have hair to my waist I had to use quite a bit so I&#x27;m not sure I can afford to keep using it but while it&#x27;s on sale here I will definitely stock up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my favourite part (other than the smell) was that it did such a great job without having any chemicals in it. It&#x27;s the biggest thing I noticed - it smells clean (not the chemical clean but the outdoor spring kind of clean). I&#x27;m definitely a fan now.</li>
            <li> I love your products! They smell amazing and make my hair feel so soft!! :)</li>
            <li> I like this Tea tree shampoo. It really helps relieve itching on my scalp. It is gentle and it makes my hair smell good, too.</li>
            <li> I love the tea tree oil! and the smell is amazing! smoothly lavender, it just relaxes me!!&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil is a wonderful shampoo ,cleans oily hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had dandruff for as far back as I can remember, I am 22 now, and each winter, its bad, see I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders and it didn&#x27;t get rid of my dandruff so i thought i would try this, and I&#x27;ve seen great results, my hair is less itchy and dry! love love love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best!! It makes my hair soft and manageable while taking the flakes away. Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product before that I was given by a friend. Which I loved the smell of this product and I could totally feel the product working in my hair and day by day I was noticing less dandruff! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband for mild dandruff. After he used it and had things under control it sat on the shelf as he felt it wasn&#x27;t needed. I then found out that TEA TREE helps ward off Head Lice and it was running rampant in the schools. I started using it on my kids and they have NEVER encountered lice and they love how it tingles lightly on their scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and now hubby isn&#x27;t afraid to use it regularly.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have very dry scalp in the wintertime. I love tea tree shampoo so I gave this a shot for my dandruff. Very nice product. My scalp does not itch no more after just 2 shampoos!!! Love this!</li>
            <li> Loved this shampoo!!  I let my husband use it because he has a very dry scalp, and it bothers him.  After a couple uses he saw less dandruff and his itching was relieved.  The smell is great too, not like the usual tea tree smell.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Less than 2 weeks and you can really feel the improvement. A++</li>
            <li> smelled like old, too long in the shelf, shampoo. I really disliked this product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the tea tree shampoo and it took care of my flaky scalp problem after 2 washes!! Not only is my scalp flake free but my hair is SO shiny and soft after each use. I have color treated hair and I straighten it often so it&#x27;s a little damaged and this shampoo is doing beautiful things for me. I&#x27;ll never go back to cheap chemical filled shapoo ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was very impressed with the follow up email that I received from Maple Holistics to make sure that everything was going well with my purchase. Thank you SO much!! I look forward to purchasing more of your products!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but it is too expensive for the amount you get. I won&#x27;t buy again unless it is sold for below $10.</li>
            <li> I shave my head on a weekly basis and have at times gotten skin irritation and even some flaking during the Summer after being out in the sun.  I have been using Head &amp; Shoulders after each shaving session as it calms my skin preventing any irritation and flakes.  Lately I have been researching and switching to more organic and natural based products for items such as toothpaste, deodorant, etc. and I was looking to do the same with the Head &amp; Shoulders I had been using.  Many products contain far too many different chemicals in them which serve no useful purpose.  I decided to try this Tea Tree Shampoo after viewing on Amazon and it works extremely well.  I use only a small amount letting it rest on my scalp for several minutes before rinsing.  Afterwards I have no irritation at all and don’t even have to use any lotion as my skin feels great.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone dealing with any kind of scalp irritation or dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> This product is a great way to start you morning, I enjoy the fragrant invigorating feeling. The scent is apparent but not overpowering. Great for a guy and the young men in my house like it to.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was pleasantly surprised with how well it cleaned and worked. After about a minute of having it in you start feeling a pleasant tingle on your scalp and within about a week I noticed an improvement in my hair and scalp feel. My only complaint would be that the rosemary over powers the scent of the tea tree oil. But otherwise a solid 4 out of 5 and well worth the purchase if you have scalp or dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the fact that everything is organic..My hair tends to be oily but my scalp is dry and itchy, especially in the winter..this product helped tremendously..love it..</li>
            <li> The shampoo is effective, feels good while I&#x27;m letting it sit in my hair for the couple of minutes suggested, and I don&#x27;t need to use a whole pile of it every wash. The only downside for me is the smell - I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells and while I am happy to say it is a fairly subtle, natural smell, it just isn&#x27;t my favorite. Overall, though, I do like this shampoo, especially for a dry, winter climate.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s tea tree, winter always gives me dandruff and this works wonders!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  I purchased this for an itchy scalp and it has helped tremendously!  The smell is so lovely and it lathers up very nicely!  My only wish is that it came in a larger size with a pump!</li>
            <li> I get dandruff in the winter time, and so far (only November) this shampoo has kept me 99% (nothing is perfect) flake-free. I have really thick hair so I have to use a little more than recommended on the label, but I still make it last a pretty long time. The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t relieve itchy scalp. It helps, but doesn&#x27;t give me complete relief. The reason I bring up the itchy scalp is because it tends to go hand-in-hand with dandruff.</li>
            <li> My aunt bought one for me because she knows I have been wanting to try a shampoo that didn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals. I&#x27;ve used this for almost a week. My hair feels soft and my scalp felt invigorating when I use this. Definitely recommending this to family and friends</li>
            <li> This is a really good product, I&#x27;m going to try different one now the one for greasy hair. I love the product feels good on your hair and easy to manage. As i will keep using it i will write more review based on different shampoo&#x27;s i used by maple holistics. Also it has the good smell plus its all natural thats why i decide to get this product and there is no sulfates.</li>
            <li> i used this product and i really loved it, my hair felt soft and it smelled great, i like the fact that it is all natural!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dandruff for the last 12 years and there is no shampoo that I haven&#x27;t tried. So, I was skeptical but ordered it just because of the good reviews. I used it just once after I got it and what a transformation!!! My hair has never been so healthy and dandruff free since forever. My hair even looks less oily than it did before. I am so happy that I ordered this shampoo. Please buy it and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it  just the way I do. Thanks Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I will definetely continue to use in the future. My scalp feels so much healthier and my hair is softer than it has ever been. I used to have a very itchy, dry scalp with occasional dandruff, but now with using the Tea tree oil shampoo , my scalp feels great. The smell is nice too. A bit pricey but you don&#x27;t really need to use that much to get a good lather going.  Would like to see it in a larger bulk size!</li>
            <li> It suds up great and seems to work very well. It seem to have cleared my daughter&#x27;s dandruff with just 2 applications. I wash my hair with this every 2-3 days and since starting I have gotten compliments about how healthy  my hair is. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a great all natural alternative to chemical filled standard dandruff shampoos. My scalp is in much better shape since I&#x27;ve started using this product. I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, and this is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used that actually addresses my scalp issues. It smells great, the nice addition of rosemary makes it so the tea tree scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Very nice! I have been using this for just 2 weeks and it leaves my scalp itch-free all the time! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this company!! The products make my hair feel amazing. I have very long (middle of back) hair and it is thick and has natural curl. Absolutely ordering from them in the future. This shampoo rinses well and I don&#x27;t have to use much (quarter size in my hand) to wash my hair well.</li>
            <li> I am 27, and have spent all of my life with oily fine hair, and moderate acne.  I have found this shampoo to really help how quickly my hair gets greasy, and has definetly helped with my scalp acne. Customer service has been great, including a follow up email asking how I liked my product.  I really value the ingredients in this shampoo, and am very happy with how it works. I will be repurchasing, and stop wasting my money on &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and I am so happy with the results. Previously I used the Sage Shampoo with great results.  It does everything it promises and then some. This leaves your head feeling cool and refreshed.  The other big name dandruff shampoos seem to help for a week and then seem to lose their potency.  I highly recommended this shampoo even if you don&#x27;t have dandruff. This is a healthy product for your scalp and hair. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for the whole family. It smells good an dis quite effective for dry scalp!</li>
            <li> Cleared up mild dandruff caused by eczema and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> only product i&#x27;ve tried from maple holistics so was hesitant, but loved the way this shampoo left my hair clean &amp; fresh feeling without drying out or being too potent</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo specifically for my daughter that has been fighting lice that she got from school.  We did the chemical treatment a few times and she started losing hair in the shower.  I know the chemicals were bad for her hair but something had to be done.  Still fighting the battle, we purchased this looking for a natural route that will help the damage I had done with the chemical lice treatment.  She uses this daily now and has naturally rid our lice problem.  She also has healthier looking hair and it is no longer coming out in the handfuls in the shower.  She loves the way it feels and smells and so do I.  I have everyone in my family use it for preventative and also to repair our hair.  Love love love the product and will continue to use it!  Thank you</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best shampoo I have tried from a natural/organic standpoint. The smell is unbeatable and the way my hair and scalp feel is amazing.</li>
            <li> one of the best ones out on the market!!!!!....clears dandruff up....love this!</li>
            <li> Works well, my hair appears much more healthy! I am also having less breakage! Seems to be taking care of the dandruff issue as well!</li>
            <li> As opposed to most anti-dandruff shampoos, this is very gentle and soothing. All those factors considered (including the price), it still works very well in treating dandruff and itchy scalp in no time!</li>
            <li> awesome smell... Reduced dandruff...So far this shampoo has worked great for me.love it..</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother. He has some dandruff problems. He says (and we can clearly see) that this product managed to eliminate most of the dandruff from his hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product.  It smells wonderfull &amp; it is so invogorating in the morning.  I love the price too.  Such a deal.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have been using &amp;#34;name-brand&amp;#34; shampoos all my life and I needed a change. My hair feels healthier due to the natural ingredients this shampoo provides. Also, I complimented this shampoo with one of Maple Holistic conditioners.</li>
            <li> Finding shampoo&#x27;s with tea tree oil and no added harsh chemicals is very difficult these days. Imagine how estatic I was when I ran across Maple Holistics Tea Tree Oil Shampoo? Its fantastic! I use it not only in my own hair but that of my daughters , her first reaction was &amp;#34; Mom it smells so good&amp;#34;! I couldnt agree more!</li>
            <li> The slight tingle of the tea tree oil, combined with the scent of the shampoo makes you feel like your at a salon! It is the only thing I have found to combat my dandruff, and what a great job it does!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and cleared up my dry scalp. Nice stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I have psoriasis and have tried everything to at least reduce it. This has done just that so far. The smell is amazing and the feel of my scalp after using it is great. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff! She has dandruff that gets worse in the winter and this works wonders. It leaves her hair feeling, looking, and smelling wonderful! She says she will never go back to other dandruff shampoos as they just do not compare. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this directly from maple holistics, I love the product! It leaves my hair feeling refreshed. The scent is natural and fresh. The price just isn&#x27;t feasible to use this on a regular basis for me.</li>
            <li> Better than any dandruff shampoo on the market, I have VERY sensitive skin and this shampoo cause no irritation and is well worth every penny, also smells wonderful I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Dandruff had been a issue since sometime and I experimented with several shampoos. Since cold started, my daughter was having severe itching and dandruff. Used this shampoo for about 2 weeks for her and the flakes on scalp had gone and there was noticeable improvement with itching.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage son who was having a problem with dandruff . This has worked well for him.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil Shampoo I purchased has been a wonder in clearing up an itchy, inflamed scalp condition I am convinced was caused by trying a more expensive salon product. It wasn&#x27;t exactly dandruff, but something similar, and though I tried every over-the-counter product, nothing worked--until I tried this. Within a few washings the itching, inflammation, and &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; were gone. Two months later they are still gone and my scalp is healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice bonus is that I can now also go a day between washings if I choose without my hair appearing dirty, something that in the past would be unthinkable for my very fine blonde hair. Don&#x27;t know why this has happened, but I&#x27;m loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this product is economical, and a little seems to go a long way. I am still working on my first bottle! It&#x27;s natural, BPA free/recyclable, not wasteful, made in the USA, and IT WORKS! What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Super bummed that it didn&#x27;t work for my dermatitis. It made mine worse. The bumps were painful and itchy. However, my husband has regular old dandruff and after a week or so of treatment...it seems to have cleared up a bit. It isn&#x27;t the wonder we were hoping for but it&#x27;s overall a good shampoo. I can only get chemicals to treat me. sigh</li>
            <li> Such an awesome product it is!! I&#x27;ve recommended my friends as well to use this product. Removed dandruff completely.</li>
            <li> Wanted a tea tree oil to help treat my dandruff while remaining free of parabens etc.  This shampoo was a delight left my head feeling good and was not terribly expensive while remaining natural.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> best all natural shampoo i have ever tried. i am allergic to regular shampoo and this shampoo does not bother my skin at all! really helps my contact dermatitis/ dandruff issues!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has not helped me. To me, it is not worth the money. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling amazing or anything. It was just normal. I still have bad dandruff. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a product for my hair type! I have dry, curly hair and during the winter my scalp gets really dry and irritated. After using this shampoo I noticed a difference. My hair was nourished and my scalp felt moisturized! Will definitely continue using this amazing product. Thank you Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most gentle anti-dandruff shampoo I have ever used but amazingly has the best results! In just 1 month of continuous use, my flakes are visibly lesser and scalp is no longer itchy like before. I also like that it smells so good. I like tea tree oil, for one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so far, as I am also trying another dandruff shampoo (not holistic) every other wash.  The Maple Holistics shampoo is a creamy pearly color and lathers up really well.  You don&#x27;t have to use a ton, which is a good thing since the bottle is pretty small.  I chose to try this out based on it being natural and holistic, as well as all the good reviews.  The smell is nice and not overpowering.  I have light dandruff sometimes and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with that, but maybe I need to use the shampoo for longer.  So far though I quite like this shampoo and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo, really helps with dandruff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received those product from my sister as a gift. At first I was pretty iffy about trying a different shampoo because my hair has been &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; to another shampoo. When I finally decided to go ahead and use it after I had ran out of shampoo, I was amazed. A little mad that I didn&#x27;t use this product earlier. I love the smell, the smooth texture and the way it leaves my hair feeling moisturized. It is all in all a good product. Would definitely use again.</li>
            <li> Maybe my dandruff is really really bad. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, and it&#x27;s gotten worse. I wish I had a positive review like most others but this shampoo just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I have always had a dry scalp and nothing has ever helped until now. I can&#x27;t wait to get more! I live in the country and there are a ton of ticks and other insects. I was never bothered anything when I used this product. I love, love, love the thought of it being completely organic, if there&#x27;s such a thing anymore. The complaint I could possibly have is the price. I thing they should lower it some so it can be more accessible to the general public.</li>
            <li> My dandruff is so disgusting. It&#x27;s kind of a family thing so I&#x27;ve had it as a cild and have never gotten rid of it since then...until now. This shampoo helped a lot in treating my dandruff and I didn&#x27;t even expect that. I bought this because of the tea tree oil thingy. I love the smell of tea tree oil. I now use this every other day and I am happy I can now wear black w/o the worry of flakes shedding out of my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells great, feels great, and I have used it on my head and in my beard and my dandruff and &amp;#34;beardruff&amp;#34; are much better!  Thanks Maple Holistics!  Make sure to follow the instructions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This item seems to work well for dandruff, but is causing scalp itching with no flaking. The use has been one month now. It strips excess oil very well and is best with a conditioner.</li>
            <li> My optometrist recommended I try a tea tree oil shampoo to get rid of eyelash mites.  It turns out most people have them, so you might want to look into it too.  So I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and I really like it.  I&#x27;d go so far as to say it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  Feels and smells great, and leaves me feeling clean.  I don&#x27;t know how effective it&#x27;s been in getting rid of the mites, though the strained vision that prompted my trip to the optometrist has improved.  I&#x27;ll post an update in a few months after my next appointment.  Either way, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice herbal scent, a pleasant combination of rosemary and lavender.  It lathers well and feels soothing to my scalp, which is great because my scalp can sometimes feel itchy or irritated. I&#x27;m very glad that it contains botanical ingredients and no harsh ingredients or parabens, and that it is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me and the kids!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I just got my hair colored and was looking for color safe shampoo. I don&#x27;t have heavy dandruff, but generally use a dandruff shampoo to keep my scalp healthy. This has kept my color looking good so far. It smells great and lathers nicely. The bottle is a fairly small amount, but I am considering buying it in bulk.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this stuff works as great as it does. I have seborrheic dermatitis and after just three uses, the itchiness is gone, the redness is gone and there were only a few flakes remaining when my hair and scalp finally dried. I have been using this for almost 3 months now and so far, I don;t experience any side effects like hair-loss or something. 5 stars, of course!</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad dandruff and had used a couple of different shampoos that didn&#x27;t do anything for my scalp. A friend recommended this product and I don&#x27;t think I will use a different shampoo again! It smells really good and within a few uses I noticed a significant difference. 10/10 would recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried  for my first time and loved it very good products</li>
            <li> I swear my name to it, it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is less pricey than other shampoos alike but works fairly fine. I&#x27;m sticking to this.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works great!</li>
            <li> It took me a few times of using this product to like it, but I think I was just getting used to how it works. The first time I used it I think it stripped out extra build up in my hair, leaving it feeling a little dry. After using it a second time, I can see that it&#x27;s working nicely! My scalp tends to get dry, so this was a great product to sooth my irritated skin. I don&#x27;t normally use a ton of product in my hair, so I was really surprised to feel the build up washing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean. You can tell it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients and doesn&#x27;t include any harsh chemical fillers. If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend trying this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this shampoo. It&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering again! In the winter,I have a very dry and itchy scalp. Within the first 2-3 days of using the Tea Tree shampoo,I noticed a difference in my scalp. I have used it for a month or so now and I still feel like it is working well. Also for an added bonus,it leaves my hair soft and shiny. I really see myself using this year round and not just in the fall and winter.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband who has persistent dandruff problem. Even after 5 weeks of continuous usage, this shampoo has done nothing for his dandruff problem. I would not recommend this and definitly not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works great! As advertised.</li>
            <li> Soothing, not overly astringent, great for those with Lupus sores on scalp. Helps reduce the sores and dry skin within a few days. Got rid of that itchy scalp feeling altogether after first time. I just received my second bottle of this, that&#x27;s how much I love it! Works best if u let sit on scalp for a minute or two. I mix with my favorite shampoo for my hair since I have extremely curly hair and need the Moroccan oil products for hair. This one is perfect for scalp tho for me. Would be perfect for hair too, just not my preference for my hair.</li>
            <li> All three of my boys have had issues with something like cradle cap (they&#x27;re 9 now and therefore I thought too old for cradle cap but that&#x27;s what it looked like).  Within two weeks of using this every night the cradle cap was gone.  And it was gentle on their hair.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All factors considered, this is a great shampoo for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, lathers well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t cure my dandruff. Still searching for a good product to get it done .. Their conditioneconditioners are great though !</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the fact that it worked within weeks of continuous use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of my dandruff for several months now by using drug store shampoos - they did nothing. This tea tree oil worked in about 2 weeks - now I barely ever see flakes. The only thing that I am not crazy about is it doesn&#x27;t really lather that well so I feel like I&#x27;m using more then the directions say so that my whole scalp is getting shampooed. Oh well though - I&#x27;m still happy!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do get dry scalp and this product really helps, but it is also great for every day cleansing, it&#x27;s scent is very refreshing and I love the quality and ingredients!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working on my itchy scalp, bad think is that it takes out my red color hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff for so many days and it got worse resulting in hair damage and hair fall. I have discussed with my friends and all suggested tea tree products. I have ordered one and its working. Amazing results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is phenomenal! Not only is it sulphur free, it lathers great &amp; truly conditions my hair &amp; scalp. I&#x27;ve been purchasing it a few times now &amp; an instant fan. Thanks for making such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second week using this product and I have already seen a difference. My scalp feels way better. It feels refreshing and clean. It also has very nice smell to it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but seems like it&#x27;s going to last a few months (I only use a tiny amount at a time), It dries my hair up a bit (i think my hair is somewhat sensitive in general) but I think that&#x27;s b/c of the SLS in it (I didn&#x27;t realize it had when I bought it, should have gone through the ingredients) but my dandruff cleared up with just one use and I only use it every couple of days to keep it clear. I&#x27;m going to try the company SLS free version next and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a more natural one. Just hope it can be cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural shampoos and most do not rinse well and leave my hair with a lot of residue and a very itchy scalp after one day. This shampoo is great, no feeling of build up and my scalp feels clean and doesn&#x27;t itch!!! It leaves my hair soft and silky for a few days before needing a wash. I&#x27;ve used it about 2 weeks now and am still quite pleased. I can&#x27;t comment on helping blemishes around the scalp area, I likely haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> I went swimming last summer at the local gym and maybe it&#x27;s the chemicals they added to the pool, my scalp began to dry out and had some dandruff. I wanted something natural so I gave this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and I can safely say that after a month or so, my scalp was no longer dry and the dandruff went away.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend anyone looking to get rid of dandruff to give this a try first. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love Tea Tree Oil and hate chemicals.  This shampoo fit the bill.  Worked great and smelled great - not too strong.  No blemishes at the moment but I will be sure to try it on them, too.</li>
            <li> This is really great!  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders on my hair, my dandruff has definitely died down since using this shampoo. It left my hair smelling great and feeling so soft. I would definitely recommend this to people looking for a better product to use on their hair. It really changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo if you have dandruff or oily hair. The smell is amazing and it leaves your hair feeling really fresh and clean. It is great because the lavender is also calming and the tea tree oil leaves your scalp feeling amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product! Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it got rid of my dandruff and i really like that it has tea tree oil because that&#x27;s great for the hair I also enjoy the lavender smell because it&#x27;s not empowering! I would totally recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil shampoo is the bomb!! How else can i say it. It cleans beautifully and its very moisturizing. It has so many natural. Oils and its organic. You cant ask for anything better. This is,my go to shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree in general, but this shampoo helped my really dry scalp in the winter. I found it to be the best on the market and I recommend during the winter months!</li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo previously and it smells and works wonderfully. I had mild dandruff and once I started this shampoo, dandruff was gone. I love how it does not contain any weird, unknown chemicals as well. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t require me to use conditioner afterward. My hair feels smooth and soft and it stays that way the whole day using just this wonderful product. I am sticking with this!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is the one who has dandruff, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. It smells wonderful! But I also am a mint addict. Since my boyfriend started using this product it has improved his scalp condition greatly. I no longer see flakes like I use to and I also don&#x27;t ever hear him complain about flakes or his head itching, which in my opinion is a double win for me. I am also a hairstylists, and I would recommend this product for moderate dandruff. It is just all around a wonderful product. Highly, highly satisfied with the results that it has shown in just the past couple of days! I honestly cannot wait to try even more of their products!</li>
            <li> I have had issues with a dry scalp during the winter for the past couple years.  Every shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in the past never worked to moisturize my hair or to help with the dry skin.  This shampoo is the first one that has actually made a difference! I would really recommend it for people who have a dry scalp!</li>
            <li> Great product. You will need to use a couple of times before seeing a change, but once you do, it will be consistent. It smells great! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled dandruff my whole life. I&#x27;ve tried most of the major dandruff shampoo brands, apple cider vinegar, the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method, coconut oil, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is generally healthy, but I&#x27;ve colored it and appreciate how gentle this shampoo is. Most importantly, it works on dandruff and calms an itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Got me impressed on the first try!</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems really effective in what it says it&#x27;ll do. The scent isn&#x27;t that strong after you shower, which is nice. The formula of the shampoo is thick and consistent and there is a slight lather at first. My hair felt really clean after washing it with this and there was even less hair loss after the first use. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this to see the maximum benefits!</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil Shampoo was purchased for my daughter who recently colored her hair and it was &amp;#34;itchy.&amp;#34;  This shampoo solved her problem without changing the newly colored hair color.  Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Let me begin by stating I do not have dandruff or lice.  My problem was psychosomatic.  Due to circumstances beyond my control, I am currently living in a roach-infested residence.  Moving right now is out of the question.  While the infestation is pretty much under control, this 4-5 month experience has actually traumatized me.  My scalp started itching within weeks of moving in and intensified to the point of bleeding.  I tried vinegar rinses to no avail.  I finally broke down and splurged and bought the most expensive shampoo of my life.  Long, sad, nauseating story short...  it worked.  Now I have to figure out how to get out of this lease and find the money to move.</li>
            <li> This product works well for dandruff and has a really great smell. Will definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t rate the product fairly, but I wanted to make a note that that this does contain Argan Oil (which I did not see listed on the Amazon ingredient page). Argan Oil is made from a tree nut, and those who have allergies to tree nuts may also have reactions to Argan Oil. Such is my case where the use results in a bad rash. Consequently, I will be looking into sending the product back.</li>
            <li> This is nice stuff, but a little pricey for the amount you get (8 oz). The fragrance is fairly strong and kind of masculine. But I still like it :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells really bad.  I am not saying it is not a good shampoo, just that it doesn&#x27;t smell good.  Overall using the shampoo has been okay.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo with great smell. I have folliculitus and using this shampoo regularly has reduced the syndrome to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Good product. Has a unique feature that aids in healing scalp disorders with consistent usage without drying out the scalp itself.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for my two boys who both had extremely dry scalp. I&#x27;ve used it on them three times and their scalp is nearly back to normal. I will buy this again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on Amazon but since I&#x27;ve started using the Tea Tree Oil shampoo I can tell this is a different type of product.  I&#x27;ve used Selson Blue and head and Shoulders in the past but I hate the chemical smell that it has and they don&#x27;t seem to work after a while.  Maple Holistics has come up with a wonderful shampoo that, first off, smells great!  Secondly, it works.  Period.  I would highly recommend this product even if you don&#x27;t have dandruff the smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have been fighting issues with my scalp for as long as I can remember.  I have never been able to use an entire bottle of shampoo without the terrible itchy scalp syndrome, until I found this shampoo.  I am happy to finally have found something that works for my hair!</li>
            <li> Love the product! Arrived in the time specified...will purchase more soon!</li>
            <li> It works great for me. Removes my dandruff and prevents my scalp from being itchy every day. A little goes a long way too! I have been consuming this bottle for nearly 2 months now. I can&#x27;t wait to order again!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been struggling in the winter with balancing the use of &amp;#34;natural shampoo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dandruff shampoo&amp;#34; due to the dry climate I live in. That&#x27;s why I was THRILLED when I cam across this shampoo; it blends both! I&#x27;ve only used a couple of times, but I already notice a difference in less dandruff, and feeling good about using a natural shampoo. My hair does seem a bit more dry all around, but it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s this shampoo or just the climate. If you&#x27;re looking for a dandruff solution that is natural and smells great, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> When I got this at the first time, I felt that the size of product is so small compare to price. If I see this product with my own eyes, I would not buy it because it is so expensive. However, after I use this, my mind was totally changed because Lavender smell was good and I could feel healthy for my hair. This shampoo is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to come across this product.  My adult daughter suffers from a medical condition which causes small sores to develop on her scalp.  Previously, washing her hair was an ordeal since other shampoos irritated and burned the already painful areas.  The Maple Holistics shampoo had none of these effects, possibly due to the lack of chemical ingredients, and now the sores seem to be healing as well.  What a blessing that would be.&lt;br /&gt;After observing the effect Tea Tree had on my daughter’s hair and scalp, I decided to try it myself. Call me crazy, but my hair feels softer now, and not as brittle.  I’m happy with the results.  This shampoo has a mild fragrance, and is sulpher- free, a plus in my book.  I also like the fact that it fights dandruff.  I’m glad someone recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this especially  for my daughter  who has really thick and unmanageable hair. I really  wanted a shampoo  that would clean her hair and hopefully help keep lice away. So far it has worked but we ran out a week ago so i will hopefully  purchase  more soon. Product update, i ordered again and this time purchased  3 bottles, i really love it for all my families hair bc it cleanse it and took my severe dandruff away and my daughter&#x27;s  lice.it leaves hair a little dry but if it takes dandruff away and lice i dont really mind.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this product for me because I have a really bad dandruff build up. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shampoos that were supposed to help with dandruff but none of them worked. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 3 months now and it has made a HUGE change. I don&#x27;t have excessive dandruff like before PLUS the product feels amazing on my hair. It smells soooo good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with that &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; feeling like most shampoos do . I would defiantly recommend giving this shampoo a try.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!! I&#x27;ve been using Biolage for years &amp; thought I needed a change. First time I actually got a compliment on how shiny my hair was!</li>
            <li> Smells okay but it did nothing for my scalp.  The buildup never went away.  I went to the company&#x27;s website and contacted them, but after about 3 weeks now they have not responded.</li>
            <li> It was great I loved it, my girlfriend loved it! Everyone liked my hair. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This natural shampoo really helped me out when I had a cyst on my scalp.  After removal, I used this to get rid of the excess skin and it worked like a charm, didn&#x27;t dry my hair out, and I love that it&#x27;s natural and full of good ingredients.  I still use it sometimes even though I do not have dandruff.  It makes your scalp feel great and I think would be good to use periodically for exfoliation/scalp health.</li>
            <li> No more flakes and itchy scalp! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Cleans well,  but doesn&#x27;t really fix my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I had bad build up on my scalp and was having large pieces of dandruff come off my scalp so my hair stylist suggested I get a shampoo with tea tree oil. This had the best ratings on amazon and I am SO pleased. After one use my dandruff was gone and my hair feels lifted and healthy again!</li>
            <li> The shampoo arrived with a note card from the seller, which was a very nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo had a very lovely scent, a mixture of calming lavendar and the earthy tea tree oil, which added to the experience. It had a spa-like vibe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathered up very nicely for me and left my hair feeling exceptionally clean after washing. I have mild dandruff and occasionally my scalp can get flaky especially when I mess with its normal routine. However, in the days after trying this shampoo, my scalp felt nice and flake-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given five stars except this shampoo is a little pricier than your average drugstore dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Surprise of my life!  I have been using this product for over a year now, particularly for hot, itchy scalp when traveling through SE Asia.  It works well in that humid climate.  However, I have suffered from puritis ani for a number of years.  That&#x27;s just a fancy name for a burning itch where &amp;#34;the sun don&#x27;t shine&amp;#34;.  You can imagine what that is like on a 15 hour long-haul flight.  Visits to several MDs over the years, including my dermatologist and gastroenterologists ruled out parasites, fungus etc. as causes.  No specific cause had been found and I was put on an intermittent cortisone cream schedule to control this.  I prefer to NOT use cortisone whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;However, one day during a shower my regular soap (I didn&#x27;t want to use the shower gel due to the perfume triggering the itch) was not available so I reached for this shampoo and thoroughly lathered butt crack and anal area.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.  The intensity of the itch was immediately reduced.  I used the shampoo again the 2nd and 3rd nights in a row and the itching has stopped 100% !  I&#x27;ve used this for my daily shower routine for over 3 months now and have not had to use the cortisone.&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from this embarrassing problem give this a try.  I lather the affected area and leave on while I wash the rest of my body.  Rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered 2 additional bottles and will always be sure to pack this for my travel abroad and have enough for daily home use.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully,  and after 3 weeks, I saw no improvement.</li>
            <li> Got this to help manage my three year old&#x27;s seborrheic dermatitis. He had big chunks of build up. It took about 2-3 weeks to really get things in check. I had to massage in the shampoo and let it sit a few minutes to soften up the scalp, then I used my fingernails to work on getting up some of the chunks. Sounds horrible, but I was careful to not break the skin. Be forewarned though that if your scalp is this bad, then some hair may fall out as the chunks loosen. Now we just it to maintain, though he still has some flaking. We sometimes follow up with conditioner as the tea tree shampoo makes his hair dry. This was very effective, and we&#x27;ll hopefully continue to keep his seborrheic dermatitis under control.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo when the winter blend was not available. I like it, but it does seem to be a bit more drying than the winter blend.</li>
            <li> I deal with stubborn dandruff that needs to be maintained daily. This tea tree shampoo really stopped any flaking after the first use. My experience in the past with dandruff shampoos are they will work for a while, but then the dandruff slowly adapts to it and comes back. Hopefully this tea tree shampoo will not stop working. We&#x27;ll wait and see.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on for me. I ended up with flakes because sulfate-free products dried out my scalp so bad. I highly recommend the Aveeno Nourish dandruff shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems that this shampoo has become my best friend. After just one washing, the infuriating little psoriasis patch I have at the very front of my hairline was somehow...changed (in a good way!). I am using this in combo with Jojoba Oil sold on Amazon by Leven Rose. I&#x27;ll give this another month before I raise the rating any higher. Let the testing begin!</li>
            <li> This shampoo revitalized my hair. I love how refreshed I feel after I use it. Additionally, my dandruff is kept at bay! Amazing.</li>
            <li> Great smell and works great! Will buy again</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my dandruff. It is very nice that it is all natural with organic ingredients, but I bought it because it claims to help dandruff. I have yet to find an all natural solution for dandruff.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both used it for the last week and we both love it. We love the smell and hopefully it&#x27;ll help with the dandruff like advertised. We also like the fact is it&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, shipped on time. As I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while now, I&#x27;m really liking it. My hair is softer and less oily. Only gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the little amount of shampoo for the high price. Otherwise I&#x27;d give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> So far this has worked wonders for me. I&#x27;ve had bad dandruff for about 6 months and it cleared up within the first week. My husband is going to start using this and if it clears up gis dandruff then this stuff is a miracle worker (he&#x27;s had horrible dandruff for his whole life). I&#x27;ll keep it updatedonce he&#x27;s used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried many tea tree oil shampoos before but nothing is like this one. Not only does it smell phenomonal...It leaves my hair silky smooth and will definatley managable! Will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> Cleaned my hair and scalp , left it clean for 2 days.  No drying, just clean.  I have a combo of dry at the middle and ends and some oiliness at the scalp, especially if i get sweaty at night.  My hair is color treated too.  My Scalp will get an oily smell as well.  This took care of all of that.</li>
            <li> I Used to think this was a woman&#x27;s shampoo but one time I had a sleepover in my gf&#x27;s apartment, I pretty much had no choice but to use this. I though it&#x27;s alright it&#x27;s just for one time. But...it turned out to be not just one time. I secretly took home her shampoo...this. It;s so great, feels great on the scalp and smells really nice. Not girly nice but really nice. I bought her a new one and another one for myself. It&#x27;s so soothing to the scalp.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than being pure and washing with natural products. I bought these products not to make my hair look like the commercialized beauties we see on magazines or TV but to be healthy. And I know using this all natural product that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll get. I wasn&#x27;t comfortable scrubbing my hair or any part on my body (for that matter) with strong chemicals that were never meant for my body which my body in turn - rejects anyways. Fast Shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Healthy Product!</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo and I definitely recommend it. Its wonderful, it cleans oily hair very well, let scalp feeling wonderful and it smells nice. 3 thumbs Up.</li>
            <li> We love the maple holistics products. I started out with their regular shampoo, but when I saw that they had a dandruff one I got it for my husband and he loves it! He is comfortable, it smells great, we really have no complaints (other than the fact that we wish it was cheaper - we would but it more often). It still deserves a 5 stars for being a great smelling dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo! I would definitely recommend it to anyone! Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> i like it and it does have that tangled effect on my hair as another reviewer said... kinda reminds me when i was a kid in the 80s, thats the way shampoo used to be, probably bc there was less crap in it. it smells great and is real soft after i blowdry my hair. I might try another lavender shampoo and if its not as good i&#x27;ll go back to this one.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my sensitive scalp and smells great!  Loved this product!</li>
            <li> For a long time I was looking for a gentle, natural dandruff preventing shampoo and decided to give this one a try. I was not disappointed and after using it for a few times I have not even a trace of dandruff flakes on my head. The scent of tea tree oil is very refreshing and the shampoo feels very easy on my scalp unlike other shampoos that make your scalp feel dry. All in all - I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone looking for a natural dandruff treatment!</li>
            <li> New staple product in my beauty regimen! I recommend a good hydrating condition with use of this shampoo as it tends to dry my hair out some. I am excited to try other Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil shampoo is probably one of the best shampoos that I&#x27;ve used, it leaves my hair feeling completely clean and fresh. It also lathers very well with only a small amount and also does wonders for dandruff. I only use it 2-3 times per week because my hair tends to a get a bit dry after everyday use but that could be just my hair. Looking forward to trying other products from this company, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for dandruff, very gentle and smells great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing,  I got it as a gift from a friend because she knows how much I love the smell of tea tree. I&#x27;m gonna have to buy more!</li>
            <li> Kind of worked. Even using it like the directions, it didn&#x27;t seem to curb my daughters hair issues. Smells nice and cleans well, just don&#x27;t know that it helps as much as we would have liked.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate dandruff.  My scalp is also very oily.  My dandruff was gone about a week after I started using this shampoo.  I used about a dime&#x27;s size twice a day so it lasted me about a month.  A little pricey but worth the money considering it has no chemicals like the commercial brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tip I picked up along the way is to switch shampoo brands every month.  The trick is finding which ones work for you, but once you figure that out, rotate, I would say, 3 or more brands.  Otherwise, the dandruff comes back because I guess it gets used to it.  I will definitely make this shampoo part of my rotation!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair always is itching and gets little white flakes in the front of my hair. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of products but this one is by far, the best!  I only bought 1 bottle to try it and since the first wash, it was amazing results! Plus, the smell is simply invigorating! Ordering more bottles today!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t end up any better than all the other stuff I have tried.  Used it till the bottle was empty, but it just didn&#x27;t work well enough.</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a mild scent. My daughter and I both have dry scalp. This did a good job of cleaning, but was not the best dry-scalp treatment that I have ever used. I think I may should have ordered the Sage shampoo. I think this would work very well if you have slightly dry scalp, but if you have moderate dryness and flakiness, you probably would not get as much benefit. I did really like the Argan Oil Conditioner!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, made my condition worse..</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Came two days earlier than I expected in the mail. I used this shampoo once and can already tell a difference. It&#x27;s been a cold winter so my skin gets extremely dry and itchy. My scalp was feeling so refreshed after using this product. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the scent. However, It&#x27;s tolerable and faint. Once I put in my Moroccan oil for my post-shower routine, you can no longer smell the shampoo. If your scalp is dry and itchy, I would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I, like any health fanatic, am constantly on the hunt for healthy alternatives to everything! That along with past hair-loss issues and dandruff issues lead me to this amazing product. Firstly it is comprised of top quality organic oils(Tea Tree, Rosemary, Lavender), but those oils are all essential to stimulate blood flow to the head and thereby the transport of nutrients to the scalp. This then produces the amazing result of healthier, fast growing hair!!! I love it, and it has already sprouted out loads of new &#x27;baby hairs&#x27; as I call them, that will one day grow to be as long as the rest -meaning soon I will have thicker, stronger hair!!! I can&#x27;t explain how great this products results are, as well as the added benefit that it&#x27;s healthy and nourishing to my scalp, without any sulfates.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this shampoo. I get occasional dandruff due to hairspray and this product helped me out. It leaves my hair feeling smooth and the smell is good. LOVE the lavender smell to it. This is a MUST try for anyone that needs help with their moderate dandruff and likes the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo. The smell is pleasant and it works well. There was a noticeable improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> A little bit lathers up really good</li>
            <li> Update (2/15/15).  This shampoo stopped working for my dandruff a few weeks after I wrote this review.  Now after continued use the dandruff continues to flare up.  Disappointed. Maybe I need a stronger shampoo, but I&#x27;m not sure why it worked magically in the beginning and then stopped working completely.      Original Review:  This product actually WORKS for dandruff, and makes my hair feel super soft.  The smell reminds me of pine.  I gave it 10 days to work, like their website suggested, until the dandruff went away completely.  Now I use it about once every 3 days ago and haven&#x27;t had any problems since starting. Very happy I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have what I&#x27;d consider moderate dandruff. The days I wear a black shirt, I have quite a few specks here and there by the middle of the day. Maybe I should have gotten the formula for severe dandruff :( This stuff does smell and feel great, and it only takes a small amount to wash, I just wish it helped more with the flaking.</li>
            <li> Conventional shampoos really irritate me (too many chemicals), so I was really pleased to find this fantastic alternative. My scalp feels much healthier and happier and my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down with build-up, like with other shampoos - it feels cleaner than ever. It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I have been exercising more and sweating more causing breakouts on my scalp and hairline. This shampoo has provided me with relief. I do find that I need to use it daily for extra relief, but nonetheless it works! Happy!</li>
            <li> If I could leave a 4.5 I would rate this product at that level but since I cant I will go for a 5.  The only reason I am leaving a &amp;#34;4.5&amp;#34; is because this product did not meet every expectation but it did do exactly what it said it was going to do. My only faults with this were that the smell wasn&#x27;t very strong nor did it leave my scalp feeling super tingly clean.  I will say that this product if used exactly as sold will work wonders.  Make sure you wash rinse and repeat faithfully to get the full effect of its healing qualities. If you want a product that simply works without fail and heals your scalp this is it! If you expect tingle and  nice strong scent maybe you should pass on this one.</li>
            <li> I decided to finally write a review AFTER using the WHOLE ENTIRE BOTTLE to truely share my experience from beginning to end with this product. I&#x27;ve always struggled with dandruff and itchy scalp- Sure, head and shoulders did the trick BUT I wanted a shampoo that wasn&#x27;t filled with chemicals and stumbled upon Maple Holistic Tea tree oil shampoo. This product worked just as well as head and shoulders and I wasn&#x27;t shedding as much as when I used Head and Shoulders. The only issue I have with this shampoo is the smell, but aside from that I&#x27;ve truely converted to this product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo , keeps my head clean and clear of dandruff. Would definitely recommend it .</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> I used this product for my moderate dandruff due to my constraint hair coloring and striping my scalp each time I color.  This is a very mild and effective solution to my dandruff.  Surprisingly, it also softens my hair, as my hair is mostly gray and coarse this is another layer of treatment I didn&#x27;t anticipate.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I had recently been getting a lot of dandruff in my hair and it was causing my hair prone to breakage and dryness in the scalp. I had been using another brand which was just causing my hair to be in even bad condition than what it was before. I got this and then i followed the instructions, rinsed my hair and it was like magic. There was very little dandruff, my hair was silky smooth and there was no breakage or itching in the scalp. I was amazed and i will be ordering from these guys from now on for my shampoo. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This has a noticeable petroleum odor.  I&#x27;ll use the bottle but won&#x27;t buy again because of that.</li>
            <li> The past year I have had dandruff and I never had before. well I used many different dandruff shampoos as well as try baking soda and nothing has really worked well. since getting this product I have seen a difference, I still have slight dandruff but I assume it will take a few washes before really helping. Glad I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something more natural to wash my hair. With bright purple tresses, regular shampoo STRIPS out my color, even those marketed as color boosting! This shampoo gets my hair clean and leaves my purple intact to shine another day. Plus, who doesn&#x27;t love tea tree?!</li>
            <li> i am a fan of tea tree shampoo from maple holistics. not only does it leave my hair dandruff free and silky smooth it smells amazing and ive noticed my hair is alot healthier since ive started using this. so thats a nice extra bonus</li>
            <li> I had slight dandruff and was liking for a shampoo that would really works and came across this. I love it. Tea tree oil shampoo always makes my hair feel so clean and it feels like it can breathe after I use it!</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo, it leaves your hair nice and shiny and gets rid of dandruff lightning fast. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I started checking out other types of shampoo because i heard dandruff/ scalp moisturizing shampoos that use the active ingredient (pyrithione zinc (PTZ) and selenium sulfide) can lead to hair loss and damaged hair. Not sure how true that is or not but regardless I didn&#x27;t want to take the risk. Anyways one of the alternatives I found was Tea Tree Oil which can cure dandruff, fix scars, discoloration, the works. Seems like some amazing stuff. From there I searched a shampoo based on this ingredient, this was cheaper than the name brand one i found by about 5 dollars so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the actual product. I am not easily swept into miracle cures, nor do I have a strong opinion of holistic vs modern. I just want a quality product that accomplishes what it is suppose to without downsides. Opening the product smells overwhelmingly like pine or some sort of foliage smell (i guess tea tree oil smell?) but it smells ok. I followed the instructions and let the product sit in my hair for a few minutes. Felt a little cooling. I got some of it on my forehead (my face is usually pretty sensitive) and I got kind of a burning/ cooling sensation there more than the rest of my scalp (kind of like putting vick vaporrub on - similar sensation). That had me kind of nervous but i didn&#x27;t break into a rash or anything so I guess I wasn&#x27;t allergic to anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result was pretty surprising. My scalp and hair felt clean and cool and my hair was a bit more fluffy than usual. Not sure if I like that or not but definitely enjoy the scalp feel. No flakes, not dry feeling, pretty happy with the result so far. I have only used it for a short while so I will update my review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> Really fantastic product! I have mild dandruff and this cleared it up really quickly without stripping my hair. I thought I just had a bad scalp because it would always start having sores and be really itchy after a day or two of not shampooing, but I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with that since I started using this! My scalp feels calm for the first time and I don&#x27;t have to worry about those embarrassing flakes on my suits! I&#x27;ve been using this with the Silk 18 conditioner and the combination is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Although the Tea Tree Oil Shampoo  from Maple Holistics smells spectacular and made my hair feel fresh,I found that after about a week of using it my scalp felt a bit oily. If you are looking for a shampoo that smells  fresh, earthy-clean, and natural then you should most definitely try this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It really helped with my scalp and it smells good.</li>
            <li> My scalp is still dry and itchy with flakes after using this a few times followed by an apple cider vinegar rinse, It almost seems worse after using this. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a guy with thick, black, and length until the base of my head...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product or the last 4 weeks or so and I think that the product works very well in fixing dandruff without the use of crazy artificial products like coal tar. I normally don&#x27;t have dandruff, however the winter cold tends to cause flakes and this shampoo was great at curing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed was that this shampoo made by hair slightly rough &amp; bunched up. However it&#x27;s all good after I use the Silk 18 shampoo by the same company (http://www.amazon.com/SALE-Natural-Conditioner-Maple-Holistics/dp/B00L1KFQKC/ref&#x3D;pd_bxgy_bt_img_y)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 stars and I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel clean but dried out my hair and scalp. After shampooing, I used the Maple Holistics conditioner, and that made my hair really nice, but I had to use a lot of conditioner. My hair is quite prone to dryness, so I don&#x27;t exactly blame the shampoo. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo!! I just wish they had a conditioner to go along with it. The tea tree isn&#x27;t super strong and overpowering. It helped my itchy scalp, but I had to use a detangler after washing.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but did not get rid of my blemishes on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t cleared up my dandruff, which, for the price, is disappointing. I&#x27;ll keep trying it until the bottle is gone, and will update if there&#x27;s any improvement.</li>
            <li> Smells very clean. Just the right amount of foam. Does really work on moderate dandruff. It has given me a very fresh feeling. I am using it as my daily shampoo and will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I had terrible dandruff these past few weeks, but this shampoo seems to be doing the trick.  Notably, it does not smell intensely like tea tree oil (which is nice), and yet seems quite effective and non-drying.  I have been using it with the silk conditioner, and my hair looks soft and shiny without being weighed down...and no flakes!  I would love to know more about the ingredients -- perhaps the company could submit to EWG for their review?</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I suffer from dry scalp from living in the frozen tundra that is Michigan. I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful smell but more impressed with the way it works. My scalp feels energized and moisturized at the same time. This product would be great for anyone who suffers from dry/itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair gets very dry during the winter and thinks works great at keeping the flakes at bay. Plus it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my wife. She uses and lives by this shampoo. She gets mild dandruff in the wintertime and swears that this is a heaven send. I love how it makes her hair feel and smell. She loves that it takes care of her issues and says that is smells fantastic. We would and do recommend to anyone who has any type of dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works amazing!! I have psoriasis and my scalp is one of the areas I get it the worst and this was great for my scalp! Helping so much with the itchy dry scalp I have!</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with dandruff and an itchy scalp, especially during the winter months.  I tried this product based on the positive reviews and have to say it is amazing!  My dandruff is gone.  I am fairly sensitive to smells and also find this shampoo scent to be subtle and nice.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I get very bad dandruff and itchy skin, all times of the year and this product is amazing,and really helps heal my scalp. it is not as harsh as store brands or prescription brands.</li>
            <li> My friend gave this product to me as a gift.  I have moderate psoriasis in my scalp and tar shampoos are so unpleasantly smelling and not very effective.  This shampoo was a blessing! It&#x27;s healing properties can be noticed rather quickly, and it has a lovely fragrance.  My hair feels lustrous and soft......not dry and brittle like I get from &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; shampoos.  I highly recommend and am going to be a loyal user of the Maple Holistics brand.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine bought this for me about a month ago and since using it I have noticed improvements in my hair, specifically a decrease in dandruff. My sclap is no longer a dry itchy mess and is very soft and shiny. Will definitely be buying this myself and recommending to others.</li>
            <li> After using this for only a week I can already see and feel the difference. The dry, itchy scalp feeling I&#x27;ve had this winter has disappeared and my hair is very soft and clean. The smell is not your typical strong tea tree aroma that bothers some people. Instead it has a pleasantly mild scent and lathers extremely well. A little goes a long way so I disagree with the reviews saying it&#x27;s expensive. In this case you get what you pay for...a great all natural shampoo with none of the harsh ingredients found in almost every other shampoo out there. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try after a discussion with my physician about hair loss.  He suggested I switch to a sulfate free shampoo.  I tried several &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brands, but not one had any effect on the continual hair loss.  Eventually I purchased a bottle of the Tea Tree shampoo (the one with rosemary) from Maple Holistics and wow was there a difference!  I stopped having huge masses of hair in the drain after every shower and the hair that stayed on my head has thickened up noticeably.  I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and it is always the same quality shampoo that I started with.&lt;br /&gt;I have been so happy with this product that I even decided to get a different product in the Maple Holistics line for my boyfriend to try.  He suffers from psoriasis and it is a constant battle for him.  I chose the sage shampoo since that seemed to give the best potential to address his condition.  That was about 5 months or so ago.  His psoriasis is absolutely getting better!  Not only is the flaky patches going away, but the irritated redness and itching/burning is just gone.  I know products all work differently for everyone, but if I was looking for a product line that might actually live up to it&#x27;s hype, this one is worth a try in my opinion.  I did and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I love it, It helps out so much with our condition we were having with our hair. I feel so much relief and I feel the difference in my scalp.</li>
            <li> Iordered the tea tree shampoo and was instantly excited by the smell when I took off the safety seal.  It has a very invigorating smell, must be the Tea tree.  There was  a pleasent warming sensation on my scalp. I was exspecting more considering the smell, but was still pleasently surprised.  It got my hair and scalp SQEAKY clean, really.  I ran my hands down my hair and it SQEAKED.  I was a bit concerned considering I have 4b/c hair, but I followed with the Maple Holistics Silk 18 and OMGosh, I fell in Love.  I could feel the moisture being put back into my hair as I massaged the conditioner into ,y scalp, the the ends of my hair.  I wanted to keep putting in more and more just cause it felt so good.  The directions say to leave it in for a couple minutes, but i was busy and left it in for 10 minites.  My hair was soft even after t-shirt drying for 10 minutes.  Both proucts did exactly what they said they would.  I will reorder again.  I wish they sold in stores.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance,Organic and works as expected.I love this n my husband liked it too</li>
            <li> In the wintertime my scalp becomes unbelievably itchy, I&#x27;m talking -can&#x27;t do anything at night but scratch my head- itchy. I was looking for a sulphate free shampoo (I got a Brazilian Blowout) that would help me out but the options were slim. I bought this shampoo based on the reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s kind of like a miracle in a bottle! After 2 washes my itching was gone. Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works the way in, no more itchy scalps no more harsh chemicals. Wish they made more conditioners as well.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo is one of the best shampoo&#x27;s I have used.  A friend told me about it, and so I tried it and loved it.  I highly recommend everyone to try this product!!</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of trying Tea Tree Oil Shampoo. My children had an outbreak of lice. My doctor actually recommended this to me due to the all natural products. It worked really well!!! Additional to the Tea Tree Oil, the shampoo had a nice aroma . I suppose this is due to the Lavender &amp; Rosemary. Additionally, the shampoo is helps with skin conditions- such as eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase continuously.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel sleek and less frizzy. Also, tea tree oil is good for acne which I suffer. It also does not dry my hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was suffering from light to moderate dandruff.  I always prefer natural products in general, but they don&#x27;t always work as well as heavy synthetic chemicals.  The Tea Tree Shampoo from Maple Holistics worked great though.  I was instantly impressed with the feeling it left after the first use, and it cleared up the majority of the dandruff by the second use!  I continued using it to make sure that I wouldn&#x27;t have a recurrence, and my scalp has been great ever since!  I like this stuff as regular shampoo, as a little bit goes a long way, and my hair feels cleaner than it&#x27;s felt with any other shampoo.  Glad I stumbled onto this brand and product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a limit to what I will pay for things like shampoos, but in the $10 range I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Just what my daughter needed for her Dandruff and Damaged hair!  It did an Amazing job of completely transforming her hair from dried, damaged, and dandruff ridden to clean, soft, with lots of body.  Made her hair look wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for almost 2 years.  I started using it to treat scalp eczema which was causing hair loss.  I immediately noticed positive results.  My scalp eczema is under control and my hair has grown back.  I am very happy to have found this shampoo.</li>
            <li> So far I have really enjoyed this shampoo just with it was a little thinner texture.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I really love this product. I have dry natural curly hair and makes my hair beautiful and wow the smell. I get so many compliments. Have not had any sort of flaky or itchy hair since using. LOVE,LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Ever since my grandmother used to treat my cuts and scrapes with tea tree oil, as a child, I have been partial to its fragrance. I was thrilled when I found an anti-dandruff shampoo that brought me back in time over thirty years. If you love the smell of tea tree oil, this shampoo will endear itself to you as it has me. Tea tree oil is a unique and lasting scent; you&#x27;ll surely have people asking you what products you use, all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a decent amount of lather, unlike a lot of anti-dandruff shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out or leave your scalp feeling tight like a lot of competitors&#x27; products do, since this doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals. It does reduce the amount of dandruff that I experience in the cold winter months. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling frizzy or weighed down, rather, my hair feels light, free flowing and smelling of delightful tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for an anti-dandruff shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell like some kind of weird medicine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.....i was suffering from dryness and so dandruff...i tried so many products....all failed....finally one of my fnd reccommended this.....so i tried .....like miracle for me..must try</li>
            <li> I have dandruff and this stuff worked AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li> As far as Shampoo&#x27;s go this has gotta be one of the best available for people like me who have terrible dandriff. I tried this and was pleasantly surprised with how well it worked. It gets the job done and leaves my hair feeling great. Its a great value for the price as well as retail stores charge an arm and a leg for other Tea Tree Shampoo&#x27;s and those don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Shampoo.  It makes my hair look and feel great  and my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy and feel amazing...THANKS!</li>
            <li> This product Rocks.  Can hardly wait to try the conditioner next.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product more than once and it really satisfied me. After trying so many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, this one is the best so far. It makes my hair shinny and smooth but not oily, and just a little bit can make enough foam.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and I love it!  I had a mildy flaky scalp and my stylist said to use tea tree oil shampoo.  I looked around on Amazon and liked that this was all natural and did not include sulfates.  There was a weird mix of reviews on smells and I am very sensitive to smells so I was a little nervous to try but so glad I did!  It has a very natural lavender smell.  Like real lavender, not the overly perfume-y, doctored up lavender found in so many other things.  Not only that, but I am flake free!  I have a lot of very fine hair and this is light enough not to weigh it down.  I like that it has a little tingly feeling when on in the shower and I love the way my hair looks.  I would recommend.  My husband had a lot of dandruff so I purchased Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff with Jojoba &amp; Organic Spikenard for him and have seen a great improvement when he is using it regularly.  I am very pleased with Maple Holistics and am going back to look for more product!</li>
            <li> I love natural products and try to use more of them in my routine. This a great shampoo for little to moderate dandruff. It treats dandruff really well and nourish the scalp. The smell is amazing. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My mom got this for me and I ended up loving it!!! I love the smell and it really help my scalp when it was so itchy I had scabs plus I really feel like its helped my hair grow quicker. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant to switch shampoos and conditioners, especially when they cost over $10.  I bought this tea tree shampoo to help with my winter dandruff, but got more than that!  Not only is great with improving my dandruff, it leaves my hair light and silky smooth! Granted the silk conditioner doesn&#x27;t hurt either!  I will never buy another shampoo again!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a week or so, but I have noticed an improvement in the condition of my scalp.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It smells nice and lathers well. After applying it, it feels nice on the scalp and it appears to be working very well for controlling dandruff. The fact that is is paraben and sulfate free, as well as cruelty-free, is definitely a major plus. I would highly recommend trying this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use this on my color treated hair. My scalp gets flaky during the winter and this worked great at controlling the flakes. Just as good as the salon brand tea tree shampoo I have been using for years (which has sulfates). The bonus to Maple Holistics shampoo, is that it is sulfate free. I was worried about my color fading faster with this product, which it did not. I wouldn&#x27;t say my color faded slower, which I was hoping for since it is sulfate free - but I&#x27;m still satisfied with the results. It lathers great. I only shampoo my hair every other day and it keeps my hair from getting too oily on the days I don&#x27;t shampoo which is great. I give it 4 stars for the price. The salon brand I was using is more economical, but I feel better using Maple Holistics because I know it&#x27;s healthier for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am always surprised when I find all natural products that are equally (if not more) effective compared to the other toxic stuff we&#x27;re all used to. This is definitely one of those products. It works well and smells good, and you don&#x27;t need to use much of it to get a good lather. It&#x27;s lasted me a couple months so far and I still have a good bit left. Will definitely be ordering from them again!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo, it&#x27;s natural and decent. and this shampoo really do help to my dandruff problem!! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I am sure this product is like all the others, excellent!  I know the conditioner is and I&#x27;m about to say the same for this one.</li>
            <li> Actually loved this after one use! Gave me back the body my hair was missing and cleared my scalp from psoriasis buildup. I gave it 4 though because it was somewhat drying and afterwards made my hair frizzy looking. If there&#x27;s a similar product with LIGHT conditioning id love to try it. Will use again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seemed to dry out my scalp even more and cause more itching and more dandruff.  Perhaps it works for some individuals, but it certainly did not help my condition.</li>
            <li> I was uncertain trying this shampoo for the first time and knowing nothing about it. It was wonderful, it had a great smell and it not only helped with flakes and itching it improved the overall health of my scalp. I was totally surprise!</li>
            <li> I recently Tryed this product because I&#x27;m transiting from perm to natural and I loved it..it gave great slip and I noticed afterwards my hair was very silky!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair still felt dirty after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair without shine and body.&lt;br /&gt;a supporting conditioner is needed.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and hoped that this would work for me, but it had absolutely no effect.  I bought the shampoo and conditioner and my dandruff didn&#x27;t get any better and in fact, got worse, because I stopped using my old shampoo and conditioner which at least was moderately effective.  After using this for about 4 weeks, I had to go back to my old product (Philip B anti-flake relief shampoo and Borghese Restorativo Conditioning Rinse) because I had large flakes.  My old products reduced my dandruff but hadn&#x27;t eliminated it and I hoped that this tea tree oil shampoo would be at least as effective or better.  Instead, my dandruff returned with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> I have always had issue with Dandruff and practically has nothing has worked on my hair. But this shampoo so far has been great. I wash my hair every other day and so far the shampoo has been excellent in controlling dandruff.</li>
            <li> It works on dry hair and scalp. All the itchiness were gone after a month of straight use.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for me. I love the smell. It&#x27;s so mild, it doesn&#x27;t even smell like an anti-dandruff shampoo but it has a way of really removing them and treating my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is what I&#x27;ve been looking for for the longest time!</li>
            <li> I have moderate dandruff, and decided to give this a go as most other dandruff shampoos did not keep it well under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thought on it was it smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;First couple times using it I noticed a little bit more itchiness than usual, and a few more flakes ; thought it might take a bit for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;After a week and a half of using the shampoo, my dandruff flared up so much I had to switch back to my normal dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be nice to use in-between my other shampoos, but it alone does not do enough to keep my dandruff at bay.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff and I know that because I have tried other more expensive anti-dandruff shampoos and this is the only one that worked so far.</li>
            <li> Smells good, lathers nice, feels good on winter-dry scalp, and no SLS. In winter my scalp gets dry, itchy and flaky. Dandruff shampoos don&#x27;t work and are toxic. I want to avoid SLS which is in all commonly available shampoos. Tried various organic shampoos. Putting aloe vera gel or pure aloe vera on to sit before a second shampoo seemed to help the scalp feel better and get rid of flaking dryness. But then I tried this shampoo and now I am not bothering with the aloe vera step. Seems great. Smells nice too. Leaves hair nice.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and cleans greasy hair easily. Does not clear dandruff away immediately, but give it a few washes...</li>
            <li> Been having really nasty dandruff and itchy scalp problems for a while... switched from brand to brand, but NONE worked until this one. I&#x27;be been habituated to wash my hair every other day, but by the end of day one, my hair gets really greasy, itchy, and full of dandruffs. THIS STUFF WORKS MIRACLES! It took a while to work (prbly because I used it every other day, so I would recommend using it everyday for two weeks and then slowly decrease from there) But now, I&#x27;m dandruff free! When you use it, your hair feels amazingly clean- like SWEAKY clean! (Remember to read the directions- wash twice and leave to simulate) AND it&#x27;s awesome that this is mostly natural and none of those harsh chemicals in mainstream brands. Been loosing few hair too! Completely sold and I just purchased another one of their product to try. HOOKED FOR LIFE; I&#x27;m never going to buy any other brands now. (Even my brother&#x27;s in love with this shampoo!) It&#x27;s a little pricey, but damn, is it worth every cent! :D</li>
            <li> this is expensive and a small bottle.  you&#x27;re supposed to use twice each time.  so this won&#x27;t go far---maybe three weeks?&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used this for a week now and no results.  i&#x27;m really bummed.  what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but was disappointed. My scalp is itchy after using &amp; my hair does not feel clean.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has a very dry scalp. It works great and removes all the dead skin. No more flakes and it leaves her her shiny, too !</li>
            <li> What a wonderful find!!!  This shampoo has a sweet, earthy smell and leaves my hair felling soft and clean.  My hair is thick and shoulder length and I was surprised at how little I needed to use to wash my hair with.   I have moderately oily hair and did not realize I had a dry, itchy scalp until trying this shampoo.  I guess I thought I was wearing my hair up and wet too often.  ;)  After blow drying I did find that my hair was staticky but I tried a vinegar rinse after washing and the static was gone.  I would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and is very soothing for a dry, itchy scalp in the winter. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a bit pricey at first glance but boy am I glad I bought it! Your head will feel totally different after using it. Try it!</li>
            <li> My six year old uses the shampoo for some scalp issue and loves it. Problem is being a six year old he uses it too fast. Oh well! Happy to see it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best! It smells amazing (I love the smell of tea tree) and it leaves my hair and scalp feeling great.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews for products, but I felt obligated to let people know that this shampoo works unlike anything else we had tried, including prescription products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our young son came home from summer camp one day and we started to notice his hair was matted; we assumed it was just drying funny from the pool.  Soon, we started to notice plaques of &amp;#34;crust&amp;#34; on his head that were covering most of the top of his head.  We took him to a dermatologist who said it was seborrheic dermatitis.  We were given topical steroids and told to use Selsun Blue to alleviate symptoms.  We used them, but the only mollified the issue temporarily; soon after treatment it would come back with a vengeance.  It was especially bad after swimming in chlorinated pools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I started looking for alternatives.  That’s when I came across all of these glowing reviews.  I figured that the worst-case scenario was that we would be back at square one, and we’d be out a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a couple of uses, it was noticeably better than ever.  Within two weeks, the majority of the problem was gone.  No more oozing plaques; just rare dandruff.  Within one month, it was gone.  May it never return.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as great as I hoped (based on everyone else&#x27;s reviews).  When used, it left my hair feeling dry and rough but I kept using it for two weeks to see if it did anything for my dandruff.  It did absolutely nothing.  It&#x27;s now in  the garbage.</li>
            <li> Everyone at home really likes this shampoo. It lathers up well and leaves a tingling sensation on the scalp for hours. It keeps the head fresh and free of dandruff and it&#x27;s priced very well too! We&#x27;ll keep on buying for sure.</li>
            <li> One of the cheapest finds out there that actually delivers! I am free of dandruff in just a month!</li>
            <li> I don;t have dandruff but what made me totally fall in love with this shampoo  is the super lovely smell. I am addicted to tea tree oil but there&#x27;s more to that. |There&#x27;s a distinct level of tea tree oil scent that I like and it&#x27;s in this shampoo. I have tried many products in the past and almost always it&#x27;s either too strong or too weak...close to nothing. This shampoo gives the right amount of scent. The kind that is not irritating to the nose but really sweet  with a citrusy hint. I love how this shampoo makes my hair smell like this for 2 days. Besides the smell, I love how it keeps my hair smooth, soft and very easy to brush. This is a 5 star shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> Great item! The smell is fantastic and my hair felt lightweight and different when I got done washing it. It wasn&#x27;t weighed down and my head stopped itching. great item and great price!</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Shampoo was tried out of curiousity. I am pleasantly surprised as my hair is very clean and soft after using it. I would like the tea tree  smell to be a little stronger however. I found a great product</li>
            <li> Great all-natural shampoo. Smells good, works well!</li>
            <li> Yes, I received it right on time with my Amazon prime. And I love the&lt;br /&gt;product! I&#x27;ve tried a handful of tea tree shampoos and this one is it for&lt;br /&gt;me, I will search no further. The first time I used it I noticed how my&lt;br /&gt;hair felt worlds different.  It feels almost light and airy. It feels super&lt;br /&gt;clean, but not stripped of moisture.  I can still get a comb through it&lt;br /&gt;while wet after rinsing it out in the shower, which is alot to be said for&lt;br /&gt;my dense curly/wavy hair. The sent is lovely but not overpowering.  And it&lt;br /&gt;lathers up really well when you wash rinse repeat. The fact that the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients are all organic and natural is what sold me on trying the&lt;br /&gt;product. I posted the bottle on instagram with the caption &amp;#34;madly in love&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I usually dont take the time to review a product, but the one is worth it!</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel dry anymore after using this product, and it cleans well.  L.</li>
            <li> I feel cheated the product I received had no organic ingredients at all!! I ordered it for the organic properties.  Ingredients as follows.  Aqua, sodium cocoyl isethionate, coca mi do propyl betaine. Sodium lauryl glucoside carboxylate.  Lauryl glucoside, sodium cocoyl glumate.acrylates copolymer  coco glucoside.glyceryl oleate.simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) oil, botanical keratin, arcana spins a (argan)  melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil. Lavendula angustifolia (lavender) oil. Rosemarinus officunalis (rosemary) oil. Would not mind paying 30 bucks for the ingredients advertised here on amazon. Maybe I got the wrong product  by accident, but whatever the case is I wish I could of received what I actually ordered.</li>
            <li> So far the shampoo works great. I can feel how it purifies the scalp and leaves the hair clean and shinny.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo!! Really helped with my dandruff and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband.  He likes the tea tree oil shampoo for itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this shampoo and since moving to a desert climate, it has been a life-saver in terms of helping me control the dryness of my scalp.  That said, I&#x27;m still struggling with losing lots of strands of hair and very mild dandruff.  Things have gotten better with continued use of this product, and I&#x27;m thinking that the issues that I still have with my hair will work themselves out over time and with more use.</li>
            <li> Tried both the degrease shampoo and this one.  They are both help to keep my dandruff and itchy scalp under control but I tend to like this one better because of the lavender ingredient especially I wash my hair at night so it also helps with my sleep.</li>
            <li> Maple holistic s have changed my hair forever&lt;br /&gt;So many years of itchy.scalp and dandruff I always used products with sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the sage shampoo as well as the silk 18 conditioner and it has changed my hair&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree is antiseptic and  great cure for dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs to order from maple holistics they are amazing</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2VFDPF9L0UAHO]]Hey! In a nutshell:&lt;br /&gt;-Great product&lt;br /&gt;-Smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;-Feels awesome when you put it on&lt;br /&gt;-Solves my winter dandruff problem&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t have to use a lot&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves my hair shiny, soft, and styleable.</li>
            <li> When my friend recommended I try this shampoo for my chronic dandruff, I didn&#x27;t believe that it would work.  I&#x27;ve dealt with heavy dandruff for years and tried all sorts of anti-dandruff shampoos to alleviate the problem, but this stuff works wonders!  My hair is excellent to touch for the first time in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love feeling of my scalp after use..hair is soft with no frizz..great product for my needs...</li>
            <li> Finally, I can wear black again! Thanks so much to this wonderful shampoo!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, permed and highlighted a while ago. My roots are oily but ends are dry and damaged. This shampoo is gentle enough to clean my roots and skull, it has medium foaming and leaves a light, relaxing herbal smell.  But it&#x27;s a bit dry for my ends, maybe I should also get the 18 silk conditioner and use them together!</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this shampoo as it says it helps with dead skin and scalp blemishes.  The first thing you notice is the smell, which is really refreshing in my opinion.  I found after one washing that it actually did soothe my scalp and I would recommend that anyone who has scalp issues try this product.  Naturally, it may not help all, but compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried this really has proven to work very well.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil shampoo is working well, I can wear black again :) The shampoo came a day sooner than I anticipated, was a pleasant surprise and just in time I used the last of mine and needed it that day. Funny how things work out sometimes...&lt;br /&gt;The container was easy to grip in the shower, the size is perfect and does not take a lot of space. And here is my &amp;#34;constructive criticism&amp;#34;?  The product is great but deserves a better quality label that doesn&#x27;t scratch easily. It takes away from the artwork on the label.</li>
            <li> Great SLS free dandruff shampoo! I leave it on for at least five minutes so it really soaks into my scalp. My scalp itch has greatly reduced. The only thing is that it is a little pricey and a really small 8oz bottle. I rotate between this one and the SLS free Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo from Trader Joes since that one is 16oz for only $3.99 in the store. But I like this shampoo better.</li>
            <li> Not sold yet. I&#x27;m really struggling with the fact that this seems to STRIP my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my hair:&lt;br /&gt;Caucasian chemically treated&lt;br /&gt;About 22&amp;#34;-24&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Damaged, dry, and brittle&lt;br /&gt;Frequent Flat Ironing&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff, and natural oils being main issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this hoping to wean away from Head &amp; Shoulders because of the chemicals in H&amp;S that are likely unnecessary, and also because it is so harsh. However, this Maple Holistics may not be my solution. I chemically color my hair usually about every 2-4 months, depending on if I go red or brown. Currently, I&#x27;m dark brunette, and last colored in September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this, I was struck by the odor. It&#x27;s not intensely UNpleasant, however, it IS very strong. There&#x27;s definitely a lavender tone, but I would almost say sandalwood as well. It&#x27;s very musty and organic, which isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, however, if you&#x27;re used to flowery frilly mass produced shelf smells like H&amp;S or Herbel Essences, it will be a drastic change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing, was that the amount suggested, a quarter, was not enough for 22&amp;#34;-24&amp;#34; of hair. For those unfamiliar, that&#x27;s about to my bra strap when in beach waves, and straightened falls to just above my lumbar region of my back. My hair is naturally thick, though I had it thinned out in September when it was last colored. I had to use more about the amount of a half dollar to accommodate the mass of hair that I have, and no, I was not going all the way down. That was just to cover scalp, and hair that lays flat against the scalp. Maybe that has more to do with head size, but the original quarter suggestion produced little lather, and was ending up getting my hands stuck in my hair rather than allowing me to work my fingers along my scalp. By adding the extra, it foamed up, and I was able to scrub. I left it in in the recommended 3-4 minutes, and that may have been an error as well. When I washed it out, my hair was like HAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So rather than immediately put in the second round as recommended, I actually smeared a small amount of conditioner on my hand and then ran that over just to get the silk feeling back before I finished the rinsing, because I was freaked by how dried out my hair was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I conditioned only from the nape of my neck down, and used a separate leave-in after towel-drying for the rest, but I am not thrilled. The smell remains, but softens which is nice. I can&#x27;t say that the grease I get from the natural oils in my hair lessened any, but the flakes did not return. Since H&amp;S was keeping them away, I can&#x27;t say whether or not this is a miracle for that. I&#x27;ve used it for about 1.5 weeks since, and I&#x27;m just really not sold on it. It&#x27;s still drying my hair out, and I&#x27;m losing the motivation to keep trusting that it might get better. I loved the idea of tea tree oil, but my hair&#x27;s hydration is vital to me since I flat iron and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if this didn&#x27;t strip my hair so badly I&#x27;d be more inclined to keep on keeping on, but I feel like unless your hair is chock full of chemicals from hairspray or treatments, this is just too harsh for daily -or even 2/3 day- use!/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So rather than immediately put in the second round as recommended, I actually smeared a small amount of conditioner on my hand and then ran that over just to get the silk feeling back before I finished the rinsing, because I was freaked by how dried out my hair was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I conditioned only from the nape of my neck down, and used a separate leave-in after towel-drying for the rest, but I am not thrilled.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product exclusively every other day for the past few weeks. It does a thorough job of cleaning your hair with 1 application about the size of a dime. This shampoo has a decent foaming agent so more isn&#x27;t necessarily better; using the minimum effective amount is important. A second application hasn&#x27;t been necessary for this man. My hair is short so a quarter size may be necessary given hair length. Your hair will actually squeak when you&#x27;re wringing it out when you follow the directions, leaving the product on your hair &amp; scalp for ~2 minutes. It took a about 3 applications for my hair and scalp to get the full effect but if you&#x27;re patient you&#x27;ll be glad you used this shampoo. It feels good on your scalp and has a pleasant and not overbearing odor. After the first week I noticed my hair is softer and requires less conditioner or after-product to keep it that way.  This product is a pleasure to use, adding a bit of luxury into your daily routine for relatively modest expense.  Recommended.  Dandruff?  What&#x27;s that?</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo that actually has a pleasant smell, and one wash helped my scalp feel better. I have not had a chance to use it multiple times, but I am looking forward to seeing how it does with consistent use.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be the only thing among many I have tried that is actually working to treat my dandruff. Dandruff can be caused by winter dryness, but also apparently by a fungus or skin infection that makes it really hard to get rid of. I have been using this product for a few weeks and notice a great difference. I noticed an immediate difference within 2 uses. I really love it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, has a nice texture to it, leaves hair soft, and manages dandruff.  I have gad trouble with dandruff intermittently since my first pregnancy. It waxes and wanes, getting worse through the winter months. This shampoo seems to work better than head and shoulders, and about the same as T-gel. It smells way better while working, though. My scalp tends to be slightly oily, even with the dry flakes. Much better with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is very watery and will only relieve dandruff for about 12 hours before you have to wash again. If you have sensitive skin then the shampoo will make the skin on your hands peel especially if you have calluses.</li>
            <li> The tree oil shampoo came with results, which was a surprise to me. I have tried all types of shampoos that are supposed to treat mild to moderate dandruff, but they never seem to work. The first thing that I noticed with the tree oil shampoo is the light clean fragrance. There wasn&#x27;t that medicine smell that you get from other medicated shampoos. The shampoo lather and deep cleans the scalp with just a dab of shampoo. I started to see results in just two uses of the shampoo. I would recommend the tea tree oil shampoo to anyone who has dandruff. Your flakes will go away in just a couple of shampoos. The fragrance is pleasant. A great shampoo for both my husband and myself</li>
            <li> Giving three stars since it was decent shampoo but didn&#x27;t get rid of my dandruff and itching. Just one testament among many.</li>
            <li> Great clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product but I think I am going to love it.  It&#x27;s very light compare to other shampoos I have tried before.  The smell is also good.  I hope this will be the perfect solution to my sensitive hair and scalp.  Tea tree shampoo and silk 18 conditioner are good combination, my hair became softer and manageable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I saw results after the first time using it. I always loved tea tree but when in conjunction with the lavender, its just amazing. I love the smell, and how fast it works.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Smells nice, but not overpowering.  Within two washes my flakes started going away.  After a week the itchiness stopped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried head and shoulders for my dandruff, but it didn&#x27;t work very well for me. I came across this shampoo and saw that it had tea tree oil in it (which I&#x27;ve read about as being effective for the scalp. I decided I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo worked well for me. Two other pros for this particular shampoo is that the jojoba makes my hair shiny and it also is free from sulfates and parabens. This is good since sulfates strip away natural oils on your head and parabens have been linked to hormone disruption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a high quality shampoo that works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks and it started working the very first time.  I&#x27;ve had hardly any itching since!  I think my itchy scalp is partly from my hair dye and partly from having the heat on the past few months and the air being dryer.  I have also had small patches of psoriasis on my scalp on and off for about 25 years and that has been 98% cleared up since I started using this shampoo.  I had previously used a bit of coal tar shampoo on the affected areas to control that, and recently learned that coal tar is not entirely safe (great - 25 years later!) - and it wasn&#x27;t so great at taking care of the problem.  Wish I would have found this stuff long ago!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shampoo! I have not had any flakes since I began using it two months ago and my head is not as itchy. My hair is very soft and manageable after use, but I am also using a maple holistics conditioner, which i highly recommend. The smell is also very nice, but not to strong or overpowering. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My scalp, neck and forehead were breaking out from the Color Proof line probably due to all the silicones.  I was trying to find a natural shampoo that would not break me out and didn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals.  I came across this on Amazon and I am really glad that I did. First of all, I cannot stand the smell of tea tree but I am really not bothered by the smells of this. It only takes a little to build a great lather and it cleans well. The best part is that it has helped to clear up my breakout problem. I also want to say that the conditioner that they sell is amazing too. I wish I would have found Maple Holistics years ago. The price is excellent, the products work and it is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/28/14:&lt;br /&gt;I am halfway through my second bottle of this shampoo along with their Silk 18 conditioner. My back has cleared up dramatically. Before using this, I would have at least one active breakout on my back and I would wash my back after I rinsed out any conditioner. I have rarely had a breakout since on my back or my scalp. It&#x27;s pretty awesome. Also, my hair is so soft and has been since using both of these and I do wash my hair everyday or it goes flat and I can&#x27;t stand not feeling clean. This shampoo does have tea tree in it and normally I would avoid tea tree because I am not a fan of the smell. I do not mind the smell of this and actually find it relaxing. I look forward to my shower at the end of the day. I didn&#x27;t mention before but I do have curly hair so my hair tends to be dry and have a static issue during the winter. I have not had either with Maple Holistics shampoo and conditioner. They are great and I will be a long-term customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to these products, I was using Color Proof and that broke me out like crazy. I have tried all the salon brands with the same results. These are better than any of them (even Devacurl, Ouidad, and Curl Junkie).</li>
            <li> I was using Jason Dandruff shampoo for a few months and it got rid of my dandruff. But, my hair feels so oily by the end of the day. I wanted to try this one since according to the reviews, it cleans and moisturizes the hair while maintaining it dandruff-free. One week after using it, I got pimples on my head. :( Just finishing up this bottle and will go back to Jason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this shampoo. It makes my hair and scalp feel healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> it does not work for me</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of my all time favorite shampoos. Nothing else can compete with it for my dandruff/dry scalp! I need to only use it one to two times in order to calm my scalp and keep my dandruff from acting up or reoccurring. I love the simplicity of the bottle, the fantastic smell, and how gentle it is on your scalp and skin. It lathers well and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well for dry hair. WhenI stop using this, however, dandruff comes back with a vengeance. So far this is a good product. The bottle lasts quite a while, too!</li>
            <li> This bottle of shampoo was very expensive but I figured if it worked, it would be worth it.  It did nothing for my scalp and did not stop the itching.  My other Tea Tree shampoo of only $8.00 works much better.  I was very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely excited to use this product after I read the reviews on Amazon. The ingredients seemed natural, and well selected; it worked for a lot of people, That being said, I hoped that if anything, this product might not eliminate my dandruff completely, but at the very least improve it. I was dead wrong. My dandruff, to my horror, got a lot worse. For those of you like me who have thick dark, long, oily hair, please avoid this product. It will make your dandruff three times worse. When I say worse, I mean worse than when your dandruff problem is at its peak without using any products to control it. Please note that I do not have other skin conditions, and have oily skin (large pores). I&#x27;m writing this for other people and for myself so that I remember not to purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In disbelief after the first week of using the bottle, I used it three-four times a week hoping the situation would turn around, but with nearly 6/8th of the bottle gone, I&#x27;m giving up, and throwing away this product because my dandruff problem got so bad that I can&#x27;t stand it anymore. My head also itches a lot, and my scalp&#x27;s flaky to its worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells great and calms your nerves when washing your hair&lt;br /&gt;2. The packaging looks professional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Failed to improve the dandruff problem&lt;br /&gt;2. Worsened the dandruff problem&lt;br /&gt;3. Did not clean my hair well&lt;br /&gt;4. Caused the end of my hair to dry up even with conditioner&lt;br /&gt;5. Caused scalp itch</li>
            <li> I had been using Head &amp; Shoulders for years and after a while, it just didn&#x27;t work the same way, so I wanted a new dandruff shampoo that was more gentle and yet more efficient at the same time; luckily I found it! My itchiness and dandruff went away when I started using this shampoo. It smells fantastic and leaves my scalp moisturized and fresh. I lather up and let the shampoo soak in for 2 minutes or so before washing it out for the best results. I am extremely happy with this product and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant scent and does not leave hair dry as other shampoos often do. It is an excellent choice for managing and restoring dry hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. Not only does it smell amazing but the oil helps my hair grow faster than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> My hair has been falling out and is product was amazing. Wouldn&#x27;t try anything else and thank you for for giving self confidence I know its just hair but I have long curly sorry to say beautiful hair and to lose it I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shampoo for the winter time especially. I have mild dandruff and this shampoo really helps! It is not too expensive, fairly affordable unlike some of the other brands that offer the same thing. This shampoo smells amazing, it is definitely worth the buy! I recommend!</li>
            <li> Received this as a stocking gift from my Mom over Christmas. This is an amazing product. It has a wonderful feel too, almost a tingle. I think that is because of the tea tree oil and the rosemary. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I tried this product when I had pretty bad dandruff. It was really embarrassing to me because I have really dark hair and it always stood out. I tried lots of things to take care of the issue before including coconut oil and nothing worked as well as this product. It was effective at combatting the issue and also smelled GOOD and not nearly as medicinal as other products I had tried. I also found that the price was really reasonable as you do not have to use a ton of the product to get the job done. It will last you thats for sure. You will be pleasantly surprised by the scent and the effectiveness. I will guarantee it.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil Shampoo and Conditioner Rock!! Love the tingly clean feeling when I&#x27;m done washing my hair. It&#x27;s really awesome to find a holistic variety of tea tree hair products without chemical additives.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The lavender and rosemary combination is to die for! I have had a slight problem with dry skin on my scalp in the past, it&#x27;s hard for me to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I used to use more &amp;#34;well known&amp;#34; brands of dandruff shampoos but I didn&#x27;t like the smell and they didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft or clean. The tea tree oil is really nourishing and I love the way this product makes my hair much better looking and more manageable. &amp; a little bit of this stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  I was worried it would have a very strong tea tree smell, but it does not.  So far I feel like it has helped with the dry and flaky scalp.  So far I like the product and will probably buy more for me and my husband.</li>
            <li> I love it, after just a couple of uses the scalp has calmed, the hair is clean. Rinses out easily, no residue left over. I just love the smell!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for several months and will continue to do so. I love the smell and what it does. I had a few red itchy bumps along my hairline and an itchy scalp...no more! It only took a few uses and no more issues. I have color treated hair, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t fade the color.  Like most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos your hair may feel a bit dry after you use it. I just use a conditioner after I shampoo and once I dry my hair, it&#x27;s beautifully soft. I would highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I might have found THE shampoo I&#x27;ve been searching for.  I tried their &amp;#34;degrease&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Sage&amp;#34; and this &amp;#34;Tea Tree Oil&amp;#34; shampoo.  I have to say this is my favorite.  It has a very pleasant scent, makes my fine and oily hair feel clean and fuller.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used an entire bottle, and it was wonderful. I had a flaky scalp prior to using this shampoo but within two weeks of using it, it really cleared up my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry. I leave it in my hair for 2-3 minutes before rinsing. I recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants a natural, organic product for mild to moderate dandruff. I just ordered my second bottle!</li>
            <li> Love The tingling clean feeling and the help of my dandruff issues great product! would reccomend to people to use !!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have ever tried a tea tree oil shampoo before. I&#x27;ve always heard positive things about it so I gave it a go. I LOVE this shampoo! I have dandruff and it gets pretty annoying to deal with, especially when other shampoos haven&#x27;t worked well for me. This shampoo took away my dandruff and left my hair feeling so healthy and clean! I love the smell as well, it&#x27;s very relaxing and refreshing. I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from dandruff!</li>
            <li> My sister had this in her shower when I stayed over, I of course asked if I could try it.. and now i WANT MORE. My hair tends to get dandruff when its growing in natural color..its odd. But this helped more than my usual head and shoulders for some reason, maybe the ingredients? Reading the label i love the fact its practically all natural. I would reccomend more scents, this one is great, but would be awesome to have more of a choice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this Tea Tree oil. I have super dry skin especially in the winter so this has been a life saver. I have seen results faster than expected &amp; the smell is wonderful as well. Thanks for the amazing products! I&#x27;ve shared with my friends &amp; family as to how wonderful your products are.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time last month and i must say that I am impressed. It left my hair feeling amazing and my dandruff is nolonger a problem. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry scalp.  We received this last week and we already see a significant improvement in her dandruff.</li>
            <li> I din&#x27;t like this product. Smells funny, didn&#x27;t help with dandruff, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, I would not recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s expensive, but it is effective at controlling dandruff flaking without using a bunch of scary chemicals. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is a fine product from a fine company.  Although the Sage shampoo worked better for me, this one is up to the high standards of the Maple Holistics, where all of ingredients are chosen carefully and for the reason.  The only draw back for this particular shampoo for me was the stronger than expected lavender undertone in the scent it has.  In addition, I am very impressed with the customer service the company offers, truly the fine example of the customer care we all wish to experience.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I&#x27;ve always had trouble with dandruff and this is the first product that helped!</li>
            <li> I use this when my hair gets really dry. I have thick hair and I love how it feels after using this product. I have recommended it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Tea tree shampoo is the best for your hair.  After a few washes I could notice a big difference .  Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this product. The smell alone is amazing. Plus all of the benefits I&#x27;ve tried so many products for me and my daughter and this is the only product that has worked!!</li>
            <li> I was staying at my MIL&#x27;s and hadn&#x27;t brought shampoo and she had the Tea Tree shampoo. I was a little hesitant because I have thick hair that can tend to be a little oily, but I was very surprised after my hair dried by the quality of the product! Definitely purchasing my own bottle.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift! I have very oily hair... This shampoo keeps my hair looking healthy and natural without the greasy look and doesn&#x27;t look dried out! I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this shampoo!!  I deal with having an itchy scalp and it drives me insane!!!  My head always itched and would get to the point of being tender to the touch. I was recommended by a family member to give this shampoo a try.  I found relief from the first time I used it, it was wonderful!!  and after several uses, my scalp quit itching and my hair looks better than ever!!!  I will continue to use this brand</li>
            <li> Received as a gift from a friend of mine and since I keep my head shaved I decided to try it out on my dog since his hair is just like humans.  Smells great and left his hair nice and shiny and controls his dry skin that he sometimes gets in the winter time.  Great stuff for my dog I highly recommend it and I did have a neighbor try it out too and she loved it as she has completely gray hair and she said it made it so soft feeling.</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of different shampoos for the issues I have with my scalp and this tea tree oil shampoo was the best! The smell was wonderful and my scalp felt so nice afterwards! My hair has never looked and felt better :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have dandruff or iritated scalp.It is very soothing and smells great. Cleans hair great with no residue. My mother gave me some to try and I just love it. This is my new go to shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo. I have 4c hair that is styled in free form dreadlocks.  It really leaves my hair soft, strong, healthy, and manageable. It doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of the natural sebum that you scalp produces. It cleans it gently so that your scalp can produce a healthy balance of sebum. When I wash my hair with this I don&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner or moisturizer afterwards. My hair looks as if it has been conditioned as well! It also looks hydrated. I only use this and evian mineral water spray on my hair, and it grows so well. This company backs up everything it says, and it really is the best on the market!</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine hair, and I dye my hair every six weeks or so. Until I began using this shampoo, my hair always felt completely fried a week or two after dyeing. Most shampoos strip hair and necessitate the use of conditioner, but this doesn&#x27;t. Although I use this shampoo in conjunction with their Silk 18 conditioner, my hair is smooth and tangle-free even before conditioning. Neither of the products leaves my hair feeling greasy or weighed down. My hair feels healthy and smells nice. I occasionally have issues with scalp psoriasis. Typical dandruff shampoos don&#x27;t help, but this shampoo seems to have cleared up my scalp problems altogether.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but nothing special . The old standby&#x27;s like Selson Blue works better .</li>
            <li> I have to say this shampoo is amazing! Im obsessed with the scent. It is amazing!! Has natural essential oils such as tea tree,lavender,and argan oil!!love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter that was dealing with severe dandruff.  Her scalp was so white from the flaking and after using the product for 3 days the problem was even worse.  So we went back to Head and Shoulders.  The concept is great but the product did not work on her scalp.  Maybe for others but not in my daughters case.  It was an honest try...</li>
            <li> I truly loved the tea tree oil shampoo by maple holistics. I loved the way it may my scalp feel. Ive recommended it to everyone. My mom even uses it now. Good stuff</li>
            <li> like it ) makes my hair so smooth , so dandruff  after this shampoo</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work for my hair. i think the amount of tea tree oil they had in there was not sufficient.  it didn&#x27;t work for my head at all. i wont recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used is shampoo a few months back and it was good. I think sulfate free shampoo helped with hair loss a little and hair felt a bit thicker. Hair feels nice and smells great!! I don&#x27;t have have dandruff problem right now so I don&#x27;t know if it works for dandruff.</li>
            <li> My hair gets very dry in the winter months. This help keep it from drying out and plus the smell is out of this world. It will leave your hair smelling very good.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It helped with my dandruff so much!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo! I am a big fan of Tea Tree oil, but so many products capture only the smell and none of the benefits. This shampoo comes with the whole package! It&#x27;s great to use if you dye your hair and your scalp gets a little dry or sore from that. No itching or burning after just one shampoo! Love it!</li>
            <li> I was given this to try after complaining about the smell Pure Australian Tea Tree Oil left when I mixed it with shampoo. I turned to tea tree oil as a natural lice deterrent, but the medicine-y smell of the pure oil was almost unbearable. This product is absolutely AMAZING. It leaves our hair feeling clean, smelling nice, and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  I used to buy a comparable, pricey version at the salon, but not anymore!</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this product.I love the smell and it leaves my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I get REALLY dried out in the winter (I guess its because I wear a hat to stay warm a lot) and the tea tree oil and lavender do just the trick to get me back to normal! Also, the tingle....</li>
            <li> I like it, especially the tea tree scent. It smells so calming and all. I don&#x27;t have dandruff but I&#x27;ve always had irritating and itchy scalp and this shampoo helps with that a lot.</li>
            <li> Was not better than any other shampoo. Didn&#x27;t help for dandruff at all.</li>
            <li> I have long fine straight but full hair. I experience dry scalp most of the time.  I don&#x27;t expect the shampoo would address the dry scalp issue after one use and it didn&#x27;t.  It did leave my scalp feel not as dry and my hair not as limp.  I look forward to continuing using it to see a longer term effect.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp and issues with inflammation.  This shampoo has helped me a lot.  You can tell that it is made with quality ingredients.  It smells and feels great. When I use it regularly my scalp is clear of dandruff and irritation. It has many natural ingredients (such as lavender and rosemary) that I&#x27;ve seen recommended to soothe the scalp and help control hair loss.  It is priced more reasonably than some other therapeutic shampoos I have bought from clinics.  I feel good about this company and its holistic approach!</li>
            <li> I used this the Tea Tree Shampoo along with MY Fav SILK 18 conditioner.  (washed, conditioned, blew dry, and then straightened)  I came out with the best straightening I have ever done on my hair myself!  Love Love!!  I would def recommend for natural hair!  Only did 4 stars because I used some other new products during blow dry and straightening and they may have had a great hand in the great results!</li>
            <li> I recently started using Maple Holistics Tea Tree Oil shampoo. I was curious and excited it compare it to my Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo. The lavender adds a much more pleasant scent and the price is much more affordable. I was leary of the potential of my hair feeling oily, as it has before with organic shampoos, but it didn&#x27;t at all. My only disappointment is this brand seems to have less of the tea tree &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that my normal shampoo has. It is still nice and refreshing, but not quite as strong as other tea tree products. Customer service was extremely helpful and quick with replies and shipping. I will continue to use their products!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from dandruff for a long time, ever since puberty really (i&#x27;m 19 now). During the winter, it gets worse because of the cold air and heat in buildings and what not. Huge flakes would fall out of my hair when I take of my shirt or hoodie, and it&#x27;s visible too because my hair is brown. I tried Selsun Blue but that didn&#x27;t work at all, and head and shoulders worked for a while but then it just stopped working for me. I tried other htings that my aunt who is a nurse gave me, I can&#x27;t tell you the names because it was basically chemicals which i don&#x27;t remember, and those smelled horrible and looked like liquid &amp;#34;stool&amp;#34; (brown and thick). I came across Maple Holistics products through google searches for anti-dandruff shampoos and decided to pull the trigger with this one. I have haven&#x27;t had it long but the clean feeling on my scalp feels amazing, and knowing that they use clean ingredients doesn&#x27;t hurt either. It seems to be working and I love the tips they give you on the card in the package, telling you to rinse with cold water at the end (never thought of doing that) to close the cuticles. Let&#x27;s hope it keeps working!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I am loving it!  I have had dry scalp for a long time and tried many different products and none of them have worked as well as this one.  I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best shampoo I&#x27;ve every purchased. Cured my incredibly dry scalp. No more embarrassment.</li>
            <li> This tee tree oil shampoo is the first shampoo I have found that controls my teen son&#x27;s dandruff. He is 15 years old and very self conscious about dandruff.  I have tried multiple products for him and finally found  the solution. It may be a little more expensive than drug store brands but I feel like you get what you pay for. I am so impressed that I just placed an order for more shampoo for him and added other products for our family to the order. I can&#x27;t wait to try them as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say this helped get rid of my dry scalp. I used it for about two weeks with a minimal reduction in my symptoms. Purchased Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo locally and it also contained tea tree and rosemary but also added menthol which cooled the scalp. It made my scalp tingle but I still had irritated patches of dry skin. The best shampoo that I have found so far is a coal tar based shampoo that I purchased for Wal*mart. After only 1 treatment the itching is gone and my scalp is not as red and irritated. I would not purchase this again since it really did not work for me.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST DANDRUFF SHAMPOO ON THE MARKET HANDS DOWN. I&#x27;M IN THE HOSPITAILTY BUSINESS AND WAS ALWAYS BRUSHING MY SHOULDERS OFF OF FLAKES ON MY SUIT.A FRIEND RECOMENDED MAPLE HOLISTICS SO I GAVE IT A TRY AND IT HAS BEEN EXCELLENT . LOOK NO FURTHER THIS IS THE PRODUCT TO BUY. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MAPLE HOLISTICS!!!!!!! YOU HAVE A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works.  Cured my husband&#x27;s flakey scalp immediately.</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell. But I will be returning it as it did NOTHING for my dandruff. Not much difference than a regular $5 shampoo if it isn&#x27;t going to help with what is promises it is supposed to help with.</li>
            <li> My mom bought his for me when I mentioned to her that typical anti-dandruff shampoos no longer worked at all for me (and never worked that for me well to begin with). I used this as directed throughout last winter and this spring and it worked fabulously. My dandruff was completely gone and my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy anymore. After the bottle ran out, I was trying to use up some other leftover shampoos we had lying around  (mostly popular brand name anti-dandruff shampoos, which still work for my Dad). For me, the dandruff ended up coming back. So we re-ordered this one. I&#x27;ve used it once and already my scalp feels relieved. I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying this if you&#x27;ve used other anti-dandruff shampoos long term and they don&#x27;t work for you anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I think the smell is quite excellent.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was great. It has no sulfates like the &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; and name brand shampoos but does the job with gentle cleaning and leaving softness and no greasy feeling. My hair is thin and it was not weighed-down by this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I also have very thin, flat hair, so I was concerned about the tradeoff of switching to this and leaving behind my volume building shampoo and conditioner. This was another needless worry. I simply used this product as instructed and styled as normal using my other regular products and my hair was full, soft, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past when I have tried these types of products they have smelled terrible and they would sting my scalp. I became especially worried about stinging when I realized the instructions said to leave it on for 2 or 3 minutes. However, there was no stinging sensation and the scent was herbal and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I have to recommend this product. My scalp does not itch nearly as much, and my hair is definitely not a greasy. This is a product that does what it says.</li>
            <li> this shampoo smells great and makes your hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!. I&#x27;ve been in search of a shampoo that is natural with no sulfates and LATHERS and makes my hair feel clean afterwards WITH NO ITCHY SCALP! This is the best shampoo out there and it is for sure worth every penny. I will definitely buy this for life.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle on my colored hair.  It has been very effective in treating my scalp issues.  Many other shampoos I have used have a very chemically smell, and this one does not - the lavender, rosemary and tea tree oil make for a great scent.  I have noticed my dry scalp issues have been reduced dramatically only after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and helps well in lessening my dandruff. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo if you have dandruff!!! Plus, it leaves your hair smelling nice all day.</li>
            <li> It is now wintertime and it&#x27;s cold out, and this is probably the healthiest my hair has ever looked.  A little bit goes a long way but it still is kind of expensive.  I still would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makes Dandruff worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of my seborrheic dermatitis.  Plus, my kids&#x27; school recently had a lice outbreak and I heard tea tree oil is a great preventive measure against lice.  I haven&#x27;t used this repeatedly yet, but I like the smell.  It&#x27;s mellower than the pure essential oil.  I haven&#x27;t found that the shampoo totally eradicates the flakes, but I haven&#x27;t given it a long trial yet.</li>
            <li> Good product.  My scalp and hair feels good after using it.  I would encourage others to use it.</li>
            <li> Some natural shampoos make my hair difficult to comb through, but this one works and smells great. I have sensitive skin and in the winter my head itches a lot. This formula has relieved the itchiness of my head without weighing my hair down or drying my skin out. I recommend this to anyone who loves buying natural, but also needs something that truly works!</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves my hair clean, soft and with no dandruff. Very effective and smells awesome. Have to leave on for 2-3 min. for best results.</li>
            <li> I decided to use the tea tree oil for my scalp issues (oily scalp, some &amp;#34;breaking out&amp;#34; on my scalp. The tea tree oil shampoo has eliminated this problem almost completely. I will continue to use it and am sure the results will only get better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a head and shoulders user for many years, and wanted to find something more natural to treat my itchy scalp. Maple holistics came recommended by a friend. I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks now and love it - the rosemary and lavender are very soothing and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with a flaky scalp. Great substitute (and in my opinion superior choice) for those looking for an alternative to head and shoulders or other similar shampoos.</li>
            <li> It really works for me and the entire family. We don;t have any other shampoo in the house but this. Even the maid use this. Cool-ass product, this is!</li>
            <li> Nothing. I&#x27;m just over the top in love with this shampoo and at what it did to my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Works for me, thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Clean, refreshing, and natural...I love it.  I was told tea tree will help the health of my scalp, so I ordered this fabulous shampoo.  Though I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times, it seems the build up on my scalp is diminishing and my head doesn&#x27;t itch!  Big positives for me.  So far, I love this shampoo and will be reordering.  Currently I&#x27;m following with the Silk 18 conditioner and I am just as pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering this shampoo, but I am SO happy that I went through with the purchase! I&#x27;m typically very wary of shampoos because I have yet to find one that is not drying. Until now! Maple Holistic&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Shampoo is a must have for your hair cleansing needs. It has left my hair soft, hydrated, and tangle free (a characteristic usually associated with creams and conditioners). Treat your scalp to a nice rinse with this shampoo!</li>
            <li> My scalp and hair feel so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I love.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. Not only does it help with dandruff and scalp problems, but it makes my hair look a whole lot better! I have dyed hair and so it gets frizzy, but this makes it looks a lot healthier. Going to keep buying these maple holistic items.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and my scalp gets mild dandruff during the winter. This product can easily clear the scalp without drying my hair. The only reason I deduct one star is it&#x27;s kind of pricey.</li>
            <li> Practically everyone in my family gets dandruff during the winter... we&#x27;ve got a bottle of this in every shower. The only shampoo I&#x27;ve found to actually heal my scalp. Great buy</li>
            <li> The scent is strong of tea tree (it smells kinda like vics vapor rub to me) but I absolutely love it. The scent is invigorating and soothing at the same time. I&#x27;ve used this product once so far today and I already notice my head itches less than it normally does. If I can add an update in a month about the results I will.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo because I have an extremely dry scalp. I needed a shampoo that would help moisturize my scalp and I love tea tree oil. This shampoo worked extremely well for me. When I use it I can tell that my scalp has been moisturized and my hair feels  moisturized as well. I have no flakes at all! It tingles a little when you are using it and I guess that is how you know it is working because it definitely works. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a shampoo to help take care of a dry scalp or dandruff.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and have not seen any dandruff since I started using it. Finally a NATURAL Dandruff Shampoo that works and isn&#x27;t blue and full of unknown chemicals. I Love It and would recommend it to anyone that wants a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I read the description, it sounded good, I have been using it for a a couple weeks now and it does its job very well. Satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought this because of my dandruff, but it really does heal skin blemishes too... I work in home remodeling, so occasionally i&#x27;ll get bruised or scratched. I&#x27;ve noticed the cut on my scalp healed much faster than the one on my arm after some use of this. Dandruff went away too. Smell, design, effectiveness... I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody even if they didn&#x27;t have dandruff!</li>
            <li> I switched off Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and I have been looking for a quality sulfate-free replacement. This is it - with it&#x27;s pleasant smell and good feeling after a shower. I think I have found my shampoo for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin in the winter so I get dandruff. This shampoo leaves my scalp feeling wonderful, not to mention smelling nice! My hair feels so clean afterwards; it gets rid of all the tangles too.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this shampoo ... smells great &amp; helps with itchy scalp/dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry scalp and hair and this shampoo has been doing a great job at keeping it moisturized and  clean since day 1. I can really feel the difference and I feel more beautiful now that I feel that my &amp;#34;crowning glory&amp;#34; is well taken cared of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for about 2-3 weeks prior to writing this review.  At first I didn&#x27;t see a difference but by the 4th to 5th day, my hair was no longer dry and static decreased drastically.  My hair is definitely lighter and no longer having the heavy feeling.  Flakes from the rough winters are very minimal now.  From many reviews, customers stated a tingling feeling but I didn&#x27;t experience that.    A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way.  First few times, there were no bubbles lathering effect but give it a week and you&#x27;ll see how much it&#x27;ll lather up.  I like the fragrance,  very lightly scented for being tea tree oil.  I&#x27;ll buy it again!  And hopefully the price will drop in the near future!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff right here!</li>
            <li> This product contains DMDM Hydantoin, which is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative. This ingredient is classified as a high hazard on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Database. Such a high-hazard ingredient, in my opinion, has no place in a product that touts its natural and organic ingredients and is made by a company with the word &amp;#34;Holistics&amp;#34; in its name. The product also contains Triethanolamine, which is classified as a medium hazard in the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Database. I would urge anyone interested in avoiding high-hazard ingredients in their cosmetics to look up each ingredient before buying. There are many companies engaged in &amp;#34;greenwashing,&amp;#34; and Maple Holistics is apparently one of them.</li>
            <li> Works fine and smells great! Been using it for 3 weeks and my scalp is less itchy.</li>
            <li> Very effective and smells really  nice. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I stayed at Kiehl&#x27;s Amino Acid collection before (the best hair product for me). I once meet difficulty to order from Kiehl&#x27;s web site, so tried Maple Holistics Shampoo for Oily, Itchy &amp; Greasy Hair with Organic Rosemary, Peach Kernel and Jojoba, and I find I quite love it. For me, I feel it is equally good as Kiehl&#x27;s Amino Acid. Since it is available at Amazon with free shipping, it is much more convenient for me to order. I also tried this Tea Tree one, and I love it, too. Now, I just ordered an Argan Oil one to try. I am very happy that they are all made by natural ingredient, and I have so many choices. I have decided to switch from Kiehl&#x27;s Amino Acid (the only good hair product for me in Kiehl&#x27;s) to Maple Holistics, which are easier to order and has more choices and usually cheaper.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of shampoos and hair treatments but of no use.&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo gave me extraordinary results reduced hair fall and i can see new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I first started out with their conditioner and LOVE it. I was sent a free gift of this shampoo from the company. I have used this shampoo twice and my hair feels so full and healthy. I&#x27;m hoping it kicks my hair growth that I&#x27;m looking for . Great stuff and awesome company to deal with.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo, makes my hair feel soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo on monday and have been using it for the past 3 days and already am impressed with it. I love the sent and it leaves my hair looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo twice, I can already see the reduction in dandruff. I also love the way my hair feels after washing. The shampoo in combination with the silk 18 conditioner make my hair very soft and manageable. I will definitely repurchase these products.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for quite a while now and I can feel that it works. My scalp is now moisturized and my hair is actually growing. It stopped growing for 2 years and it was very dry. I am not sure why but after a hair perm gone wrong, it just stopped growing at all. Now I can see it grow! I finally have healthy hair again.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for only a week, but have seen a decrease in dandruff. My scalp also feels clean. It probably takes longer than just a week to get the full result. Although it is quite expansive compared to other regular commercial shampoo brands on the market, it is worth a try for its high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells sooo good. I have guttate psoriasis, and it&#x27;s hard to find an effective shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair, and helps keep my scalp clear.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because seriously, it&#x27;s the only thing that worked for me and it&#x27;s the one I least expected to work. It was a gift from a workmate. I laughed at first because, seriously. I never even heard about the brand. Wait, what brand is this again? But yeah...you know the what happened next.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  I have dry curly thinning hair and for the first time in forever, my head doesn&#x27;t itch and I think I&#x27;m actually growing new hair!!</li>
            <li> Five stars. Feels clean and helps with break outs near my hair line. I got it in hopes of reducing excessive shedding (TE) and to help regrow lost hair. I don&#x27;t know that it has helped at all with the regrowth but it hasn&#x27;t hurt and is non irritating. I have not liked the anti hair loss shampoos I have tried so I plan to stick with this and continue healthy eating and supplements. I have sensitive skin and fine hair; it works well for me.  Don&#x27;t want to use second bottle. That review was for the first bottle I ordered. I just got the second bottle of the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; shampoo. I was very surprised to find the ingredients list very different from the first bottle I reviewed. There are many new additives and the natural oils have gone from being the 8th ingredient to the 18th or 20 something. What happened? Is the original still available? So disappointing.  I would love for someone to tell me the ingredients are the same and just more broken down and I misunderstood. From what I can tell they added a bunch of stuff.</li>
            <li> Im very impressed i placed an order saturday evening and i received it the next day. I used the tree oil shampoo and first day i noticed a big difference my hair feel healthy i recommend it, i would buy it again.Im hoping my hair will grow faster to soon to speak on that but so far my hair feels great!</li>
            <li> I received a full sized bottle to sample. I am used to using the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo, which costs me $28 every week or so. And it doesn&#x27;t really clean my hair, but it also won&#x27;t break me out. It is one of the very very few that won&#x27;t trigger an allergic reaction to my super sensitive skin. This shampoo was almost as good as the Paul Mitchell brand. But, it did leave me feeling like I had something on my scalp. It made my hair feel heavy and rather oily. Maybe because I changed shampoos, to use this. Its wonderful, though. It smells really good. I would definitelyrrecommend this.</li>
            <li> Since I gave birth I get sensitive skin. When I color my hair I get a sensitive scalp. This shampoo helps keep my scalp from itching and flaking out of control.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hair and scalp were so dry during the bitter winter months. The product worked so well. My hair was moisturized, no flaky scalp,  and I liked the scent.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome! For the past year, I&#x27;ve had dry scalp problems that couldn&#x27;t be fixed with drugstore varieties of shampoo. I&#x27;ve also got chronic illness, so I&#x27;m hesitant about other chemical-laden beauty products and &amp;#34;therapeutic&amp;#34; hair formulas. Maple Holistics was a great solution. Within three uses, my dry scalp and dandruff was completely gone. It smells great without any heavy perfumes, and it makes my hair look shiny and healthy. Consider me a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mainly used Head &amp; Shoulders, and the other leading brands, but I think this one worked just as well, if not better than the others. I think it was very helpful, and I&#x27;m giving it a thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Rep</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this,actually she showed me.her hair and face kept looking better each time I saw her.finally I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore,I had to know what she was doing.now I don&#x27;t wish to go another day without it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell terrific</li>
            <li> We have never tried a shampoo like this before, and both my husband &amp; I are very pleased with this product.  It feels gentle on the scalp and has really helped the winter dry scalp scene.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I love the way it makes my hair feel and I don&#x27;t plan on using anything else! Such an amazing line of&lt;br /&gt;Products</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair and in winter I usually get dandruff. This shampoo is great for my hair. No dandruff in my hair after use. Also it has great smell. My hair smell so nice after they dry. My hair gets so tangles after they dry but this shampoo makes my hair frizz free and tangle free. Love it.</li>
            <li> My son has very dry hair and occasionally has dandruff. This product worked amazing for him and he enjoyed the scent</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry hair and a dry scalp.  She has used this Tea Tree Oil Shampoo and her has has improved greatly!</li>
            <li> Must have if you have dandruff. I love the smell. Cleans your hair perfectly. And the tree oil is a plus. It helps with preventing and treating lice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very prone to getting dandruff, and have to say this stuff is great.. No complaints, and my hair also feels so smooth, and smells great after using it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with dandruff for year. Tried head and sshoulders and others of the like. Thos shampoo has helped a lot with relieving some of thw itchyness I have. I still have some dandruff, but not nearlynas. Much as before.  I love the way this smells as well. And as a bonus the tree tree oil prevents headlice. I had my cousins kids at my house for three days before I realized they both had lice. The girl had it bad. Surprisingly even though my daughter and the little girl shared the same bed and pillow my daughter didn&#x27;t get lice. I feel its because she uses this shampoo also. Inwill definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> best product ever)) love tree oil so good for your skin</li>
            <li> I tried this out and it made my hair really soft.  I paired it with a conditioner I already had but I felt the shampoo worked great.  My hair splits easily but my split ends felt less dry after using this.  A lot of natural products with tea tree don&#x27;t smell great, but I really liked this one.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I get it local sometimes when it is in stock but it is great for my hair and my brothers!! Great product with a great scent! Dont think you have to buy Big brand names to have a great product. Natural is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Feels great on the scalp and leaves hair smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I really appreciate a safe shampoo that treats dandruff. There is no strong smell to this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I am chemically sensitive and absolutely cannot use just any shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo lathers nice and rinses out well and leaves my hair feeling great and shinny.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Really liked using a shampoo that is sulfate free but still produced a nice lather. I have naturally curly hair that tends to get dry and frizzy. After using this shampoo ,my scalp and hair felt so clean, and still  manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Gift for my mom. Smells good. She seems to like it.</li>
            <li> good stuff works good</li>
            <li> have scalp acne and a little dandruff have used this 3x and can tell a huge difference already</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to say that this shampoo delivers in just one week of use (at least for me). My dandruff is visibly less after using it every day for one week straight. I will continue my use and recommend it to friends who have dandruff too.</li>
            <li> leaves hair fresh but still dandruff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna have to order some more soon.</li>
            <li> I like it. I do feel that my scalp itches less. It provides relief almost immediately after. -1 star for the price. $15 for one bottle of shampoo is very expensive. But I&#x27;d rather use something natural than harsh chemicals. Looking forward to trying this shampoo with one of their conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very dense, medium-long hair. My grocery store stopped carrying the shampoo and conditioner I was using, so I just bought a random bottle of shampoo and conditioner, which I found to be a huge mistake. My hair was getting crunchy and my scalp was itchy (though partially because of winter) and I went on the hunt for something better. I decided on this shampoo because I was starting to get dandruff, and I think it was a good decision. It costs A LOT more than the stuff I was using, but my scalp is much less dry and itchy, and there&#x27;s no dandruff. One wash made a difference. I also really like the smell, which is mostly rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only two complaints. One: I wish this came in a larger size or was available through subscribe and save. I have so much hair and I use so much shampoo - I could really use a discount of some sort. Speaking of discounts, my second complaint is that the item description claims buying two or more bottles saves 30%, but that is not actually true, unless there&#x27;s an unknown hoop to jump through to actually make that work.</li>
            <li> Use it every day and be amazed!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night and I must say I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  I loved the tingling feeling my scalp had afterwards and I loved the fact that i wasnt scratching my usual itchy scalp!!!!  Looks like a keeper so far!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it! The smell, the feel, the effects and the price. Everything. I just love it and I;m never going back to H&amp;S.</li>
            <li> I have seen my friend use this product and decided to buy one for myself. I have dandruff and due to which had a severe hair loss. After using a sample of this shampoo for 2 weeks, I am very much satisfied with my reduced dandruff problem and also hair loss problem. Though there is not much new hair growing, the loss of existing hair is very much reduced. I like this product and i strongly recommend this product fro those who have dandruff problem.</li>
