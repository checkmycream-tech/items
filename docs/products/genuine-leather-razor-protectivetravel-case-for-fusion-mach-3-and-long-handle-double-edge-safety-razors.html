    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Perfect case to protect your razor!</li>
            <li>Will do an excellent job of protecting my razor (fancy handle, Mach 3 heads)</li>
            <li>It works, but for the money, it wasn&#x27;t a very good item.</li>
            <li>This case arrived on time and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Great piece of equipment for your travel shaving needs.  </li>
            <li>A great case for my fancy The Art of Shaving Razor.</li>
            <li>This case is great for my Parker</li>
            <li>Looks good.  </li>
            <li>and I need to look good when I get there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it for good.</li>
            <li>Fits \\&quot;Genuine Ox Horn Handle Triple Blade Mach 3 Compatible Razor From Parker Safety Razor\\&quot; perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to safely transport a quality razor.</li>
            <li>Nice, inexpensive razor case.</li>
            <li>Keep blade and razor handy.</li>
            <li>I just wish it came in a brown that could showcase the grain of the leather better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than trying to keep it in the plastic case</li>
            <li>still looking for a better</li>
            <li>Some have noted that the travel case has a strong smell, and indeed it does, but It&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell like shoe polish and will lessen over time.</li>
            <li>Sure the hotel has disposables available if you need it, but would you trust your paycheck to one of those?</li>
            <li>My Fusion ProGlide fits perfectly, is well protected, and looks sharp.</li>
            <li>Convenient and easy to use .</li>
            <li>Easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li>It says it will fit Gillette Fusion razors, but is way too small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, but my razor was too long for it</li>
            <li>you can stretch it out first, it may work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Now I can find the razor in my dopp kit safely and easily even in dim light.</li>
            <li>Just right for travel.  </li>
            <li>Nice tight fit.  </li>
            <li>The razors only fit if you force them into the case, but they do fit.</li>
            <li>A tight fit for my Gillette Fusion razor, but I was able to force it in.  </li>
            <li>None of the razors I currently use fit into this holder.  </li>
            <li>Very pleases.</li>
            <li>This is a very well-made case in leather, lined with a heavy-duty vinyl.</li>
            <li>Easily protects wide handle razors, and compatible with Mach 3 and Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Fit is a little snug but, utimately, exactly what I had hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>I tried a number of time to get the razor to fit and finally cut away some material to let it go further into the sleeve so that the snap might latch.  </li>
            <li>Very tight fit for my Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>This is a high quality, well constructed case that fits my razor like a glove and protects not only the blade, but my fingers when I&#x27;m digging around in my kit to find it.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the deep pocket for this long handled razor.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times you put the razor into the case, it fits so tightly that it&#x27;s a bit of a challange to know where to push on the \\&quot;business end\\&quot; of the razor to get it into the case.  </li>
            <li>Bit of a tight fit though, so be careful the first few times you put your razor in, until the case &amp;#34;molds&amp;#34; to the handle.</li>
            <li>When I tried to put this razor into the travel case it would not fit, in fact the first time id the cartridge broke off.  </li>

            <li> Great product, but my razor was too long for it so I cant snap it shut.</li>
            <li> I had to return this after about a week as it smelled really badly. No idea if it was a fluke or they all are this way.</li>
            <li> None of the razors I currently use fit into this holder.  It is simply too tight for them.  And they range from disposables to powered ones.</li>
            <li> This case arrived on time and in great condition.  I have a long handled Merkur razor and this thing is at least another inch longer so whatever you have, it&#x27;ll carry it!  It snaps tight over the head but didn&#x27;t require a monster effort to get it closed.  Great piece of equipment for your travel shaving needs.  I just wish it came in a brown that could showcase the grain of the leather better.</li>
            <li> A great case for my fancy The Art of Shaving Razor. Easily protects wide handle razors, and compatible with Mach 3 and Fusion blades. Some have noted that the travel case has a strong smell, and indeed it does, but It&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell like shoe polish and will lessen over time.</li>
            <li> Nice, inexpensive razor case. It protects my Fusion razor well while it&#x27;s in my shaving kit when I travel. It&#x27;s much better than trying to keep it in the plastic case it comes with.</li>
            <li> Looks good.  Keeps the blade of your razor intact and attached to razor.</li>
            <li> I travel extensively for a living and I need to look good when I get there. My razor is an essential part of that. Sure the hotel has disposables available if you need it, but would you trust your paycheck to one of those? This is a high quality, well constructed case that fits my razor like a glove and protects not only the blade, but my fingers when I&#x27;m digging around in my kit to find it. That&#x27;s a small price to pay for one less thing I need to think about.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use . Keep blade and razor handy. Easy to use and maintain. Would recommend it to friends and family</li>
            <li> My Fusion ProGlide fits perfectly, is well protected, and looks sharp. Mission accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made, I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this case to protect my Gillette Fusion razor blade or my Schick Razor from damage in my travel bag. The razors only fit if you force them into the case, but they do fit. I wish there was one made specifically for these razors that have disposable blade heads. It works, but for the money, it wasn&#x27;t a very good item.</li>
            <li> It says it will fit Gillette Fusion razors, but is way too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it for good.</li>
            <li> terrible purchase--they don&#x27;t tell you it only fits the handle. Got some advice that it would stretch out. So I took it, It still did not change the dimensions enough the accommodate the handle and blade. Which makes it pretty useless.</li>
            <li> This case is great for my Parker 96R.  I particularly like the deep pocket for this long handled razor.  Also, the flap is long enough to cover the head of the razor.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to safely transport a quality razor. It is simple but does the job. Very pleases.</li>
            <li> Perfect case to protect your razor!</li>
            <li> Fit is a little snug but, utimately, exactly what I had hoped it would be.  Will do an excellent job of protecting my razor (fancy handle, Mach 3 heads)</li>
            <li> This is a very well-made case in leather, lined with a heavy-duty vinyl. Bit of a tight fit though, so be careful the first few times you put your razor in, until the case &amp;#34;molds&amp;#34; to the handle.</li>
            <li> A tight fit for my Gillette Fusion razor, but I was able to force it in.  It should loosen up with continued use.</li>
            <li> I have a Fusion razor with the standard handle.  When I tried to put this razor into the travel case it would not fit, in fact the first time id the cartridge broke off.  I tried a number of time to get the razor to fit and finally cut away some material to let it go further into the sleeve so that the snap might latch.  After doing this it still would not close. I am keeping this item with the hope that as the leather stretches I will get snap to close.</li>
            <li> What was delivered was not what is pictured.  It is a flat leather pouch too tight for even a pocket comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> Fits \\&quot;Genuine Ox Horn Handle Triple Blade Mach 3 Compatible Razor From Parker Safety Razor\\&quot; perfectly.  Just right for travel.  Nice tight fit.  The first couple of times you put the razor into the case, it fits so tightly that it&#x27;s a bit of a challange to know where to push on the \\&quot;business end\\&quot; of the razor to get it into the case.  I don&#x27;t view this as an issue, after the first couple of times it fits like an expensive pair of shoes.  Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> Very tight fit for my Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;If you can stretch it out first, it may work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a better case.&lt;br /&gt;I used a ziplock Baggie for years.</li>
