            <li>I hope it is a product that continues to be available here.</li>
            <li>Wash.  Makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and was glad to find it for such a good price here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I used Nu Skin years ago and really liked how your skin is so soft and the softness lasts for days.  </li>
            <li>As described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>scrub is just right for any type of skin.</li>
            <li>this soap is a item i would buy again but does not lather great...priced right...</li>
            <li>The Nu Skin body Lufra is good for your entire body and keeps your skin soft all over (face, elbows, hands, etc.)</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>it is developed by advanced technology</li>
            <li>and it was pretty good but the defoliant and mint scent clean no better than regular soap and water or body wash.</li>
            <li>Smells minty, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>And she was very grateful for her daughter for giving this product!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>love other nu skin products</li>
            <li>products are good but not as grandiose as all the sales materials I had to buy led on to believe plus everything was much more expensive than your regular store brands which work just as well.  </li>
            <li>Even the wholesale price was extravagant, most of my customers simply couldn&#x27;t afford these products; which left me with promotional material I could do nothing but give or throw</li>
            <li>suspect most of the 5-star reviews here are from current distributors especially those who give a sales code which will earmark part of this sale as a commission for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for this particular item, it was one I used myself</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Not harsh on the skin</li>
            <li>This product leaves your skin soft and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no kind of advertising of any kind was allowed by corporate HQ if you did then you would lose your distributorship and possibly fined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so will give this one a 2nd chance before completely decide....</li>

            <li> I have used this for years and was glad to find it for such a good price here on Amazon.  I hope it is a product that continues to be available here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better and easier than using a lufra sponge. It makes your skin feel clean and refreshed. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it. The best exfoliating product on the market.</li>

            <li> I used Nu Skin years ago and really liked how your skin is so soft and the softness lasts for days.  I had to buy it when I saw it on Amazon.  The products truly nourish your skin. The Nu Skin body Lufra is good for your entire body and keeps your skin soft all over (face, elbows, hands, etc.)</li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune disease, scleroderma and I am limited on what I can use without developing little bumps on my arms. This product does a great job at exfoliating. I really like it.</li>

            <li> This is the best Lufra I have used.  Blows away all sugar and salt scrubs..Highly recommend. Do try it.  You will be satisfied . Nice price for the product</li>
            <li> I prefer sugar and salt scrubs to this product, not what I have been expected. This product isn&#x27;t doing anything to help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> smell is OK- but apricot bids there is very random and dont give effect of exfoliator .  makes skin very smooth right after rinsing -  but I dont like fact of parabens in there . Why do they need to be in the soap?  it is developed by advanced technology Co-  I can not imagine why  they use such harmful chemicals... will not buy again sorry</li>
            <li> Nu skin liquid body lufa is working great I would refer it to someone if I get to know someone</li>
            <li> I was a distributor back in 1993 for about two years before I cut my losses and gave it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are good but not as grandiose as all the sales materials I had to buy led on to believe plus everything was much more expensive than your regular store brands which work just as well.  Even the wholesale price was extravagant, most of my customers simply couldn&#x27;t afford these products; which left me with promotional material I could do nothing but give or throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect most of the 5-star reviews here are from current distributors especially those who give a sales code which will earmark part of this sale as a commission for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything against them for making money but when I was a distributor, it was strictly door to door and word of mouth, no kind of advertising of any kind was allowed by corporate HQ if you did then you would lose your distributorship and possibly fined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this particular item, it was one I used myself and it was pretty good but the defoliant and mint scent clean no better than regular soap and water or body wash.</li>
            <li> The best body wash...</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! As described and quick delivery.</li>
