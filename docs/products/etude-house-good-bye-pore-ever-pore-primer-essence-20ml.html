            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I read in the reviews that this produce was as good as Benefit Porefessional; it ins&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It has the palest of tints that are not noticeable on my fair skin and does not smear onto clothing like foundation.  </li>
            <li>Just want to try, the effect is good ÔºÅ</li>
            <li>It does a very good job minimizing pores and fine lines</li>
            <li>/&gt;It WAS well packaged, a VERY cute box with a face profile on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To top it off, the price is great.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought this because I loved the name and the packaging (congratulations to the marketing department, you&#x27;ve won me over).</li>
            <li>MAKEUP WENT ON OVER IT, AS SMOOTH AS CAN BE!!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>The smell is very light and the good thing is that it goes away.</li>
            <li>Compared to some higher-end primers, I think Etude House holds its own.</li>
            <li>But if all the 5 star reviews made you think this was a spectacular find, I hope this review helps ground your expectations a bit.</li>
            <li>And just to be honest</li>
            <li>and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>It does not feel sticky on my face, and it has a nice finish when it dries.</li>
            <li>Maybe not as perfect as they claim it is, but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean fragrance and excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised that this worked so great!</li>
            <li>Smooth, matte, and it feels good, too.  </li>
            <li>The company sent three samples for me to try and that was a nice bonus. : )&lt;</li>
            <li>Makes my face flawless without the shine and pores are instantly gone for a nice foundation finish</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, it&#x27;s not oily, and spreads on well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I applied the moisturizer, then the Good-bye Pore-ever (it is a very light, pleasent scent)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good primer and allows my BB cushion to work to its full potential and make my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>love this pore filler - fills in large pores easily, great makeup primer as well.  </li>
            <li>Benefit works better for me.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the quality of the product and in my opinion, it is better than the</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Since my skin is combination, I&#x27;m glad NOT to have the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>Packaged nicely, shipped on time and had a free sample and a lovely hand-written/hand-folded note inside.  </li>
            <li>I like using this on my nose &amp; cheeks where my pores are more noticeable.</li>
            <li>But it did smooth my skin out a bit, made applying foundation easier, and made my foundation look amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better</li>
            <li>Ok as a primer but didn&#x27;t diminish any of my pores.</li>
            <li>I am SO pleased with Etude&#x27;s dupe.</li>
            <li>The product works even better than Benefit&#x27;s in my opinion.</li>
            <li>You do need a bit more of the product (maybe a half-pea sized amount for each area you want to cover) but considering the price and size difference of the two products, I have no problem using a bit more.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and more of this.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly at night, but also under my make-up...</li>
            <li>I really love this product and it works as soon</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product as it help my complexion look much better.  </li>
            <li>Once I run out, I&#x27;ll be sure to get another bottle. : )</li>
            <li>This makes my skin look and feel like satin - SO smooth!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this Primer..</li>
            <li>For the price, it works okay $18, but I found cheaper ones for about $10 but does not compare to Benefit&#x27;s Porefessional.</li>
            <li>I love beauty products, and this one I will use forever more.</li>
            <li>It even hides the shine in the T zone :)</li>
            <li>my foundation goes on much more smoothly on my nose and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;collect&amp;#34; in the pores like it did before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard it was a good dupe to Benefit&#x27;s Porefessional, and it&#x27;s much cheaper, so</li>
            <li>Its moisturizing keeping the skin smooth and the makeup will apply easily.</li>
            <li>Amazing product because I have a problem with large pores on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who feels their pores are too visible.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores around my nose and on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It Primer (supposedly the no.1 selling primer in Korea) that I have been using in terms of oil control and how smoothly my makeup glides on.</li>
            <li>They also threw in some free samples with my order.</li>
            <li>That said, it does smooth out textures created by pores, so it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll use until it runs out.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT AND NOT GREASY FEELING.  </li>
            <li>This primer makes foundation go on so smoothly</li>
            <li>It also help any foundation to smooth on your skin like silk</li>
            <li>it smooth skins out though.</li>
            <li>It also smells light and refreshing,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have really big pores, which always show through my makeup, so I was happy when I found that this hid them so well.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel smooth and improves the look of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This primer does a fantastic job of minimizing the appearance of pores upon makeup application.</li>
            <li>went on smoothly</li>
            <li>same texture and feels great on skin .</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly onto your face and your pores does appear unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say if you want a good but cheap primer, try this!</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s perfect for everyday use though you might need something stronger for special events.</li>
            <li>I did find that it had a strong perfume smell (but not unpleasant)</li>
            <li>usually wear it under my BB cream and it looks great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now interested in more products by this brand.  </li>
            <li>As long as she was happy that&#x27;s all that mattered.</li>
            <li>I love this primer, it really keeps my skin looking clean and silky under makeup and gives me a semi-dewy look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to primers and have large pores, and after hearing good things from Etude House I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.</li>
            <li>What I really like is the smooth, no-slime texture!</li>
            <li>I put on the primer before anything else on my face and leave it to &#x27;settle&#x27; for a good ten minutes.</li>
            <li>As far as my pores go, yes, it DID fill them in and everything looked nice, even and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product offers a nice matte foundation, does seem to shrink pores.  </li>
            <li>skin breaks out pretty easily and have yet</li>
            <li>The product itself works well - feel good, smells good, lasts long, doesn&#x27;t cause outbreaks and my pores look much smaller.</li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super oily and runny.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t oily or slick, it was a very good consistency for my combination face.</li>
            <li>Not as heavy as Benefit&#x27;s The PoreFESSIONAL, so the coverage isn&#x27;t quite as good and long lasting, but it&#x27;s very light and is wonderful for every day use.</li>
            <li>Has a very light scent that fades immediately (and I have a VERY sensitive sense of smell).  </li>
            <li>This primer does go on nicely - the texture is like that of most primers, making skin slightly slick to allow foundation to be blended and spread out easily.</li>
            <li>Love this small tube, my face is so bright and feel good all day long.  </li>
            <li>THIS MADE MY SKIN LOOK MUCH FRESHER!!  </li>
            <li>product itself works pretty well for me!</li>
            <li>It is light weight but really does not do the job.</li>
            <li>but now it seems more natural and allows for makeup to blend in more naturally.</li>
            <li>it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I use the primer after my moisturizer (which I use religiously, now) and my skin looks nice.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s expected to get it after a good while).</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the product thus far.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves a soft, smooth finish that allows my favorite BB cream (Garnier) to glide on smoothly and last all day.  </li>
            <li>the smell is kinda flowery but the price is worth it considering the one from benefit is 30$</li>
            <li>I purchased this product due to the good reviews (see [...]</li>
            <li>Love the primer, it has a pleasant light scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have very large pores</li>
            <li>Etude has a new loyal customer!</li>
            <li>I always put this product all over my face, and slightly more on my pores and you can barely see my pores.</li>
            <li>so it really works really good on my skin, leaving my pores closed.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly the same, but the Etude House product worked MUCH better.</li>
            <li>Rubbing an ice cube on my face briefly before applying makeup works better to reduce pore size than using this product.</li>
            <li>This was my first primer I&#x27;d ever really gotten!</li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY FACE EXTREMELY SMOOTH AND REALLY SOFT.</li>
            <li>WHEN I PUT MY MAKEUP ON, IT SEEMS TO LAST LONGER :)</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this is the first primer I ever bought and used though.</li>
            <li>At first I used it before the foundation</li>
            <li>Love this product and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>put my moitureizer on my face first, then applied the Good-bye Pore-ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is almost exactly like the benefit primer.</li>
            <li>This item came on time even a little early and was packaged great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty cute, and the actual box it came in was very well cushioned.</li>
            <li>I have big pores and I&#x27;m always looking for low cost but good quality products and this product is both.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and I have an oily T-zone</li>
            <li>I use it everyday before I put my makeup on and totally love it!</li>
            <li>Throughout the day my makeup looks fine and my skin gets just a tiny bit oily (I have oily skin).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Asian makeup/skin care.</li>
            <li>The next day she called and told me that everyone said how fabulous she looked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Until then, thanks for letting me share my experience of this product and the company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a silicone pore filler so you won&#x27;t get that velvet smooth feel when putting it on put it does work to make them appear smaller.</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>Personally, the product does cover the look of pores and smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>This Pore Primer covers the pores on my nose really well.</li>
            <li>My makeup went on a whole lot smoother.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this primer!</li>
            <li>product for the money, which is very resonable...........</li>
            <li>Really has improved the way i apply makeup.</li>
            <li>but really I don&#x27;t think it covers pores that well.</li>
            <li>Not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;Liking it so far.. probably will finish out the tube and would most likely ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The product got here about a week earlier than expected, though it was still a good amount of wait</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like many other products out there.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, but this is the first one that actually seemed to work and especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>so I would definitely recommend trying it out, especially if you are venturing into good Asian</li>
            <li>Nice packaging, although it is a small tube</li>
            <li>It subdued my sebum production a little bit (as in, for the first few hours after makeup application), but not as nicely as I was hoping it would (lost effectiveness pretty quickly).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I used to live without this!</li>
            <li>Just lightly pat it into the skin where you need it and let it dry then apply makeup.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only 1/3 of the price, and personally I think this primer does a better job than the Benefit one</li>
            <li>work as a makeup artist and used this item 2 days ago on an older lady in her 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I AM OLDER, SO MY PORES HAVE ENLARGED AND</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker where suddenly my pores are magically gone and low and behold</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and bought some for my mother as well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an essential primer that really does smooth out my skin texture and helps my bb cream last longer without any oily looking skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not waxy and leaves skin soft and ready for foundation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First let me say that I am 53 years old and my pores are very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pores are really intense on my nose, I was hoping this product would just eliminate the look through my makeup completely</li>
            <li>My makeup looks so fresh especially having combination skin.</li>
            <li>The primer is slightly tinted as shown in the examples by the seller, but it easily blends into the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;No smell and quick to dry when applying on skin.</li>
            <li>One of my regrets is that I didn&#x27;t take better care of my skin, when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried to use foundation first, waited one minute for the foundation to dry, then apply this product, and it work very well.</li>
            <li>are pretty similar</li>
            <li>I use it under Holika Holika&#x27;s BB cream (my foundation), and it helps with the larger pores on my nose so much!</li>
            <li>Product worked well enough that I was willing to just deal with it.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at how it seems to fill in the fine lines and make less visible the deeper.  </li>
            <li>This product hides my pores completely!</li>
            <li>USED IT TODAY FOR FIRST TIME, SO I FIRST PUT IT ON HALF MY FACE</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for anyone that has large pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks and have noticed my pores are diminishing, the large ones are smaller, and the blackheads are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>but I am extremely sensitive to smells and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>It does make your face look noticeably smoother, though it won&#x27;t completely cover your pores.</li>
            <li>The skin feel sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and feels well on the face.</li>
            <li>And so far, no signs of breaking out (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this would have oil control as well, since my face is a grease-ball by the end of the day, but no such luck.</li>
            <li>I didnt really notice a big difference in my pores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin tho</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it really made my pores look smaller, especially on my nose.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend seller EMUNAH since they were very prompt at processing my order and my order arrived a week earlier than the earliest expected arrival date.</li>
            <li>I have VERY large pores on my nose...while they didn&#x27;t disappear, they were much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It works in making my face look smoother, especially in the t-zone, and the pores do look a bit more subtle.</li>
            <li>Someone younger or with just plain large pores would probably find that it works very well.  </li>
            <li>this was kind of silly for someone who almost never wears make-up but decided to give it a try and see what all the fuss was about.  </li>
            <li>I review primers on my website regularly and have tried out several brands from high to low end.</li>
            <li>Came fast with other samples inside</li>
            <li>(Personally I believe the only way to hide pores completely is using airbrushed foundation).</li>
            <li>Not sure if it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is because of this particular seller or due to</li>
            <li>It has a slightly matte finish, but not as much as some products making the matte claim.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly less greasy than the benefit version, and you get so much for such a lower price.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> Great but water based</li>

            <li> Make-up applies nicer with this and pores look good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> I read in the reviews that this produce was as good as Benefit Porefessional; it ins&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It has the palest of tints that are not noticeable on my fair skin and does not smear onto clothing like foundation.  </li>
            <li> Just want to try, the effect is good ÔºÅ</li>
            <li> It does a very good job minimizing pores and fine lines</li>
            <li> /&gt;It WAS well packaged, a VERY cute box with a face profile on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To top it off, the price is great.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this because I loved the name and the packaging (congratulations to the marketing department, you&#x27;ve won me over).</li>
            <li> MAKEUP WENT ON OVER IT, AS SMOOTH AS CAN BE!!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> The smell is very light and the good thing is that it goes away.</li>
            <li> Compared to some higher-end primers, I think Etude House holds its own.</li>
            <li> But if all the 5 star reviews made you think this was a spectacular find, I hope this review helps ground your expectations a bit.</li>
            <li> And just to be honest</li>
            <li> and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> It does not feel sticky on my face, and it has a nice finish when it dries.</li>
            <li> Maybe not as perfect as they claim it is, but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean fragrance and excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that this worked so great!</li>
            <li> Smooth, matte, and it feels good, too.  </li>
            <li> The company sent three samples for me to try and that was a nice bonus. : )&lt;</li>
            <li> Makes my face flawless without the shine and pores are instantly gone for a nice foundation finish</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth, it&#x27;s not oily, and spreads on well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I applied the moisturizer, then the Good-bye Pore-ever (it is a very light, pleasent scent)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good primer and allows my BB cushion to work to its full potential and make my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> love this pore filler - fills in large pores easily, great makeup primer as well.  </li>
            <li> Benefit works better for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the quality of the product and in my opinion, it is better than the</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is combination, I&#x27;m glad NOT to have the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> Packaged nicely, shipped on time and had a free sample and a lovely hand-written/hand-folded note inside.  </li>
            <li> I like using this on my nose &amp; cheeks where my pores are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> But it did smooth my skin out a bit, made applying foundation easier, and made my foundation look amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better</li>
            <li> Ok as a primer but didn&#x27;t diminish any of my pores.</li>
            <li> I am SO pleased with Etude&#x27;s dupe.</li>
            <li> The product works even better than Benefit&#x27;s in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You do need a bit more of the product (maybe a half-pea sized amount for each area you want to cover) but considering the price and size difference of the two products, I have no problem using a bit more.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more and more of this.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly at night, but also under my make-up...</li>
            <li> I really love this product and it works as soon</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product as it help my complexion look much better.  </li>
            <li> Once I run out, I&#x27;ll be sure to get another bottle. : )</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look and feel like satin - SO smooth!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I love this Primer..</li>
            <li> For the price, it works okay $18, but I found cheaper ones for about $10 but does not compare to Benefit&#x27;s Porefessional.</li>
            <li> I love beauty products, and this one I will use forever more.</li>
            <li> It even hides the shine in the T zone :)</li>
            <li> my foundation goes on much more smoothly on my nose and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;collect&amp;#34; in the pores like it did before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard it was a good dupe to Benefit&#x27;s Porefessional, and it&#x27;s much cheaper, so</li>
            <li> Its moisturizing keeping the skin smooth and the makeup will apply easily.</li>
            <li> Amazing product because I have a problem with large pores on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who feels their pores are too visible.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores around my nose and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It Primer (supposedly the no.1 selling primer in Korea) that I have been using in terms of oil control and how smoothly my makeup glides on.</li>
            <li> They also threw in some free samples with my order.</li>
            <li> That said, it does smooth out textures created by pores, so it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll use until it runs out.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT AND NOT GREASY FEELING.  </li>
            <li> This primer makes foundation go on so smoothly</li>
            <li> It also help any foundation to smooth on your skin like silk</li>
            <li> it smooth skins out though.</li>
            <li> It also smells light and refreshing,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have really big pores, which always show through my makeup, so I was happy when I found that this hid them so well.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and improves the look of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This primer does a fantastic job of minimizing the appearance of pores upon makeup application.</li>
            <li> went on smoothly</li>
            <li> same texture and feels great on skin .</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly onto your face and your pores does appear unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say if you want a good but cheap primer, try this!</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s perfect for everyday use though you might need something stronger for special events.</li>
            <li> I did find that it had a strong perfume smell (but not unpleasant)</li>
            <li> usually wear it under my BB cream and it looks great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now interested in more products by this brand.  </li>
            <li> As long as she was happy that&#x27;s all that mattered.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, it really keeps my skin looking clean and silky under makeup and gives me a semi-dewy look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to primers and have large pores, and after hearing good things from Etude House I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.</li>
            <li> What I really like is the smooth, no-slime texture!</li>
            <li> I put on the primer before anything else on my face and leave it to &#x27;settle&#x27; for a good ten minutes.</li>
            <li> As far as my pores go, yes, it DID fill them in and everything looked nice, even and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product offers a nice matte foundation, does seem to shrink pores.  </li>
            <li> skin breaks out pretty easily and have yet</li>
            <li> The product itself works well - feel good, smells good, lasts long, doesn&#x27;t cause outbreaks and my pores look much smaller.</li>
            <li> It also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super oily and runny.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t oily or slick, it was a very good consistency for my combination face.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as Benefit&#x27;s The PoreFESSIONAL, so the coverage isn&#x27;t quite as good and long lasting, but it&#x27;s very light and is wonderful for every day use.</li>
            <li> Has a very light scent that fades immediately (and I have a VERY sensitive sense of smell).  </li>
            <li> This primer does go on nicely - the texture is like that of most primers, making skin slightly slick to allow foundation to be blended and spread out easily.</li>
            <li> Love this small tube, my face is so bright and feel good all day long.  </li>
            <li> THIS MADE MY SKIN LOOK MUCH FRESHER!!  </li>
            <li> product itself works pretty well for me!</li>
            <li> It is light weight but really does not do the job.</li>
            <li> but now it seems more natural and allows for makeup to blend in more naturally.</li>
            <li> it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I use the primer after my moisturizer (which I use religiously, now) and my skin looks nice.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s expected to get it after a good while).</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the product thus far.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and leaves a soft, smooth finish that allows my favorite BB cream (Garnier) to glide on smoothly and last all day.  </li>
            <li> the smell is kinda flowery but the price is worth it considering the one from benefit is 30$</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the good reviews (see [...]</li>
            <li> Love the primer, it has a pleasant light scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very large pores</li>
            <li> Etude has a new loyal customer!</li>
            <li> I always put this product all over my face, and slightly more on my pores and you can barely see my pores.</li>
            <li> so it really works really good on my skin, leaving my pores closed.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly the same, but the Etude House product worked MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Rubbing an ice cube on my face briefly before applying makeup works better to reduce pore size than using this product.</li>
            <li> This was my first primer I&#x27;d ever really gotten!</li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY FACE EXTREMELY SMOOTH AND REALLY SOFT.</li>
            <li> WHEN I PUT MY MAKEUP ON, IT SEEMS TO LAST LONGER :)</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is the first primer I ever bought and used though.</li>
            <li> At first I used it before the foundation</li>
            <li> Love this product and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> put my moitureizer on my face first, then applied the Good-bye Pore-ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is almost exactly like the benefit primer.</li>
            <li> This item came on time even a little early and was packaged great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty cute, and the actual box it came in was very well cushioned.</li>
            <li> I have big pores and I&#x27;m always looking for low cost but good quality products and this product is both.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and I have an oily T-zone</li>
            <li> I use it everyday before I put my makeup on and totally love it!</li>
            <li> Throughout the day my makeup looks fine and my skin gets just a tiny bit oily (I have oily skin).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Asian makeup/skin care.</li>
            <li> The next day she called and told me that everyone said how fabulous she looked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until then, thanks for letting me share my experience of this product and the company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a silicone pore filler so you won&#x27;t get that velvet smooth feel when putting it on put it does work to make them appear smaller.</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> Personally, the product does cover the look of pores and smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> This Pore Primer covers the pores on my nose really well.</li>
            <li> My makeup went on a whole lot smoother.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this primer!</li>
            <li> product for the money, which is very resonable...........</li>
            <li> Really has improved the way i apply makeup.</li>
            <li> but really I don&#x27;t think it covers pores that well.</li>
            <li> Not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;Liking it so far.. probably will finish out the tube and would most likely ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The product got here about a week earlier than expected, though it was still a good amount of wait</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like many other products out there.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, but this is the first one that actually seemed to work and especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> so I would definitely recommend trying it out, especially if you are venturing into good Asian</li>
            <li> Nice packaging, although it is a small tube</li>
            <li> It subdued my sebum production a little bit (as in, for the first few hours after makeup application), but not as nicely as I was hoping it would (lost effectiveness pretty quickly).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I used to live without this!</li>
            <li> Just lightly pat it into the skin where you need it and let it dry then apply makeup.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only 1/3 of the price, and personally I think this primer does a better job than the Benefit one</li>
            <li> work as a makeup artist and used this item 2 days ago on an older lady in her 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I AM OLDER, SO MY PORES HAVE ENLARGED AND</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker where suddenly my pores are magically gone and low and behold</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and bought some for my mother as well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an essential primer that really does smooth out my skin texture and helps my bb cream last longer without any oily looking skin</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not waxy and leaves skin soft and ready for foundation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First let me say that I am 53 years old and my pores are very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pores are really intense on my nose, I was hoping this product would just eliminate the look through my makeup completely</li>
            <li> My makeup looks so fresh especially having combination skin.</li>
            <li> The primer is slightly tinted as shown in the examples by the seller, but it easily blends into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No smell and quick to dry when applying on skin.</li>
            <li> One of my regrets is that I didn&#x27;t take better care of my skin, when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried to use foundation first, waited one minute for the foundation to dry, then apply this product, and it work very well.</li>
            <li> are pretty similar</li>
            <li> I use it under Holika Holika&#x27;s BB cream (my foundation), and it helps with the larger pores on my nose so much!</li>
            <li> Product worked well enough that I was willing to just deal with it.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how it seems to fill in the fine lines and make less visible the deeper.  </li>
            <li> This product hides my pores completely!</li>
            <li> USED IT TODAY FOR FIRST TIME, SO I FIRST PUT IT ON HALF MY FACE</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for anyone that has large pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks and have noticed my pores are diminishing, the large ones are smaller, and the blackheads are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> but I am extremely sensitive to smells and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> It does make your face look noticeably smoother, though it won&#x27;t completely cover your pores.</li>
            <li> The skin feel sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and feels well on the face.</li>
            <li> And so far, no signs of breaking out (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this would have oil control as well, since my face is a grease-ball by the end of the day, but no such luck.</li>
            <li> I didnt really notice a big difference in my pores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin tho</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it really made my pores look smaller, especially on my nose.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend seller EMUNAH since they were very prompt at processing my order and my order arrived a week earlier than the earliest expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> I have VERY large pores on my nose...while they didn&#x27;t disappear, they were much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It works in making my face look smoother, especially in the t-zone, and the pores do look a bit more subtle.</li>
            <li> Someone younger or with just plain large pores would probably find that it works very well.  </li>
            <li> this was kind of silly for someone who almost never wears make-up but decided to give it a try and see what all the fuss was about.  </li>
            <li> I review primers on my website regularly and have tried out several brands from high to low end.</li>
            <li> Came fast with other samples inside</li>
            <li> (Personally I believe the only way to hide pores completely is using airbrushed foundation).</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was worth the wait</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is because of this particular seller or due to</li>
            <li> It has a slightly matte finish, but not as much as some products making the matte claim.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly less greasy than the benefit version, and you get so much for such a lower price.</li>
            <li> The tube is large and  you ONLY NEED A small amount</li>
            <li> so it will last A long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does the job as described, but makes my sking feel really oily and  almost like I have dead skin on my face... not a fun feeling or look</li>
            <li> Takes A LONG TIME TO ARRIVE.  </li>
            <li> slightly tinted but blends bare.  </li>
            <li> The primer doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> the way, I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> For the people who have dry or dry combination skin, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this works just as well on the dry areas of my face as well as my oily \\&quot;T-zone\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The texture is creamy and silky, unlike some primers which have that matte, dry silicone-like feel.</li>
            <li> &quot; long minus the cap),</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way, so the 20ml bottle will probably last you a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> You only need about the size of a pea, or less, to cover your face.</li>
            <li> Definitely made my pores less visible and would recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I applied just a bit on the center of her forehead, on her nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I expected it to glide on and create a buffer layer between foundation and skin in order to minimize lines and pores...</li>
            <li> not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and if you&#x27;re like me and have acne pit scars, layering the primer will help a lot.</li>
            <li> I usually use BB cream and feel like this product is very similar to that.</li>
            <li> I am really not sure iftere is a big difference with it or without it.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s on the other side of the world</li>
            <li> /&gt;The primer side of it made way for a very smoothe, soft base before applying my regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe because it is coming from the orient and has to go through customs and all other things that if bought in the USA it would not have to go through.</li>
            <li> I broke out more :(</li>
            <li> I found it to be creamy, non-oily, non-greasy and dry to the touch in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> They sent it a little late, but they did include a handwritten letter and a few random samples, which I found endearing.</li>
            <li> is thick white</li>
            <li> but it definately makes them way less</li>
            <li> and I find that I use less foundation because of this product.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry sticky but not sure about other reviews they must have very little pores</li>
            <li> I have lots of pores around my cheeks and some little ones around my nose.</li>
            <li> It looks a little peachy coming out but blends invisibly.</li>
            <li> I used it and it was a little to greasy for me.</li>
            <li> , I did NOT find it &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It comes off well with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li> I have terrible combination skin (mega oily in the t-zone and cheeks, and super dry on the chin/mouth area and eyes) and this served to sooth out both types.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> Yes, the tube is small (about 3\\</li>
            <li> maybe it works for making pores small but as a primer not at all</li>
            <li> I would say it takes at least nine hours for my BB cream to start smearing, and that&#x27;s a lot considering how oily my face is and the fact that i never wear powder.</li>
            <li> but it sucks I wouldnt even give it one star</li>
            <li> Goes on invisibly, texture is not too thick, not too runny.  </li>
            <li> It arrived a bit slow.</li>
            <li> this is not a good primer of</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve also had much, much worse.</li>
            <li> so therefore I was afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> But anyway its too bad there is no instructions coming wthbthe product how to put it on your face and when.</li>
            <li> too bad the writing is in Korean</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t work on me. Benefit works better for me.</li>
            <li> Great but water based</li>
            <li> Love this product it&#x27;s an essential primer that really does smooth out my skin texture and helps my bb cream last longer without any oily looking skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the good reviews (see [...] and I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Asian makeup/skin care. I was satisfied with the quality of the product and in my opinion, it is better than the The Faceshop Face It Primer (supposedly the no.1 selling primer in Korea) that I have been using in terms of oil control and how smoothly my makeup glides on. It does a very good job minimizing pores and fine lines but it&#x27;s not a miracle product (Personally I believe the only way to hide pores completely is using airbrushed foundation). It&#x27;s a great dupe for the Benefit POREfessional primer since the consistency and effects are pretty similar and it&#x27;s only 1/3 of the price, and personally I think this primer does a better job than the Benefit one so I would definitely recommend trying it out, especially if you are venturing into good Asian cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it does have fragrance or dimethicone so if you have allergies you should probably try out a sample first.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I highly recommend seller EMUNAH since they were very prompt at processing my order and my order arrived a week earlier than the earliest expected arrival date. They also threw in some free samples with my order.</li>
            <li> Got this earlier then estimated date given.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for aobut 2 weeks now. Not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;Liking it so far.. probably will finish out the tube and would most likely ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;My skin breaks out pretty easily and have yet o have an issue.&lt;br /&gt;No smell and quick to dry when applying on skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was worth the wait but it&#x27;s not too bad. It&#x27;s like many other products out there.</li>
            <li> Compared to some higher-end primers, I think Etude House holds its own. I review primers on my website regularly and have tried out several brands from high to low end. This one works and it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work as a makeup artist and used this item 2 days ago on an older lady in her 50&#x27;s. I applied just a bit on the center of her forehead, on her nose and chin. It smoothed out her pores fantastically and plus kept the area matte. The next day she called and told me that everyone said how fabulous she looked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this says a lot about the product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the shipping took forever. I don&#x27;t know if this is because of this particular seller or due to the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on doing an indepth review of the product on my website soon. Until then, thanks for letting me share my experience of this product and the company.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it under Holika Holika&#x27;s BB cream (my foundation), and it helps with the larger pores on my nose so much!</li>
            <li> Used this a handful of times now. Feels very nice of the skin. Make-up applies nicer with this and pores look good.</li>
            <li> This primer does go on nicely - the texture is like that of most primers, making skin slightly slick to allow foundation to be blended and spread out easily. It subdued my sebum production a little bit (as in, for the first few hours after makeup application), but not as nicely as I was hoping it would (lost effectiveness pretty quickly). For someone with oily skin, I would recommend continuing the search for a shine regulator. That said, it does smooth out textures created by pores, so it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll use until it runs out. But if all the 5 star reviews made you think this was a spectacular find, I hope this review helps ground your expectations a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its moisturizing keeping the skin smooth and the makeup will apply easily. I have lots of pores around my cheeks and some little ones around my nose. I always put this product all over my face, and slightly more on my pores and you can barely see my pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. Does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. I usually use BB cream and feel like this product is very similar to that. It goes on smooth and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a great primer.  Goes on invisibly, texture is not too thick, not too runny.  It has a slightly matte finish, but not as much as some products making the matte claim.  Since my skin is combination, I&#x27;m glad NOT to have the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; look.  What I really like is the smooth, no-slime texture!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised, great product. This product Works just as the shipper states it would work for all your makeup needs.</li>
            <li> I have VERY large pores on my nose...while they didn&#x27;t disappear, they were much less noticeable. Someone younger or with just plain large pores would probably find that it works very well.  I don&#x27;t know why there are varying comments about it&#x27;s texture.  I found it to be creamy, non-oily, non-greasy and dry to the touch in a few seconds. I did find that it had a strong perfume smell (but not unpleasant)..but I am extremely sensitive to smells and perfumes.  Product worked well enough that I was willing to just deal with it.  Very impressed with the seller also.  Packaged nicely, shipped on time and had a free sample and a lovely hand-written/hand-folded note inside.  THAT&#x27;s good customer service!  Would definitely buy product again, and would definitely buy from this seller.  FOLLOW-UP:::::Just bought some L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code Pore Vanisher to try.....paid $24.00 for it.  Looks exactly the same, but the Etude House product worked MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice now. It definitely helps my makeup stay on throughout the day. I would say it takes at least nine hours for my BB cream to start smearing, and that&#x27;s a lot considering how oily my face is and the fact that i never wear powder. It does make your face look noticeably smoother, though it won&#x27;t completely cover your pores. It also has never clogged my pores or aggravated my skin. I would say it&#x27;s perfect for everyday use though you might need something stronger for special events.</li>
            <li> USED IT TODAY FOR FIRST TIME, SO I FIRST PUT IT ON HALF MY FACE--BOY COULD I TELL THE DIFFERENCE!!  IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT AND NOT GREASY FEELING.  MAKEUP WENT ON OVER IT, AS SMOOTH AS CAN BE!!  I AM OLDER, SO MY PORES HAVE ENLARGED AND THIS MADE MY SKIN LOOK MUCH FRESHER!!  I&#x27;LL BE BUYING SOME FOR MY DAUGHTER AND MORE FOR ME!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I used to live without this! Makes my face flawless without the shine and pores are instantly gone for a nice foundation finish</li>
            <li> I am really not sure iftere is a big difference with it or without it. But anyway its too bad there is no instructions coming wthbthe product how to put it on your face and when.</li>
            <li> I am so happy.. I was thinking I have to use like a night cream, but I read and I can use before the make up... But I am using it and I don¬¥t need to use make up. The skin feel sooooooo soft. Thank u!</li>
            <li> I have big pores and I&#x27;m always looking for low cost but good quality products and this product is both. It doesn&#x27;t make my pore vanish but it definately makes them way less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the Etude House BB cream and the combination of both makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that this worked so great! I use it everyday before I put my makeup on and totally love it! I have a greasy olish type of skin so it really works really good on my skin, leaving my pores closed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to work as well as I hoped it would.  Rubbing an ice cube on my face briefly before applying makeup works better to reduce pore size than using this product.</li>
            <li> everything from etude house does what it says I swear, it&#x27;s not shiny/sparkly like some primers and doesn&#x27;t leave an off color finish like others. A must have for my beauty box.</li>
            <li> What a great product! Not as heavy as Benefit&#x27;s The PoreFESSIONAL, so the coverage isn&#x27;t quite as good and long lasting, but it&#x27;s very light and is wonderful for every day use. Fresh, clean fragrance and excellent coverage. Have seen some improvement of my skin&#x27;s overall appearance while using this product as well.</li>
            <li> This primer makes foundation go on so smoothly and it looks great but every time I wore it, I would break out and I usually don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> Love the primer, it has a pleasant light scent and a little goes a long way. It looks a little peachy coming out but blends invisibly. I like using this on my nose &amp; cheeks where my pores are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> This was my first primer I&#x27;d ever really gotten! I&#x27;d heard it was a good dupe to Benefit&#x27;s Porefessional, and it&#x27;s much cheaper, so I gave it a shot. It&#x27;s very smooth, it&#x27;s not oily, and spreads on well. You only need about the size of a pea, or less, to cover your face. I can&#x27;t say that it really made my pores look smaller, especially on my nose. But it did smooth my skin out a bit, made applying foundation easier, and made my foundation look amazing. It also had great staying power. Overall, I would say if you want a good but cheap primer, try this! I&#x27;ve had better but I&#x27;ve also had much, much worse. This wasn&#x27;t oily or slick, it was a very good consistency for my combination face.</li>
            <li> Love this small tube, my face is so bright and feel good all day long.  It&#x27;s covered all larges pores and make them invisible.  I would recommend for some one who, has oily skin</li>
            <li> I use it under my foundation and my pores noticeably disappeared compared to using the foundation without this.</li>
            <li> Ok as a primer but didn&#x27;t diminish any of my pores. Like you can still see them even after I have this and makeup on them.</li>
            <li> So I waited for ever for this to get to me but that&#x27;s because of an address mix up with amazon it&#x27;s self. And just to be honest it was worth it. I have huge pores around my nose and on my forehead. Which is where I apply this you can use it all over. It&#x27;s not a silicone pore filler so you won&#x27;t get that velvet smooth feel when putting it on put it does work to make them appear smaller. Just lightly pat it into the skin where you need it and let it dry then apply makeup. And you&#x27;ll give great face!!</li>
            <li> As a former Benefit Porefessional buyer. I am SO pleased with Etude&#x27;s dupe. The product works even better than Benefit&#x27;s in my opinion. The serum is lighter and I can feel it tightening my pores when applied. I don&#x27;t feel as cakey wearing it. You do need a bit more of the product (maybe a half-pea sized amount for each area you want to cover) but considering the price and size difference of the two products, I have no problem using a bit more. Etude has a new loyal customer!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, but this is the first one that actually seemed to work and especially for the price.  I am very impressed. I will be buying more and more of this. It also arrived quickly.So, I would have to give product and seller a AAA+++</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super oily and runny. It does nothing to cover pores. I would never buy and would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks and have noticed my pores are diminishing, the large ones are smaller, and the blackheads are almost completely gone.  I use it mostly at night, but also under my make-up...my foundation goes on much more smoothly on my nose and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;collect&amp;#34; in the pores like it did before.  I really love it!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product and it works as soon I as put it on</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product as it help my complexion look much better.  It also help any foundation to smooth on your skin like silk and I find that I use less foundation because of this product.  I will definitely buy again.  Good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;wowed.&amp;#34; I gave it three stars because I do see a bit of dirt on the cotton ball, even after I have cleansed my face. However, I purchased it for the pore minimizer effect and I see none whatsoever.</li>
            <li> ....or even 55!  One of my regrets is that I didn&#x27;t take better care of my skin, when I was younger.  As a consequence, I have enlarged pores in the T-section of my face. Thought getting this was kind of silly for someone who almost never wears make-up but decided to give it a try and see what all the fuss was about.  I use the primer after my moisturizer (which I use religiously, now) and my skin looks nice.  Smooth, matte, and it feels good, too.  When I do wear make-up, it looks especially nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and I&#x27;ll get it again.  It did take a while to arrive, so next time I&#x27;ll order two of them.</li>
            <li> Works for a couple hours but then my pores are visible again.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT. IT MAKES MY FACE EXTREMELY SMOOTH AND REALLY SOFT. WHEN I PUT MY MAKEUP ON, IT SEEMS TO LAST LONGER :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to primers and have large pores, and after hearing good things from Etude House I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. The product got here about a week earlier than expected, though it was still a good amount of wait (it&#x27;s on the other side of the world so it&#x27;s expected to get it after a good while). The packaging it&#x27;s pretty cute, and the actual box it came in was very well cushioned. The company sent three samples for me to try and that was a nice bonus. : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works pretty well for me! I have terrible combination skin (mega oily in the t-zone and cheeks, and super dry on the chin/mouth area and eyes) and this served to sooth out both types. It feels like a lotion, but it&#x27;s not oily. It&#x27;s not heavy and feels well on the face. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker where suddenly my pores are magically gone and low and behold I have Photoshop -esque skin. But! It works in making my face look smoother, especially in the t-zone, and the pores do look a bit more subtle. The primer is slightly tinted as shown in the examples by the seller, but it easily blends into the skin. I tried it on my tanner skin of my arms to see if it would make a difference in tint and it blended well as well. I put on the primer before anything else on my face and leave it to &#x27;settle&#x27; for a good ten minutes. It may seem like a lot to wait for, but I don&#x27;t want the primer to rub off or smear all over my face where it&#x27;s not needed when I put on my concealer. (I put the primer on and let it settle while I do my hair, so the wait doesn&#x27;t seem so tedious).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m a fan of the product. Compared to not using to currently using in my make up routine, it helps in making my skin appear smoother. The primer doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. It helps a bit in matting the t-zone, but after eight hour shifts of working and toiling at a day care for puppies, some shine does come through (but what wouldn&#x27;t with working up a sweat). It comes off well with plain soap and water.Once I run out, I&#x27;ll be sure to get another bottle. : )</li>
            <li> Personally, the product does cover the look of pores and smooth my skin. It also moisturizes my skin and does not make my foundation cakey.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have dry skin. For the people who have dry or dry combination skin, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use benefit pore fashanal was expecting this would be similar to benefit one since the price difference but it doesn&#x27;t fill my pore as I wanted. it smooth skins out though.</li>
            <li> If you can read Chinese than by all means get this item..so therefore I was afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> love this pore filler - fills in large pores easily, great makeup primer as well.  it&#x27;s not waxy and leaves skin soft and ready for foundation.  slightly tinted but blends bare.  non-oily so great for oily skin.  I will re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;SeoulGlamour is terrific to purchase from as well. Will purchase from them in the future.</li>
            <li> this is truly the best stuff ever.  its only been about 3 days and i dont have the big oil pit holes on my nose.  I am planning to buy the rest of the products from this company.  too bad the writing is in Korean</li>
            <li> I read in the reviews that this produce was as good as Benefit Porefessional; it ins&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This Pore Primer covers the pores on my nose really well. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or anything.&lt;br /&gt;It actually makes my skin feel smoother. It also smells light and refreshing,&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear it under my BB cream and it looks great! Love it! I would continue to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This item came on time even a little early and was packaged great. It works wonderful as does all their skin care products. They have always worked well and I would recommend everyone to try their products.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look and feel like satin - SO smooth!  It has the palest of tints that are not noticeable on my fair skin and does not smear onto clothing like foundation.  I am amazed at how it seems to fill in the fine lines and make less visible the deeper.  I&#x27;m now interested in more products by this brand.  Has a very light scent that fades immediately (and I have a VERY sensitive sense of smell).  The instructions are all in Korean since this is a high-end Korean brand.  LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product hides my pores completely! I have really big pores, which always show through my makeup, so I was happy when I found that this hid them so well. And so far, no signs of breaking out (I have sensitive skin). I was really hoping that this would have oil control as well, since my face is a grease-ball by the end of the day, but no such luck. If you&#x27;re looking for something to hide your pores, this is your product. If you&#x27;re looking for something for pores and oil control, keep looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and she really liked it. I used it and it was a little to greasy for me. As long as she was happy that&#x27;s all that mattered.</li>
            <li> This product does not cover pores like everyone is saying. It is light weight but really does not do the job.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and improves the look of my makeup.  I am really enjoying the product thus far.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They sent it a little late, but they did include a handwritten letter and a few random samples, which I found endearing. The product itself works well - feel good, smells good, lasts long, doesn&#x27;t cause outbreaks and my pores look much smaller. Maybe not as perfect as they claim it is, but it&#x27;s decent. Keep in mind that this is the first primer I ever bought and used though.</li>
            <li> Just want to try, the effect is good ÔºÅ&lt;br /&gt;The effect is very good. i recommended to use this ÔºÅ</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Creamy and smooth.  I have others that I have tried, though,  and that I prefer.  Gave this one to my sister.</li>
            <li> Definitely cover the pores just like the product description says. My makeup went on a whole lot smoother. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone that has large pores. It is a life saver!</li>
            <li> This product works great, does it&#x27;s job covering pores. Shipping took a while, but one concern is whether or not the product clog pores...</li>
            <li> This primer does a fantastic job of minimizing the appearance of pores upon makeup application. I have been using it for several weeks. It does not feel sticky on my face, and it has a nice finish when it dries. I use this product on my nose and the part of my forehead in the middle of the T-zone (between and slightly above the brows), which are my problem areas. I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who feels their pores are too visible. A little bit goes a LONG way, so the 20ml bottle will probably last you a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> At first I used it before the foundation and it was horrible. They just don&#x27;t mix well that way. Then I tried to use foundation first, waited one minute for the foundation to dry, then apply this product, and it work very well. Pores basically are invisible.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  I have combination skin and this works just as well on the dry areas of my face as well as my oily \\&quot;T-zone\\&quot;.  It goes on smoothly and leaves a soft, smooth finish that allows my favorite BB cream (Garnier) to glide on smoothly and last all day.  Poors are minimized and my skin looks like porcelain when I use this.  Yes, the tube is small (about 3\\&quot; long minus the cap), but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, it really keeps my skin looking clean and silky under makeup and gives me a semi-dewy look.&lt;br /&gt;I use a pea-sized amount and apply it to my T-zone area and cheeks. The smell is very light and the good thing is that it goes away. The texture is creamy and silky, unlike some primers which have that matte, dry silicone-like feel. Throughout the day my makeup looks fine and my skin gets just a tiny bit oily (I have oily skin). I highly recommend this primer!</li>
            <li> Works really great! My pores definitely look smaller with this on! Love this product and would definitely buy again! This is really similar to benefit&#x27;s porefessional.</li>
            <li> One of the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It arrived a bit slow., you can not trace it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It WAS well packaged, a VERY cute box with a face profile on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my moitureizer on my face first, then applied the Good-bye Pore-ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that I am 53 years old and my pores are very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I applied the moisturizer, then the Good-bye Pore-ever (it is a very light, pleasent scent) l it will fade though.&lt;br /&gt;It went on smoothly, I did NOT find it &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer side of it made way for a very smoothe, soft base before applying my regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My make up looked great!  a wonderful finishi!  As far as my pores go, yes, it DID fill them in and everything looked nice, even and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recomend this product?  Yes, I would.  The tube is large and  you ONLY NEED A small amount so it will last A long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product for the money, which is very resonable...........It just...Takes A LONG TIME TO ARRIVE.  Maybe because it is coming from the orient and has to go through customs and all other things that if bought in the USA it would not have to go through.</li>
            <li> I just got this today great texture and it doesn&#x27;t dry sticky but not sure about other reviews they must have very little pores I have very large pores and this did not cover them or even minimize them</li>
            <li> I have large pores and I have an oily T-zone but with this primer, my foundation stays put and lasts longer. A little goes a long way and if you&#x27;re like me and have acne pit scars, layering the primer will help a lot.</li>
            <li> I broke out more :( I wasted my money and it didnt work out as much as i thought it would. I think it is because of the type of skin i have.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought the benefit pore reduction primer, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good knock off and this is it! Surprisingly less greasy than the benefit version, and you get so much for such a lower price. Amazing product because I have a problem with large pores on my nose and cheeks. Highly recommend it and bought some for my mother as well</li>
            <li> My pores are really intense on my nose, I was hoping this product would just eliminate the look through my makeup completely but it still shows. This does help it a lot though from showing through my makeup. I do have to apply about three layers of it on my nose and let it set before I apply my makeup, but it does help.</li>
            <li> I love this Primer.. Definitely made my pores less visible and would recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> For the price, it works okay $18, but I found cheaper ones for about $10 but does not compare to Benefit&#x27;s Porefessional. I didnt really notice a big difference in my pores. 2 Stars because it is not supposed to be $18 and also it did not work too well.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I expected. Does the job as described, but makes my sking feel really oily and  almost like I have dead skin on my face... not a fun feeling or look</li>
            <li> This product did not do what it said it would do. Will not be buying anymore. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> this is almost exactly like the benefit primer. same texture and feels great on skin . the smell is kinda flowery but the price is worth it considering the one from benefit is 30$</li>
            <li> Work so well&lt;br /&gt;Love it! I will definitely purchased again.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter even borrowed it to use it because she likes it too.</li>
            <li> Really has improved the way i apply makeup. Before my foundation seemed all caked up on my skin but now it seems more natural and allows for makeup to blend in more naturally.</li>
            <li> I was amazed.  I love beauty products, and this one I will use forever more.</li>
            <li> This product offers a nice matte foundation, does seem to shrink pores.  Nice packaging, although it is a small tube and I wish I had ordered more!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this because I loved the name and the packaging (congratulations to the marketing department, you&#x27;ve won me over). But once I started using this, I noticed that indeed my big noticeable pores were &amp;#34;pore ever&amp;#34; gone. It&#x27;s a good primer and allows my BB cushion to work to its full potential and make my skin look flawless. To top it off, the price is great.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Great application for nose and pore problem areas. Can be worn under makeup to hide pores! My makeup looks so fresh especially having combination skin. It even hides the shine in the T zone :)</li>
            <li> It smells inoffensive and it feels moisturizing but really I don&#x27;t think it covers pores that well. I expected it to glide on and create a buffer layer between foundation and skin in order to minimize lines and pores... it did not do that thus the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Came fast with other samples inside but it sucks I wouldnt even give it one star if I didn&#x27;t have to write review this is not a good primer of is thick white an broke me out I have sensitive skin tho maybe it works for making pores small but as a primer not at all</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Scent is great!!! Glides on smoothly onto your face and your pores does appear unnoticeable. Will order again.</li>
            <li> It help cover my pore.</li>
