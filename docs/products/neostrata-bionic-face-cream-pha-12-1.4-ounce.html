            <li>I love it !!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>But Neo Strada is a great company.  </li>
            <li>Using it for years great stuff</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>My co-worker who has more problematic skin than I do started using it as well and within a couple weeks, her skin and complexion beautiful and flawless.  </li>
            <li>It has an amazing effect on your skin!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon price is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Truly my favorite face cream ever!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer feels great on your skin - smooth and not at all stciky or oily.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for years under the recommendation of my dermatologist and was fortunate to have found it online at a great price .</li>
            <li>Feels amazing.</li>
            <li>HIGH price prevents five stars... but excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the most sensitive skin on all areas of the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful but pricey and it has one major drawback, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product on amazon, and for a more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but it surely fixes problematic skin and prevents breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and when I ran out, as opposed to buying more I decided to go to my nearest CVS and pick up a light moisturizer, which in turn, wrecked havoc on my face again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin easily dries and flakes.</li>
            <li>I had previously tried a sample and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>All I can tell you is that my wife has been using this for about 10 years primarily as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Apply a small amount to a damp face to get the best application and absorption.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day and is non greasy and well worth the money</li>
            <li>recommended by  my doctor very gentle.</li>
            <li>My wife is convinced that this face cream  along with a high quality sun block keeps her face healthy and young looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise that you wait until the lotion sets first.  </li>
            <li>First recommended by my dermatologist about a year ago.</li>
            <li>Wish I had started using it when first suggested by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this for my fair, dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist approved broadly and delivers significant effect.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had so much as one blemish or pimple since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li>It plumps up your skin (must be keeping in the moisture) to a very youthful look.</li>
            <li>One tube will last you a couple months, however, you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot!  </li>
            <li>exactly what my Australian friend was looking for.</li>
            <li>Works well for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I did notice that some of my pores got smaller but did not see much of a change.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the priceyness is mitigated by the fact that you need only a very tiny amount and it distributes and gets absorbed effortlessly and immediately.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a face cream that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin but does the job.</li>
            <li>My skin has been so smooth since I started using it and my PIH is slowly disappearing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one of the few products that works for my sensitive skin.  I love it !!!!! and will continue to purchase...thank you !!!!!</li>
            <li> HIGH price prevents five stars... but excellent product.  Dermatologist approved broadly and delivers significant effect.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the texture of this product</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Even in the dry days of early winter, my face never gets dry and that is with using a Retinol product.  A bottle lasts a month and that is using it morning and evening.  Eventually, I have to cut the bottom of the plastic container to get every little bit out.</li>
            <li> Love it! Feels like silk.</li>
            <li> Works well for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago.  It usually retails about $55.00 but a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all.  It has an amazing effect on your skin!  I haven&#x27;t had so much as one blemish or pimple since I&#x27;ve started using it.  It goes well under make up.  I&#x27;d advise that you wait until the lotion sets first.  I use it twice daily and when I ran out, as opposed to buying more I decided to go to my nearest CVS and pick up a light moisturizer, which in turn, wrecked havoc on my face again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product on amazon, and for a more reasonable price.  One tube will last you a couple months, however, you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot!  But Neo Strada is a great company.  My co-worker who has more problematic skin than I do started using it as well and within a couple weeks, her skin and complexion beautiful and flawless.  I don&#x27;t know what is in this product but it surely fixes problematic skin and prevents breakouts.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff</li>
            <li> I finally found a face cream that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin but does the job. It plumps up your skin (must be keeping in the moisture) to a very youthful look. With continued use it lightens some dark spots (that was a plus) I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason. Back to the youthful part, you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great on your skin - smooth and not at all stciky or oily.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
            <li> exactly what my Australian friend was looking for.</li>
            <li> This was recommended several years ago by my dermatologist, who uses it herself.  It&#x27;s wonderful but pricey and it has one major drawback, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  It does not include any SPF factor.  There may be some chemical reason why, but when i use my Aveeno 30 SPF moisturizer I can just put it on and go.  Finally, the priceyness is mitigated by the fact that you need only a very tiny amount and it distributes and gets absorbed effortlessly and immediately.  Also, one of the few fragrance free products that doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Using it for years great stuff</li>
            <li> This cream seem to work well.  I did break out a little when I started using this.  I did notice that some of my pores got smaller but did not see much of a change.  The price is a little high for what the product does.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my fair, dry, sensitive skin. My skin easily dries and flakes. So hard to find something to keep it hydrated without looking greasy, etc. This does the trick! I apply it twice a day. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Apply a small amount to a damp face to get the best application and absorption. I use CeraVe as my cleanser before I apply this cream. They work well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon price is a good deal. My derm sells it for $50 a pop in her office.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years under the recommendation of my dermatologist and was fortunate to have found it online at a great price . Thank You !</li>
            <li> Truly my favorite face cream ever! My skin has been so smooth since I started using it and my PIH is slowly disappearing. Already on my second tube!</li>
            <li> All I can tell you is that my wife has been using this for about 10 years primarily as a moisturizer.  It was recommended by her cosmetic surgeon. My wife is convinced that this face cream  along with a high quality sun block keeps her face healthy and young looking.  I know this sounds like a commercial, but there is no way I could ever get her to stop using this stuff.</li>
            <li> recommended by  my doctor very gentle.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with redness having both lupus and rosacea.  After several weeks of using this product, my face is less red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> First recommended by my dermatologist about a year ago. I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin under my eyes with less than two weeks of daily use. I now use this cream (which has the consistency of Vaseline) regularly as my daily moisturizer. Perfect for the most sensitive skin on all areas of the face.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a sample and am very happy with the results.  Wish I had started using it when first suggested by my dermatologist.  Purchased two tubes to give one to my daughter.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love it. Feels amazing. Lasts all day and is non greasy and well worth the money</li>
