            <li>Acqua Di Gio for Men by Giorgio Armani is an outstanding cologne, and I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li>I had bought this perfume many without any problem ...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve used many times.</li>
            <li>Ladies love it.</li>
            <li>The cool thing about it is that its the kind of perfume that works well with any body pH; so even when others are wearing it, they will never smell quite like you.</li>
            <li>Muy husband is going to love it :) and the price is just right.</li>
            <li>I have a huge dong</li>
            <li>The scent it fresh, cool, and clean; yet masculine and warm.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Def not a fake!</li>
            <li>This gift set was a good deal compared to the department stores and I received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Acqua Di Gio for Men by Giorgio Armani has become my favorite cologne, because it is so invigorating when it is applied, and it has such a crisp and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Same classic scent and a nice additional travel bottle</li>
            <li>In general, I prefer cologne gift sets, because the smaller one-ounce bottle is perfect for traveling, since it occupies so little space in my carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I justo got this today, the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>We always get our fragrances through Amazon, always fast.</li>
            <li>so getting chicks hasn&#x27;t been much of a problem for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But if your short donged couple sprays of this and her thong slips right off.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne ever, I turned my husband on to it years ago and he hardly wears anything else now.</li>
            <li>He was surprised by a &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; gift, but likes it now.</li>

            <li> In addition, with a cologne gift set, the price per ounce is usually lower than it would be with the purchase of a single bottle of the cologne.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle cologne, but yet it lasts for the entire work day.</li>
            <li> And a spritz or two goes a long way even late in the day.</li>
            <li> Smell not longer and the bottle not good it was broken</li>

            <li> Great cologne! Def not a fake!</li>
            <li> Does not smell like Gio at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure if real or not.  Smells the same but does not last..........</li>
            <li> Don know why... I had bought this perfume many without any problem ... But this time I met it... Smell not longer and the bottle not good it was broken</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, this cologne is as nice as he is. I&#x27;ll buy this again. Love it. Oh yeah, he likes it too.</li>
            <li> Great price, reasonable shipping time and the product was excellent quality! Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> Acqua Di Gio has been my signature cologne since July 1999. And the price has not dropped during that time--which is testament to the staying power of Gio. The scent it fresh, cool, and clean; yet masculine and warm. And a spritz or two goes a long way even late in the day. For that matter, too much can be off-putting, but this cologne never gets tiring (at least according to the ladies&#x27; comments). The cool thing about it is that its the kind of perfume that works well with any body pH; so even when others are wearing it, they will never smell quite like you. Kudos to Armani on this one.</li>
            <li> Great offer on a qualified product.</li>
            <li> We always get our fragrances through Amazon, always fast. and best price, I love this scent on my husband, it smells clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> This will be my go to person for any fragrance! Quick shipping. Exactly what I purchased and a few surprise samples thrown in the box!  What a treat. Great communication. Will do business again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> I love to smell this on my man! He was surprised by a &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; gift, but likes it now. The travel size is nice.</li>
            <li> I get nothing but compliments. Girls every day come sniff my neck and oooh about how good i smell.This stuff smells great. I have a huge dong so getting chicks hasn&#x27;t been much of a problem for me. But if your short donged couple sprays of this and her thong slips right off.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and doesnt break the bank. I get compliments almost every day when I have it on. Ladies love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne ever, I turned my husband on to it years ago and he hardly wears anything else now. This gift set was a good deal compared to the department stores and I received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Amazing Price and FAST shipping!!!!</li>
