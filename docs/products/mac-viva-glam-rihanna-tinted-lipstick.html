            <li> This was advertized as a color that would look good on any complexion and one of Rhiana&#x27;s favorite lipsticks.  Dude, it is purply-gray and an absolutely hideous color unless you are a person of color.  And even that I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> Am a Brown skin person and this color looks gorgeous in my skin. Recommend anyone to purchase it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described; very happy!</li>
            <li> Love this MAC!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome lipstick just a little darker than what I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> Shipping price is ridiculous. And I hope MAC releases this again. I really wanted this color as gifts for my bridesmaids but 4.99 to ship and the box looked like it had been opened a lot but it didn&#x27;t looked used so I kept it and I REFUSED to pay for shipping it back</li>
            <li> Hate it color is not as expected. Supposed to be bronze and its bight red!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very satisfied</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous color -- I&#x27;ve been looking, for some time, for the perfect shade of silver/brown, and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;It also lasts very well.  And it works great mixed with other shades too.  One of my favorite new lipsticks, definitely.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Great transaction!</li>
            <li> By far my favorite MAC color and I&#x27;m an avid MAC lipstick user!!  My only complaint is that it was a limited time color and now it&#x27;s very difficult to find anywhere.  I&#x27;ve almost had to pay double the regular purchase price since it can only be purchased on line through Amazon. With that said, I will continue to  order this color as long as it is being offered since I love it that much.</li>
            <li> I love the color!!!! I&#x27;ve worn it everyday since I received it and very happy I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick!!!</li>
            <li> Love this color.  And it works with all shades of skin complexion.... Will order again...</li>
            <li> Lovely color great for fall/ winter. A bit pricey wish I would&#x27;ve made it to the Mac counter before it sold out.</li>
            <li> Love this color, should complement whatever your underlying skin tone may be. Color is as shown in photo, shimmer with hint of deep bronze and/or cocoa underneath. Feels smooth and light on lip, not too heavy. Doesn&#x27;t feather. Highly recommend, this is a unique color, worth the $. Regarding shipping, the lipstick arrived in new condition with original black and red packaging, and extra wrap for protection of product during shipment.</li>
            <li> Pretty shade. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great lipstick color. I wish I purchased it before it was discontinued. The product I received was exactly what I expected. Thank you! Totally worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lipstick. Love the applicator and it works well on brown skin.</li>
