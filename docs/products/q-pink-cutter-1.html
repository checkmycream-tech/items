            <li>Still learning how to get the technique down, but very happy to have it.</li>
            <li>i think it will work just fine (once my nails come</li>
            <li>The quality is not what I wanted--its cheap</li>
            <li>It has lots of sizes to fit just about every size nail</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t use this much.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li>Leaves clean lines once you figure out what size you need for each nail.</li>
            <li>and it is a miracle tool when doing a French tip a great guide to pretty tips .</li>
            <li>Your acrylic need to stay sifter longer to be able to remove the excess, mine is fast drying</li>
            <li>Definitely need this for doing perfect white tips.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for creating fast smile lines.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, what you see is what you get.</li>
            <li>Perfect for french tip white or any color you want!</li>
            <li>I use this in my shop daily and love it!</li>
            <li>wonderful tool, makes doing pink and white acrylics alot easier!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to spend time shaping the smile line in my nails anymore.</li>
            <li>Perfect for doing pink and white nails.</li>
            <li>I had my nails done for the first time a few months back--they used a tool similar to this one to make the perfect smile curve.  </li>
            <li>I love it..very easy to cut and sharp too..</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Came super fast and helps you to build the nails super fast.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what i had been looking for.</li>
            <li>My first time using it was a charm</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was plastic</li>
            <li>Hmmmmm wish me luck!!!;)</li>
            <li>I used this a cutter tool when I first started nails</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, nicely cut &#x3D; sharp.</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying the other ones that kind of look like and measuring cups have a stack on top of each other</li>
            <li>I decided that I could do my own nails, and purchased this little gadget for myself.  </li>
            <li>It makes doing acrylic nails at home so much faster and easier.  </li>
            <li>Not too much to say about it</li>
            <li>SO IT DOESNT COME OUT VERY CLEAN,BUT THIS PRODUCT IS SO HELPFUL</li>
            <li>My daughter and I started doing our own acrylic nails a few months ago</li>
            <li>Have to have the right tools to do a professional job.  </li>
            <li>I love my pink cutters!  </li>
            <li>Good its a little expensive but its good(:</li>
            <li>It will make pink &amp; whites look even and look even more professional.</li>
            <li>I apply my pink acrylic and then cut the smile line in with this handy little tool.</li>
            <li>an does not cut the acrylic in a nice moon shape , it looks real choppy .</li>
            <li>this simple little item is awesome for doing pink and white acrylic.  </li>
            <li>Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li>I make my own smile lines and it&#x27;s harder for me to switch to doing the pink first on a pink and white set.</li>
            <li>It is pricey but you only have to purchase it once, and it really is a time saver.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>As far as the price goes, all the other cutters are twice as much!</li>
            <li>For DIY it&#x27;s easier doing the pink first, instead of the white, like at salons.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money..not worth it.</li>
            <li>Talk about cutting your acrylic application in half (pun intended) its a great, easy to use little tool I wish I had found sooner!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really difficult to use especially if you&#x27;re doing your own nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I use this right or not</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I use this right or not</li>
            <li> I use it with tips that are already designed and use clear and pink!</li>
            <li> This item is so small and light that it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
            <li> had been looking for one of these for so long and couldnt be happier that I found it</li>
            <li> I would recommend this nail tool to anyone that likes pink and white nails.</li>
            <li> Product arrived a few days early, which was awsome.</li>
            <li> Works well, but did expect a little better cutting.</li>
            <li> not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product came before expected time and that&#x27;s a plus for me.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.</li>
            <li> other than that, 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Thinking of trying out some other shapes and lines that can be created throughout the nail.</li>
            <li> I really had a difficult time.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before, I found it difficult to use and am not sure I am using it right.</li>
            <li> A little to sharp for my taste</li>
            <li> Novel little tool.</li>
            <li> This little tool works like a charm.</li>
            <li> and not like the ones I see here in the shops .. waste of money ..</li>
            <li> if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just very odd</li>
            <li> Total disappointment.</li>
            <li> and when I did I had such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get a slow set powder to try that.</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side for what it is.</li>
            <li> too expensive for its use.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this tool.</li>

            <li> not what I expected. Total disappointment. and not like the ones I see here in the shops .. waste of money ..</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, nicely cut &#x3D; sharp.</li>
            <li> sturdy durable metal. i think it will work just fine (once my nails come that I ordered 1.5 months ago???)</li>
            <li> Very happy I found the Q-pink cutter online, I had looked at many stores but couldn&#x27;t find one in any beauty supply store</li>
            <li> A very handy tool for the job. It will make pink &amp; whites look even and look even more professional.</li>
            <li> Give the perfect smile for nail in two tone acrylic nails. Love how easy and fast can be use, the size are perfect, it&#x27;s really a great alternative if you&#x27;re having problems making smiles when making you own or other nails.</li>
            <li> Novel little tool. Where were you when I needed you all these years. This little tool works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before, I found it difficult to use and am not sure I am using it right. I have seen them used many times, I&#x27;ll try it once more before I give up.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, exactly what i expected. A little on the expensive side for what it is. But I think it will pay for itself really quickly!!</li>
            <li> Definitely need this for doing perfect white tips. So much more difficult without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had seen someone in a nail salon using it and it made their smile line perfect. I was so excited to use it and when I did I had such a disappointment. It doesn&#x27;t remove the acrylic. you have to sit there and keep scraping off the acrylic</li>
            <li> had been looking for one of these for so long and couldnt be happier that I found it</li>
            <li> I will never have short nail beds again! Talk about cutting your acrylic application in half (pun intended) its a great, easy to use little tool I wish I had found sooner!</li>
            <li> Excellent tool. Thanks for sending so quickly.  I appreciate getting it on time, and appreciate the great condition it was in.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It makes doing acrylic nails at home so much faster and easier.  I don&#x27;t have to spend time shaping the smile line in my nails anymore.</li>
            <li> I love it, it gives you that perfect French curve. Saves on products and time. Every ball tech should have one.</li>
            <li> I had my nails done for the first time a few months back--they used a tool similar to this one to make the perfect smile curve.  I decided that I could do my own nails, and purchased this little gadget for myself.  I&#x27;ve switched to gel nails since--but if I ever go back to acrylics, I&#x27;ll be happy to have this gadget on hand to make the perfect curve.</li>
            <li> The best tool for make a full set aceylic nails. Came super fast and helps you to build the nails super fast.</li>
            <li> too expensive for its use. I wish I had not purchased this...I could have used my money on something else...With practice and patience, I now make my smiles perfect. I wasn&#x27;t able to use the q-pink. I really had a difficult time. Don&#x27;t waste your money..not worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent everything! I love this thing! I would recommend this nail tool to anyone that likes pink and white nails.</li>
            <li> It was a really good idea and thought that went into making this but it&#x27;s really difficult to use especially if you&#x27;re doing your own nails let alone somebody else&#x27;s I would suggest buying the other ones that kind of look like and measuring cups have a stack on top of each other I&#x27;m going to try those</li>
            <li> does the job!!  no problems with it..this simple little item is awesome for doing pink and white acrylic.  I use it with tips that are already designed and use clear and pink!</li>
            <li> It is a good Ã­tem for My wife</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was packaged well.  It feels sturdy, no dents or bends in it, I&#x27;m very happy with product.  Makes great smile lines - no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This product came before expected time and that&#x27;s a plus for me. It worked as seen on reviews. My first time using it was a charm and it&#x27;s very handy if you still can&#x27;t get your smile lines right on your own yet.</li>
            <li> It is what it is! Not too much to say about it</li>
            <li> Received today love it.</li>
            <li> This item is so small and light that it&#x27;s hard to use. At first, I thought it was plastic but it is metal. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Great tool for doing acrylics, makes it so much easier.  A little to sharp for my taste given that you use it close to the skin, but, other than that, 4 stars.  Came to me without alot of delay in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> Good its a little expensive but its good(:</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes for a perfect smile line. Product arrived a few days early, which was awsome. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again. Thinking of trying out some other shapes and lines that can be created throughout the nail. Hmmmmm wish me luck!!!;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I use this right or not but it&#x27;s just very odd an does not cut the acrylic in a nice moon shape , it looks real choppy . Like I said could be just me .</li>
            <li> I used this a cutter tool when I first started nails and it is a miracle tool when doing a French tip a great guide to pretty tips . Anytime I want French tips I use this</li>
            <li> I love it..very easy to cut and sharp too..the shape is excellent..believe me..</li>
            <li> i love to do my own nails and this is an awesome item for those who like to do thier own nails or even a nail shop.</li>
            <li> well this was a gift for a friend of mine and she is happy for this useful tool.</li>
            <li> Works well, but did expect a little better cutting. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t fully cut thought as it should.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does it&#x27;s job though.</li>
            <li> Works just as it should!</li>
            <li> great price and really easy to use. Perfect for doing pink and white nails. this saved me lots of money!</li>
            <li> Have to have the right tools to do a professional job.  Still learning how to get the technique down, but very happy to have it.</li>
            <li> The quality is not what I wanted--its cheap</li>
            <li> I love this product for creating fast smile lines. I apply my pink acrylic and then cut the smile line in with this handy little tool. It is pricey but you only have to purchase it once, and it really is a time saver.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I started doing our own acrylic nails a few months ago and I wish I had seen this tool sooner!! For DIY it&#x27;s easier doing the pink first, instead of the white, like at salons. So when I saw this, I bought  one immediately and it makes the job possible. I was too nervous to try acrylic pink and whites before, but now with this handy tool, I can count on them coming out perfect and easy each time!! As far as the price goes, all the other cutters are twice as much!</li>
            <li> I had one of these cutters before so it was just a replacement. But it does what I need it to do when applying 2-colored L&amp;P.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect! It do the job and its simple to used! U will get nice and clean lines.</li>
            <li> Loved this tool now I can have multi colors with a straight line</li>
            <li> takes some getting used to but it is a great tool, with time and practice it will make things much easier</li>
            <li> A bit flimsy....hopefully will hold up.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, what you see is what you get.</li>
            <li> Perfect for french tip white or any color you want!</li>
            <li> This is best tool ever! Makes perfect crisp smile lines with no fuss at all! I just did my best french mani ever with it! LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best tool yet for Acrylic Nails... I am going to get the french v cut next. You cant go wrong with this tool. Speedy service from where it came from as well.</li>
            <li> Small...fits inside palm....fits all my fingers. I even tried my big toe out of curiosity. ...Perfect! !!</li>
            <li> Performs it&#x27;s purpose. Not much else to say. Leaves clean lines once you figure out what size you need for each nail.</li>
            <li> I tried using this after reading some reviews but I still haven&#x27;t quite got the hang of it yet. It has lots of sizes to fit just about every size nail so that isn&#x27;t an issue. I make my own smile lines and it&#x27;s harder for me to switch to doing the pink first on a pink and white set. It&#x27;s just a matter of time and I&#x27;m sure I will be pleased with it. Your acrylic need to stay sifter longer to be able to remove the excess, mine is fast drying so that&#x27;s my problem. I&#x27;m going to get a slow set powder to try that.</li>
            <li> I am a self taught nail enthusiast and I honestly don&#x27;t use this much.  There is an art of how to use this and I haven&#x27;t quite got it yet even thought it is the simplest of tools. I will update my review once I start using it more.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.</li>
            <li> I love my pink cutters!  It is exactly as described and I am very happy using this when doing acrylics.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS OK, A COUPLE OF THE NUMBERS HAVE A SNAG SO IT DOESNT COME OUT VERY CLEAN,BUT THIS PRODUCT IS SO HELPFUL</li>
