            <li>The slip is amazing, and definition it gives is banging!</li>
            <li>Almost perfect if the scent wasn&#x27;t so strong.  </li>

            <li>WELL, TO EACH HIS OWN.</li>
            <li>Cost effective.</li>
            <li>The picture was kind of misleading.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for natural hair</li>
            <li>Love this is the best hair product for natural hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and no gressy.</li>
            <li>,  no nasty gel stuck on my hands, tons of shine.  </li>
            <li>I love my hair...</li>
            <li>And you will love yours too....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>TO MENTION THE OVERWHELMING PERFUME SMELL...</li>
            <li>You will love this product.  </li>
            <li>When I use Ecostyler gel, I am able to define my curls.</li>
            <li>OMG, I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>Yes I love the smell, however I am around too many people with sensitivities to smells.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It works better if I use the shingle method.</li>
            <li>; products and I am enjoying the definition it has brought to my curls/coils.</li>
            <li>have combo 4b/c hair and my daughter has more 4c than she does 4b.  </li>
            <li>so you understand that achieving a wash and go can be challenging on our hair and yet we can achieve it.  </li>
            <li>I love the look.  </li>
            <li>I like shrinkage and enjoyed watching my hair shrink during the work day.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea that my curls could look so cute and defined.</li>
            <li>I love AS I AM products, this is quite gooey though.  </li>
            <li>and I love them all.</li>
            <li>It also smells lovely which is always a plus to my hair regimen.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this jelly.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Love the smell, not too sticky and not too runny.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly as it claims!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly a relief to cowash to get clean hair, no build up, apply this product and go.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s probably good for those curl sets where you normally use some kind of gel as opposed to just using for a twist out like I did.</li>
            <li>This curling jelly is amazing; it is easy to apply, light on the hair, and creates a shine on my hair with no flaking or frizz.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I put a light amount of curling jelly on top.</li>
            <li>Good part is you don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>gave it four stars because of the price, but I&#x27;m cheap as far as hair products go since I always manage to find good products, decently sized for a good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I tried this product, especially since it&#x27;s silicone and sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Great for wash and gos and for slicked back styles.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once but happy with my curls after my twist out.</li>
            <li>The products I used were great, but my hair would be super frizzy after only a couple days.</li>
            <li>As I Am Cowash and immediately fell in love after the first use.  </li>
            <li>style was easy to do and fun to wear.</li>
            <li>This product was gummy and it did not do well on my clean hair or my grandsons hair either</li>
            <li>It gets 2 starts for smelling lovely and being natural, but it doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as drugstore gel for keeping frizzies away and making good curls (I am caucasian with 3b/c curls)</li>
            <li>I love the As I am double butter!! :-)</li>
            <li>It also leaves a nice shiny look and does not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>It smells good too - but take a while to dry.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a light hold, but adds so much definition.</li>
            <li>Instead it looks shiny, soft and my curls are more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use some good oil like emu or coconut, something really thick before applying this product.  </li>
            <li>:) It really works very well, as well as everyone else has said.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I clean my hair with Giovanni smooth as silk, apply a dollop of kinky curly knot today mixed with a couple squirts of argan oil, and then a light gloss of curling  jelly.</li>
            <li>have been searching for years for the right product to moisturize, hold and define my curls without being too greasy or too drying.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hold.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better experience with Eco Styler, and you get much more for way less.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I will say is that the Kinky Curly custard has more hold than the Curling jelly does.</li>
            <li>This product defines my curls so much better than Kinky Kurly, plus there is no residue left over</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want your hair air drying and tripping with this stuff for hours because you caked on too much!</li>
            <li>the As I Am Cowash, these products are moisture rich and made my hair soft and curly.</li>
            <li>The great thing about the Curling Jelly in particular is that it&#x27;s hard to use too much.  </li>
            <li>Mine is very low, (doesn&#x27;t absorb moisture/products easily)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky; preferably it would have no silicones, water solubility, natural ingredients, good texture, no build up, hold curl for at least two days, provide shine and play nicely with my keratin treatment and other products.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>sticky and dries crunchy; didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>So if you are wearing a hat most of the day like the military does I would go with the Kinky Curly.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Olive Oil Eco Styler gel when it was much shorter.  </li>
            <li>too much product can cause flaking.  </li>
            <li>It really defines my curls.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is very curl-enducing, but it does cause some dryness and crunchiness.  </li>
            <li>But as my hair lengthened it did absolutely nothing to define my coils.</li>
            <li>but I definitely expected better.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to give my hair more definition for a longer period of time, but keep my hair soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>Seems to be ok - not as much definition as i would have expected.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product just a bit pricey for me to generally use it for curling my ponytails when there is humidity.  </li>
            <li>Highly porous naturally, so more on the dry side.</li>
            <li>Straight curly on the top, curly straight on the sides and at my back hairline and fine frizzy in the center back.  </li>
            <li>paired with the leave in gives me GREAT hair days and multiple day hair as long as my hair is 100% percent dry before manipulating/sleeping on it.</li>
            <li>I have several different textures and this worked beautifully on my curly and wavy sections but less so on the kinky prone to frizzy areas.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It is also not thick and greasy</li>
            <li>I am biracial with natural 3c curls that I loosen with a DIY keratin treatment to a 3a/b-ish curl (once a month, 275 degrees to avoid heat damage and maintain curl) to make my hair more manageable and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The jar is just not user friendly and makes application more difficult than it needs to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the natural hair scene, so I bought this product after a friend let me borrow hers.</li>
            <li>I suspect that this is due to the super moisturizing ingredients in all of these products.  </li>
            <li>This product  gives more definition and shape without making hair sticky or hard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn my hair natural and have worn it cut</li>
            <li>Soft curls, no crunch</li>
            <li>I can say, is WOW.  </li>
            <li>Anybody thats struggling to control their natural hair</li>
            <li>All my natural sista&#x27;s out there do not hesitate, buy it now.  </li>
            <li>Contains natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for 2 years this month</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair soft while helping the curl texture.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and this product helps enhance the curls.</li>
            <li>Coils remained soft and yes I touch my hair with no problems.  </li>
            <li>So far this jell has not irritated my scalp .</li>
            <li>I purchased this gel after reading a post about it on a natural hair blog.</li>
            <li>A little trial and error may be needed to get the right balance for your particular hair.</li>
            <li>I have type 3a hair and live in a very dry climate and this whole line works wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and just a little bit on my hair, currently rocking a tapered twa cut, have kinky-curly (some parts smooth, some frizzy) coils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect, and though the size is a little bit small, it should last me considering how little is needed!</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft, shiny and extra curly.  </li>
            <li>but I am really please with this hair product along with alot of the other</li>
            <li>As a caucasian woman, I used to steer clear of the hair products that were marketed towards African American people.  </li>
            <li>My hair is softer, more manageable and less frizzy after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m african american 5 months natural with 4a and 4b hair type</li>
            <li>and it moisturizes not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>I have 3c natural hair, and it made my hair  very defined but stiff.</li>
            <li>This worked well on my short and long natural hair styles.  </li>
            <li>It really brings out the curl definition of my hair without flaking up like some other products, nor does it dry out my hair.</li>

            <li> I like this product because it is very curl-enducing, but it does cause some dryness and crunchiness.  </li>
            <li> But as my hair lengthened it did absolutely nothing to define my coils.</li>
            <li> but I definitely expected better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to give my hair more definition for a longer period of time, but keep my hair soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> Seems to be ok - not as much definition as i would have expected.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product just a bit pricey for me to generally use it for curling my ponytails when there is humidity.  </li>
            <li> Highly porous naturally, so more on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Straight curly on the top, curly straight on the sides and at my back hairline and fine frizzy in the center back.  </li>
            <li> paired with the leave in gives me GREAT hair days and multiple day hair as long as my hair is 100% percent dry before manipulating/sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> I have several different textures and this worked beautifully on my curly and wavy sections but less so on the kinky prone to frizzy areas.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> It is also not thick and greasy</li>
            <li> I am biracial with natural 3c curls that I loosen with a DIY keratin treatment to a 3a/b-ish curl (once a month, 275 degrees to avoid heat damage and maintain curl) to make my hair more manageable and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The jar is just not user friendly and makes application more difficult than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the natural hair scene, so I bought this product after a friend let me borrow hers.</li>
            <li> I suspect that this is due to the super moisturizing ingredients in all of these products.  </li>
            <li> This product  gives more definition and shape without making hair sticky or hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn my hair natural and have worn it cut</li>
            <li> Soft curls, no crunch</li>
            <li> I can say, is WOW.  </li>
            <li> Anybody thats struggling to control their natural hair</li>
            <li> All my natural sista&#x27;s out there do not hesitate, buy it now.  </li>
            <li> Contains natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 2 years this month</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft while helping the curl texture.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and this product helps enhance the curls.</li>
            <li> Coils remained soft and yes I touch my hair with no problems.  </li>
            <li> So far this jell has not irritated my scalp .</li>
            <li> I purchased this gel after reading a post about it on a natural hair blog.</li>
            <li> A little trial and error may be needed to get the right balance for your particular hair.</li>
            <li> I have type 3a hair and live in a very dry climate and this whole line works wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and just a little bit on my hair, currently rocking a tapered twa cut, have kinky-curly (some parts smooth, some frizzy) coils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, and though the size is a little bit small, it should last me considering how little is needed!</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft, shiny and extra curly.  </li>
            <li> but I am really please with this hair product along with alot of the other</li>
            <li> As a caucasian woman, I used to steer clear of the hair products that were marketed towards African American people.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer, more manageable and less frizzy after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african american 5 months natural with 4a and 4b hair type</li>
            <li> and it moisturizes not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I have 3c natural hair, and it made my hair  very defined but stiff.</li>
            <li> This worked well on my short and long natural hair styles.  </li>
            <li> It really brings out the curl definition of my hair without flaking up like some other products, nor does it dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I like a combo of slightly frizzy hair with the high shine</li>
            <li> I even have a little shine, which is not something I normally associate with my curls nor care about really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has changed in texture over the years, probably as a result of coloring, flat ironing, and so on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a great product, it&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li> If you use way much it makes my hair hard, and the product flakes up big time,  </li>
            <li> I have shelled out major money on Bumble and Bumble, TIGI Curls Rock/ Curlesque, Deva Curl, Ouidad, and other pricy products.  </li>
            <li> No major frizz.  </li>
            <li> : The product turns white until dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still very defined and not nearly as frizzy as it usually would be.</li>
            <li> This product worked, though not great, when I first big chopped.</li>
            <li> It made the hair a little dry but soft.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my hair wet, I tried to used it with my hair dry, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same result.</li>
            <li> I really like it because it does give a little extra time before your hair gets hard to style it and make a change if necessary.</li>
            <li> I have type 4a hair that is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> I will say, unlike the eco styler, there is no crunchiness once the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> But be careful.  </li>
            <li> the As I Am leave-in conditioner, wet and apply the Curling Jelly and then section my hair to define the curls.  </li>
            <li> While still wet with leave in, apply the gel using the shingle method.  </li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be</li>
            <li> Plain and simple it works</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Just remember, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been natural since 1996 and finding products that actually work on my tightly coiled hair has been an exhausting search.  </li>
            <li> ignore the other review i wrote...</li>
            <li> Warning - a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product tends to dry the hair a little bit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it worked really well, but as hair started to grow, my curl pattern started to change.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it was much too expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> This product is the stand out for me hands down, and I had no expectations of it at all since I&#x27;m an Eco styler crystal girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use just a little on the ends when my hair is wet and twist it just a little</li>
            <li> This may be one of my &amp;#34;luxury buys&amp;#34; for my hair, still have a little sample of this on hand</li>
            <li> This morning I was probably a little too generous with this product and my hair still doesn&#x27;t look crunchy.</li>
            <li> It feels a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair a little too crunchy for my liking AND you need to purchase a leave in conditioner to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these products to ANYONE who has coarse curly thick hair!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF ALONG WITH THE GEL MADE MY VERY COARSE, VERY THICK LONG HAIR VERY ANGRY :</li>
            <li> /&gt;After slugging through sticky, drying gels, greasy creams and flaky, dull build up for years, this product feels like the holy grail.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m having a hard time finding that balance.</li>
            <li> I have never had flakes nor hard hair with this gel.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and napp...</li>
            <li> Our curls are very small coils ranging in size from the spring of a ball point pen (or the size of the lead in a pencil) to the outer side of the pen (or pencil).  </li>
            <li> I hate trying new products, because they never work for me.</li>
            <li> Will seriously consider repurchasing if the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced flaking.</li>
            <li> This natural product dries my hair terribly.</li>
            <li> I hate greasy, weighed down hair.</li>
            <li> I switched to As I am because the Kinky Curly Custard was alittle too expensive for my tastes.</li>
            <li> The product did curl the hair when twisted.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell weird or make my hair crunchy</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve worn my hair natural and have worn it cut short ( about 1 1/2 in)for 3 years.  After letting the perm chemical grow out, I discovered my hair has 3 different textures.  Straight curly on the top, curly straight on the sides and at my back hairline and fine frizzy in the center back.  I&#x27;ve tried several products. This is the only one that give my hair a uniform curl all over. It also leaves a nice shiny look and does not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> sticky and dries crunchy; didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Just did a review on the As I Am Coils and Curls care package. This product is the stand out for me hands down, and I had no expectations of it at all since I&#x27;m an Eco styler crystal girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paired with the leave in gives me GREAT hair days and multiple day hair as long as my hair is 100% percent dry before manipulating/sleeping on it. The slip is amazing, and definition it gives is banging! I even have a little shine, which is not something I normally associate with my curls nor care about really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gave it four stars because of the price, but I&#x27;m cheap as far as hair products go since I always manage to find good products, decently sized for a good price. This may be one of my &amp;#34;luxury buys&amp;#34; for my hair, still have a little sample of this on hand haha. Will seriously consider repurchasing if the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and just a little bit on my hair, currently rocking a tapered twa cut, have kinky-curly (some parts smooth, some frizzy) coils. Highly porous naturally, so more on the dry side. Guess they&#x27;re 3C/4A sized curls if you use that system, think BeatyByLee on YouTube but a tad smaller.</li>
            <li> Soft curls, no crunch,  no nasty gel stuck on my hands, tons of shine.  I love my hair... And you will love yours too....</li>
            <li> I have type 3a hair and live in a very dry climate and this whole line works wonders for my hair.  I layer this over leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;ve never experienced flaking.</li>
            <li> I switched to As I am because the Kinky Curly Custard was alittle too expensive for my tastes. The only thing I will say is that the Kinky Curly custard has more hold than the Curling jelly does. So if you are wearing a hat most of the day like the military does I would go with the Kinky Curly. I&#x27;m african american 5 months natural with 4a and 4b hair type</li>
            <li> Definitely a fan of this product now. Tempted to try the entire line</li>
            <li> Love this is the best hair product for natural hair</li>
            <li> Awesome product for natural hair</li>
            <li> So far, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am biracial with natural 3c curls that I loosen with a DIY keratin treatment to a 3a/b-ish curl (once a month, 275 degrees to avoid heat damage and maintain curl) to make my hair more manageable and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for years for the right product to moisturize, hold and define my curls without being too greasy or too drying. I&#x27;m pretty picky; preferably it would have no silicones, water solubility, natural ingredients, good texture, no build up, hold curl for at least two days, provide shine and play nicely with my keratin treatment and other products. I&#x27;m blown away -- curling jelly does ALL of the above, provides optional stretch to the curl and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After slugging through sticky, drying gels, greasy creams and flaky, dull build up for years, this product feels like the holy grail. It makes me look forward to showering and styling my hair. It&#x27;s honestly a relief to cowash to get clean hair, no build up, apply this product and go. I clean my hair with Giovanni smooth as silk, apply a dollop of kinky curly knot today mixed with a couple squirts of argan oil, and then a light gloss of curling  jelly. Works wonders!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Does leave residue. Good part is you don&#x27;t need much and so it will last a longer time. I think it&#x27;s probably good for those curl sets where you normally use some kind of gel as opposed to just using for a twist out like I did. I love the As I am double butter!! :-)</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF ALONG WITH THE GEL MADE MY VERY COARSE, VERY THICK LONG HAIR VERY ANGRY :(&lt;br /&gt;NOT TO MENTION THE OVERWHELMING PERFUME SMELL...YUCK, NO THANKS!&lt;br /&gt;OH WELL, TO EACH HIS OWN.</li>
            <li> I have recently been struggling with my hair a lot.  My hair has changed in texture over the years, probably as a result of coloring, flat ironing, and so on.  I&#x27;ve always had curls, but recently my hair has become a lot coarser and crazier.  As a caucasian woman, I used to steer clear of the hair products that were marketed towards African American people.  However, after doing some research online, I discovered the As I Am Cowash and immediately fell in love after the first use.  Because of this, I decided to try the As I Am Leave In Conditioner and Curling Jelly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say, is WOW.  My hair is softer, more manageable and less frizzy after only a few uses.  I suspect that this is due to the super moisturizing ingredients in all of these products.  The great thing about the Curling Jelly in particular is that it&#x27;s hard to use too much.  This morning I was probably a little too generous with this product and my hair still doesn&#x27;t look crunchy. Instead it looks shiny, soft and my curls are more defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have found this line of products.  I have shelled out major money on Bumble and Bumble, TIGI Curls Rock/ Curlesque, Deva Curl, Ouidad, and other pricy products.  I have also tried several drug store product lines like John Freida and Garnier Fructis.  As I Am knocks all of these products out of the water for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these products to ANYONE who has coarse curly thick hair!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It elongates the curls and they stay defined for days. Great!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it claims!!! My hair is thick and napp...yes I said nappy lol...but I am really please with this hair product along with alot of the other As I Am hair products. I will be purchasing more! Anybody thats struggling to control their natural hair this is the product for you!!! #teamnatural</li>
            <li> The product did curl the hair when twisted. It made the hair a little dry but soft.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All my natural sista&#x27;s out there do not hesitate, buy it now.  You will love this product.  I had minimal shrinkage (which is always a issue for me) and my curl definition was perfect, every curl perfectly defined.  Lots of moisture and held up for second and third day hair. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue was with the jar, wish it was in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product just a bit pricey for me to generally use it for curling my ponytails when there is humidity.  I have several different textures and this worked beautifully on my curly and wavy sections but less so on the kinky prone to frizzy areas.  Overall, I like the product and will continue to buy it as a backup.</li>
            <li> I have 4a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Minimizes shrinkage. Cost effective. Contains natural ingredients. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The product turns white until dry. This product tends to dry the hair a little bit. This product does define the curls,just nor as well as say Eco Styler</li>
            <li> This product does not work on my hair.  When I use Ecostyler gel, I am able to define my curls. Perhaps, I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but this product did not work for me. I have 4b/4c hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome for curl definition.  This worked well on my short and long natural hair styles.  It made my hair soft, shiny and extra curly.  I received lots of compliments whenever I used this.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 2 years this month and I have FINALLY figured how to manage my hair.  I have type 4a hair that is extremely dry.  I used to use the Olive Oil Eco Styler gel when it was much shorter.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it worked really well, but as hair started to grow, my curl pattern started to change.  Hence how I style had to change also.  I came across this product on YouTube and decided to try it.  OMG, I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE IT.  I shingle the Curling Jelly overtop the As I Am leave-in Conditioner.  As soon as I start to shingle, the curls just POP!  The only drawback I have it the drying time can be around 4-5 hours.  So I use a diffuser on medium heat to get the bulk of the moisture out.  I simply can&#x27;t say enough about this entire line.  It&#x27;s moisturizing and gives great curl definition.  But be careful.  too much product can cause flaking.  A little trial and error may be needed to get the right balance for your particular hair.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft while helping the curl texture. My hair is naturally curly and this product helps enhance the curls.</li>
            <li> Great gel for curly 3b hair.  Almost perfect if the scent wasn&#x27;t so strong.  Yes I love the smell, however I am around too many people with sensitivities to smells.</li>
            <li> This the best product ever for any kind of hair I believe. ..love it!! love it!</li>
            <li> I have 4B hair. I love this stuff. It really defines my curls. It works better if I use the shingle method. It feels a little sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better experience with Eco Styler, and you get much more for way less.  Not sure why this product is so expensive.</li>
            <li> As a part of my hair care regime.. I will definitely be buying this from now on</li>
            <li> Great product.  I am AA with 3C hair and this works well on my hair.  I apply the As I Am leave-in conditioner, wet and apply the Curling Jelly and then section my hair to define the curls.  No rods, no twists needed because the Curling Jelly does the job.  I would highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the natural hair scene, so I bought this product after a friend let me borrow hers. You have to be mindful of the porosity of your hair when using this product. Mine is very low, (doesn&#x27;t absorb moisture/products easily) so I have to use it sparingly which affects its effectiveness. If you use way much it makes my hair hard, and the product flakes up big time,  so I&#x27;m having a hard time finding that balance.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.  I have been natural since 1996 and finding products that actually work on my tightly coiled hair has been an exhausting search.  I have literally tried it all.  This curling jelly is amazing; it is easy to apply, light on the hair, and creates a shine on my hair with no flaking or frizz.  I bought the entire line of &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; products and I am enjoying the definition it has brought to my curls/coils.</li>
            <li> This product  gives more definition and shape without making hair sticky or hard. I use it with my hair wet, I tried to used it with my hair dry, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same result.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple it works amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;I have combo 4b/c hair and my daughter has more 4c than she does 4b.  I share this so you understand that achieving a wash and go can be challenging on our hair and yet we can achieve it.  Our curls are very small coils ranging in size from the spring of a ball point pen (or the size of the lead in a pencil) to the outer side of the pen (or pencil).  I love the look.  Still my daughter wanted slightly larger coils, but she did achieve a wash and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works:  After detangling in the shower with conditioner, rinse the conditioner out.  Apply leave-in of choice.  This is key because generous amount of leave-in will prevent flakes.  I have never had flakes nor hard hair with this gel.  While still wet with leave in, apply the gel using the shingle method.  There you go, Wash and Go.  I like shrinkage and enjoyed watching my hair shrink during the work day.  Coils remained soft and yes I touch my hair with no problems.  No major frizz.  I like a combo of slightly frizzy hair with the high shine this product gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The style was easy to do and fun to wear.</li>
            <li> It gets 2 starts for smelling lovely and being natural, but it doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as drugstore gel for keeping frizzies away and making good curls (I am caucasian with 3b/c curls)</li>
            <li> ignore the other review i wrote...its this product, not the smoothing gel!  doh!  this curling jelly is great for curl definition...its runny and easy to apply and doesnt leave your hair heavy....recommend</li>
            <li> This natural product dries my hair terribly.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  I had no idea that my curls could look so cute and defined.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. I have 3c natural hair, and it made my hair  very defined but stiff. I will stick to my eco styler</li>
            <li> This product was gummy and it did not do well on my clean hair or my grandsons hair either and I will not recommend anyone to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great for wash and gos and for slicked back styles. Doesn&#x27;t smell weird or make my hair crunchy and it&#x27;s not sticky or drying. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> product was too watery to me</li>
            <li> I love AS I AM products, this is quite gooey though.  It smells good too - but take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> The picture was kind of misleading. I knew it was eight ounces but the product I got doesn&#x27;t look like it is. It works well, but it was much too expensive for the size. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this from here.</li>
            <li> Regular jells itch my scalp.  So far this jell has not irritated my scalp . It is also not thick and greasy</li>
            <li> I use just a little on the ends when my hair is wet and twist it just a little and it keeps my hair curled and defined. Warning - a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and no gressy. I like it.  I use the leave-in as well as the co-wash and I love them all.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is very curl-enducing, but it does cause some dryness and crunchiness.  Make sure to use some good oil like emu or coconut, something really thick before applying this product.  It is good for curl definition and enhancement.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of hold.  I really like it because it does give a little extra time before your hair gets hard to style it and make a change if necessary.</li>
            <li> I have 4b/4c hair. This product worked, though not great, when I first big chopped. But as my hair lengthened it did absolutely nothing to define my coils. I promptly switched to the eco styler gel and I have not looked back since. I think this product would work best on looser curls and/or softer textures. I will say, unlike the eco styler, there is no crunchiness once the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I am AA with 4b/4c hair. I purchased this gel after reading a post about it on a natural hair blog. This curling jelly does wonders on my hair. It really brings out the curl definition of my hair without flaking up like some other products, nor does it dry out my hair. It also smells lovely which is always a plus to my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> This product defines my curls so much better than Kinky Kurly, plus there is no residue left over and it moisturizes not dry my hair out. Combined with the As I Am Cowash, these products are moisture rich and made my hair soft and curly. I absolutely love this jelly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who sticks to the same products. I hate trying new products, because they never work for me. I was leery about trying this product, especially w/ the consistency.  I hate greasy, weighed down hair. I was looking for something to give my hair more definition for a longer period of time, but keep my hair soft at the same time. The products I used were great, but my hair would be super frizzy after only a couple days. So I reluctantly picked up this product to try.  I co-washed my hair then applied It&#x27;s a 10 Leave In and Aussie Moist Conditioner as a styler. I put a light amount of curling jelly on top. I must say, I am so impressed with this product! It gives my hair a light hold, but adds so much definition. It&#x27;s now Day 2, and my hair has never looked this good on Day 2. It&#x27;s still very defined and not nearly as frizzy as it usually would be. I&#x27;m so happy I tried this product, especially since it&#x27;s silicone and sulfate free. This will definitely be a staple product in my routine. The only con is the packaging. They should make this in a squeeze tube. The jar is just not user friendly and makes application more difficult than it needs to be. If they change the packaging, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Give my twist out moisture and definition. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy. I love this stuff and I do recommend this to all my naturalistas out there!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a great product, it&#x27;s not a bad product but I definitely expected better. Leaves hair a little too crunchy for my liking AND you need to purchase a leave in conditioner to use. Smells really good though.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, not too sticky and not too runny.  I have only used it once but happy with my curls after my twist out.</li>
            <li> wonderful purchase worth the money</li>
            <li> I love this! :) It really works very well, as well as everyone else has said. It&#x27;s worth the buy. Just remember, a little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t want your hair air drying and tripping with this stuff for hours because you caked on too much! It&#x27;s perfect, and though the size is a little bit small, it should last me considering how little is needed!</li>
            <li> Seems to be ok - not as much definition as i would have expected.</li>
