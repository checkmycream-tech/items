            <li>He absolutely loved it and uses it quite often.</li>
            <li>if you look good then you feel good.</li>
            <li>Good for shaving not for shaping.</li>
            <li>also gives me a good neck line).</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how well designed this product was and still is and how it is still the best out their for precise trimming.</li>
            <li>but then you run into the battery giving out and the trimmer still being perfectly good.</li>
            <li>I started with battery-powered ones, moved up to good rechargables (2 Wahls) and was pleased well enough--until I got the Andis.&lt;br /&gt;Wow!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my T....</li>
            <li>I received my order on time and I am very pleased with it...</li>
            <li>And boy have i tried many!</li>
            <li>These liners are light and a great purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect buy for people that Cut their own hair or barbers on all skill levels</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal: great performance at a great price.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a edjer that won&#x27;t burn your skin because the razor is getting warm switch to this type.</li>
            <li>and I liked the brown edger</li>
            <li>Be kind to the product and it will be kind to you.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>His older T-Edjer burned out a fuse so this was the perfect replacement.</li>
            <li>Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The Andis Professional T-Edjer Trimmer gave me the perfect cut.</li>
            <li>I love these edgers they get nice and close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best electric shaver that I have ever owned (46years).</li>
            <li>So happy that I could make my dad smile before Christmas ...</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, was a good buy at $45.27 and worked perfectly for six cuttings (twice monthly, five-minute hair trims on one \\&quot;high and</li>
            <li>The trim is very close and easy to handle he also shaves his head and these work perfect for that too!</li>
            <li>It makes perfectly straight lines and has my man looking good!  </li>
            <li>Good edger, does not get as close as my other edgers, but it makes perfect corner cuts.</li>
            <li>Besides that, great product, trims very well also.</li>
            <li>Surely this product should have a working life of more than six haircuts?&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly accept a replacement.</li>
            <li>paid more than what it cost here...</li>
            <li>The Andis is much more powerful, yet surprisingly quieter.  </li>
            <li>It trims more closely: I used the Wahl, and then this immediately after in order to compare them.  </li>
            <li>I had better.  </li>
            <li>The Peanut shaver is the next best one that I have found.</li>
            <li>And Yes, I tried it immediately making sure it edges like most of the reviews stated it did....</li>
            <li>and now I am glad I took a chance with this T-Edjer</li>
            <li>I am truly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Have NO idea how any of the models have had more than one star.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for trimming around the ears, sideburns and for cleaning up the hair at the back of the neck.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and recommend it for any one that that wants to keep a nice edge on their hairline.</li>
            <li>I love these edgers.</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Better deal than a barber supply.</li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>I have to use my index finger to put pressure on the top of the blade in order to make it move.</li>
            <li>Over the years he has tried many brands of trimmers but the Andis brand has always had a better cut.</li>
            <li>I love these trimmers..</li>
            <li>I also love the Brand....</li>
            <li>I use it to trim around my ears, my neckline, my beard line around my neck and cheeks, and to shorten the hair on my face if I haven&#x27;t shaved for too many days.</li>
            <li>Good quality at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust and fits my needs.</li>
            <li>I adjusted the blades and it gives a clean cut, better than my Andis T-Outliner</li>
            <li>Ordering was easy</li>
            <li>Also had to adjust them but not an easy task -</li>
            <li>had functions to attend three consecutive days where a clean shaven face was most preferred.</li>
            <li>For 5+ years and still going strong.</li>
            <li>If you want a sweet cut you better order a pair of these.</li>
            <li>The trimmer it self worked fine</li>
            <li>Turn the shaver off when brushing or clearing out the fine</li>
            <li>i hope you fine it helpful.</li>
            <li>Rusted really quickly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The edjers are really light in your hands but has some weight to it.</li>
            <li>So that you don&#x27;t feel like they are cheap but rather well made for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This T edger is so precise, I use it to trim and edge my three boys hair.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Edjer&amp;#34; worked smoothly for a while, but now it jams.</li>
            <li>This item required disassembly to free the blades after 5 - 10 minutes of use almost from the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>smooth to the touch, not abbrasive like the cheaper clippers.</li>
            <li>might also be because i oil it after evvery use to keep it running smooth.</li>
            <li>It could have been better and sharper, like the andis t liner  which is much sharper and have better blades</li>
            <li>amazon has the best price and these trimmers get right to skin and arent sharp at all.</li>
            <li>I am more than willing to deal with that issue because it never cuts my skin and it cuts almost as close as a razor.</li>
            <li>They may get hot after you leave them on without stopping for more than 20 mins but</li>
            <li>They work great as long as you keep them oiled.</li>
            <li>Kept clean and oiled, with original Andis oil.</li>
            <li>And I was using a spray to clean it after using it.</li>
            <li>Then the electric razor can give me a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Very smooth feel to the skin and a very close shave.</li>
            <li>good news is, it&#x27;s quiet, and lightweight</li>
            <li>if you need a good facial clipper, this is the one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a set of these for my brother,  my good friend and my man, who are all black and they all love how close shaved they can get with these, with out the razor bump issues they have when they shave with a razor.</li>
            <li>Great sharp clippers once they are adjusted</li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t i the lucky one</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of quick tips that my enhance your shaving comfort:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It is by far the most precise trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The black adds style to and already great piece of equipment</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>and they are worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, the plastic will start getting hot, I&#x27;ll stop for a while to let them cool off.</li>
            <li>i noticed it was not cutting, I had to push [...]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked for this cable charger for nearly a year glad</li>
            <li>It is professional grade and works better than a battery operated trimmer.</li>
            <li>It did not cut nor was it able to get close enough to the scalp to allow a clean shaven look..</li>
            <li>Be sure to open out the blade area to clean out excess hairs inside every once in a while.</li>
            <li>These are far more durable and will not get hot as its being used.  </li>
            <li>It is great for beard trimming and edging; and it costs about half as much as this one did.</li>
            <li>Works great for trimming toes on my 2 small dogs.</li>
            <li>i use this about every friday for the past 2 months now and still works great.</li>
            <li>this product 5 stars because I own the previous version of this product and can only imagine how good the new version will be.</li>
            <li>I have recently been using trimmers close to a year now, and this is the most closest, smoothest trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>love this product, It a lot easier for me to give myself a line verses using regular clippers..</li>
            <li>If this one will last as long I will be happy.</li>
            <li>Not 5 only because the machine itself gets hot more then</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find another one until recently.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Received as a gift for trimming around edges, and was only able to use 3 times.</li>
            <li>I first noticed the product while the barber was lining my son&#x27;s head</li>
            <li>and now others are noticing them and the work ive been producing and are interested in buying them.</li>
            <li>This T-Edjer was exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t get too hot after prolonged use.</li>
            <li>, I have struggled all my life (I&#x27;m 62 now) in finding something that works consistently.</li>
            <li>It gets too hot while in use.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 20 years</li>
            <li>of one star because unit gets really hot.</li>
            <li>My first was bought in the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>gives a very close cut and very percise !  </li>
            <li>The Andis T-Edjer Professional Hair Trimmer and T-Blade is just too cool...</li>
            <li>I own the previous version of this product.</li>
            <li>Other than that the trimmer cuts close and gives me a nice clean look that can only be beat by a straight razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Use an old tooth brush to clear out the fine hairs on the shaver as you</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really remember how fast the shipping was</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t cut very close...</li>
            <li>You ready?</li>
            <li>I am not a pro barber and never was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any reasonable person desiring an edger that is ready to use with \\&quot;no</li>
            <li>The reviews I read was what sold me, I&#x27;m now wondering; how much did those people get paid for saying what they said.</li>
            <li>This Hair Trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>I found it here, thanks.  </li>
            <li>It should already come ready to go.</li>
            <li>It really lives up to its specs.</li>
            <li>my wife wants one.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast ...</li>
            <li>These clippers cut very well...</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with there performance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The T-Eder cuts really close.  </li>
            <li>A early Christmas Gift for him !!!</li>
            <li>Does great detail but not strong enough for over all trimming</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, I think I paid about $30 that many years ago for the other one.</li>
            <li>Took some getting used to but much better for shaving my head and maintaining the bald look than any other clippers i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have even tried using specialized methods with a good old single razor blades, but the bumps always come back and I have skin irritation.</li>
            <li>so my rating is the average of I love it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any man looking to have that Steve Harvey line without using a razor.</li>
            <li>It is good for a small musctach trim or ear trim only.</li>
            <li>It is relatively quiet, but powerful.</li>
            <li>A huge savings compared to other sites.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a smooth cut and adjustable for how sharp of a line you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>so he decided he wanted a new one.  </li>
            <li>I hardly ever write a review for a product, but this good enough to take the time and do so.</li>
            <li>I felt just like had left my barber with such a smooth trim,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different other brands but am very pleased.</li>
            <li>If you want to shave everyday and look clean!</li>
            <li>This is the professional edger/trimmer that cannot be beaten in any arena!</li>
            <li>the blade is very small so its great for tight areas and all my work is coming out much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The down part would be that you have to oil it frequently and adjust the setting when you first get it, and the clippers can get a little warm.</li>
            <li>To my amazement the old beat up 5 star razor gave me a closer shave than this brand new Andis machine...</li>
            <li>number of Black Men have difficulty in getting a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I have owned several electric trimmers through the years but have been less than satisfied.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a 5 year old toy  .</li>
            <li>I purchased the Andis 1530 Professional T-Edjer Trimmer in March of 2011.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the blade is wider, makes everything even and professional looking.</li>
            <li>This machine is for White people or people with straight hair...</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to someone else based on how much he likes it.</li>
            <li>I have 10 year old clippers hat work just as well.  </li>
            <li>Have gotten a lot of use out of it so far.</li>
            <li>I am an apprentice in a professional salon.</li>
            <li>The Andis T-Edjer Professional Hair Trimmer and T-Blade allows me to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Andis Professional did the job &amp;#34;without&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The Andis T-Edjer Professional is the answer for me and it just may be the answer for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is sensitive to electric shavers so trimmers works well for him when it comes to trimming his mustache, beard and lining himself(He</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quiet and stay cool for a long time.</li>
            <li>and I just received them a couple of days ago (very fast standard shipping/no extra cost)</li>
            <li>I had though it would help line short small areas better but was not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are small but are very powerful.</li>
            <li>, i had this machine for 2 years the only reason I had to buy a new one was because i dropped the machine on its blades one day while it was on...</li>
            <li>Andis is clearly built to last under professional use.</li>
            <li>I am African American and really like a close shave.</li>
            <li>I have to go extremely slow and back up often when my hair grows more than 1/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional barber for the last 27 years..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good idea to put it in a small box or baggy to protect it given the issue with the delicate teeth.</li>
            <li>Great Trimmer for using around those hard to get places with a Beard!!!!</li>
            <li>Still Sharp and cuts very well after all this time.</li>
            <li>Fake Plastic, lightweight, and very cheap.</li>

            <li> if you look good then you feel good.</li>
            <li> Good for shaving not for shaping.</li>
            <li> also gives me a good neck line).</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well designed this product was and still is and how it is still the best out their for precise trimming.</li>
            <li> but then you run into the battery giving out and the trimmer still being perfectly good.</li>
            <li> I started with battery-powered ones, moved up to good rechargables (2 Wahls) and was pleased well enough--until I got the Andis.&lt;br /&gt;Wow!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my T....</li>
            <li> I received my order on time and I am very pleased with it...</li>
            <li> And boy have i tried many!</li>
            <li> These liners are light and a great purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfect buy for people that Cut their own hair or barbers on all skill levels</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal: great performance at a great price.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a edjer that won&#x27;t burn your skin because the razor is getting warm switch to this type.</li>
            <li> and I liked the brown edger</li>
            <li> Be kind to the product and it will be kind to you.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> His older T-Edjer burned out a fuse so this was the perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The Andis Professional T-Edjer Trimmer gave me the perfect cut.</li>
            <li> I love these edgers they get nice and close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best electric shaver that I have ever owned (46years).</li>
            <li> So happy that I could make my dad smile before Christmas ...</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, was a good buy at $45.27 and worked perfectly for six cuttings (twice monthly, five-minute hair trims on one \\&quot;high and</li>
            <li> The trim is very close and easy to handle he also shaves his head and these work perfect for that too!</li>
            <li> It makes perfectly straight lines and has my man looking good!  </li>
            <li> Good edger, does not get as close as my other edgers, but it makes perfect corner cuts.</li>
            <li> Besides that, great product, trims very well also.</li>
            <li> Surely this product should have a working life of more than six haircuts?&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly accept a replacement.</li>
            <li> paid more than what it cost here...</li>
            <li> The Andis is much more powerful, yet surprisingly quieter.  </li>
            <li> It trims more closely: I used the Wahl, and then this immediately after in order to compare them.  </li>
            <li> I had better.  </li>
            <li> The Peanut shaver is the next best one that I have found.</li>
            <li> And Yes, I tried it immediately making sure it edges like most of the reviews stated it did....</li>
            <li> and now I am glad I took a chance with this T-Edjer</li>
            <li> I am truly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Have NO idea how any of the models have had more than one star.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for trimming around the ears, sideburns and for cleaning up the hair at the back of the neck.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and recommend it for any one that that wants to keep a nice edge on their hairline.</li>
            <li> I love these edgers.</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Better deal than a barber supply.</li>
            <li> LOVE  </li>
            <li> I have to use my index finger to put pressure on the top of the blade in order to make it move.</li>
            <li> Over the years he has tried many brands of trimmers but the Andis brand has always had a better cut.</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers..</li>
            <li> I also love the Brand....</li>
            <li> I use it to trim around my ears, my neckline, my beard line around my neck and cheeks, and to shorten the hair on my face if I haven&#x27;t shaved for too many days.</li>
            <li> Good quality at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust and fits my needs.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the blades and it gives a clean cut, better than my Andis T-Outliner</li>
            <li> Ordering was easy</li>
            <li> Also had to adjust them but not an easy task -</li>
            <li> had functions to attend three consecutive days where a clean shaven face was most preferred.</li>
            <li> For 5+ years and still going strong.</li>
            <li> If you want a sweet cut you better order a pair of these.</li>
            <li> The trimmer it self worked fine</li>
            <li> Turn the shaver off when brushing or clearing out the fine</li>
            <li> i hope you fine it helpful.</li>
            <li> Rusted really quickly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The edjers are really light in your hands but has some weight to it.</li>
            <li> So that you don&#x27;t feel like they are cheap but rather well made for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This T edger is so precise, I use it to trim and edge my three boys hair.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Edjer&amp;#34; worked smoothly for a while, but now it jams.</li>
            <li> This item required disassembly to free the blades after 5 - 10 minutes of use almost from the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li> smooth to the touch, not abbrasive like the cheaper clippers.</li>
            <li> might also be because i oil it after evvery use to keep it running smooth.</li>
            <li> It could have been better and sharper, like the andis t liner  which is much sharper and have better blades</li>
            <li> amazon has the best price and these trimmers get right to skin and arent sharp at all.</li>
            <li> I am more than willing to deal with that issue because it never cuts my skin and it cuts almost as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> They may get hot after you leave them on without stopping for more than 20 mins but</li>
            <li> They work great as long as you keep them oiled.</li>
            <li> Kept clean and oiled, with original Andis oil.</li>
            <li> And I was using a spray to clean it after using it.</li>
            <li> Then the electric razor can give me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Very smooth feel to the skin and a very close shave.</li>
            <li> good news is, it&#x27;s quiet, and lightweight</li>
            <li> if you need a good facial clipper, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a set of these for my brother,  my good friend and my man, who are all black and they all love how close shaved they can get with these, with out the razor bump issues they have when they shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> Great sharp clippers once they are adjusted</li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t i the lucky one</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of quick tips that my enhance your shaving comfort:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It is by far the most precise trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The black adds style to and already great piece of equipment</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> and they are worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , the plastic will start getting hot, I&#x27;ll stop for a while to let them cool off.</li>
            <li> i noticed it was not cutting, I had to push [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for this cable charger for nearly a year glad</li>
            <li> It is professional grade and works better than a battery operated trimmer.</li>
            <li> It did not cut nor was it able to get close enough to the scalp to allow a clean shaven look..</li>
            <li> Be sure to open out the blade area to clean out excess hairs inside every once in a while.</li>
            <li> These are far more durable and will not get hot as its being used.  </li>
            <li> It is great for beard trimming and edging; and it costs about half as much as this one did.</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming toes on my 2 small dogs.</li>
            <li> i use this about every friday for the past 2 months now and still works great.</li>
            <li> this product 5 stars because I own the previous version of this product and can only imagine how good the new version will be.</li>
            <li> I have recently been using trimmers close to a year now, and this is the most closest, smoothest trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> love this product, It a lot easier for me to give myself a line verses using regular clippers..</li>
            <li> If this one will last as long I will be happy.</li>
            <li> Not 5 only because the machine itself gets hot more then</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find another one until recently.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Received as a gift for trimming around edges, and was only able to use 3 times.</li>
            <li> I first noticed the product while the barber was lining my son&#x27;s head</li>
            <li> and now others are noticing them and the work ive been producing and are interested in buying them.</li>
            <li> This T-Edjer was exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t get too hot after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> , I have struggled all my life (I&#x27;m 62 now) in finding something that works consistently.</li>
            <li> It gets too hot while in use.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 20 years</li>
            <li> of one star because unit gets really hot.</li>
            <li> My first was bought in the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> gives a very close cut and very percise !  </li>
            <li> The Andis T-Edjer Professional Hair Trimmer and T-Blade is just too cool...</li>
            <li> I own the previous version of this product.</li>
            <li> Other than that the trimmer cuts close and gives me a nice clean look that can only be beat by a straight razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Use an old tooth brush to clear out the fine hairs on the shaver as you</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really remember how fast the shipping was</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut very close...</li>
            <li> You ready?</li>
            <li> I am not a pro barber and never was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any reasonable person desiring an edger that is ready to use with \\&quot;no</li>
            <li> The reviews I read was what sold me, I&#x27;m now wondering; how much did those people get paid for saying what they said.</li>
            <li> This Hair Trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> I found it here, thanks.  </li>
            <li> It should already come ready to go.</li>
            <li> It really lives up to its specs.</li>
            <li> my wife wants one.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast ...</li>
            <li> These clippers cut very well...</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with there performance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The T-Eder cuts really close.  </li>
            <li> A early Christmas Gift for him !!!</li>
            <li> Does great detail but not strong enough for over all trimming</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, I think I paid about $30 that many years ago for the other one.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to but much better for shaving my head and maintaining the bald look than any other clippers i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have even tried using specialized methods with a good old single razor blades, but the bumps always come back and I have skin irritation.</li>
            <li> so my rating is the average of I love it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any man looking to have that Steve Harvey line without using a razor.</li>
            <li> It is good for a small musctach trim or ear trim only.</li>
            <li> It is relatively quiet, but powerful.</li>
            <li> A huge savings compared to other sites.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a smooth cut and adjustable for how sharp of a line you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> so he decided he wanted a new one.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever write a review for a product, but this good enough to take the time and do so.</li>
            <li> I felt just like had left my barber with such a smooth trim,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different other brands but am very pleased.</li>
            <li> If you want to shave everyday and look clean!</li>
            <li> This is the professional edger/trimmer that cannot be beaten in any arena!</li>
            <li> the blade is very small so its great for tight areas and all my work is coming out much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The down part would be that you have to oil it frequently and adjust the setting when you first get it, and the clippers can get a little warm.</li>
            <li> To my amazement the old beat up 5 star razor gave me a closer shave than this brand new Andis machine...</li>
            <li> number of Black Men have difficulty in getting a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric trimmers through the years but have been less than satisfied.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a 5 year old toy  .</li>
            <li> I purchased the Andis 1530 Professional T-Edjer Trimmer in March of 2011.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the blade is wider, makes everything even and professional looking.</li>
            <li> This machine is for White people or people with straight hair...</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone else based on how much he likes it.</li>
            <li> I have 10 year old clippers hat work just as well.  </li>
            <li> Have gotten a lot of use out of it so far.</li>
            <li> I am an apprentice in a professional salon.</li>
            <li> The Andis T-Edjer Professional Hair Trimmer and T-Blade allows me to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Andis Professional did the job &amp;#34;without&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The Andis T-Edjer Professional is the answer for me and it just may be the answer for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is sensitive to electric shavers so trimmers works well for him when it comes to trimming his mustache, beard and lining himself(He</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quiet and stay cool for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I just received them a couple of days ago (very fast standard shipping/no extra cost)</li>
            <li> I had though it would help line short small areas better but was not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are small but are very powerful.</li>
            <li> , i had this machine for 2 years the only reason I had to buy a new one was because i dropped the machine on its blades one day while it was on...</li>
            <li> Andis is clearly built to last under professional use.</li>
            <li> I am African American and really like a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have to go extremely slow and back up often when my hair grows more than 1/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber for the last 27 years..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good idea to put it in a small box or baggy to protect it given the issue with the delicate teeth.</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer for using around those hard to get places with a Beard!!!!</li>
            <li> Still Sharp and cuts very well after all this time.</li>
            <li> Fake Plastic, lightweight, and very cheap.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re highly sensitive to razor blades in other forms of shaving</li>
            <li> Will have you line-up look sharp and professional.  </li>
            <li> It saves me time and, in the long run, will save money too (all the batteries, even rechargables, only last</li>
            <li> just stoped working after about two months, just long enough to where i could not return it.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I have a problem with is that this product is a little loud when in use.</li>
            <li> As a barber this has limited use only.</li>
            <li> I have one minor problem with these trimmers, if u use them, say longer than 20min</li>
            <li> tight\\&quot; male hairdo).&lt;br /&gt;It was never abused, dropped, wet or disassembled.</li>
            <li> Quality set, although I prefer the grey model</li>
            <li> I recieve minor razor bump while using this product.  </li>
            <li> I did, but when he received it, he claimed that it was making a strange noise.</li>
            <li> and I hope they last as long as my other Andis trimmers that I have owned for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> In other words, use it the way a barber does when edging the back of your neck or edging your hairline.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little late in putting up the review, but better late than never.</li>
            <li> trim guard always comes loose.</li>
            <li> Well I went down to my local sally beauty supply and got this machine...</li>
            <li> a Black Man with in- grown facial hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall as long as you keep them well oiled before use as instructed then they will stay sharp and keeping your hair straight&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the last year it has started to balk a little bit</li>
            <li> Theses clippers are not sharp at all, not good for tapering or facial hair!!!</li>
            <li> For the money paid, I expected a closer trimming result.  </li>
            <li> For the reading impaired, let me repeat, \\&quot;For the money paid, I expected a closer trimming result.\\</li>
            <li> The Andis gave me a still closer trim, with absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Spoke to Andis who was convinced the blades were jammed, so had me remove to test motor.</li>
            <li> I have used and tried a few different trimmers.</li>
            <li> if u want ur man to keep that fresh, neatly trimmed facial hair, u can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> have owned the grey one and now the black one...</li>
            <li> The only difference in this trimmer from my previous is that the housing was flesh colored instead of black.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning these as they are not as sharp as expected.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the cutter, slender and extended, makes for extreme precision, and you can get to places you can&#x27;t with other trimmers.  </li>
            <li> it suppose to but other than that he loves it</li>
            <li> I will have to agree with the review on some are sharp and some are blunt.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It it sharp but not too sharp that it cuts you or bites.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday and it only take him a few minutes to groom himself.</li>
            <li> you try to tighten the holding screw down.</li>
            <li> Put a very small drop of clipper oil on both edges and in the middle of the T.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It cuts closer than my previously owned name brand balding clipper and also my Peanut.</li>
            <li> The difference between this and all my previous trimmers is the difference between a tool and toys.  </li>
            <li> Trimmers cut just the way the trimmers cut that you can buy at Walmart, and for half the price.</li>
            <li> After making a slight adjustment on the blades, the T-Edjer cuts like a dream.</li>
            <li> Angle the shaver slightly downward</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I would like to pass on a little trick that helps in getting an even closer shave.</li>
            <li> , i wanted to have somewhat of a heavy shadow going on....</li>
            <li> My previous T-Edjer lasted some 15-20 years!  </li>
            <li> Then motor slowed down to a faint vibration, not enough power to cut.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is dull and not powerful.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the zero gap has anything to do with it or not since I am have some experience beauty school and practice on the the men in my house</li>
            <li> Only thing wrong with it is that you have to oil it.</li>
            <li> Not able to adjust to sharpen.</li>
            <li> Probably too small.</li>
            <li> but i always hated  the puke salmon color they originally came in.</li>
            <li> Not sure why some of the confusing reviews...</li>
            <li> I took out my broken, beat down 5 Star Razor from Wahl...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t cut nearly as close as a barber&#x27;s edger does.  </li>
            <li> This is not good product</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer ever!, even that peanut crap is better as noisy a it is!</li>
            <li> This is not a great pair of clippers..</li>
            <li> Broke after one week, not happy</li>
            <li> This is aa little annoying while using it.</li>
            <li> Im sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over a year using expensive 5 blade</li>
            <li> It performs horribly and is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Because of in-gown hairs, this makes it very difficult to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Pulled this bad boy out and mind you</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> my arm!&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed</li>
            <li> #disappointed</li>
            <li> and now I hate it.</li>
            <li> It is truly a worthless product.</li>

            <li> Great edger for barbers.</li>
            <li> This pair of leaders I have had for quite some time now and they are worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really remember how fast the shipping was but I used it as soon as I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edjers are really light in your hands but has some weight to it. So that you don&#x27;t feel like they are cheap but rather well made for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are really quiet! Quiet enough to line up Your hair at 2 in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall as long as you keep them well oiled before use as instructed then they will stay sharp and keeping your hair straight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect buy for people that Cut their own hair or barbers on all skill levels</li>
            <li> I use this clipper to bald my entire head. It cuts closer than my previously owned name brand balding clipper and also my Peanut. I would say that it cuts as close as 1 or 2 days growth after a razor shave. The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t have much power. I have to go extremely slow and back up often when my hair grows more than 1/4&amp;#34;. I am more than willing to deal with that issue because it never cuts my skin and it cuts almost as close as a razor. Easy to adjust and fits my needs. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product works great !!!!  gives a very close cut and very percise !  I am very pleased with my T....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin</li>
            <li> Fake Plastic, lightweight, and very cheap. It&#x27;s like a 5 year old toy  . Does not work, blade doesn&#x27;t even move .</li>
            <li> I have one minor problem with these trimmers, if u use them, say longer than 20min, the plastic will start getting hot, I&#x27;ll stop for a while to let them cool off. Besides that, great product, trims very well also.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Andis 1530 Professional T-Edjer Trimmer in March of 2011. It arrived quickly, was a good buy at $45.27 and worked perfectly for six cuttings (twice monthly, five-minute hair trims on one \\&quot;high and tight\\&quot; male hairdo).&lt;br /&gt;It was never abused, dropped, wet or disassembled. It just stopped working after the sixth cut in three months. Surely this product should have a working life of more than six haircuts?&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly accept a replacement. I might have just gotten the \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; of the lot. Unless replaced, I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut very close...</li>
            <li> I have recently been using trimmers close to a year now, and this is the most closest, smoothest trimmer I have ever used. I like the fact that the blade is wider, makes everything even and professional looking. I felt just like had left my barber with such a smooth trim, a bald fade for over 14 years. Another plus with this trimmer is there is no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Im sorry but I have to admit i was warned! I checked this item out on Amazon and after reading the reviews i thought to myself ohhh well you will always have someone who complains, Im still getting it... Well I went down to my local sally beauty supply and got this machine... paid more than what it cost here... got home and was eager to test the machine out.  Did not shave for 2 days, i wanted to have somewhat of a heavy shadow going on.... As soon as i put this thing up to my face i noticed it was not cutting, I had to push [...] my face for it to cut... Finally after about 15mins of me trying to convince myself that this machine works, I gave up.. I did the impossible! You ready? I took out my broken, beat down 5 Star Razor from Wahl... Pulled this bad boy out and mind you, i had this machine for 2 years the only reason I had to buy a new one was because i dropped the machine on its blades one day while it was on... To my amazement the old beat up 5 star razor gave me a closer shave than this brand new Andis machine... I went to the store the next day and changed it out for the 5 star razor.. I am happy now.. I will never go back to Andis products.. This machine is for White people or people with straight hair... Im a Hispanic male with curly facial hair.. I cannot use Razors, breaks me out into hives.. If you want to shave everyday and look clean! go get the 5 star Razor... Don&#x27;t waist your time and money on this item. This has nothing to do with Amazon just Andis...</li>
            <li> I take no pleasure in rating this trimmer/edger only one star.  However,  I have no alternative since it didn&#x27;t shave as closely as the ad phraseology leads you to believe.  I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t cut nearly as close as a barber&#x27;s edger does.  For the money paid, I expected a closer trimming result.  Item was returned/refunded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some know-it-alls commented that maybe I should have \\&quot;adjusted\\&quot; the blade on this edger for a closer cut.  For the reading impaired, let me repeat, \\&quot;For the money paid, I expected a closer trimming result.\\&quot;  I shouldn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; anything.  I am not a pro barber and never was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any reasonable person desiring an edger that is ready to use with \\&quot;no adjustments\\&quot; just seek out the Andis Headliner.  It is great for beard trimming and edging; and it costs about half as much as this one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using trimmers for over 10 years.  I started with battery-powered ones, moved up to good rechargables (2 Wahls) and was pleased well enough--until I got the Andis.&lt;br /&gt;Wow! The difference between this and all my previous trimmers is the difference between a tool and toys.  The Andis is much more powerful, yet surprisingly quieter.  It trims more closely: I used the Wahl, and then this immediately after in order to compare them.  The Andis gave me a still closer trim, with absolutely no irritation.  The shape of the cutter, slender and extended, makes for extreme precision, and you can get to places you can&#x27;t with other trimmers.  The cord is no problem: after all, where will you use it?&lt;br /&gt;The Andis is clearly built to last under professional use. It&#x27;s the real deal: great performance at a great price.  It saves me time and, in the long run, will save money too (all the batteries, even rechargables, only last so long).&lt;br /&gt;If you care about your grooming, just get it: you&#x27;ll be delighted!</li>
            <li> good product at great price.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. He absolutely loved it and uses it quite often. I&#x27;m a little late in putting up the review, but better late than never. I would definitely recommend this to someone else based on how much he likes it.</li>
            <li> love this product, It a lot easier for me to give myself a line verses using regular clippers..</li>
            <li> The reviews I read was what sold me, I&#x27;m now wondering; how much did those people get paid for saying what they said. Trimmers cut just the way the trimmers cut that you can buy at Walmart, and for half the price. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Works great.  My previous T-Edjer lasted some 15-20 years!  If this one will last as long I will be happy.</li>
            <li> Good edger, does not get as close as my other edgers, but it makes perfect corner cuts.</li>
            <li> Not 5 only because the machine itself gets hot more then it suppose to but other than that he loves it</li>
            <li> After utilizing the beige type of Andis T-Edjer and now using these instead I will never go back.  These are far more durable and will not get hot as its being used.  If you&#x27;re looking for a edjer that won&#x27;t burn your skin because the razor is getting warm switch to this type.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning these as they are not as sharp as expected.  I have 10 year old clippers hat work just as well.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This Hair Trimmer works very well.  I wish that it would have come with attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for this cable charger for nearly a year glad I found it here, thanks.  A huge savings compared to other sites.</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer for using around those hard to get places with a Beard!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this one either. I will have to agree with the review on some are sharp and some are blunt.  I cut my husbands hair and line him up and I liked the brown edger I had better.  I messed that one up because I was not use to cleaning them and it rusted.  I have not been able to find another one until recently. I am not sure if the zero gap has anything to do with it or not since I am have some experience beauty school and practice on the the men in my house but I just did not like this one.  I don&#x27;t think I should have to get it adjusted.  It should already come ready to go.</li>
            <li> Quality set, although I prefer the grey model</li>
            <li> This the perfect clippers for me,I have a baby face that needs a close cut. The Andis Professional T-Edjer Trimmer gave me the perfect cut. They are quiet and not too big for my hand.If you want a sweet cut you better order a pair of these.</li>
            <li> It did not cut nor was it able to get close enough to the scalp to allow a clean shaven look..This is not a great pair of clippers..I did not hesitate in sending it back..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a set of these for my brother,  my good friend and my man, who are all black and they all love how close shaved they can get with these, with out the razor bump issues they have when they shave with a razor. if u want ur man to keep that fresh, neatly trimmed facial hair, u can&#x27;t go wrong with these! I also know my brother lines up his hair with these, and they keep his hairline lookin extra crispy!</li>
            <li> I love these edgers they get nice and close to the scalp. I&#x27;ve used several different other brands but am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I used this item only three times. The forts two times it was pulling my hair and the third time it stop working. And I was using a spray to clean it after using it. Almost $60.00 for nothing.</li>
            <li> These are the best trimmer ever&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
            <li> I own the previous version of this product. The brown version. For 5+ years and still going strong. I had no problem with this product. Kept clean and oiled, with original Andis oil. Still Sharp and cuts very well after all this time. Be sure to open out the blade area to clean out excess hairs inside every once in a while. Be kind to the product and it will be kind to you.&lt;br /&gt;Gave this product 5 stars because I own the previous version of this product and can only imagine how good the new version will be.</li>
            <li> These liners are light and a great purchase. The motor in the liners are low as well. They&#x27;re a smooth cut and adjustable for how sharp of a line you&#x27;d like. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Only thing wrong with it is that you have to oil it. Has plenty of power, cuts close.</li>
            <li> This T edger is so precise, I use it to trim and edge my three boys hair.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product...........</li>
            <li> Great clippers!  Great for trimming the hairline and neck!</li>
            <li> Does great detail but not strong enough for over all trimming</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write a review for a product, but this good enough to take the time and do so. I use this trimmer to shave with. I am African American and really like a close shave. Because of in-gown hairs, this makes it very difficult to get a close shave. I like to shave every day. I have owned several electric trimmers through the years but have been less than satisfied. The Peanut shaver is the next best one that I have found.I have even tried using specialized methods with a good old single razor blades, but the bumps always come back and I have skin irritation. I have had the Andis trimmer for about a month and I could not be happier with it. It will cut almost as close as a razor blade, but with no bumps or skin irritation. Very smooth feel to the skin and a very close shave. It is by far the best electric shaver that I have ever owned (46years). I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to but much better for shaving my head and maintaining the bald look than any other clippers i&#x27;ve tried. And boy have i tried many! The down part would be that you have to oil it frequently and adjust the setting when you first get it, and the clippers can get a little warm. So be prepared. Otherwise 5/5 stars for this solid piece of equipment. It will get you closer than any clippers you will find. Trust me. Quality product.</li>
            <li> I received my order on time and I am very pleased with it... And Yes, I tried it immediately making sure it edges like most of the reviews stated it did....I was really skeptical at first and now I am glad I took a chance with this T-Edjer I am truly satisfied. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Received as a gift for trimming around edges, and was only able to use 3 times. Then motor slowed down to a faint vibration, not enough power to cut. Spoke to Andis who was convinced the blades were jammed, so had me remove to test motor. Still had problem. They told me I could mail it to an authorized repair shop, but would have to pay for repair since I do not have the receipt. It was a gift, so no receipt.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Have gotten a lot of use out of it so far. It really lives up to its specs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber for the last 27 years.. This is my choice of trimmers .. Tried all different types .</li>
            <li> Andis T- Edjer was shipped in a timely manner as agreed upon. The trimmers have worked great for my mustache and beard and I hope they last as long as my other Andis trimmers that I have owned for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re highly sensitive to razor blades in other forms of shaving these are the best trimmers to get the closest cut.</li>
            <li> Broke after one week, not happy</li>
            <li> Have bought two Andis buzzers. Have NO idea how any of the models have had more than one star. Terrible product. Both fell apart, LITERALLY stopped working, after about 10 uses. I beg of you, save your money. Find another product.</li>
            <li> This is the professional edger/trimmer that cannot be beaten in any arena!</li>
            <li> Worked great while it lasted. Two months of moderate use</li>
            <li> The trimmer it self worked fine but it gave up after a year of only occasional use and no longer functions so my rating is the average of I love it and now I hate it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a great buy.  It is professional grade and works better than a battery operated trimmer. The trimmer does not come with any additional blades or hair depth guides. It is perfect for trimming around the ears, sideburns and for cleaning up the hair at the back of the neck.</li>
            <li> Rusted really quickly!</li>
            <li> Not sure why some of the confusing reviews...&lt;br /&gt;I have owned the grey one and now the black one...it&#x27;s terrific.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job it is supposed to... and does it well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it doesn&#x27;t shave at all. So I tried it and it won&#x27;t even take a hair off of my arm!&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed</li>
            <li> I am an apprentice in a professional salon. I have used and tried a few different trimmers. This trimmer is dull and not powerful. It smelled burnt when I took it out of the box. It performs horribly and is not what I expected. #disappointed</li>
            <li> Great product. Does the job. Will have you line-up look sharp and professional.  They&#x27;re quiet and stay cool for a long time. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and recommend it for any one that that wants to keep a nice edge on their hairline. The only thing that I have a problem with is that this product is a little loud when in use. This is aa little annoying while using it. Other than that the trimmer cuts close and gives me a nice clean look that can only be beat by a straight razor. Overall I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I shave and trim my mustache with it daily.  I recieve minor razor bump while using this product.  I would recommend this to family and friends.  I first noticed the product while the barber was lining my son&#x27;s head then he line my beard and goatee.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the blades and it gives a clean cut, better than my Andis T-Outliner</li>
            <li> Best liner for barbers and grooming experts</li>
            <li> Great product for razor bump prone skin....</li>
            <li> I love these edgers. They give a perfect outline everytime. Andis is a great name brand tool to use in homes and barbershops.</li>
            <li> This is not good product</li>
            <li> Good quality at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was using the wahls detailers before and this was the best difference. amazon has the best price and these trimmers get right to skin and arent sharp at all. the blade is very small so its great for tight areas and all my work is coming out much cleaner. they are small but are very powerful. i have had no problems with these since i got them and now others are noticing them and the work ive been producing and are interested in buying them.</li>
            <li> trim guard always comes loose. didn&#x27;t even last me 1 year.</li>
            <li> A++++ Higly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this edger so I could give myself cleaner lines and edges than I was getting with my Andis Outliner II. After making a slight adjustment on the blades, the T-Edjer cuts like a dream. I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product , great price. Will remember next time, or will tell a friend. Better deal than a barber supply. my wife wants one.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my dad for Christmas and I just received them a couple of days ago (very fast standard shipping/no extra cost) and I gave my dad his clippers today because he was going to go to Sally&#x27;s and buy the same clippers at Sally&#x27;s for $100 dollars and I found them on Amazon for $40 ... He loves them and rushed to the bathroom to style his hair !!! I will recommend this this item to everyone ... So happy that I could make my dad smile before Christmas ... A early Christmas Gift for him !!! The shipping was fast ... It was suppose to take a month to receive but only took 4 to 6 days to receive !!! Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> if you look good then you feel good. if you feel well then you perform well1 premoting all around wellness to those protecting us and our beliefs</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming toes on my 2 small dogs.</li>
            <li> So my husband always wears out his trimmers cuz he&#x27;s constantly cleaning them. When he saw this he wanted to purchase it. I did, but when he received it, he claimed that it was making a strange noise. Um, Hello!?, It&#x27;s a trimmer, it&#x27;s supposed to be making noises!! So, anyway, I returned it for a refund. He should just stick to his PEANUT Wahl trimmer instead.</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer ever!, even that peanut crap is better as noisy a it is!</li>
            <li> As a barber this has limited use only. It is good for a small musctach trim or ear trim only. I had though it would help line short small areas better but was not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, it&#x27;s quiet, and lightweight</li>
            <li> It could have been better and sharper, like the andis t liner  which is much sharper and have better blades</li>
            <li> Go nowhere without your t outliner!</li>
            <li> My sisters bought this item for husband for Christmas. It was needed. It works well. He loves it!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is perfect!  It makes perfectly straight lines and has my man looking good!  I would highly recommend this to any man looking to have that Steve Harvey line without using a razor.</li>
            <li> Ordering was easy&lt;br /&gt;Product works great</li>
            <li> These clippers cut very well...maybe too well. I actually cut through my skin while lining the front of my hairline the 1st time. Have to get used to the closeness of the cut. Also had to adjust them but not an easy task - you almost need 2 sets of hands cause the blade keeps moving around whine you try to tighten the holding screw down. Good set of clippers nonetheless!</li>
            <li> LOVE  T EDGER ANYAY.  but i always hated  the puke salmon color they originally came in. The black adds style to and already great piece of equipment</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Edjer&amp;#34; worked smoothly for a while, but now it jams. I turn it on and the blades don&#x27;t move. I have to use my index finger to put pressure on the top of the blade in order to make it move. This I do again and again until finally the blade keeps moving without me having to push on it.</li>
            <li> This T-Edjer was exactly what he wanted. His older T-Edjer burned out a fuse so this was the perfect replacement. Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This item required disassembly to free the blades after 5 - 10 minutes of use almost from the day I bought it.  It is truly a worthless product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my dad&#x27;s birthday and they work GREAT!! So sharpe and the precision is perfect! They may get hot after you leave them on without stopping for more than 20 mins but besides that, perfection!!!</li>
            <li> just stoped working after about two months, just long enough to where i could not return it. aren&#x27;t i the lucky one</li>
            <li> if you need a good facial clipper, this is the one. smooth to the touch, not abbrasive like the cheaper clippers. Also, they don&#x27;t get too hot after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> The Andis T-Edjer Professional Hair Trimmer and T-Blade is just too cool... I use it to shave and it&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Black Man with in- grown facial hair, I have struggled all my life (I&#x27;m 62 now) in finding something that works consistently. Something that would not tear up my face. Something that would allow me to shave two or three days in a row (if required) without the associated soreness, bumping, and pain. The Andis T-Edjer Professional Hair Trimmer and T-Blade allows me to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had functions to attend three consecutive days where a clean shaven face was most preferred. The Andis Professional did the job &amp;#34;without&amp;#34; soreness, bumping or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would like to pass on a little trick that helps in getting an even closer shave. It will probably work for you as well whether you have in-grown facial hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the T-Edjer or any shaver like barber clippers, reverse the shaver.  In other words, use it the way a barber does when edging the back of your neck or edging your hairline.  You will be amazed by the close shave you will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of Black Men have difficulty in getting a comfortable shave. Those of you who have this problem know what I talking about. The Andis T-Edjer Professional is the answer for me and it just may be the answer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of quick tips that my enhance your shaving comfort:&lt;br /&gt;- Turn  the shaver on.&lt;br /&gt;- Put a very small drop of clipper oil on both edges and in the middle of the T.&lt;br /&gt;- Angle the shaver slightly downward so the oil does not back up into the motor. (Just wipe off the excess oil with a paper towel or whatever is handy.)&lt;br /&gt;- Use an old tooth brush to clear out the fine hairs on the shaver as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Turn the shaver off when brushing or clearing out the fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s it. That all I have to offer.  i hope you fine it helpful.</li>
            <li> Theses clippers are not sharp at all, not good for tapering or facial hair!!! I was very dissapointed with there performance.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers. They work great as long as you keep them oiled. They showed up on time too.</li>
            <li> I am trained as a barber and they work great!</li>
            <li> Work great, zero gap the blade, lines, mustaches and beards great, owned mine since 06</li>
            <li> This does not shave as close as it should. It gets too hot while in use.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves these.  The trim is very close and easy to handle he also shaves his head and these work perfect for that too!</li>
            <li> Great product, and great services.</li>
            <li> i use this about every friday for the past 2 months now and still works great. might also be because i oil it after evvery use to keep it running smooth.</li>
            <li> Not able to adjust to sharpen. Good for shaving not for shaping.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s second Andis t-edger trimmer.  Over the years he has tried many brands of trimmers but the Andis brand has always had a better cut. The first one lasted about 20 years so he decided he wanted a new one.  He is sensitive to electric shavers so trimmers works well for him when it comes to trimming his mustache, beard and lining himself(He also gives me a good neck line). It it sharp but not too sharp that it cuts you or bites. He uses it everyday and it only take him a few minutes to groom himself. An excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Just got it yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over a year using expensive 5 blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T-Eder cuts really close.  I think I&#x27;ll be saving $ by not using razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lose of one star because unit gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers.. I also love the Brand.... Great investment will purchase again! i totally recommend this product to anyone who cuts.</li>
            <li> Great sharp clippers once they are adjusted</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd T-Edjer. My first was bought in the 1970&#x27;s. I replaced the blade once because it dropped against something and a couple of teeth broke off. They don&#x27;t have a blade guard for it.Probably too small. I had the switch replaced once. In the last year it has started to balk a little bit and I assumed the motor was beginning to wear out. It has been a model of consistency through the years.  It is by far the most precise trimmer I have ever used. I use it to trim around my ears, my neckline, my beard line around my neck and cheeks, and to shorten the hair on my face if I haven&#x27;t shaved for too many days. Then the electric razor can give me a clean shave. It is relatively quiet, but powerful. The key probably is to ensure that you use the lubricating oil provided for optimal performance. It&#x27;s also a good idea to put it in a small box or baggy to protect it given the issue with the delicate teeth. I am amazed at how well designed this product was and still is and how it is still the best out their for precise trimming. I&#x27;ve had cheaper trimmers over the years and no longer have them because they didn&#x27;t hold up. I would like to have it rechargeable but then you run into the battery giving out and the trimmer still being perfectly good. That probably is the key to it&#x27;s longevity. The only difference in this trimmer from my previous is that the housing was flesh colored instead of black. The price is reasonable, I think I paid about $30 that many years ago for the other one.</li>
