            <li> Was just as represented. Used on some muscle.gave immediate relief.</li>
            <li> The oil has a very strong smell so a little will go a long way.I think it is a very good product. DeShane</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered fast</li>
            <li> Wow-fantastic oil. This is super strong, like their peppermint oil. It really has staying power and has agreat scent that is super fresh and smells like Winto-green life savers. This one is just great and I will be needing more, like a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in a rub recipe for back and sciatica , which I haven&#x27;t made yet.. it smells wonderful..using as an air freshner.. put a drop the the trash bag and I&#x27;m sure I will find more uses.</li>
            <li> I have several of plant therapy essential oils and they all seem very nice.  I got this to make my own version of a headache soother roll-on.</li>
            <li> Great oil, LOVE the smell use in oil mix for bad knees</li>
            <li> Good scent, not cloying.  Has scent on cap top which is useful when stored away.</li>
            <li> Wintergreen is supposed to be a bit controversial but it works as well as any other on deep pain for me, especially on the awful flu-like aches so I can sleep. I have enjoyed PT&#x27;s wintergreen as much as any I have tried. It lasts for a long time when I use it and is not greasy or sticky. The smell is not astringent-like, as I have picked up in others. I will be using PT&#x27;s wintergreen indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!! Only takes about three drops in the diffuser and it smells great all day!</li>
            <li> Smells just the way I had hoped, like the old Brach&#x27;s Wintergreen Candies.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the aroma would last longer, I&#x27;m using in a scent burner, any ideas?</li>
            <li> I have gray hair....so my shampoo and conditioner have a funky smell to keep me from getting a strange yellow color to it. I add these oils to make it smell a lot better and tolerable!!! THEY STINK GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using plant therapy products for a while now &amp; I must say I was shocked by the price &amp; the quality....I&#x27;ve completely quit ordering from my other supplier which was very expensive &amp; the shipping was very expensive also...&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is fast too....&lt;br /&gt;NEEDLESS TOO STAY I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED W/ THE PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy provides excellent essential oils.  Wintergreen Essential Oil is just one of many of their products that I have used repeatedly.  I use most of them as aroma therapy for my allergies.  They work if you find the one or combination of oils that work for your system.  Some will not work on you.  Your system doesn&#x27;t need it.  Surprisingly, my older dog who has allergies, responds very well to these products!</li>
            <li> great and fast shipping.  very good quality oil &amp; helped my muscles greatly</li>
            <li> Good oil for topical pain relief</li>
            <li> I honestly literally couldn&#x27;t wait for this to arrive. My relative suffers from chronic pain and this was just the ticket. The only drawback was when we found out it could only be used short term.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil as ordered!  Will get it again.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant scent.  I bought it to put in my pain cream and my skin care cream.  I use it in combination with other oils. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I like this product for my homemade toothpaste favor. Peppermint makes my stomach upset. Going back to making my own at least i know whats in it. Hate the chemicals and additives,don&#x27;t need them , and want them.THANX for other alternatives!!!  PH</li>
            <li> I have been buying all my essential oils from Plant Therapy as of late. I think they are the best (you may differ) and their price is quite fair since I like a large quantity. I cannot write a separate review on all those that I have bought so please know, if this review is here, I love this product.</li>
