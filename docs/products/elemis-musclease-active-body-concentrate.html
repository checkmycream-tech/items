            <li>I have diabetes and my feet were dry and cracked most of the time.</li>
            <li>I have found that the Musclease oil really soaks into the scars and rope-like adhesions and helps to loosen them up.  </li>
            <li>, I use it on my knees, when the muscles ache from climbing stairs too much.  </li>
            <li>After massaging my entire body, I sleep soundly.</li>
            <li>We mix Musclease with Instant Refreshing Gel and rub then rub it into our neck, shoulders and back.</li>
            <li>My mother is 84 years old with lots of aches and pains.</li>
            <li>To prevent the knots, you really need to use it daily when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It is same product just new updated packaging with new wording.</li>
            <li>After three years or so it was empty and I always check at Amazon first.</li>
            <li>But when I use these products my pain will go away generally by the next day.</li>

            <li> It lasted a long time because you only use a drop or two at a time.  </li>
            <li> I called &amp; reached no one, then called back shortly and was forwarded to their overload call center.</li>
            <li> Costly for a product that you may not use long term.  </li>

            <li> They were quick in getting the wrong item to me.</li>
            <li> I have not used this long enough to know what the long-term benefits are from this therapy but at least initially it seems to be helping and offer some short-term relief.  </li>
            <li> This is not even close to what I bought a few years ago on the cruise, it smells like fish oil and have a different contincency...</li>
            <li> Yes this is expensive but worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it to other diabetics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had prescription creams, compounds, and any other muscle cream you can think of from doctors.</li>
            <li> I note much less tightness of the adhesions for a while, and actually seem to get some relief, albeit temporary from some of the pain and discomfort due to the skin and scars being less tight.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Elemis musclease active body concentrate as shown at Amazon.com and received Elemis musclease active body oil.</li>
            <li> On 03-09, I ordered elemis musclease active body concentrate not body oil.</li>
            <li> My 81-yr old Mother was also sick and ached the same--too much bed time.  </li>
            <li> Will be trying out other Elemis products!</li>
            <li> yes it is expensive, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews.  </li>
            <li> The concentrate is priced at $48.98 and the oil is usually priced around $42.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been sick all week and in bed way to much for my body.</li>

            <li> This is not even close to what I bought a few years ago on the cruise, it smells like fish oil and have a different contincency...watery. I do not recommend to buy this from this seller, I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely amazing.  Like everyone else here, I purchased this product after having a great massage on a cruise.  About 12 years ago I was severely burned over almost 1/2 my body, and as a result I have many scars, adhesions, and skin grafts.  My doctors tell me I am one of the \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; ones who&#x27;s scars continue to contract, which causes me lots of discomfort and pain.  I have found that the Musclease oil really soaks into the scars and rope-like adhesions and helps to loosen them up.  I note much less tightness of the adhesions for a while, and actually seem to get some relief, albeit temporary from some of the pain and discomfort due to the skin and scars being less tight.  I also sometimes use some of the Instant Refreshing Gel in conjunction with the oil and it makes for a great combination.  I have not used this long enough to know what the long-term benefits are from this therapy but at least initially it seems to be helping and offer some short-term relief.  I highly recommend this product so far, even though it is somewhat expensive IMHO.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with a massage on a cruise ship 2 years ago and forgot about it until I came across it in my bathroom this week.  I&#x27;d been sick all week and in bed way to much for my body. No position was comfortable anymore. I used this oil after a shower and within minutes my back and butt aches were practically gone! My 81-yr old Mother was also sick and ached the same--too much bed time.  I rubbed her back side down from neck to ankles and she slept the best in ages that night--until 10:30 the next morning. &lt;br /&gt;She had to have me find more of this product for her to have!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product while on vacation in Hawaii.  I suffer from Fibromyalgia that can affect several areas on my body at the same time.  This product takes away the pain without the use of aspirin.  I was told that it can be used on your forehead if you have a headache.  I have not tried this as yet but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it.</li>
            <li> Garbage. And non-responsive seller. Different from what I got on cruise ship&lt;br /&gt;Trash</li>
            <li> My favorite massage oil and worth every penny</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this I was on a cruise.  It lasted a long time because you only use a drop or two at a time.  I ran out and this is bottle number two, I use it on my knees, when the muscles ache from climbing stairs too much.  It works terrific.</li>
            <li> The subject of this book is fascinating, the life of Jews living in the USSR during the 1920&#x27;s. Where it fails for me is having&lt;br /&gt;characters that I would find interesting or appealing.</li>
            <li> People need to know that the Concentrate is now updated to read Oil. It is same product just new updated packaging with new wording. Same ingredients...</li>
            <li> Yes this is expensive but worth the price.  I have a lot of muscle pain and use this quite often.  A little goes a long way, so it does last a long time.  It really does help my pain and smells good too.</li>
            <li> yes it is expensive, but a little goes a long way.  Absolutely a wonderful massage oil.</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and my feet were dry and cracked most of the time. Now that I&#x27;m using Elems Musclease. My feet are much better. I have recommended it to other diabetics.</li>
            <li> We mix Musclease with Instant Refreshing Gel and rub then rub it into our neck, shoulders and back. It unwinds the tension for rest.</li>
            <li> My mother is 84 years old with lots of aches and pains. Even though this is an expensive product she continues to use it and doesn&#x27;t want to go without it. When anyone complains about joint pain she wants to rub them down.</li>
            <li> i bought a bottle of it on a Carnival cruise ship in the Spa. After three years or so it was empty and I always check at Amazon first. Found it and it helps not only when muscles hurt, alwo for most head aches, when my knee hurts and also I use it on an ant bite that hurts from time to time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I don&#x27;t usually write reviews.  Purchased it on a cruise, I was sick on the cruise. Bronchitis that required breathing treatments, steroids, and oxygen. Fibro was acting up. I hurt all over. Went to the spa for a massage. Bought this, bath, and muscle gel.  It works! I&#x27;d rub it on my aching body, and was able to get out and enjoy the cruise. I&#x27;ve had prescription creams, compounds, and any other muscle cream you can think of from doctors. None compare to this miracle in a bottle! I&#x27;m a believer now and will always keep a bottle handy! It&#x27;s pricey, but we&#x27;ll worth every penny! Will be trying out other Elemis products!</li>
            <li> Very nice massage oil. Pleasant scent and quality oil absorbs well. I am disappointed only because this was compared to the pain/ache relieving qualities of Bengay or IcyHot and we have not found that to be the case. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good for a light massage.  Costly for a product that you may not use long term.  Does provide stimulation to your limbs.  Decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> Received the basic version of this product not the concentrate that I ordered but needed it so badly that I havn&#x27;t taken the time to let the supplier know of the mistake musleease is a great product in any form I would still like to receive the concentrate of this formula.</li>
            <li> The aroma alone relaxes you.  Great product to use after Elemis muscle ease herbal bath synergy soak in you tub.  I feel like I&#x27;m back in the spa.</li>
            <li> I use this product before I go to bed. After massaging my entire body, I sleep soundly. It helps relieve restless legs and relaxes my entire body.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Elemis musclease active body concentrate as shown at Amazon.com and received Elemis musclease active body oil. This is not what I wanted. No phone answered.</li>
            <li> I, like the others, bought this on a cruise.  Within 5 minutes, I can get the deepest knots out from under my shoulder blades.  To prevent the knots, you really need to use it daily when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Have found this effective by using after bath and before bed.  Have used for six years and have massage therapist use during massage to gain most relief.</li>
            <li> Always enjoyed muscle ease especially when my calves ache at night.  Great product and received it quickly with no problems. ****</li>
            <li> I use this product with the refreshing gel at night on my hips and thighs. I sometimes get terrible aches and pains in that area. But when I use these products my pain will go away generally by the next day. I love it!</li>
            <li> I did not take heed to the previous beware!!!-----they sent the wrong product to me too-No customer service. They were quick in getting the wrong item to me. On 03-09, I ordered elemis musclease active body concentrate not body oil. Rec&#x27;d the wrong product today, 03-15. The concentrate is priced at $48.98 and the oil is usually priced around $42.00. I called &amp; reached no one, then called back shortly and was forwarded to their overload call center. I was getting this as a birthday present for the 23rd. BEWARE........Don&#x27;t order this item from them, the same thing will happen to you.</li>
