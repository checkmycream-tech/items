            <li>my skin looks amazing.......</li>
            <li>I waited to give a review after using it to give honest results.</li>
            <li>I used to use a product called Avalon Organics CoQ10 Repair but the formula has changed and it is not as effective now.  </li>
            <li>I apply while my skin is damp from my toner, then rose hip oil over it.</li>
            <li>I am 56 and have pretty good skin; this has me passing on botox and the rest of those poison injections!</li>
            <li>Love Clinique and this is easy to use!  </li>
            <li>It very light</li>
            <li>In two days I saw a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>Since using Repairwear Laser Focus I have received many, many compliments on how I look.  </li>
            <li>This product is better than Botox.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles around my eyes are noticeably better.</li>
            <li>Seems okay</li>
            <li>My skin feels better and looks nicer.  </li>
            <li>and ive used many products....</li>
            <li>I love Clinique and Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I have purchased more of these since.</li>
            <li>I am going to give it a couple more weeks and see how I feel.  </li>
            <li>I also use TimeWise by MaryKay which I like better than Lancome.  </li>
            <li>Fully satisfied and recommend anyone else to buy this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I used this product for more than 2 weeks, I do not see the result as most of 5 stars review claim.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t repaired anything yet, and my brown spots have not faded, but I&#x27;m going to give it more time.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>maybe you will have a better result.....</li>
            <li>I love the product and am very happy to have been able to get this size so I could try it out before committing to a larger size.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that works very well on me.</li>
            <li>This product is okay, nothing too special.</li>
            <li>I have tried every time of skin care line available and, while some have worked better than others, I consider this product at the top of my list right now.  </li>
            <li>But this serum smooths my fine lines, and tones my skin.  </li>
            <li>Product is fine.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend to any person 40 plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of lancome</li>
            <li>I tried this Clinique product within three days I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference...</li>
            <li>I will  buy a huge bottle and spend the $150.00 ...</li>
            <li>but what I got was a free sample and</li>
            <li>( sample size not for re-sale), they want a lot for a free product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with Clinique&#x27;s Repairwear.  </li>
            <li>ANOTHER 2-week supply FREE.</li>
            <li>My face just was so smooth and it evened out the tones on my skin...</li>
            <li>However, I could have gotten these bottles for free at the Clinique counter.</li>
            <li>The serum goes on smoothly and seems to reduce the signs of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is sample which you could get it free</li>
            <li>nice lotion don&#x27;t leave a oily feel absorbes fast leaves</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, it goes on smoothly and covers my face and neck very easily.</li>
            <li>I have a year of shopping online, Amazon, and this is the first time that I have not been satisfied with the</li>
            <li>Originally I got this product as a free gift with Clinique foundation, and loved it so much that when it ran out, I really missed it.</li>
            <li>I expect to make a purchase then and it will be worth it!</li>
            <li>I overlooked the fact these items were travel samples, however there is no difference from these samples as the original repairware.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it is worth just treating yourself, when you see such great results.</li>
            <li>The mini-bottles are great when traveling, or just taking up minimal space in a make-up bag.</li>
            <li>when I ordered the product I thought I was getting a full sized bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a definate difference using it over a short period of time, my lines have reduced in appearance and my skin feels good</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased and definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Like my favorite turnaround cream only better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much, but it&#x27;s always good to start early and be pro-active, rather that reactive with skin care.  </li>
            <li>Skin texture is better, overall color is more even.</li>
            <li>It blends wonderfully under make up..when the little bottles that I purchased runs out, I think I will probably seek out a larger bottle of this lovely liquid..</li>
            <li>Fine lines around the eyes are gently disappearing.</li>
            <li>A big savings if one plans to continue using this amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to spend much money on skin care products, but after a free sample of this stuff, I could tell it was worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>well worth $5 a bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice facial lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinique Serum for years, I think it&#x27;s the best on the market after trying several other brands.</li>
            <li>As of right now, I would say with 90% certainty I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that after my first two weeks, I am starting to see a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 30 and don&#x27;t have much in the way of real &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; but was looking for something to put my fine lines on hold.</li>
            <li>maybe it just needs a little more time to show me some change for the better......</li>
            <li>My first order got lost somewhere and the vendor made it right by re-sending to me.</li>
            <li>This little bottle has a wonderful, silky, soft, fast absorbing, silicone feel, to it..</li>
            <li>and I actually noticed my face looking more refreshed after using it for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Saw some improvement, but it is ineffective on deep wrinkles ; most of which I have at 65 years of age.</li>
            <li>If that bothers you just be aware.</li>
            <li>Wrinkle are not a worry since I use this magical product, it makes my day, you  look younger, and feel as you look .</li>
            <li>Since Macy&#x27;s wanted $132 for the same amount of the product I looked for a better deal to &amp;#34;try it&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Love the way my skin looks next morning.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying looking 10 yrs younger with this product !!!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than what they tried selling me at the Spa on the cruise ship!</li>
            <li>The first bottle diminished the appearance of the scars.</li>
            <li>This is the first time trying the antiwrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li>ny face and neck feeling soft and smooth will buy again</li>
            <li>Easily covered with Bare Minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to get these, but at my age, not sure the product itself will be that significant in changes, but I appreciate the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Overall my skin appears much firmer, more even and healthier.</li>
            <li>really works and it&#x27;s fast!</li>
            <li>I started using this stuff about 8 months ago and have really seen a visible difference.</li>
            <li>Two of these trial bottle equals the smaller bottle that&#x27;s available retail for $42.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants to focus on wrinkles and sun damage.</li>
            <li>Pores are much diminished and any flakiness is gone.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 5 weeks and really am seeing a difference in my skin tone and imperfections.  </li>
            <li>I have very sentive combo skin.</li>
            <li>and this really produces results without unwanted side effects.</li>
            <li>I am sure part of this was due to retiring from my high-stress job, but I give 5 years credit for it to Clinique Repairwear Laser Focus.</li>
            <li>B004BWPQS4 CLINIQUE NEW!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I got my first free sample while shopping at a major department store - a two week trial, had to make an appointment to return the empty bottle in two weeks for a Consultation</li>
            <li>Only compaint is I do not have a Clinique stockist close by, so I need to purchase on-line, in my opinion it is definately worth the 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much as far as wrinkles, but I was hoping for  a more even skin tone and lightening of dark spots, but so far have not seen any improvement.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and notice a huge difference in the dark sun spots on my face.</li>
            <li>It was a complete hoax!</li>
            <li>I had noticed my skin seemed softer and less noticeable fine lines.</li>
            <li>For the first 30 days I used it only on one side of my face.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so soft after use!</li>
            <li>You are paying for a &amp;#34;free sample&amp;#34; that clearly says &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I guess I will have to buy direct from the Clinique site directly from now on.  </li>
            <li>I am fifty eight years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed with skin that hasn&#x27;t wrinkled much, although it could be my daily regimen of another product.</li>
            <li>Clinique&#x27;s Repairwear  is a very close 2nd.  </li>
            <li>Just exactly the same as the product in a larger size my wife uses... and a bargain price, too.</li>
            <li>I am not satisfied with the product, besides being in the extreme small, you lasted more than 3 weeks to send it and ubieron many problems with management.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30, and my skin is definitely showing signs of age; not the plump, tight, poreless, wrinkle free skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did much besides dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Laugh lines around my mouth were gone in less than 2 hours after 1st application.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is not a pipet, or dispenser with this, but I just apply a few drops to the back of my hand and then apply it with my fingertips to my face, then smooth it in.</li>
            <li>My skin is just a little bit too sensitive right now</li>
            <li>The bottles were properly sealed and sent in a very professional manner--I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old and have tried several products.  </li>
            <li>I normally use all-natural products, however age is winning the battle and I needed something to slow down the process.</li>
            <li>,i think it is useful for the skin of the face,although it is a little expensive :)</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>And I apply it around my mouth as it has really helped those little lines the lipstick tend to bleed into.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have noticed a definate difference using it over a short period of time, my lines have reduced in appearance and my skin feels good</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased and definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like my favorite turnaround cream only better.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much, but it&#x27;s always good to start early and be pro-active, rather that reactive with skin care.  </li>
            <li> Skin texture is better, overall color is more even.</li>
            <li> It blends wonderfully under make up..when the little bottles that I purchased runs out, I think I will probably seek out a larger bottle of this lovely liquid..</li>
            <li> Fine lines around the eyes are gently disappearing.</li>
            <li> A big savings if one plans to continue using this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to spend much money on skin care products, but after a free sample of this stuff, I could tell it was worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> well worth $5 a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice facial lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique Serum for years, I think it&#x27;s the best on the market after trying several other brands.</li>
            <li> As of right now, I would say with 90% certainty I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that after my first two weeks, I am starting to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 30 and don&#x27;t have much in the way of real &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; but was looking for something to put my fine lines on hold.</li>
            <li> maybe it just needs a little more time to show me some change for the better......</li>
            <li> My first order got lost somewhere and the vendor made it right by re-sending to me.</li>
            <li> This little bottle has a wonderful, silky, soft, fast absorbing, silicone feel, to it..</li>
            <li> and I actually noticed my face looking more refreshed after using it for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Saw some improvement, but it is ineffective on deep wrinkles ; most of which I have at 65 years of age.</li>
            <li> If that bothers you just be aware.</li>
            <li> Wrinkle are not a worry since I use this magical product, it makes my day, you  look younger, and feel as you look .</li>
            <li> Since Macy&#x27;s wanted $132 for the same amount of the product I looked for a better deal to &amp;#34;try it&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Love the way my skin looks next morning.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying looking 10 yrs younger with this product !!!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than what they tried selling me at the Spa on the cruise ship!</li>
            <li> The first bottle diminished the appearance of the scars.</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying the antiwrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li> ny face and neck feeling soft and smooth will buy again</li>
            <li> Easily covered with Bare Minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to get these, but at my age, not sure the product itself will be that significant in changes, but I appreciate the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Overall my skin appears much firmer, more even and healthier.</li>
            <li> really works and it&#x27;s fast!</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff about 8 months ago and have really seen a visible difference.</li>
            <li> Two of these trial bottle equals the smaller bottle that&#x27;s available retail for $42.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who wants to focus on wrinkles and sun damage.</li>
            <li> Pores are much diminished and any flakiness is gone.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 5 weeks and really am seeing a difference in my skin tone and imperfections.  </li>
            <li> I have very sentive combo skin.</li>
            <li> and this really produces results without unwanted side effects.</li>
            <li> I am sure part of this was due to retiring from my high-stress job, but I give 5 years credit for it to Clinique Repairwear Laser Focus.</li>
            <li> B004BWPQS4 CLINIQUE NEW!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got my first free sample while shopping at a major department store - a two week trial, had to make an appointment to return the empty bottle in two weeks for a Consultation</li>
            <li> Only compaint is I do not have a Clinique stockist close by, so I need to purchase on-line, in my opinion it is definately worth the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much as far as wrinkles, but I was hoping for  a more even skin tone and lightening of dark spots, but so far have not seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and notice a huge difference in the dark sun spots on my face.</li>
            <li> It was a complete hoax!</li>
            <li> I had noticed my skin seemed softer and less noticeable fine lines.</li>
            <li> For the first 30 days I used it only on one side of my face.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so soft after use!</li>
            <li> You are paying for a &amp;#34;free sample&amp;#34; that clearly says &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I guess I will have to buy direct from the Clinique site directly from now on.  </li>
            <li> I am fifty eight years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with skin that hasn&#x27;t wrinkled much, although it could be my daily regimen of another product.</li>
            <li> Clinique&#x27;s Repairwear  is a very close 2nd.  </li>
            <li> Just exactly the same as the product in a larger size my wife uses... and a bargain price, too.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with the product, besides being in the extreme small, you lasted more than 3 weeks to send it and ubieron many problems with management.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30, and my skin is definitely showing signs of age; not the plump, tight, poreless, wrinkle free skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did much besides dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Laugh lines around my mouth were gone in less than 2 hours after 1st application.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is not a pipet, or dispenser with this, but I just apply a few drops to the back of my hand and then apply it with my fingertips to my face, then smooth it in.</li>
            <li> My skin is just a little bit too sensitive right now</li>
            <li> The bottles were properly sealed and sent in a very professional manner--I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and have tried several products.  </li>
            <li> I normally use all-natural products, however age is winning the battle and I needed something to slow down the process.</li>
            <li> ,i think it is useful for the skin of the face,although it is a little expensive :)</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> And I apply it around my mouth as it has really helped those little lines the lipstick tend to bleed into.  </li>
            <li> no different than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.....  I have only been using it a week now, but according to the advertising I should be seeing signs of change for the better and alas, I do not......  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually fall for the hype, but this time I bought into it and much to my dismay.....  </li>
            <li> I am only 34, and am an advocate of preventative maintenance, so maybe that &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; factor isn&#x27;t going to be as obvious with the other products because maybe I am maintaining and</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was a little uncertain of this product in that the bottle was opaque and different from the same product and size I was given at the Clinique counter.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure that I see a big difference in my actual wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but it just wasn&#x27;t doing anything for my very dry skin that needed some help.  </li>
            <li> Not much in the way of change.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I was curious so bought some for husband and</li>
            <li> I purchased the double package of the sample size as it is a little less expensive than a full size, and packs well.</li>
            <li> the price other serums worked just as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s empty promises of &amp;#34;youth!</li>
            <li> You can check my other reviews.</li>
            <li> Will not use any other stuff from here on out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even really start to use it until a few days ago and in those few days, I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> One dark spot is still there but less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> but like the dark spot, are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> These little sample bottles are cheaper than buying from Clinique.</li>
            <li> Wish it could be a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> My skin has a fresher look and the sun spots and melia (little cysty bumps) have started to disappear.</li>
            <li> In a lot of ways, it made it look worse because it left scars.</li>
            <li> If you buy the trial products, 4 of the small bottles lasted me 2.5 months.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it is working just yet,</li>
            <li> Just remember they are small bottles.</li>
            <li> but because the bottle is opaque and the amount is a small</li>
            <li> the packaging is very small and not worth the price you pay, it&#x27;s a big disappointment and not buy you but never to that vendor.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait at least 3 weeks before I wrote a review.  </li>
            <li> I guess the item is as described, but it is very small in reality.</li>
            <li> it made my face and eyes burn and itch, it was not good.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old, and I had that turtleneck look to the base of my neck.</li>
            <li> So they must have been broken off a sample offer somewhere.  </li>
            <li> I am just shy of 52 and have had a problem with break outs as well as fighting wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Skeptical</li>
            <li> For the price, it is not too bad.  </li>
            <li> but of course we&#x27;re all our worst critics</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked like a charm for me- follow the directions and use it twice a day- I use only Clinique products</li>
            <li> This is excellent.  It moisterizes my skin without leaving it greasy.  It very light and I actually noticed my face looking more refreshed after using it for a couple of weeks.  I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments that I look like I have no stress.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel nor see any difference on my skin.. so won&#x27;t be buying these again.. good try though...</li>
            <li> I bought the product because I have used and is very good but what I got was a free sample and the packaging is very small and not worth the price you pay, it&#x27;s a big disappointment and not buy you but never to that vendor. It was a complete hoax!</li>
            <li> This product is okay, nothing too special. It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel any smoother and I haven&#x27;t seen any results, although I&#x27;m not exactly sure what kinds of results I am exactly supposed to see....</li>
            <li> This product does work. I had noticed my skin seemed softer and less noticeable fine lines. After using it for about 6 weeks I attended a party at which a former employee said I looked 10 years younger! I am sure part of this was due to retiring from my high-stress job, but I give 5 years credit for it to Clinique Repairwear Laser Focus. I will continue to use this. I purchased the double package of the sample size as it is a little less expensive than a full size, and packs well.</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff about 8 months ago and have really seen a visible difference. Wrinkles on forehead and even my &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;s are diminished.  And I apply it around my mouth as it has really helped those little lines the lipstick tend to bleed into.  I am 56 and have pretty good skin; this has me passing on botox and the rest of those poison injections!</li>
            <li> I like it ,i think it is useful for the skin of the face,although it is a little expensive :)</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with the product, besides being in the extreme small, you lasted more than 3 weeks to send it and ubieron many problems with management.  I have a year of shopping online, Amazon, and this is the first time that I have not been satisfied with the product.[[ASIN:B004BWPQS4 CLINIQUE NEW! REPAIRWEAR LASER FOCUS Wrinkle &amp; UV Damage Corrector 2 X 0.5 OZ &#x3D; 1 OZ / 30 ML]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a Huge difference with my skin!! It clarifies and got s rid of my wrinkles between my brows 100 percent!!! being 41, I don&#x27;t want any wrinkles anyplace yet!!</li>
            <li> e on the back of the bottle it says ( sample size not for re-sale), they want a lot for a free product.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and the results it provided.</li>
            <li> Saw some improvement, but it is ineffective on deep wrinkles ; most of which I have at 65 years of age.</li>
            <li> Since using Repairwear Laser Focus I have received many, many compliments on how I look.  Before using it I got Botox injections around my eyes and now I don&#x27;t.  This product is better than Botox. The wrinkles around my eyes are noticeably better. I could not be more pleased and definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used the trial product when it was introduced at Macy&#x27;s.  Being that this serum is fairly pricey I searched to see if I could get it cheaper online.  Two of these trial bottle equals the smaller bottle that&#x27;s available retail for $42. A big savings if one plans to continue using this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to spend much money on skin care products, but after a free sample of this stuff, I could tell it was worth the investment.  I&#x27;m 30, and my skin is definitely showing signs of age; not the plump, tight, poreless, wrinkle free skin it was 10 years ago. But this serum smooths my fine lines, and tones my skin.  I know aging is inevitable, but this helps ease me into it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to get these, but at my age, not sure the product itself will be that significant in changes, but I appreciate the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> when I ordered the product I thought I was getting a full sized bottle.  Instead I got two sample bottles that said not for retail sale.  So they must have been broken off a sample offer somewhere.  Product is fine.  Just don&#x27;t like the idea of getting someone else&#x27;s samples.  I guess I will have to buy direct from the Clinique site directly from now on.  I gave it a three stars which is generous.</li>
            <li> Seems okay but fo r the price other serums worked just as well</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I see a big difference in my actual wrinkles around my eyes.  They were pretty small to begin with but of course we&#x27;re all our worst critics so maybe I just don&#x27;t see it.  I have been using it about 3 weeks now 2x a day.  My skin feels better and looks nicer.  The packaging I got was a sample that they resold even though it says not for resale on it.  If that bothers you just be aware.</li>
            <li> Wrinkle are not a worry since I use this magical product, it makes my day, you  look younger, and feel as you look .</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin looked after using for a couple of weeks. I am fifty eight years old. It does give skin a smoother look.</li>
            <li> Laugh lines around my mouth were gone in less than 2 hours after 1st application. A fairly deep wrinkle in my forehead; gone within 2 hours. Sagging skin on my neck firmed up, as well as my jowls are now gone. This stuff is amazing! Puffiness around eyes even seems diminished.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did much besides dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Since Macy&#x27;s wanted $132 for the same amount of the product I looked for a better deal to &amp;#34;try it&amp;#34;.  For the first 30 days I used it only on one side of my face.  Not much in the way of change.  My dermatologist used to work for Clinique and said any product needs time to work.  So, still using, now on both sides of my face, and hoping for the best.  I guarantee I will not be buying this at Macy&#x27;s; what a rip off.</li>
            <li> This little bottle has a wonderful, silky, soft, fast absorbing, silicone feel, to it..It blends wonderfully under make up..when the little bottles that I purchased runs out, I think I will probably seek out a larger bottle of this lovely liquid..</li>
            <li> I have done A LOT of research on facial products. I have used and continue to use Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, Phloretin, E, Retina-A, LaGratiae&#x27;s Lift, but nothing was giving me that &amp;#34;wow, I LOOK different&amp;#34; appearance.  I am only 34, and am an advocate of preventative maintenance, so maybe that &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; factor isn&#x27;t going to be as obvious with the other products because maybe I am maintaining and preventing-- but I still wanted something that made me feel like my money was well-spent and something I could SEE. So, I did a lot of research on this product, read the trials, read the reviews, researched the ingredients etc. I purchased this April 6, Today is June 26. I waited to give a review after using it to give honest results. I can say this: This product has shrunken my pores, my skin IS smoother, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it brighter (vit. c will) it just makes it look smoother, finer, and as if I had a laser procedure. Just as it promises. I can tell you, you don&#x27;t find a lot of products that actually deliver what they say they will. It&#x27;s empty promises of &amp;#34;youth! No lines! Miracle Overnight!&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re left waiting to actually SEE the results. You can check my other reviews. I do not work for this company, and am RARELY an impressed buyer. But this product turned me from skeptic to regular consumer. If you buy the trial products, 4 of the small bottles lasted me 2.5 months. well worth $5 a bottle. Do research on the sellers, some are selling at $10 a bottle and you can find it cheaper.</li>
            <li> it made my face and eyes burn and itch, it was not good.</li>
            <li> You are paying for a &amp;#34;free sample&amp;#34; that clearly says &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34;.  I have been using it for 3 or 4 weeks and have seen no results at all.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much as far as wrinkles, but I was hoping for  a more even skin tone and lightening of dark spots, but so far have not seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> My skin is just a little bit too sensitive right now so I have to hold off and using it but I hope to see you soon you have to just check with your doctor to see if you can use something like this but it&#x27;s supposed to be very good I can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
            <li> Love Clinique and this is easy to use!  Would recommend this to anyone who wants to focus on wrinkles and sun damage.</li>
            <li> While on vacation, I went into an Ulta store for some foundation, and walked out with a .5 oz bottle of this. I didn&#x27;t even really start to use it until a few days ago and in those few days, I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. I am 57 years old, and I had that turtleneck look to the base of my neck. Not anymore. It firmed it and gave it a smoother appearance. I use it all over my face and neck, not just the areas that have wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been blessed with skin that hasn&#x27;t wrinkled much, although it could be my daily regimen of another product. Try this and see if you don&#x27;t notice a difference immediately. I recommend taking before pictures so you have something to compare the results to.</li>
            <li> Like my favorite turnaround cream only better.  Love the way my skin looks next morning.  Pores are much diminished and any flakiness is gone.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement.  The bottles to say not for resale on them, hmm.</li>
            <li> Not what the hype says.  L&#x27;Oreal works just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique Serum for years, I think it&#x27;s the best on the market after trying several other brands. It actually changes the texture of your skin and makes it softer and smoother. These little sample bottles are cheaper than buying from Clinique.</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff ive used on my face and ive used many products....this corrector does just that...my skin looks amazing.......and i use it on my neck as well.....................wont be without it......excellent product.....love it</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> i heard about this product from a friend and i wa not dissapointed .it does what it describes my skin is improving after 1 bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 30 and don&#x27;t have much in the way of real &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; but was looking for something to put my fine lines on hold. I don&#x27;t need much, but it&#x27;s always good to start early and be pro-active, rather that reactive with skin care.  This is a fast-drying, non-irritating formula that looks flawless under make-up, and has reduced my &amp;#34;baby crow&#x27;s feel&amp;#34; noticeably. The mini-bottles are great when traveling, or just taking up minimal space in a make-up bag. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Originally I got this product as a free gift with Clinique foundation, and loved it so much that when it ran out, I really missed it. I have noticed a definate difference using it over a short period of time, my lines have reduced in appearance and my skin feels good, I can not think of any negatives. Yes, there is not a pipet, or dispenser with this, but I just apply a few drops to the back of my hand and then apply it with my fingertips to my face, then smooth it in. Sometimes it is worth just treating yourself, when you see such great results. Only compaint is I do not have a Clinique stockist close by, so I need to purchase on-line, in my opinion it is definately worth the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any results after 2 weeks of continuous use</li>
            <li> I am enjoying looking 10 yrs younger with this product !!! I love Clinique and Amazon.com. I will definately be back.</li>
            <li> I am still using the repairwear.  I have been using for 1-week now.  I cannot say presently if it is working.  Too soon too tell.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she has loved it!! I have purchased more of these since.</li>
            <li> No instructions.  Bottle said &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34;. No noticeable differnce in my skin&amp;#34;.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome, fast shipping and just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait at least 3 weeks before I wrote a review.  Overall, I am happy with Clinique&#x27;s Repairwear.  Skin texture is better, overall color is more even. One dark spot is still there but less noticeable.  Easily covered with Bare Minerals makeup.  Tiny lines around my eyes have improved, as have lines from nose to corners of mouth.  They are still there but like the dark spot, are less noticeable.  Some makeup tricks make them disappear. I used to use a product called Avalon Organics CoQ10 Repair but the formula has changed and it is not as effective now.  Clinique&#x27;s Repairwear  is a very close 2nd.  Would I buy Repairwear again?  I am going to give it a couple more weeks and see how I feel.  As of right now, I would say with 90% certainty I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> really works and it&#x27;s fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and notice a huge difference in the dark sun spots on my face. Best Cliniqe product, ever.</li>
            <li> I got my first free sample while shopping at a major department store - a two week trial, had to make an appointment to return the empty bottle in two weeks for a Consultation and I get to take home ANOTHER 2-week supply FREE. I can honestly say that after my first two weeks, I am starting to see a difference. My skin is softer, I believe it will make a difference in my 57 year-old wrinkles and aging/sun spots. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in another two weeks! I expect to make a purchase then and it will be worth it! Much cheaper than what they tried selling me at the Spa on the cruise ship!</li>
            <li> The bottles were properly sealed and sent in a very professional manner--I would buy from this seller again. The thing with sellers that are re-selling samples is that you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re going to get a sealed bottle--and this time I did. I took a chance and it paid off. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and have tried several products.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of lancome but it just wasn&#x27;t doing anything for my very dry skin that needed some help.  I tried this Clinique product within three days I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference... My face just was so smooth and it evened out the tones on my skin... I will  buy a huge bottle and spend the $150.00 ... I also use TimeWise by MaryKay which I like better than Lancome.  Collagen Filler Collagen Moisture Filler Day/Night Cream by LOreall I love!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product that works very well on me. Wish it could be a little cheaper though. After all, they are just samples.</li>
            <li> I have tried every time of skin care line available and, while some have worked better than others, I consider this product at the top of my list right now.  I am just shy of 52 and have had a problem with break outs as well as fighting wrinkles.  I have used this product for 5 weeks and really am seeing a difference in my skin tone and imperfections.  My skin has a fresher look and the sun spots and melia (little cysty bumps) have started to disappear. I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend to any person 40 plus.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. I am on my second sample and feel I am seeing a difference. I had cryo surgery on my face for pre cancerous cells last summer and the procedures damaged my skin. In a lot of ways, it made it look worse because it left scars. The first bottle diminished the appearance of the scars.</li>
            <li> Item is as stated. I overlooked the fact these items were travel samples, however there is no difference from these samples as the original repairware. Fully satisfied and recommend anyone else to buy this product. Customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li> I am still waiting for some results.</li>
            <li> I am happy with Clinique and did not want to pay a fortune for a one ounce.  However, I could have gotten these bottles for free at the Clinique counter.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this product a try since it was the sample size. I love it. I use it everyday! It seems to minimize my pores and tighten my skin! I would definitely try this product again!</li>
            <li> This makes your skin feel like a million dollars. It lasts a long time. One of my favorite products. Outstanding!</li>
            <li> Just exactly the same as the product in a larger size my wife uses... and a bargain price, too.</li>
            <li> I used this product for more than 2 weeks, I do not see the result as most of 5 stars review claim.  There is no wrinkles reduction I can see.  For the price, it is not too bad.  But I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> I normally use all-natural products, however age is winning the battle and I needed something to slow down the process. I heard about this and read the reviews. Skeptical so I bought the one month trail size. I only use in the evening. I apply while my skin is damp from my toner, then rose hip oil over it. In two days I saw a huge improvement! I recommend this to anyone. I have very sentive combo skin. Love it! Will order more when I&#x27;m done with this trial size!</li>
            <li> A great product from Clinque. The serum goes on smoothly and seems to reduce the signs of wrinkles.I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Amo este producto ,lo he usado por mucho tiempo y me a dado buenos resultados..mi pel es mas tersa y radiante</li>
            <li> Got it on the time. I guess the item is as described, but it is very small in reality. Not sure it&#x27;s worth it. It is sample which you could get it free</li>
            <li> I use the daily moisturizer faithfully.  This is the first time trying the antiwrinkle cream.  Im not sure if it is working just yet, but I do think my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li> nice lotion don&#x27;t leave a oily feel absorbes fast leaves ny face and neck feeling soft and smooth will buy again</li>
            <li> This is a really nice facial lotion. You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, it goes on smoothly and covers my face and neck very easily. It smells good without being perfumey. My face feels so soft after use! It hasn&#x27;t repaired anything yet, and my brown spots have not faded, but I&#x27;m going to give it more time. I might buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent prices. Delivered immediately after ordering.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m going back to Merle Norman!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Works great. Will not use any other stuff from here on out.</li>
            <li> removed a 10 yr, okd age spot,</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the advertising.  I don&#x27;t usually fall for the hype, but this time I bought into it and much to my dismay.....  no different than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.....  I have only been using it a week now, but according to the advertising I should be seeing signs of change for the better and alas, I do not......  I will continue to use the product I purchased until it&#x27;s all..... maybe it just needs a little more time to show me some change for the better......maybe you will have a better result.....</li>
            <li> I am having amazing results from this product! Fine lines around the eyes are gently disappearing. Overall my skin appears much firmer, more even and healthier. I have very sensitive skin and this really produces results without unwanted side effects.</li>
            <li> a product that meets all my expectations</li>
            <li> My first order got lost somewhere and the vendor made it right by re-sending to me. I love the product and am very happy to have been able to get this size so I could try it out before committing to a larger size.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just remember they are small bottles. I bought them for travel</li>
            <li> I was a little uncertain of this product in that the bottle was opaque and different from the same product and size I was given at the Clinique counter.  It also did not seem to have the same amount in it  but because the bottle is opaque and the amount is a small anyway I did not  attempt to measure it.  As for the serum it does seem to have the same tactile properties and the affect on my skin seems to be the same.</li>
            <li> Daughter said this used regularly will remove age spots and moles. I was curious so bought some for husband and I. To date, about 6 weeks, I cannot tell if there is improvement.</li>
