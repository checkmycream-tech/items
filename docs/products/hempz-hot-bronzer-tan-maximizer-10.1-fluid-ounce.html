            <li>The tingle isn&#x27;t as strong as the bottle states.</li>
            <li>WOULDN&#x27;T EVEN GIVE IT TO SOMEONE FOR FREE</li>
            <li>but I continue to use it because it does such a great job.</li>

            <li>and i cant help but laugh</li>
            <li>is worth the heat to me.</li>
            <li>Too tingly for me, (like SUPER hot) I had to get in the shower and wash it all off</li>
            <li>yes this product is hot as it states right on the bottle, but thats because</li>
            <li>and it was very hot and does what it promises that is the whole point of tingles</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin pretty red for an hour or so afterwards which most hot lotions do....</li>
            <li>Once again for me, I never had a needle like feeling, I felt hot for about an hour.</li>
            <li>Love all Hempz products, especially the Hot Bronze.  </li>
            <li>and i know it is supposed to have a nice smell bc I have used it before when it&#x27;s new and not old</li>
            <li>I had to stop halfway through my session because my whole body felt like it was on fire.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>After about three hours the redness was gone and I felt completely normal.</li>
            <li>It was okay at first, but after a few uses I started getting white spots all over my upper body.</li>
            <li>The tanning lotion I received was old.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I usually tan before work, but I don&#x27;t use this lotion before work because it smells so strong.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or you do not like tingling lotion do not buy this lotion get a regular bronzing lotion for tanning.</li>
            <li>Switching back to my old brand.</li>
            <li>Its very clumpy and leaves little wax looking stuff on me.</li>

            <li> Be careful!!</li>

            <li> Stinks like hell</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT IS THAT BAD OF A TANNING LOTION</li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist and she said it was NOT tinea versicolor, just a bad reaction to the lotion.</li>
            <li> It was HORRIBLE and downright painful!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ANOTHER HORRIBLE LOTION</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I just bought this lotion and I love it!  It is very hot but gives you great, fast results! Totally worth the burn!</li>
            <li> I haved used other Hempz products so I decided to give this one a try. When I was in the Tanning Bed I had to stop halfway through my session because my whole body felt like it was on fire. For the next 12 hours I thought I had severely burned my skin before the product wore off. I would not recommend buying this product unless for some odd reason you want to feel burnt.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ANOTHER HORRIBLE LOTION I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND OR USE AGAIN.  I LOST MY TAN WITH THIS LOTION ALSO AND I THREW THE BOTTLE AWAY BECAUSE I WOULD NOT ONLY EVEN USE IT AS A MOISTURIZER I WOULDN&#x27;T EVEN GIVE IT TO SOMEONE FOR FREE BECAUSE IT IS THAT BAD OF A TANNING LOTION</li>
            <li> Great product, Have been using it with my tanning bed. Will be buying more as soon as I use this one up. Thanks</li>
            <li> Hot! Love it. I&#x27;ve used it before &amp; will use it again. Def a 5 star rating. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I like to use hot lotions in the tanning beds and this one has worked great for me. No strong odor afterwards either so I can run errands after tanning without being worried that I smell. Leaves my skin feeling moisturized. If you have sensitive skin or you do not like tingling lotion do not buy this lotion get a regular bronzing lotion for tanning. It does leave your skin pretty red for an hour or so afterwards which most hot lotions do....</li>
            <li> The tanning lotion I received was old. It had no smell and i know it is supposed to have a nice smell bc I have used it before when it&#x27;s new and not old it&#x27;s a really good lotion. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle! It gives a great tan and smells amazing. What a great price too. It&#x27;s way cheaper than I have paid in the salons for it. I placed my order on Monday and it arrived on Thursday. I couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li> It definitely tingles and does darken me up quite a bit, but leaves a very unpleasant strong smell after use. Almost like cat pee or something. I usually tan before work, but I don&#x27;t use this lotion before work because it smells so strong.</li>
            <li> im reading these reviews and i cant help but laugh, i bought this and it was very hot and does what it promises that is the whole point of tingles, there is even a warning. yes this product is hot as it states right on the bottle, but thats because its a \\&quot;hot\\&quot; lotion lol. the tan u will get with this is worth the heat to me. i do not suggest this lotion for those who can&#x27;t handle heat.</li>
            <li> LOVED THIS PRODUCT!!!! Gives you a beautiful tan:)</li>
            <li> My girlfriend purchased this-here is what she had to say: I am a diehard Hempz fan and have always used their lotions.  I can&#x27;t find the Hempz tanning lotion I always use to buy so I purchased this. I will never buy it again.  It smells completely different and my skin was burning for the next 3 hours. I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;hot\\&quot; bronzers before and this has never happened and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. Felt like my skin was burning and needles were poking me at the same time. It was HORRIBLE and downright painful! I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think it all depends on the person. For me, this brand worked very nice. I got the results I wanted and only after one use I could see a big difference. Once again for me, I never had a needle like feeling, I felt hot for about an hour. After about three hours the redness was gone and I felt completely normal.</li>
            <li> Stinks horrible like old self tanning lotion. Its very clumpy and leaves little wax looking stuff on me. Very disappointed. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Love all Hempz products, especially the Hot Bronze.  Be careful!!</li>
            <li> Be careful with this lotion. It was okay at first, but after a few uses I started getting white spots all over my upper body. I went to the dermatologist and she said it was NOT tinea versicolor, just a bad reaction to the lotion.</li>

            <li> Too tingly for me, (like SUPER hot) I had to get in the shower and wash it all off it was so hot.&lt;br /&gt;I had red tender skin for hours, but I&#x27;m a near transparent white boy that was trying to tan :(</li>
            <li> Its good I like it just wish it had more TINGLE!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love Hempz products normally, but not this one. The smell is horrible! The tingle isn&#x27;t as strong as the bottle states. Switching back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because a friend was using it and loved it, but when I tried it, it has a strong tingle factor and I broke out in bumps. It is not for me.</li>
            <li> Stinks like hell but I continue to use it because it does such a great job. Do not use this lotion without access to a shower soon after. The smell is AWFUL&amp;#62; but as I said, the product works GREAT so I will buy again.</li>
