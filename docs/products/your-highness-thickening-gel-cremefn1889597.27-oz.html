            <li>I have fine hair, a LOT of it, but it&#x27;s still pretty fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, as I wash my hair every day, but the intense tangling is puzzling.</li>
            <li>She is forever trying to help me get full hair</li>
            <li>My hair stylist used this product on me at a haircut+highlighting appointment and I absolutely fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I found out about this product because an officemate of mine dropped by my area and the first thing I noticed was her hair!</li>
            <li>I prefer products with a good margin of error -- but I&#x27;m willing to make sure I use the right amount of this and can forgive this little problem.</li>
            <li>Great Product.....only need a little</li>
            <li>I did not have any success with this product</li>
            <li>I have used a root booster by Big Sexy Hair and didn&#x27;t have the same results texture wise but deciding between the two products</li>
            <li>So far, TIGI Your Highness is my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the only kind I will buy.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I got really fine thin hair works great for me.  </li>
            <li>My hairstylist used it for my very straight hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t gum up my hair, but adds body and more styling potential.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times (after using the Catwalk volumizing shampoo and conditioner) and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and allows me to have a decent hair style inspite of thin and fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I really depend on it and it arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li>I have medium length, fine, dark brown/black hair, and can use 2-3 full pumps of this product but tend to go for the full 3.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Later, she emailed the name of the product which I think is really a unique name!</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Thanks will order again</li>
            <li>This stuff really works...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Helps my thin hair look smooth and presentable...have used it for years and honestly cannot do without it.</li>
            <li>These products are highly concentrated, which is great, because you only have to use a little.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and this gel is very light and just adds a bit of thickness to my hair without making it sticky and break off.  </li>
            <li>Works best when applied on wet hair working your way from the roots , then blow drying with a round brush to get tons of volume , with my super fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>I wash my hair maybe 4-5 times a week since I am a huge dry shampoo fan, so maybe I would have run out of the product by now?  </li>
            <li>It gives a little body to my very straight and fine hair without adding a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feel to it.  </li>
            <li>This product gives me the lift I need to hide some thinning problems in my 64 year old head!!</li>
            <li>very slight downside, is..like most thickeners, on Day 3, I need to shampoo.</li>
            <li>The only reason for my 4 vs. 5 star rating is that you really do have to watch how much of this you use.</li>
            <li>This product was available at my local hair stylist until recently.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, blonde hair, this product made it look flat and greasy.</li>
            <li>I comb this product through my hair, blow dry upside down and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I use it most frequently when I&#x27;m blowing my hair straight with round brush and blow dryer -- not when I&#x27;m using my flat iron.</li>
            <li>It gives some volume to my hair while making it soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not available at all retail stores selling hair products, so appreciate that it is available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot tell whether this really offers any protection at all for heat styling.</li>
            <li>this product can really claim such promises.</li>
            <li>Excelent product, hair feels soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Love the volume and texture, and just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, I always use store-brand hair products, and I&#x27;m never satisfied.</li>
            <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t use it the right way, but it tends to leave my hair weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have medium thick, long hair and this is by far my favorite hair styling product.</li>
            <li>I like to test various products that claim it will make your hair shine and soft and</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way to making thin hair more full.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is a few inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, the texture feeling I first get after blow drying typically lessens as I style and tease my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for it if I leave my hair to dry naturally, however.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and this product adds volume and control to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Just a *little* bit too much</li>

            <li> I wash my hair maybe 4-5 times a week since I am a huge dry shampoo fan, so maybe I would have run out of the product by now?  </li>
            <li> It gives a little body to my very straight and fine hair without adding a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feel to it.  </li>
            <li> This product gives me the lift I need to hide some thinning problems in my 64 year old head!!</li>
            <li> very slight downside, is..like most thickeners, on Day 3, I need to shampoo.</li>
            <li> The only reason for my 4 vs. 5 star rating is that you really do have to watch how much of this you use.</li>

            <li> I comb this product through my hair, blow dry upside down and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it most frequently when I&#x27;m blowing my hair straight with round brush and blow dryer -- not when I&#x27;m using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> It gives some volume to my hair while making it soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not available at all retail stores selling hair products, so appreciate that it is available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot tell whether this really offers any protection at all for heat styling.</li>

            <li> My favorite hair gel, and I have baby fine hair.  Love the volume and texture, and just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives some volume to my hair while making it soft. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> excellent seller, product works great</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works wonders on my straight, ultra thin hair.  At least now I can keep a curl for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with it</li>
            <li> Been using this for years now, it&#x27;s a good product for fine hair!</li>
            <li> Great product , love the smell. Works best when applied on wet hair working your way from the roots , then blow drying with a round brush to get tons of volume , with my super fine and thin hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this as part of a set with a gloss spray. I did not have any success with this product and I did not care for the scent at all. I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific.  Recommended to me by my daughter.  I have fine, thin hair and this gel is very light and just adds a bit of thickness to my hair without making it sticky and break off.  Only need a tiny little dime size drop for my short haircut.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great on fine blonde hair...without costing a fortune either. I hate paying a lot of money for hair products...</li>
            <li> Adds nice body, softness and shine if you use it right before a thorough blow-dry. I don&#x27;t care for it if I leave my hair to dry naturally, however. My normally naturally wavey hair gets weirdly straightish and heavy if I don&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Catwalk thickening shampoo and conditioner. I comb this product through my hair, blow dry upside down and the results are amazing. When I flip my head up, I have an amazing amount of volume and thickness :) I&#x27;m giving the product 4/5 stars because the only con about this product is that when I run my fingers through my hair post blow drying (and before styling), it has a texture to it that doesn&#x27;t feel silky - if that makes sense. I have used a root booster by Big Sexy Hair and didn&#x27;t have the same results texture wise but deciding between the two products, I like this one the best and I still would recommend giving it a try. Ultimately, the texture feeling I first get after blow drying typically lessens as I style and tease my hair. The texture though also seems to keep your hair looking fuller all day - keeping your hair from naturally parting down the middle (saying this because my hair will do this sometimes when I tease and do hairspray and 4 hours later, my hair starts to part it&#x27;s natural way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a medium amount of fine wavy hair. I&#x27;ve tried many volumizing products. So far, TIGI Your Highness is my favorite. It is a translucent lavender cream, with a pleasant candy-like scent.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just past my shoulders. So i use 1 tiny squirt for the roots and another for the length.&lt;br /&gt;It gives GREAT volume, is not clumpy, crunchy or sticky!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very slight downside, is..like most thickeners, on Day 3, I need to shampoo.( i usually wash every other day anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but i will pay for a good product like this.</li>
            <li> great price and product</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  My hair is very fine and this gel cre&#x27;me gives me a lot of volume.&lt;br /&gt;It is the only kind I will buy.  Fast shipping with good service.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Adds some extra oomph to any hairstyle!</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t use it the right way, but it tends to leave my hair weighed down. Could just need to use less product or style differently. Smells good though!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and allows me to have a decent hair style inspite of thin and fine hair.  It is not available at all retail stores selling hair products, so appreciate that it is available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> i was expecting it to thicken more than it did. But, the products are very nice and don&#x27;t leave residue on the hair.</li>
            <li> This works as it says, but for some reason, my hair is absolutely tangled and hard to comb through the next day. It&#x27;s okay, as I wash my hair every day, but the intense tangling is puzzling.</li>
            <li> Not heavy but has enough hold to keep curly hair from going crazy.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Catwalk products!!!! I was afraid though when I bought this that it would just make my hair fizzy and make it poof out instead of just making it have body. I was pleasantly surprised when it worked great without any frizz. It does work better if you use the Catwalk Your Highness Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got really fine thin hair works great for me.  I use this with catwalk root boost.. Thanks will order again</li>
            <li> Was getting this from a local salon but theying it. stopped gett...so I found it on here............Great Product.....only need a little</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my stylist. She is forever trying to help me get full hair and we seem to have this battle between what I want (which is nice fullness that compliments an angled bob cut) and what she wants (which is some sort of 1950&#x27;s June Cleaver like volume making me look like I just took a ride with Michael J. Fox!). But, you know, you gotta sacrifice sometimes. Compromise is an art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one product that we *both* agree on. You need VERY little of it. I use one to two pumps for my chin length hair -- seems like that is about 1/2 tsp or so. I run it through my roots to the length. It has a very nice smell - doesn&#x27;t hang around (bummer! I like it when my hair smells good!) but it&#x27;s not obnoxious -- sort of like a candy smell I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell whether this really offers any protection at all for heat styling. I use it most frequently when I&#x27;m blowing my hair straight with round brush and blow dryer -- not when I&#x27;m using my flat iron. Just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My perfect combo nowaday&#x27;s pairs this stuff with [[ASIN:B004Y5M8QQ Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo 8.5 FL OZ]] and [[ASIN:B004Y5NA1I Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner 8.5 FL OZ]]. I get soft, shiny hair that has a good amount of volume that stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t be scared by the price -- this stuff will last like a year! The only reason for my 4 vs. 5 star rating is that you really do have to watch how much of this you use. Just a *little* bit too much and it does the opposite of what you want which is to decrease volume and weigh hair down (at least on my fine hair). I prefer products with a good margin of error -- but I&#x27;m willing to make sure I use the right amount of this and can forgive this little problem.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products! This works great with my stringy, flat hair! It also smells great!</li>
            <li> This is the best thickening cream ever. It&#x27;s not to thick and it makes your hair smell wonderful. The best part is it includes thermal protection so I can use my hot tools with no worries. I have medium thick, long hair and this is by far my favorite hair styling product. If you are questioning whether or not to buy it, do it! I bet you will love it as much as I do!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this thickening gel for a few years now, and it makes my hair look really thick and not so straight. I had always bought it at a local salon that charged $17.95 a bottle. This is a much better value.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to be able to get this product so easily. I really depend on it and it arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used it for my very straight hair. it added volumne with just a little amount. When I had my hair permed. I kept retain the curls and made them more soft and beautiful. Best project I&#x27;ve ever used on my straight hair.</li>
            <li> Catwalk products are great.  This is just one of many that I buy!</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD AS I HOPED!</li>
            <li> Wow!Wow!Wow! That&#x27;s what I can say with this product. I like to test various products that claim it will make your hair shine and soft and this product can really claim such promises. The price is also very reasonable and you don&#x27;t need much. I used 1-2 pumps but if your hair is short 1 pump is enough. I found out about this product because an officemate of mine dropped by my area and the first thing I noticed was her hair! I said \\&quot;What did you do to your hair? It&#x27;s shiny!\\&quot; And she said \\&quot;Oh, my hairstylist recommended this product and I bought it from her.\\&quot; Later, she emailed the name of the product which I think is really a unique name! I&#x27;ve relied a lot on amazon for shopping and we found the best price. For $25 order, we got the shipping FREE (which would have cost $8 for 3). My friend ordered two and I ordered one and we made the $25+ requirement for a free shipping. It came the next day because we had it delivered to our office!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works...a little goes a long way to making thin hair more full. I have purchased this many times and am not disappointed. Hopefully they never cost-save and change the formula!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the Catwalk foam product which had been discontinued.  I have found this product to be even better.  The liquid serum is light and adds a lot of volume.  In addition the fragrance is nice.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. It has a pleasant scent and really does the job. Lightweight and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This product gives me the lift I need to hide some thinning problems in my 64 year old head!! Will order again!</li>
            <li> I love t his hair gel.  It gives a little body to my very straight and fine hair without adding a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feel to it.  It is light and easy to comb out at days end.  I use it with steam hair curlers and I just love it.  I am on bottle 4 now.</li>
            <li> I LOVE TIGI!  I&#x27;ve been using this styling gel for years and it&#x27;s the best.  It doesn&#x27;t gum up my hair, but adds body and more styling potential.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells fantastic. I use it after every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not thicken my hair for sure</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, I always use store-brand hair products, and I&#x27;m never satisfied. I love the Tigi Catwalk Volume Collection shampoo, conditioner and thickening gel. Definitely worth it and will buy again. My hair looks great, and I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments! These products are highly concentrated, which is great, because you only have to use a little. Definitely lasts longer. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 years and I absolutely love it.  Protects hair I will keep using this..</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product to add some body and volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, blonde hair, this product made it look flat and greasy. If hair is thicker it might work ok, but not for me. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> jjust what I wanted and at a great price</li>
            <li> This volumizer is wonderful; I&#x27;ve been using it for years. My hair is really fine and thin, but with the Catwalk line of products, I can manipulate it into looking so thick! I use about a nickel size amount of this and rub it into my hair. I finish up with a few sprays of the Your Highness Root Boost at the crown of my head before blow drying my hair upside down. It&#x27;s amazing how well this works! I can usually always find it cheaper on Amazon than at a local store.</li>
            <li> This product was available at my local hair stylist until recently.  I have thin, fine hair and this product adds volume and control to my hair.  Order four bottles so that I won&#x27;t have to worry for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad that you had this product in your supplies!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, hair feels soft and not greasy. Wonderful smell too.</li>
            <li> Helps my thin hair look smooth and presentable...have used it for years and honestly cannot do without it.</li>
            <li> Great product also adds shine!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, a LOT of it, but it&#x27;s still pretty fine. I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times (after using the Catwalk volumizing shampoo and conditioner) and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film on my hair or make it feel stiff or sticky. The scent is wonderful. It also tames the frizzes which I love!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is a few inches past my shoulders. I use 3 pumps of this jasmine-scented gel for the lengths of my hair (I avoid the roots; I haven&#x27;t managed to find anything that will help in that area without giving me an unwanted greasy feel). It gives me nice body that lasts all day and gets rid of the frizzies. This product also has UV filters so if you have color-treated hair that&#x27;s a big bonus. I like to switch out my products form time to time but I always come back to this, I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li> Good product...repeat purchase</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Can&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this product on me at a haircut+highlighting appointment and I absolutely fell in love with it.  I have medium length, fine, dark brown/black hair, and can use 2-3 full pumps of this product but tend to go for the full 3.  It does the job to thicken my hair without weighing it down.  Little did I know it also smooths it out, gives it great shine, and prevents flyaways.  My hair blowouts come out great, and it also smells great, what a plus!  My bottle has lasted me for maybe 6-8 months now and there&#x27;s still a lot left in there.  I wash my hair maybe 4-5 times a week since I am a huge dry shampoo fan, so maybe I would have run out of the product by now?  When I run out I am definitely buying another bottle!</li>
