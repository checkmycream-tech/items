            <li> Use this product on wet hair after every shower. Love this product. Smells great. Preserves color and helps fight frizz. On my 3rd or 4th bottle now. Love it and will use it forever.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I know with certainty it keeps my color lasting longer. I can go one week longer before hair color! Delighted I found it here on Amazon because it&#x27;s a bit more expensive in the salon.</li>
            <li> Great for stopping frizzies</li>
            <li> So good for thin hair!</li>
            <li> Great for color treated thick curly hair, great for when you need to blow dry or straighten your hair. Makes hair soft, very good smell. Been using for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love ‪FRAMESI‬ ‪ColorLover‬ ‪Primer11‬ leave in conditioner and detangler. It has saved me from having to touch up my own hair color, with the only reason to touch up now is my grey roots. All ‪Vegan‬, made of ‪Natural‬ oils to infuse the air, keeping th frizzies at bay, whole also being a weightless thermal guard.&lt;br /&gt;Boosts body, without being frizzy, without weighing the hair down, while giving a beautiful shine!&lt;br /&gt;Framesi sent me a sample bottle to try out and only asked for my review! Well, let me say that I love it and have been using it daily, especially on the days while in the sun a lot. It has kept my hair from drying out and splitting. Amazing product that is sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I got this for free to review. I wanted to stay that this does retain color. Does the repair against damage may ask well you can’t really repair damage. After damage has been done there’s no way to repair it. Does it make your hair silky and shiny well yes of course this is a sprite in product it’s going to makemake your hair shiny and silky. The product also claims to fix for us well I have some Hairs that never stay. Have you use this product on the way into my hair I’ve used it on the head and I don’t see anything with the frizz control. Does that help with the body absolutely I love the body that I have in my hair after using this product. Does a man you’re splitting aunts now no product can officially menu splitting and conditioner does not mean your split ends it just put some protein into the ends to keep them together until you cut it. Does it detangler absolutely have no trouble after using this product brushing and parting My hair is great. Does it help your style steak not really but on the other hand my hair straight and I really don’t do much to it so I cannot stay that it does so I use this product online and her style stayed the next day. No static well static is always going to be an issue with any product so this does not have static electricity but your hair is not going to be more attracted to frizzing up as much. Thermal guard it does protect your hair against thermal styling which is one reason I wanted to review this product which I feel like I would use this over a thermal protectant spray it’s that amazing. Wireless well this product is very white and this is like putting water on your hair that’s how weightless. I would recommend this to a professional which I am myself and any clients customers that are looking for a quick and easy leaving thermal protector that needs body and needs a detangling spray. I would say overall this product works and I would buy it. I’ve looked into the business and I found a lot of products that I would also like to review until my followers and etc.hat I would also like to review until my followers and etc.</li>

            <li> Love it my hair feels amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and cheaper then in a salon!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product but when I received from UPS, it was frozen solid!  I hope this doesn&#x27;t affect the product but very disappointed it arrived frozen.</li>
            <li> I purchased this solely on reviews.  First, let me say to you...Are you all crazy?!  I spray a small amount on hands and into hair and by second day my hair is dirty looking.  Dull, no shine.  The verdict is out on color though.  I can&#x27;t use this anymore since I am a stickler on shiny, clean hair.  So, if you buy this product, remember, I warned you.</li>
            <li> Works great on frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Seriously Amazing! I have been coloring my hair since 14, like literally bleaching it every other month so my hair was FRIED even after trying product after product to fix it...well I was super surprised and excited when it worked right away. My boyfriend even noticed the major change right away  I also liked how weightless, shiney and not oily it was. Plus a way better price on most salons products that might not even work. Definitely will buy this over and over again!!</li>
            <li> I like this because it&#x27;s so light and not greasy like some other color saving stuff you can buy. You can spray it in dry or wet, it protects from a LOT of stuff! I&#x27;ve gotten several of my girlfriends to use this too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it when my hair is damp or when my hair needs a little refresh. I&#x27;ve got thick hair and this product is so light, I can&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li> Love this leave in treatment. Helps keep hair healthy and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of parabens or other crap in it.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. Now I have super curly, dry, color treated hair and I put a few sprits is this after I shower and when I feel that my hair needs some refreshing and this makes my hair super soft and it feel so much healthier!</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron and this Color Primer keeps my color until my next hair appointment.  Great Product.</li>
