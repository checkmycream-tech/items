            <li>This wig is light and looks amazing!</li>
            <li>Great lenght and most important</li>
            <li>Sheds and tangles easily but for a one time use, it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li>It does the job and the price is ok.</li>
            <li>Would be better if it wasn&#x27;t so shiny...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Did not come with a cap so make sure you get one if you have hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used this wig for a wednesday addams costume and it doesn&#x27;t look like a cheap wig, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Looks real and doesnt feel cheap at all!!!</li>
            <li>perfect brand from different sellers but still same great quality guaranteed</li>
            <li>Good hold and doesn&#x27;t really fall out.</li>
            <li>It is very well constructed and looked good.</li>
            <li>You can easily curl it by just putting it in a braid.</li>
            <li>Can get notted easily</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of cheap wigs.</li>
            <li>It looks just like the picture and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great wig - especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I did not like the look or the fit of this wig</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>but so far looks excellent especially for the price</li>
            <li>Tangles easily but useful</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t melt when I straightened it so the heat resistant part holds true.</li>
            <li>This is my second wig and i love it!</li>
            <li>Very obviously a wig kind of shiny.</li>
            <li>; this is useful for my Porrim cosplay</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t like the gaps which make the cap visible if you don&#x27;t style it right.</li>
            <li>Not as pretty as the picture in my opinion, maybe it has to be styled?</li>
            <li>Haha! ^0^</li>
            <li>Came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>feels\ looks so real!</li>
            <li>doesnt tangle easily feels soft close to real hair feeling</li>
            <li>On the mannequin head it looks like it can pass as a good realistic looking wig in the color black, but that is not the case.</li>
            <li>This black wig is amazing.</li>
            <li>Good for price hard to keep from tangling and brushing pulls hair out</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really shiny.</li>
            <li>its so luscious and perfectly better than I expected for my cosplay.</li>
            <li>and it came surprisingly fast.</li>
            <li>And very soft.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and hair does not fall out of the wig.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old picked this wig out and loves it.</li>
            <li>This wig is more of a Halloween costume wig that is not meant to be taken seriously.</li>
            <li>looks ok just really thin.</li>

            <li> looks ok just really thin.</li>
            <li> You may end up having to reshape the wig with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> That really the only complaint I have.</li>
            <li> I know price is cheap but be wary.</li>
            <li> But for the price I was shocked at how nice it is!&lt;br</li>
            <li> you will  look like a wild dog after a few stroke of combing.</li>
            <li> Bangs are cut way to long</li>
            <li> Was originally sent the wrong color</li>
            <li> For those of you who are looking for an ultra deep black wig, this one has a brown tint to it.</li>
            <li> and I could use this for probably all my other long haired girl trolls in Homestuck.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!!</li>
            <li> Hair was a little tangled other than that I like it</li>
            <li> I got the black one.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a week and a half before estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> I want to wear it everyday</li>
            <li> Not an everyday wig.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Definitely can tell this one is fake.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit small</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that hard to brush out.</li>
            <li> Arrived over a week late</li>
            <li> Thin.</li>
            <li> Really thin.</li>
            <li> Got the wrong color and style.</li>
            <li> The bangs are difficult and give the wig a Cleopatra look.</li>
            <li> It sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> Hate it and it looks really really fake</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this roduct</li>
            <li> Worthless!!</li>

            <li> Great wig for photography. I use it on a dummy head.</li>
            <li> Not as pretty as the picture in my opinion, maybe it has to be styled?</li>
            <li> This is my second wig and i love it! it bounce when i walk and it&#x27;s a bit shiny but it works for me, great purchase &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Ordered it Friday and it came in Monday.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like the gaps which make the cap visible if you don&#x27;t style it right.</li>
            <li> Thin. But it sufficed for my Rinoa cosplay.</li>
            <li> It suck!!!!!  by the time you brush the hair it instantly tangle.and you will  look like a wild dog after a few stroke of combing. You get what you made for</li>
            <li> ehhhh. I buy a lot of cheap wigs. Some are great, some are not so great. The one I received was not so great. Shiny... Really shiny. Very obviously a wig kind of shiny. Not a huge fan. :/</li>
            <li> I love this hair! its so luscious and perfectly better than I expected for my cosplay. its beautiful and gorgeous and its totally worth the cost! &amp;#62;u&amp;#60; this is useful for my Porrim cosplay and I could use this for probably all my other long haired girl trolls in Homestuck. I recommend! Haha! ^0^</li>
            <li> Hate it and it looks really really fake</li>
            <li> Definitely can tell this one is fake. It sheds like crazy. Great for pics but gets tangled easily. Bangs are cut way to long n it&#x27;s a bit small</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a cosplay and I like it a lot. It looks just like the picture and is comfortable. And very soft. It is a tiny bit itchy though. That really the only complaint I have.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!! Worthless!!</li>
            <li> perfect brand from different sellers but still same great quality guaranteed</li>
            <li> Really nice! Tangles a lot but it&#x27;s not that hard to brush out. It didn&#x27;t melt when I straightened it so the heat resistant part holds true. I&#x27;m planning on using it for a lot of different events this year and I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li> I will buy this wig again</li>
            <li> Looks real and doesnt feel cheap at all!!!</li>
            <li> This wig is light and looks amazing! I got the black one. Shipping was a week and a half before estimated delivery date. For those of you who are looking for an ultra deep black wig, this one has a brown tint to it. It looks natural and hair does not fall out of the wig. I will be ordering again and do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great wig - especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! I want to wear it everyday I love it so much! Took a bit to get the bangs figured out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with it. I got it for a wonder woman costume and it came surprisingly fast. I&#x27;m still working on combing it out but so far looks excellent especially for the price</li>
            <li> Got the wrong color and style. Tangles easily but useful til i can get another. It does the job and the price is ok.</li>
            <li> Really thin. I know price is cheap but be wary. Good hold and doesn&#x27;t really fall out. Great wig to try</li>
            <li> Would be better if it wasn&#x27;t so shiny... But for the price I was shocked at how nice it is!&lt;br /&gt;Fully covers scalp/hair underneath.&lt;br /&gt;Did not come with a cap so make sure you get one if you have hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long and wavy. Stretchy straps to hold it on your head.</li>
            <li> Got this for our daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume. It is very well constructed and looked good.</li>
            <li> The wig does not look like the picture. The bangs are difficult and give the wig a Cleopatra look. I tried to part but it does not look good. The synthetic hair is of good quality and shipping was good. This wig is more of a Halloween costume wig that is not meant to be taken seriously. On the mannequin head it looks like it can pass as a good realistic looking wig in the color black, but that is not the case. You may end up having to reshape the wig with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as pictured. Sheds and tangles easily but for a one time use, it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li> Used this wig for a wednesday addams costume and it doesn&#x27;t look like a cheap wig, which is nice. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old picked this wig out and loves it.</li>
            <li> Hair was a little tangled other than that I like it</li>
            <li> I did not like the look or the fit of this wig I was disappointed in this roduct</li>
            <li> This black wig is amazing. You can easily curl it by just putting it in a braid. Can get notted easily but it&#x27;s durable. You can even wear this daily!</li>
            <li> Wig looks great. Was originally sent the wrong color but the seller took great care of me!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used it however it feels\ looks so real!</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween! Not an everyday wig.</li>
            <li> Good for price hard to keep from tangling and brushing pulls hair out</li>
