            <li>but my scars look phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Many people don&#x27;t even notice.  </li>
            <li>But I am satisfied with how the scar healed.</li>
            <li>Given the fact that it was recommended by a doctor I will give it a four and change my rating if my scar looks better.</li>
            <li>Friends say it does look better, and is not quite as noticeable.</li>
            <li>it looks almost 90% better.</li>
            <li>The sooner you start using it the better.</li>
            <li>Great for new incisions to reduce scarring.  </li>
            <li>I the larger size was great for the price.</li>
            <li>Dr. recommended product and I liked the results so much that I purchased another bottle.  </li>
            <li>BioCorneum plus SPF 30 Advanced scar treatment was recommended  by my surgeon.  </li>
            <li>So far soo good.</li>
            <li>It has significantly reduced the appearance of my scars and I have been using the product for 2 months.  </li>
            <li>This has been an effective product - very pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have seen great improvements, but the scar is only two months old, so i hope to see more.</li>
            <li>Saw results quickly.</li>
            <li>am very pleased to having found this item on Amazon at the same price as my doctor&#x27;s office but delivered home.</li>
            <li>I used this for my breast reduction and in just a few months no scars at all no one can tell I had my great done</li>
            <li>Honestly, I saw better results with constant Neosporin application, plus keeping my injury completely out of the sun.</li>
            <li>What I expected at a really good price</li>
            <li>Applied twice a day as directed and had good results, less visible scares after surgery.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my surgeon for a large linear fresh surgical scar</li>
            <li>we bought TWO bottles of this and of course we don&#x27;t know how much better the scarring is with the use of this product, ( I guess you would have to have parallel universes,</li>
            <li>Not as red and looks so much better.</li>
            <li>the Plastic Surgeon who did the closure sold us some at his office - the price would make your heart beat faster - this was the same product at a MUCH better price - thanks</li>
            <li>Have a large scar from surgery that I was told will probably take a year to heal.</li>
            <li>bioCorneum really does help with scar revision.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it contains SPF 30.</li>
            <li>Very misleading.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my doctor and really works.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>If it feels sticky you have used too much.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it would work on old scars, but works great on new ones.</li>
            <li>Hoping it will work 6 month update : I am still on the original bottle and use the cream 1 to 2 times daily for five months now.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but has to dry.</li>
            <li>it just does not  dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on any older scars.</li>
            <li>so yes we highly recommend using this product..thank you</li>
            <li>highly recommend it for any type of scarring tissue that needs to heal</li>
            <li>It was super red and bumpy and now 5 months later using this scar treatment</li>
            <li>The directions clearly say you have to wait three months</li>
            <li>how well it helps the scar heal and fade, as it is still early.</li>
            <li>I plan to laser but due to hyper pigmentation risk you are not allowed to laser a fresh scar  for 12 months</li>
            <li>People saying that it stains are either applying way too much, or not waiting for it to dry before getting dressed, or both.</li>
            <li>My ventral hernia surgical incision is nearly obliterated, and my 18 month old prior hernia scar is 50% improved.</li>
            <li>(it looked like I had been in a major sword fight) and have been using this to reduce the scarring.  </li>
            <li>You have to rub it in really well, as it looks wet on your skin for a while, if you don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It says that it dries in place but it feels greasy and do not dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but a little goes a LONG way and, I already paid an arm and a leg for surgery, another couple hundred is worth it for me.</li>

            <li> However, the label says it will dry in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It will not dry in 5 or even 15 minutes no matter how little I put on.</li>

            <li> Careful with what you buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit spendy but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had another scar that was still thick and red from 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It has even minimized a previous scar I had.  </li>

            <li> It has drastically reduced the scars appearance, the thickness of the scar and uneven color.  </li>
            <li> I apply twice a day to a small scar on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working but warning it will stain your clothes permanently.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> bioCorneum really does help with scar revision.  I especially like that it is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Expensive.  I have used it for about seven months now.  I apply twice a day to a small scar on my forehead.  The container, although not large in appearance, goes a long way.  I believe it is helping.  My scar has not faded, but it has not gotten worse.  I recently began laser surgery on the scar, fraxel.  I continue to use biocoreum in between treatments.  You have to rub it in really well, as it looks wet on your skin for a while, if you don&#x27;t.  I really like the fact that it contains SPF 30.</li>
            <li> we bought TWO bottles of this and of course we don&#x27;t know how much better the scarring is with the use of this product, ( I guess you would have to have parallel universes, one where you could see the scar without using this and one in which you see the scar with its use, and do a comparison LOL!) But we do have to say that spending thousands and thousands of dollars on a cosmetic procedure...the cost for this products to help us feel confident that we are getting the best possible outcome was very worth the price based on the excellent reviews and PS recommendations regarding its effectiveness ...so yes we highly recommend using this product..thank you</li>
            <li> Great for new incisions to reduce scarring.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on any older scars.</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon recommended this product and finding it I the larger size was great for the price. I would definitely recommend anyone that has had surgery to use this product to reduce scarring.</li>
            <li> Still applying to scar to see end results in a few months.</li>
            <li> I used this for my breast reduction and in just a few months no scars at all no one can tell I had my great done</li>
            <li> This product is related to kelocote which costs just a few dollars. The claims that it make are not supported with the FDA. Only that it is a SPF product. Careful with what you buy! It says that it dries in place but it feels greasy and do not dry. Very misleading.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else on the market!</li>
            <li> Dr. recommended product and I liked the results so much that I purchased another bottle.  It has significantly reduced the appearance of my scars and I have been using the product for 2 months.  It has even minimized a previous scar I had.  Would definitely recommend this product to aid in reducing the appearance of surgical scars.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I saw better results with constant Neosporin application, plus keeping my injury completely out of the sun. Will buy product again to see more results. I would have preferred a larger amount for the price paid though.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this serum to minimize scars. I had multiple surgeries with big scars.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased to having found this item on Amazon at the same price as my doctor&#x27;s office but delivered home.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product for reducing the size and color of scar tissue.  Recommended by my doctor and really works.  I use it twice/day--had surgery 6 months ago, and the results are remarkable!</li>
            <li> recommended by my daughters plastic surgeon for a cut in her face, trying not to forget a day to apply it but I wont see any difference yet. I will give it more time and I will update.</li>
            <li> Works well; knee surgery scar still fading after 18 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month. Not sure if it&#x27;s working but warning it will stain your clothes permanently.</li>
            <li> I Used this product 2 times a day for many months and noticed no change. Wish it was not too late to return it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for 3 weeks but my scars look phenomenal. I started 3 weeks post op. It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but a little goes a LONG way and, I already paid an arm and a leg for surgery, another couple hundred is worth it for me. People saying that it stains are either applying way too much, or not waiting for it to dry before getting dressed, or both. It says multiple times in the instructions that you only need a very thin layer, and that if it does not dry within five minutes, you&#x27;ve used too much! Not sure how it would work on old scars, but works great on new ones.</li>
            <li> So far soo good. I have seen great improvements, but the scar is only two months old, so i hope to see more.</li>
            <li> I think this helps.  Been using it for a year now.  I still have my scars.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received the wrong size, 20g when it should have been 50g.</li>
            <li> BioCorneum plus SPF 30 Advanced scar treatment was recommended  by my surgeon.  I had extensive breast surgery (it looked like I had been in a major sword fight) and have been using this to reduce the scarring.  It is very effective and I&#x27;m seeing good results.  I will be using it for the next four months, twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with the results I have had with the use of this product.  I broken my nose 6 months ago and had a large laceration under my eye.  I&#x27;ve been using the cream since on the scar and it has healed well.  Many people don&#x27;t even notice.  Maybe its the cream or maybe its just my skin.  But I am satisfied with how the scar healed.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my surgeon for a large linear fresh surgical scar and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month with no difference yet. The directions clearly say you have to wait three months so I will update the post. Given the fact that it was recommended by a doctor I will give it a four and change my rating if my scar looks better. I plan to laser but due to hyper pigmentation risk you are not allowed to laser a fresh scar  for 12 months so this cream is my only option. Hoping it will work 6 month update : I am still on the original bottle and use the cream 1 to 2 times daily for five months now. The scar is definitely lighter but it&#x27;s unknown if it&#x27;s from the cream or from time. This car still has a long way to go. I can&#x27;t wait to start laser.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet how well it helps the scar heal and fade, as it is still early. However, the label says it will dry in 5 minutes. It will not dry in 5 or even 15 minutes no matter how little I put on. When I asked the surgeons office about it, I was told that is the way it is.  I was applying it correctly it just does not  dry quickly.  I am still using it I just get dressed and hope for the best!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!. My ventral hernia surgical incision is nearly obliterated, and my 18 month old prior hernia scar is 50% improved.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd pump ordered &amp; surgical scar has turned out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for any type of scarring tissue that needs to heal&lt;br /&gt;which eventually flattens &amp; becomes white thin line. Had a tummy tuck procedure&lt;br /&gt;done 09/14 which now, almost a year later looks AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NVJJ</li>
            <li> Great item, this was recommended to me by my plastic surgeon after my tummy tuck to help heal the scar. It works well and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation on the skin. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because it takes time to dry.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it works , all i know is - it does .... product was purchased for my Lady after having a rather nasty looking scar from some melanoma surgery ....the Plastic Surgeon who did the closure sold us some at his office - the price would make your heart beat faster - this was the same product at a MUCH better price - thanks</li>
            <li> What I expected at a really good price</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. I&#x27;m still using the scar gel. It seems to be working. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Applied twice a day as directed and had good results, less visible scares after surgery. Was recommended by my DR.</li>
            <li> I have a very deep 1inch scar above my eyebrow. After using the product morning and night for 6 months, the scar is not as red, but still as deep. Friends say it does look better, and is not quite as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Incision is looking better every day!</li>
            <li> It has improvedy scar. I will keep ordering it</li>
            <li> This has been an effective product - very pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon recommend this so I have been using it 2x a day for about 6 months.  It has drastically reduced the scars appearance, the thickness of the scar and uneven color.  I had another scar that was still thick and red from 8 years ago.  This time I will not be left with an unsightly scar !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw dramatic improvement in scar after about a month of use.  The scar just keeps getting better !</li>
            <li> Amazing product it works and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper here .</li>
            <li> Have a large scar from surgery that I was told will probably take a year to heal. It was super red and bumpy and now 5 months later using this scar treatment it looks almost 90% better. Not as red and looks so much better. Easy to apply but has to dry. If it feels sticky you have used too much.</li>
            <li> excellent price for the quantity</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit spendy but a little goes a long way! Saw results quickly. The sooner you start using it the better. Needs to be put on 2 times a day.</li>
