            <li>After being introduced to Un Jardin I got immediately in love with it!</li>
            <li>Just love the smell!</li>
            <li>so it is nice to have a change with ginger instead of citrus being predominant.</li>

            <li>My favorite</li>
            <li>Of the Un Jardin line, I love this and Sur Le Nil.  </li>

            <li>THE AROMA IS VERY UNIQUE</li>
            <li>This fragrance is so unique!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and refreshing- almost like bottled air.</li>
            <li>though this doesnt smell like it it kind of serves the same purpose- a pleasant scent to start the day that you can even wear to the gym.</li>
            <li>Overall a pleasant slightly quirky scent that seems perfect for a heat wave.</li>
            <li>Was too strong for me, i wont change my un jard&amp;iacute;n sur le toit...</li>
            <li>Just a gorgeous scent, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent cloud for the first 6-7 hrs.</li>
            <li>so finding it here for way less was great!</li>
            <li>Very unusual, but very easy to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Be ready for many, many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She will really enjoy it for some time.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and sumptuous.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean, fresh scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Not flowery and not too sweet, just a wonderful combination of clean, fresh, and wet smell.</li>
            <li>, it is a subtle and elegant unisex perfume which lingers on pleasantly!</li>
            <li>People have asked about it because it smells so good and different.</li>
            <li>It is fresh perfume with a slightly sweet fruit note at the end.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far!</li>
            <li>smelled fresh and not stale!</li>
            <li>Longevity is amazing, although I do spray a little more liberally (about 6 sprays).</li>
            <li>Many professional perfume reviewers didn&#x27;t like this scent.</li>
            <li>the hermes fragrances dont bother my allergies but many of the big name perfumes do.</li>
            <li>I should never buy a perfume without smell it first...</li>
            <li>I purchased it at an airport overseas, which was the first time I ever smelt any of the fragrances by Hermes.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and clean, but sensual at the same time.</li>
            <li>It has a very particular smell, with hints of oak, but also exoctic flowers and scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it sure does, combining hints of Sweet Lime, Ginger, Green Notes, Coriander, Pepper, Cardamom seed, Aquatic Notes, Vetiver, Longose</li>
            <li>A light, sophisticated, complex fragance</li>
            <li>I really like this scent</li>
            <li>it was very invigorating and</li>
            <li>So much so that it was discontinued by Hermes.</li>
            <li>This was my pick out of dozens of other better known fragrances.</li>
            <li>Authentic and big deal at the same time!</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same product that costs almost twice as much in stores.</li>
            <li>I have tried different fragrances from different brands, but I was not so lucky in finding one that would speak for my personality.</li>
            <li>I still would like a real jasmine eau de toilette  and none of the Bulgari or any of the commercial brands seem to make one that I like.</li>
            <li>i really gave this scent a chance, however, not only</li>
            <li>is the scent toooo sweet, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I keep repurchasing Apres La Mousson as no other cologne on the market</li>

            <li> I bought this product as a gift for my husband, but secretly I was hoping I would like it too. And I do - I love it. It has a very clean, fresh scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering. Very nice perfume to wear to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this scent. It&#x27;s light and refreshing- almost like bottled air. I love it, but some people may want something that lasts longer. I spray it on my boyfriend all the time and he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent the one downside is it does not last long- the other scent that I considered was the jardin eau de nil but I dont like one of the notes in it - I think it is the water lotus I have smelled it in other fragrances and it is peculiar.I like Annick Goutal ( eau de hadrien ) and the jo malone grapefruit so it is nice to have a change with ginger instead of citrus being predominant.One scent I used to love is the Clarins eau Dynamisante it was very invigorating and though this doesnt smell like it it kind of serves the same purpose- a pleasant scent to start the day that you can even wear to the gym. I read a review that said this smelled like rotten cantaloupe and though there is a cantaloupe like note it is pleasant and very light.I still would like a real jasmine eau de toilette  and none of the Bulgari or any of the commercial brands seem to make one that I like. I am also allergic to lots of fragrances( kenzo was one)and the hermes fragrances dont bother my allergies but many of the big name perfumes do.Overall a pleasant slightly quirky scent that seems perfect for a heat wave.</li>
            <li> I keep repurchasing Apres La Mousson as no other cologne on the market gives such a sensual India-tinged feel and finish. The perfume is supposed to evoke the monsoon garden in Kerala and it sure does, combining hints of Sweet Lime, Ginger, Green Notes, Coriander, Pepper, Cardamom seed, Aquatic Notes, Vetiver, Longose, it is a subtle and elegant unisex perfume which lingers on pleasantly!</li>
            <li> One of my fave scents! Happy that the perfume sent smelled fresh and not stale!</li>
            <li> Too sweet....reminds me of rotten fruit... :-(  i really gave this scent a chance, however, not only is the scent toooo sweet, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I should never buy a perfume without smell it first... It&#x27;s my fault but this scent just makes me feel like vomiting...</li>
            <li> I did not buy this fragrance from Amazon. I purchased it at an airport overseas, which was the first time I ever smelt any of the fragrances by Hermes. This fragrance is so unique! It smells so fresh and clean, but sensual at the same time.This was my pick out of dozens of other better known fragrances. People have asked about it because it smells so good and different. It lasts all day on my skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great &amp;#34;eau de parfum&amp;#34; by Herm&amp;egrave;s. It has a very particular smell, with hints of oak, but also exoctic flowers and scents.&lt;br /&gt;It has no sweetness and it is very elegant!</li>
            <li> A light, sophisticated, complex fragance</li>
            <li> I have tried different fragrances from different brands, but I was not so lucky in finding one that would speak for my personality. After being introduced to Un Jardin I got immediately in love with it! I am in my third bottle. It is fresh perfume with a slightly sweet fruit note at the end. Not strong...give 3 sprays and it will last the entire day. It is a four season, day and night fragrance. I keep receiving many compliments about it and I have lost the count of how many times I had to spell the name of it and the brand to random people.</li>
            <li> Very unusual, but very easy to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Be ready for many, many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it every time I need something different from usual flowery aromas.</li>
            <li> Was too strong for me, i wont change my un jard&amp;iacute;n sur le toit... My favorite</li>
            <li> Of the Un Jardin line, I love this and Sur Le Nil.  Very prominent ripe melon scent, even though there is no melon listed in the notes, but it&#x27;s such a fragrant delicious melon scent. Very fresh and sumptuous. It truly is a unisex scent. Not flowery and not too sweet, just a wonderful combination of clean, fresh, and wet smell. Longevity is amazing, although I do spray a little more liberally (about 6 sprays). I get 12-14 hrs when it gets over 80 degrees.  The hotter it gets, the longer it lasts.  Amazing!!! Nice scent cloud for the first 6-7 hrs., I can smell it on me. After that it sits closer to the skin, but I can still catch a wiff of it when I move around. Just a gorgeous scent, highly recommend.  Between the melon scent in this and the green mango of Sur Le Nil, I&#x27;m set for the summer.</li>
            <li> Just love the smell! My favorite so far! Authentic and big deal at the same time! Love this one lol</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!! THE AROMA IS VERY UNIQUE BUT IF ITS YOURS IT WOULD BE VERY SPECIAL! ONLY ONE THING( IT DOESNT STAY TOO LONG.</li>
            <li> This is my signature fragrance and I&#x27;m so grateful to be able to buy it at a reduced price.  It is exactly the same product that costs almost twice as much in stores.</li>
            <li> My wife has been wearing this perfume for years, regularly at dept.stores this its $140 so finding it here for way less was great!</li>
            <li> Everything in perfect order;</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Wife. She loved it. Her favorite perfume. She will really enjoy it for some time.</li>
            <li> Many professional perfume reviewers didn&#x27;t like this scent. So much so that it was discontinued by Hermes. However, I am enjoying mine.</li>
