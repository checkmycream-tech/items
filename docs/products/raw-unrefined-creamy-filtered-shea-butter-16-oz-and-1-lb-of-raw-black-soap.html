            <li>The stuff is wonderful and I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>The shea butter is awesome too.</li>
            <li>However I accidentally made some homemade lotion out of it by mixing it with coconut oil, evoo, and almond oil, and it&#x27;s PERFECT.</li>
            <li>This is the best shea butter that i have ever had.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>The product is awesome.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s real good for my face</li>
            <li>For me is the best soap in the world.is a great cleanser,</li>
            <li>and it does great with cleansing my face</li>

            <li>I have seen good results using this product.</li>
            <li>I t was a good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>So when I ran out, I was looking for a good deal for the soap and shea butter for my mom.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with both products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although there was not the amount of lather I am used to, the quality of the lathering is more important as my face was thoroughly cleansed, not stripped of oil and it felt wonderful!</li>
            <li>the shea butter was way too sticky as well as greasy and the dudu osun soap broke my face out even more!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Shea butter!</li>
            <li>Iove love it for my hair!</li>
            <li>I started making my own body butter with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest and will be 55 in 2 months</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this out since all the reviews were so good</li>
            <li>I bought this for my (natural) hair and skin and am very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li>It works nicely and is filled almost to the brim!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I use it more than she does.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied and will reorder when needed.  </li>
            <li>i use it from head to toe in many applications.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it is a fabulous product, too!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I will like it better than the Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>and my skin is smoother and more radiant than it has been since I started getting acne.</li>
            <li>it is so completely natural and good for so many uses.  </li>
            <li>It smelled like paint or something really strong.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is ok (smells funny), Ive used better</li>
            <li>and then my skin in fine.</li>
            <li>But the product worked wonderfully for my little sister(12yr</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and leaves a great deep moisturized feeling to the face and body.</li>
            <li>send you a free pound to get you hooked</li>
            <li>It was so good that I let my 28 year old son try it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much too drying!!!</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel squeeky clean</li>
            <li>It does have an earthy aroma which disappears quickly</li>
            <li>, I first started using DuDu Osun first(no burn sensation) and that work fine and started seeing my face clear which is good with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>products are well worth the price</li>
            <li>ADDING MORE TO MY HAIR SINCE IN NATURAL</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast!</li>
            <li>I usually mix it with rose water which gives it a better smell and makes it a thinner consistency so that I can apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li>Shea butter great for my skin and the black soap cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li>but my Shea butter was very very stinky.</li>
            <li>If you want the best benefits of Shea butter definitely buy it raw.</li>
            <li>Products are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It does work pretty well to soften hands</li>
            <li>I really love this product for making body butters and hair deep conditioner....</li>
            <li>it was exactly how it was advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every product/brand available but this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was very cautious when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>The product came to my home pretty fast.</li>
            <li>If you are using this for your hair, use sparingly because it&#x27;s ultra thick deluxe!</li>
            <li>I had to comment on how amazing the black soap has been.</li>
            <li>My new staple!!</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and whole body.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very drying.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t too much care for the results.</li>
            <li>Just break off how ever much you want and put the rest away.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>THE SHEA BUTTER KEEPS MY HAIR NICE AND MOISTURIZED IN WHICH I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO USE EVERYDAY ON MY HAIR</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the black soap that I received.</li>
            <li>I also love black soap its a moisturizing soap</li>
            <li>leaves my skin super clean after shower and I wash also my face everyday with</li>
            <li>(im using dove to correct my skin def.working to fix problem, my skin is practically back to normal, soft and smooth).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I highly doubt it.</li>
            <li>I attempted to use it on my body and it removed so much of the natural oils from my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over in Afghanistan now and all my normal acne medicine didn&#x27;t work here.</li>
            <li>but I use my normal face moisturizer</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy again (in BIGGER quantities)  ;)</li>
            <li>I LOVE BOTH ITEMS AND ALREADY SHARED YOUR BUSINESS WITH FEW PEOPLE ALREADY.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter is exactly as I expected, great quality, but I never expected the results I&#x27;ve seen from the black soap.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t enjoy the black soap as much.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Shea butter and black soap a few months ago.they arrived fast and good condition.after using it for a while</li>
            <li>I will get the black soap for sure in the future 100% recommend</li>
            <li>The texture is very smooth, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li>The shea butter I received was pure white and had a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>The last batch I purchased was really in large chunks and it took a while to work it up</li>
            <li>It is sort of greasy, but I like how it makes my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>and it lasts at least three months or more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m natural</li>
            <li>I use this to keep my skin soft and reduce marks and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>so far it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months and my skin is sooooo supple and has a natural radiant glow now!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought black soap before from a small vendor and loved the results.</li>
            <li>This shea is creamy,non-greasy and melts way better and the raw black soap is doing wonders on my skin better than any other thing I&#x27;ve ever brought!</li>
            <li>I just felt in love with the black soap!!!</li>
            <li>and I could never get it to clear entirely.</li>
            <li>no where near my face, and definitely not on my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it to wash my natural african american hair, and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>i have use raw unrefined shea butter in the past but this is already smooth and ready for whatever use you may have.  </li>
            <li>I was really amazed at just how big the accompanying black soap was.</li>
            <li>old)so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE test out the soap on a small area for 3 days to a week before using on whole body especially if you have sensitive skin such as myself</li>
            <li>I found it was kind of hard to put on with just the shea butter because of how thick it is.</li>

            <li> I found it was kind of hard to put on with just the shea butter because of how thick it is.</li>
            <li> I really like the Shea butter and am now hooked on the black soap too!  </li>
            <li> squeeky clean, I recommend the Raw Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I immediately washed my face and could not believe the deep cleansing job this little miracle soap did on this 54 year old face.</li>
            <li> This has been the only product that has helped my eczema and dry skin</li>
            <li> On my skin but only in the winter when its dry.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using this soap I learned that the soap actually ATE my skin, I was left with Black Scaly Skin on my FACE, NECK, AND BACK which appeared to be scabbed skin(even after applying moisturizer and shea butter still felt scaly).</li>
            <li> the black soap.a little goes for a long time,I used a little bit more than half from a lb till now.</li>
            <li> About the Shea butter now-I didn&#x27;t liked.has a very strong unpleasant smell.i</li>
            <li> One pound goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try a different carrier and a different black soap</li>
            <li> With the African Black Soap it actually got it under control!</li>
            <li> THE RAW BLACK SOAP IS CLEARING UP MY FACE VERY WELL</li>
            <li> It does dry out my skin</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling too dry</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this 2 stars is because I like the black soap, however, I do NOT like the shea butter.</li>
            <li> I knew I was going to order Shea Butter and was curious of the addition of the African Black soap that was included by this seller.  </li>
            <li> I like to add quite a few essential oils in it</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a different smell but perhaps that is because it&#x27;s raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li> and I am throwing away all my other lotions.</li>
            <li> Even though the package came 1 day late, big deal, the product is what I am reviewing.</li>

            <li> It is sort of greasy, but I like how it makes my skin soft and supple. I have seen good results using this product. I noticed it tones my skin and lines disappear. I use it on my face and whole body.</li>
            <li> I love this product. (Raw Unrefined Shea Butter) The texture is very smooth, not too hard, not too soft. I use this shea butter as a moisturize for my hair and skin. I like to add quite a few essential oils in it and it lasts at least three months or more. A little goes along way!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t enjoy the black soap as much. I used it as a shampoo and a facial cleanser. It made my hair feel squeeky clean and it does great with cleansing my face but it&#x27;s very drying. I attempted to use it on my body and it removed so much of the natural oils from my skin it caused me to itch. If you like you hair squeeky clean, I recommend the Raw Black Soap. I don&#x27;t recommend for facial cleanser or body bar. It&#x27;s much too drying!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  Brought it for my wife but I use it more than she does.  One pound goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased some shea butter and dudu osun maybe earlier this summer by a different carrier and I didn&#x27;t too much care for the results. the shea butter was way too sticky as well as greasy and the dudu osun soap broke my face out even more! So I decided to try a different carrier and a different black soap and I&#x27;m very pleased with both products. This shea is creamy,non-greasy and melts way better and the raw black soap is doing wonders on my skin better than any other thing I&#x27;ve ever brought! The stuff is wonderful and I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> The product is as described in the advertising.  I am satisfied and will reorder when needed.  I t was a good deal for the price.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> When researching about black soap I seen in alot of forums people mention that black soap burns slightly and you just have to get used to the product over time. Soooo not the case with me, I first started using DuDu Osun first(no burn sensation) and that work fine and started seeing my face clear which is good with my sensitive skin so I decided to try out black soap in its &#x27;raw&#x27; state. When using the raw soap I def.felt the burn instantly, so I figured it was just quality soap...NOPE..After 3 days of using this soap I learned that the soap actually ATE my skin, I was left with Black Scaly Skin on my FACE, NECK, AND BACK which appeared to be scabbed skin(even after applying moisturizer and shea butter still felt scaly). But the product worked wonderfully for my little sister(12yr old)so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE test out the soap on a small area for 3 days to a week before using on whole body especially if you have sensitive skin such as myself (im using dove to correct my skin def.working to fix problem, my skin is practically back to normal, soft and smooth). The shea butter is ok (smells funny), Ive used better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought black soap before from a small vendor and loved the results. Never had my acne disappear like it did with this. So when I ran out, I was looking for a good deal for the soap and shea butter for my mom. Bingo! Here it is. Arrived super fast! 2 days after I ordered. Products are exactly as described. Shea butter arrives in the container pictured and soap arrives in a sealed plastic bag. Just break off how ever much you want and put the rest away. Quality products from this seller! Will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a month. I&#x27;m over in Afghanistan now and all my normal acne medicine didn&#x27;t work here. With the African Black Soap it actually got it under control! I love it and it was an awesome price! I read a lot of reviews before I bought it and some said it burnt their skin and dried out their skin really bad and others said it works great. So I was very cautious when I first started using it. I started with using it once a day and then once I got a feel for how it worked with my skin I now use it twice a day. It does dry out my skin but I use my normal face moisturizer and then my skin in fine. The shea butter is awesome too. I started making my own body butter with it. I found it was kind of hard to put on with just the shea butter because of how thick it is. I would definitely buy this again and I was actually thinking about sending it as a present. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The shea butter I received was pure white and had a chemical smell. The scent was so offensive that I could only use it on my feet--no where near my face, and definitely not on my hair. I have never had shea butter like this, and would never buy it if I had known that it was not the yellow stuff with the nutty smell that I am used to using. I am completely satisfied with the black soap that I received. I use it to wash my natural african american hair, and I have no complaints. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because I like the black soap, however, I do NOT like the shea butter.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a stocking stuffer for my daughter at Christmas.  She is using this and likes it but prefers another brand.</li>
            <li> what can i say about shea butter except that it is a gift from the motherland.  it is so completely natural and good for so many uses.  i use it from head to toe in many applications.  i have use raw unrefined shea butter in the past but this is already smooth and ready for whatever use you may have.  will reorder in the future.</li>
            <li> I use shea butter everyday and at times I have gone for the unrefined product. If you are trying to decide, by all means, go with the ones that are labeled \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; or \\&quot;milled\\&quot;, as the chunks have been worked out. The last batch I purchased was really in large chunks and it took a while to work it up but you will not have that problem with this creamy product. I was really amazed at just how big the accompanying black soap was. I make a wash combining it with essential oils and aloe vera and I use it all over.</li>
            <li> I heard about the ABS on You Tube and  needed to try it, as I have psoriasis. Even though the package came 1 day late, big deal, the product is what I am reviewing. I immediately washed my face and could not believe the deep cleansing job this little miracle soap did on this 54 year old face. I&#x27;ll be honest and will be 55 in 2 months but my face feels like a 30 year old!&lt;br /&gt;Although there was not the amount of lather I am used to, the quality of the lathering is more important as my face was thoroughly cleansed, not stripped of oil and it felt wonderful! It was so good that I let my 28 year old son try it and he now uses it daily.&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter that came with the order, I have since learned is not actual Shea butter, but something referred to as \\&quot;African Butter\\&quot; from the nut of the African Butter Tree. HOWEVER, it is a fabulous product, too! It glides on smoothly and leaves a great deep moisturized feeling to the face and body. It does have an earthy aroma which disappears quickly and my body was moisturized all day and all night!&lt;br /&gt;Both products are well worth the price and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the black soap but there wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with it. I LOVE the Shea butter! If you want the best benefits of Shea butter definitely buy it raw. This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this out since all the reviews were so good but my Shea butter was very very stinky. It smelled like paint or something really strong. It does work pretty well to soften hands but when I tried it in my hair it felt like I had gone to the beach, not good and tangled. I haven&#x27;t tried the black soap yet but I&#x27;m sure I will like it better than the Shea butter. I don&#x27;t know if the butter is supposed to smell like that but I highly doubt it.</li>
            <li> When I initially received this I was a bit turned off by how thick it was. However I accidentally made some homemade lotion out of it by mixing it with coconut oil, evoo, and almond oil, and it&#x27;s PERFECT. My new staple!! I have been using this for several months and my skin is sooooo supple and has a natural radiant glow now!!! I will never buy lotion again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Shea butter and black soap a few months ago.they arrived fast and good condition.after using it for a while I just felt in love with the black soap!!! For me is the best soap in the world.is a great cleanser,leaves my skin super clean after shower and I wash also my face everyday with the black soap.a little goes for a long time,I used a little bit more than half from a lb till now.About the Shea butter now-I didn&#x27;t liked.has a very strong unpleasant smell.i tried to use it on my skin..and it feels greasy.maybe was something wrong with the Shea butter or just my skin didn&#x27;t \\&quot;received \\&quot; so good.anyway I will get the black soap for sure in the future 100% recommend</li>
            <li> If you are using this for your hair, use sparingly because it&#x27;s ultra thick deluxe! I would suggest mixing 1 part shea to 3 parts coconut oil. Yeah, it&#x27;s just that thick! It has a bit of a different smell but perhaps that is because it&#x27;s raw and unrefined. Mine was not yellow as shown in the picture, it was off-white.</li>
            <li> I really love this product for making body butters and hair deep conditioner....However the container it came in was busted that&#x27;s the reason for 3 stars the product deserves 5 stars</li>
            <li> This is the best shea butter that i have ever had. I was so impressed with the scent and the way that it leaves my skin feeling that i ordered more. My products arrived in 2 days and the price is cheaper than anywhere i have seen. Great products. Great seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my (natural) hair and skin and am very happy with the quality. It works nicely and is filled almost to the brim!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It does wonders for my skin.i shared it with friends. The product arrived on time.and it was exactly how it was advertised.</li>
            <li> I knew I was going to order Shea Butter and was curious of the addition of the African Black soap that was included by this seller.  I really like the Shea butter and am now hooked on the black soap too!  I would have given 5 stars but the plastic container with the Shea butter  was cracked. No harm to the Shea Butter that I could tell. Probably happened in the course of shipping. I would absolutely buy again (in BIGGER quantities)  ;)</li>
            <li> This has been the only product that has helped my eczema and dry skin and I am throwing away all my other lotions. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> The product came to my home pretty fast. The product is awesome. Shea butter great for my skin and the black soap cleans my face very well. Peace</li>
            <li> I know people usually refer to perms/relaxers as creamy crack but I&#x27;m natural so this is my creamy crack and boy do I use shea butter for everything. when I do pedicures I use it to soften my feet and hands. On my skin but only in the winter when its dry. I love Iove love it for my hair! The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite I usually mix it with rose water which gives it a better smell and makes it a thinner consistency so that I can apply it to my hair. I also love black soap its a moisturizing soap so it&#x27;s real good for my face it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling too dry</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my skin soft and reduce marks and wrinkles. so far it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I had to comment on how amazing the black soap has been. The shea butter is exactly as I expected, great quality, but I never expected the results I&#x27;ve seen from the black soap. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks and my skin is smoother and more radiant than it has been since I started getting acne. I never had terrible acne but it&#x27;s always bothered me and I could never get it to clear entirely. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every product/brand available but this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They send you a free pound to get you hooked but I&#x27;m grateful!</li>
            <li> I LOVE BOTH ITEMS AND ALREADY SHARED YOUR BUSINESS WITH FEW PEOPLE ALREADY.  THE SHEA BUTTER KEEPS MY HAIR NICE AND MOISTURIZED IN WHICH I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO USE EVERYDAY ON MY HAIR I CAN GO 2-3 DAYS WITH OUT ADDING MORE TO MY HAIR SINCE IN NATURAL THIS IS GREAT WHEN I PUT MY IN A PROTECTIVE STYLE  THE RAW BLACK SOAP IS CLEARING UP MY FACE VERY WELL AND I CUT OFF SLICES TO SHARE WITH OTHERS I ALSO USE THE SHEA BUTTER ON MY FACE ONCE I DRY IT FROM USING THE RAW BLACK SOAP  I WILL BE ORDERING THIS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
