            <li>This screen protector works perfectly as described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It fits perfectly!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re able to get it on perfect, it works great!!!</li>
            <li>but I got a great result with no bubble at all.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use!</li>
            <li>the touch screen worked just as good as without the protector.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>There is a handy microfiber cleaning cloth included, so I cleaned the screen.  </li>
            <li>My best friend bought a new iPad mini, and was just going to carry it around.  </li>
            <li>but it turned out to be a really good protector, its not 100% accurate of the size of the iPad</li>
            <li>It fit my iPad and the quality was good.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone, there are many others that work much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found better products out there for the iPad</li>
            <li>However, I could say it&#x27;s still good product with reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it is easily scratched up.  </li>
            <li>all the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mini is now just as easy to use as before.  </li>
            <li>The protector doesn&#x27;t interfere with the operation, and is still easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My friend was grateful I bought this for him, and I am glad his device will stay clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It will get bubbles if you dont clean screen correctly..be sure to use eletronics duster and install in a room</li>
            <li>it fits the screen just fine and was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it is a good product, it fits my mini iPad, the installation was breeze, so far good very satisfied with product, and seller is great, would do buy this product from same seller definitely.</li>
            <li>The quality is fine, it does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li>But now that it is on it is fine.</li>
            <li>so you will have a fine install&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second one worked great.</li>
            <li>To be honest, it was the correct product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This leaves a bubbling that can&#x27;t be removed, and therefore prevents a smooth application to the ipad screen.</li>
            <li>also noticed it makes a squeeking sound whenever i use my stylus on it.</li>
            <li>The whole package has two sets of the protectors, each in their own plastic.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to wipe fingerprints off, and keep clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The person who wrote that it doesnt fit is wrong&lt;</li>
            <li>The screen still accumulates finger smears, but I think ever device and protector will do that, wipes clean easily.</li>
            <li>you first put the screen protector on make sure you get all the bubbles out as you apply, otherwise you will end up with bubbles and you cant get them out</li>
            <li>Product was shipped quickly, and as described.</li>
            <li>This product is incredibly hard to get on the iPad and if it&#x27;s not put on perfectly the first time, don&#x27;t bother trying again.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install, instructions were clear.</li>
            <li>I think the Supcase  2 pack Clear Screen Protector for the iPad Mini works fine</li>
            <li>Installed the first sheet and have a couple of bubbles on the edges from dust.  </li>
            <li>at first i thought this might be a rip of</li>
            <li>I opened the first set, and it had everything needed for one application of the protector.  </li>
            <li>I opened the first set.  </li>
            <li>They did it the first go around, because they are used to it.  </li>
            <li>The screen protector works exactly likes its supposed to.</li>
            <li>You do want to get this on straight the first time.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it went on the screen</li>
            <li>screen protector also seems very durable.</li>
            <li>thats the only thing i didnt like but other than that its a good protector&lt;</li>
            <li>However, I took it off one week later since there were so many fingerprint left.</li>
            <li>decent for the price, but if you like to use skype and facetime, you might want to consider another screen protector that doesn&#x27;t block the microphone.</li>
            <li>I bought ZAGG invisible shield with high definition.</li>
            <li>When you compare the ZAGG and this product, I like ZAGG since it gave more clear view and less fingerprint.</li>
            <li>Although they suggested not to buy this again for the reason stated above, if you don&#x27;t do it right the first time you&#x27;ll need to move onto the next one.</li>
            <li>I will be more careful next time, when I replace it.</li>
            <li>I could read very clearly through the protector and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting a screen protector and secondly recommend this one in particular.</li>
            <li>Fits as it should, clear.</li>
            <li>I could say that ZAGG also left fingerprint but not as much as this product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Two \\&quot;soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;Screen protector fits perfectly, is nearly invisible, and does not hinder the tablet&#x27;s touch operation in any way.</li>
            <li>Indeed, even though, ZAGG left fingerprint, I could see clearly with any angle but this product with fingerprint makes blurry writing.</li>
            <li>It was kind of difficult to apply on my Mini</li>

            <li> hard to see dust on the edges.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> tried and tried and looked at Utube and yet couldnt get rid of the bubbles. so not worth the time nor the money.</li>
            <li> Have tried wtih both sheets now and can&#x27;t get either one to go on without tons of bubbles. It&#x27;s frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> I think the Supcase  2 pack Clear Screen Protector for the iPad Mini works fine and it was easy to use. No problems.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped quickly, and as described. Installed the first sheet and have a couple of bubbles on the edges from dust.  hard to see dust on the edges.  It does not effect the operation of the unit only appearance. I will be more careful next time, when I replace it. I like the idea of protecting the touch pad, since this is my first touch pad device and am not sure how vulnerable they are to damage.</li>
            <li> protects my screen great!&lt;br /&gt;when you first put the screen protector on make sure you get all the bubbles out as you apply, otherwise you will end up with bubbles and you cant get them out</li>
            <li> I really like the way it went on the screen and it does not look or feel like there is a cover on it.</li>
            <li> You do want to get this on straight the first time. I wasted the first one trying to straighten a slight misalignment. The second one worked great.</li>
            <li> I got this product before I got my IPad mini. So after I got ipad mini, I tried to apply it. But the protector is larger than my screen! I just threw it away.....</li>
            <li> at first i thought this might be a rip of but it turned out to be a really good protector, its not 100% accurate of the size of the iPad but it gets the job done i would recommended it</li>
            <li> it is a good product, it fits my mini iPad, the installation was breeze, so far good very satisfied with product, and seller is great, would do buy this product from same seller definitely.</li>
            <li> These screen protectors are difficult to apply, you cannot get all of the air bubbles out and it is easily scratched up.  I would not recommend this product to anyone, there are many others that work much better.</li>
            <li> This was suggested as an add-on item and it worked great!  Price is awesome as well!  Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> You will get what you pay for. To be honest, it was the correct product at reasonable price. It fit my iPad and the quality was good. It was kind of difficult to apply on my Mini but I got a great result with no bubble at all. I could read very clearly through the protector and the touch screen worked just as good as without the protector. However, I took it off one week later since there were so many fingerprint left. I bought ZAGG invisible shield with high definition. I paid $32 with tax. When you compare the ZAGG and this product, I like ZAGG since it gave more clear view and less fingerprint. I could say that ZAGG also left fingerprint but not as much as this product. Indeed, even though, ZAGG left fingerprint, I could see clearly with any angle but this product with fingerprint makes blurry writing. That kept bordering me to read some articles. However, I could say it&#x27;s still good product with reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After waiting almost a month for the screen protectors to arrive, there was immediate disappoint in the quality of the product.  When the protective film is being pulled from the package for application to the ipad, it sticks together.  This leaves a bubbling that can&#x27;t be removed, and therefore prevents a smooth application to the ipad screen.</li>
            <li> it fits the screen just fine and was easy to apply. screen protector also seems very durable. However, it covers the microphone hole next to the camera. also noticed it makes a squeeking sound whenever i use my stylus on it. decent for the price, but if you like to use skype and facetime, you might want to consider another screen protector that doesn&#x27;t block the microphone.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1WQJFUICG00HU]]This kit comes with two of everything:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Two screen protectors&lt;br /&gt;-Two microfiber cleaning cloths&lt;br /&gt;-Two \\&quot;soft cards\\&quot; for pushing air bubbles out once the screen protector is applied&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screen protector fits perfectly, is nearly invisible, and does not hinder the tablet&#x27;s touch operation in any way.</li>
            <li> My best friend bought a new iPad mini, and was just going to carry it around.  I sprang for one of these screen protectors, and put it on for him.  The whole package has two sets of the protectors, each in their own plastic.  I opened the first set, and it had everything needed for one application of the protector.  I opened the first set.  There is a handy microfiber cleaning cloth included, so I cleaned the screen.  I just peeled the plastic back, lined it up, put it on, and used the little applicator card to squeeze out all the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mini is now just as easy to use as before.  The protector doesn&#x27;t interfere with the operation, and is still easy to use.  It is easy to wipe fingerprints off, and keep clean.  My friend was grateful I bought this for him, and I am glad his device will stay clean.  It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This screen protector works perfectly as described. I highly recommend getting a screen protector and secondly recommend this one in particular.</li>
            <li> The quality is fine, it does what it is intended to do. It took several tries to get it to adhere without bubbles and the adhesive started to dry up. But now that it is on it is fine.</li>
            <li> This screen protector is not like the one shown on display&lt;br /&gt;The cut out for home button is not a full circle..thats the only thing i didnt like but other than that its a good protector&lt;br /&gt;It will get bubbles if you dont clean screen correctly..be sure to use eletronics duster and install in a room you know you wont have dust flying&lt;br /&gt;.If you do so you will have a fine install&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who wrote that it doesnt fit is wrong&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  Fits as it should, clear. No need to pay tons for any others. Will by again when I need a replacement</li>
            <li> This product is incredibly hard to get on the iPad and if it&#x27;s not put on perfectly the first time, don&#x27;t bother trying again.  Just use the second one.  I&#x27;ve found better products out there for the iPad protectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re able to get it on perfect, it works great!!! I didn&#x27;t bother trying to put the second one on, and gave it to a friend who works for a cell phone company in a store.  They did it the first go around, because they are used to it.  Although they suggested not to buy this again for the reason stated above, if you don&#x27;t do it right the first time you&#x27;ll need to move onto the next one.</li>
            <li> Tried it twice on a ipad mini. Every time I had small bubbles because of dust. Second time I did it in the bathroom because of the dust issue. Same result. Did my iPad with a screen protector from Tech Armor no problem there.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying a different brand for the mini next time.</li>
            <li> The screen protector works exactly likes its supposed to. It was easy to install, instructions were clear. The screen is protected and it&#x27;s not noticeable that anything is over my ipad mini screen. The screen still accumulates finger smears, but I think ever device and protector will do that, wipes clean easily.</li>
