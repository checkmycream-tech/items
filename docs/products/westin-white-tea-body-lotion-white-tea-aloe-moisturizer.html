            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too greasy or too watery, just right.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to strong perfume</li>
            <li>After obtaining as many samples as possible from a recent Westin overnight, was thrilled to determine availability online.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh, tantalizing and sexy and the cream keeps the fragrance fresh for a long time on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is such a clean light scent.</li>
            <li>We stay at Westin hotels and that is where I first used it.  </li>
            <li>Love the Westinghouse White Tea Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li>like it!&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, I like</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t able to find all ingredients prior to purchase.</li>
            <li>have many products at home, but only reach for this one.</li>
            <li>I first discovered it at the Westin in Disneyworld.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they will make the lotion more creamy in the future.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li>My wife loves this lotion and will most likely reorder on a regular basis unless another product becomes more alluring.  </li>
            <li>love the Westin hotels and stay there whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>I first had found it in the mini hotel size, at the Detroit Westin.</li>
            <li>I first used these products while at the Westin in Shanghai.</li>
            <li>I have the hand soap in several of my bathrooms at home and guests have commented on how lovely it</li>
            <li>I have been using it for three years always buying at the Kierland Arizona&lt;br /&gt;Spa and it has been first class that was the reason I purchased three.</li>
            <li>The smell is sophisticated, earthy, and yet quite simple.</li>
            <li>I use way too much lotion, to make it feesable for me!  </li>
            <li>Like many who purchase online my first experience with Westin&#x27;s White Tea Aloe Body Lotion was while staying at a Westin hotel and wondered if it could be purchased elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I ordered because I love the smell of the White Tea Aloe Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it when I stayed in one of the Westin hotels</li>
            <li>first used this when we stayed at hotel in florida.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this lotion when we stayed at the Westin in Philadelphia for our anniversary.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I have already placed a second order.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is not very big so won&#x27;t last very long - it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size of the bottle but worth it because the scent is so incredible.</li>
            <li>Walked into the Westin in Dallas and the whole hotel smelled like this..</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>and it does&#x27;t really have any healing properties that I know of, so</li>
            <li>is.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order within 10 days and am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The lotion really moisturizes and the scent lingers.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Sinks in immediately and leaves skin with fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to find a perfume that instantly reminded me of the Westin lotion.  </li>
            <li>Like the clean fresh scent that is not over powering like other lotions.</li>
            <li>Body lotion glides on easily with no greasy residue left on skin, yet thoroughly moisturizes, leaving behind a lovely, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>love, love, love the scent, just too expensive!!</li>
            <li>I recently ordered a bunch of fragrance samples and was delighted to discover that Bulgari&#x27;s White is VERY similar.  </li>
            <li>Luckily with my job, I have a reason to go to a local Westin every so often.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I got this is for the scent.</li>
            <li>but I noticed the smell wore off fairly quickly and is not ultra- moisturizing which is necessary in drier climates.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Some of the people in our hotel put it on their children, but I would say the scent is a little over the top for a child.</li>
            <li>This is good for a slight scent after a shower, but not for use as a dry skin product or skin softener.  </li>
            <li>I had never really tried to find a sample of a lotion from a hotel before, but this lotion is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick.</li>
            <li>Soft, clean and slightly sweet, but not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I live in AZ and get sunburned</li>
            <li>It has such a soft fresh scent and is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy,  dry&#x27;s quickly.  </li>
            <li>Light, absorbs quickly - no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a large bottle and while it does smell similar, it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same scent.  </li>
            <li>It works wonders on my sensitive skin, and leaves me feeling velvety soft!</li>
            <li>A little pricey for the size of the bottle, but the scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>He works in the sun all day and was surprised how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>But the scent is really the key.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy.</li>
            <li>Just on a whim, I Googled it, and voila, it comes directly to my door.</li>
            <li>It is still tolerable, just not as strong as the small bottle I had at the hotel.  </li>
            <li>if you enjoy this scent, then you know exactly what I mean!</li>
            <li>I have two colleagues that work in management and seriously, when I run out, I have thought of begging them for some more.      </li>
            <li>a clean scent, easily absorbed lotion with white Tea at this price and quality is hard to find!  </li>
            <li>I first came across this when I spent the night at the Westin with my son and mom for an appointment.</li>
            <li>It dries quick and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy oily feel that some lotions have.</li>
            <li>I like also because it absorbs into the skin quickly and is not greasy or heavy oil feeling.  </li>
            <li>Smells unbelievable fresh!</li>
            <li>As a lotion, it&#x27;s fairly standard - on par with say, the stuff you get from Bath &amp; Body Works - which is to say it&#x27;s a little nicer than standard hotel lotion, but not exactly noteworthy on its own.  </li>
            <li>Such a suttle and soft scent.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to hear his praises for this product and that he actually purchased it!!!</li>
            <li>I work with people sensitive to scent and have never gotten a negative comment (but have gotten positive ones!).  </li>
            <li>The scent is clean but subtle.</li>
            <li>Just exactly as I like it, and I got it in only a few days.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> \\&quot;White Tea is my favorite lotion EVER!</li>

            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too greasy or too watery, just right.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to strong perfume</li>
            <li> After obtaining as many samples as possible from a recent Westin overnight, was thrilled to determine availability online.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh, tantalizing and sexy and the cream keeps the fragrance fresh for a long time on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is such a clean light scent.</li>
            <li> We stay at Westin hotels and that is where I first used it.  </li>
            <li> Love the Westinghouse White Tea Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li> like it!&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, I like</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t able to find all ingredients prior to purchase.</li>
            <li> have many products at home, but only reach for this one.</li>
            <li> I first discovered it at the Westin in Disneyworld.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they will make the lotion more creamy in the future.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> My wife loves this lotion and will most likely reorder on a regular basis unless another product becomes more alluring.  </li>
            <li> love the Westin hotels and stay there whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> I first had found it in the mini hotel size, at the Detroit Westin.</li>
            <li> I first used these products while at the Westin in Shanghai.</li>
            <li> I have the hand soap in several of my bathrooms at home and guests have commented on how lovely it</li>
            <li> I have been using it for three years always buying at the Kierland Arizona&lt;br /&gt;Spa and it has been first class that was the reason I purchased three.</li>
            <li> The smell is sophisticated, earthy, and yet quite simple.</li>
            <li> I use way too much lotion, to make it feesable for me!  </li>
            <li> Like many who purchase online my first experience with Westin&#x27;s White Tea Aloe Body Lotion was while staying at a Westin hotel and wondered if it could be purchased elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I ordered because I love the smell of the White Tea Aloe Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li> I first tried it when I stayed in one of the Westin hotels</li>
            <li> first used this when we stayed at hotel in florida.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this lotion when we stayed at the Westin in Philadelphia for our anniversary.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I have already placed a second order.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is not very big so won&#x27;t last very long - it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size of the bottle but worth it because the scent is so incredible.</li>
            <li> Walked into the Westin in Dallas and the whole hotel smelled like this..</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> and it does&#x27;t really have any healing properties that I know of, so</li>
            <li> is.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order within 10 days and am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The lotion really moisturizes and the scent lingers.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Sinks in immediately and leaves skin with fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find a perfume that instantly reminded me of the Westin lotion.  </li>
            <li> Like the clean fresh scent that is not over powering like other lotions.</li>
            <li> Body lotion glides on easily with no greasy residue left on skin, yet thoroughly moisturizes, leaving behind a lovely, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> love, love, love the scent, just too expensive!!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a bunch of fragrance samples and was delighted to discover that Bulgari&#x27;s White is VERY similar.  </li>
            <li> Luckily with my job, I have a reason to go to a local Westin every so often.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I got this is for the scent.</li>
            <li> but I noticed the smell wore off fairly quickly and is not ultra- moisturizing which is necessary in drier climates.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Some of the people in our hotel put it on their children, but I would say the scent is a little over the top for a child.</li>
            <li> This is good for a slight scent after a shower, but not for use as a dry skin product or skin softener.  </li>
            <li> I had never really tried to find a sample of a lotion from a hotel before, but this lotion is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick.</li>
            <li> Soft, clean and slightly sweet, but not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I live in AZ and get sunburned</li>
            <li> It has such a soft fresh scent and is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy,  dry&#x27;s quickly.  </li>
            <li> Light, absorbs quickly - no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a large bottle and while it does smell similar, it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same scent.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on my sensitive skin, and leaves me feeling velvety soft!</li>
            <li> A little pricey for the size of the bottle, but the scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> He works in the sun all day and was surprised how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> But the scent is really the key.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy.</li>
            <li> Just on a whim, I Googled it, and voila, it comes directly to my door.</li>
            <li> It is still tolerable, just not as strong as the small bottle I had at the hotel.  </li>
            <li> if you enjoy this scent, then you know exactly what I mean!</li>
            <li> I have two colleagues that work in management and seriously, when I run out, I have thought of begging them for some more.      </li>
            <li> a clean scent, easily absorbed lotion with white Tea at this price and quality is hard to find!  </li>
            <li> I first came across this when I spent the night at the Westin with my son and mom for an appointment.</li>
            <li> It dries quick and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy oily feel that some lotions have.</li>
            <li> I like also because it absorbs into the skin quickly and is not greasy or heavy oil feeling.  </li>
            <li> Smells unbelievable fresh!</li>
            <li> As a lotion, it&#x27;s fairly standard - on par with say, the stuff you get from Bath &amp; Body Works - which is to say it&#x27;s a little nicer than standard hotel lotion, but not exactly noteworthy on its own.  </li>
            <li> Such a suttle and soft scent.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to hear his praises for this product and that he actually purchased it!!!</li>
            <li> I work with people sensitive to scent and have never gotten a negative comment (but have gotten positive ones!).  </li>
            <li> The scent is clean but subtle.</li>
            <li> Just exactly as I like it, and I got it in only a few days.  </li>
            <li> The smell stays quite long.</li>
            <li> We used the lotion all day long to help keep our skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> but for goes too fast for $14 or so for a small amount of lotion!  </li>
            <li> I will purchase this lotion again as well as other products in this same fragrance.</li>
            <li> (my skin would dry out)</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well enough, but it&#x27;s definitely not a product to use for heavy moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey which is why I gave it only 4 stars .</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected a richer lotion.  </li>
            <li> Whenever we stay at the Westin, I grab this lotion to take home and never really thought of looking online, but I did!  </li>
            <li> All these other comments are on par...</li>
            <li> I remember the time we spent in Hawaii for our honeymoon!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that this line does not have a body spray or cologne in this scent.</li>
            <li> I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because the lotion is not really \\&quot;rich\\&quot; or thick enough to be an everyday body cream</li>
            <li> I tracked it down on the internet and found it on Amazon and have been buying it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product again  (not a good value) but it is the same hotel supplied product.</li>
            <li> The only reason I think I would keep buying this from them at the ridiculous price they charge is because my husband and I stayed at the Westin a few months ago</li>
            <li> A little pricey but it&#x27;sworth</li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> Usually lotion is heavy and oily.  </li>
            <li> The sun was brutal, but the hotel supplied us with this fabulous Heavenly aloe tea lotion, and hair products.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the conditioner after dating at the marriott in mammoth but feel that the bottle is way to small for the price and quality.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Westin is the only one who makes this fragrance (that I know of), so you have to buy it from them.  </li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is expensive.</li>
            <li> The only negative for me is the consistancy is very thin and watery.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was an old or bad batch.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift and the scent is very faint and the color of lotion is white, where as the one in the hotel is a mint green</li>
            <li> It is a little thin but the smell trumps that.</li>
            <li> her!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for giving me a small gift!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something subtly addicting about it.  </li>
            <li> I know that sounds a little sad, but</li>
            <li> Not greasy but also not a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of</li>
            <li> Without fail, EVERY time I used it, I was asked what I was wearing...</li>
            <li> I visited the Westin hotel one time and they had this line of products and i was totally obsessed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why it is so damned expensive.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend everyone try a trial size, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed there are parabens in it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was disappointed in that regard.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product!</li>

            <li> Smelling it makes me feel like I&#x27;m on vacation again!</li>
            <li> Such a suttle and soft scent. Great for yoga and the gym. Not perfumey, just clean and crisp. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I stayed at a Westin in Providence multiple times over a period of months and came to adore this lotion.  The mixture is smooth and goes on easily.  The smell is clean and pleasant.  I work with people sensitive to scent and have never gotten a negative comment (but have gotten positive ones!).  This is a great lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great/fresh. Not overpowering at all.  We stay at Westin hotels and that is where I first used it.  Not into strong smells that is why I like this.</li>
            <li> Walked into the Westin in Dallas and the whole hotel smelled like this.. it&#x27;s so clean and nice.. found it here on amazon!! love it</li>
            <li> Westin heavenly bath products are as advertised - heavenly! Body lotion glides on easily with no greasy residue left on skin, yet thoroughly moisturizes, leaving behind a lovely, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great, light fragrance &amp; not greasy!</li>
            <li> My husband got a sample while staying at the Westin.  He came home and purchased some more online.  He works in the sun all day and was surprised how well it worked.  Usually lotion is heavy and oily.  I was surprised to hear his praises for this product and that he actually purchased it!!! Very unlike him so it must be great!</li>
            <li> I discovered this lotion on a trip to Chicago and immediately loved the fresh, clean scent.  There&#x27;s something subtly addicting about it.  As a lotion, it&#x27;s fairly standard - on par with say, the stuff you get from Bath &amp; Body Works - which is to say it&#x27;s a little nicer than standard hotel lotion, but not exactly noteworthy on its own.  But the scent is really the key.  It&#x27;s wonderful!    Since then, I make a point to grab the room sample whenever I&#x27;m in a Westin.  Luckily with my job, I have a reason to go to a local Westin every so often.  I now get inordinately excited if I see the housekeeping cart in the hallway, I&#x27;m always hoping I can snag a bottle!  I have two colleagues that work in management and seriously, when I run out, I have thought of begging them for some more.      I recently ordered a bunch of fragrance samples and was delighted to discover that Bulgari&#x27;s White is VERY similar.  So ladies, if you want to wear this as a perfume, check it out.  I was really excited to find a perfume that instantly reminded me of the Westin lotion.  I know that sounds a little sad, but if you enjoy this scent, then you know exactly what I mean!</li>
            <li> love, love, love the scent, just too expensive!!</li>
            <li> I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in Vancuvor, Canada and loved the smells, bath soaps, even the bedding ( which I also purchased! I am never without this product in the summer! I feel back in Canada! It&#x27;s just enough moisture &amp; not sticky.  Luv it!!!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well enough, but it&#x27;s definitely not a product to use for heavy moisturizing. Just apply for an energetic boost of fragrance.   A little pricey for the size of the bottle, but the scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> A nice, light-weight lotion with a long-lasting scent. I adore it, and will probably buy more. It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is light, non--oily and has a light, clean fresh fragrance.  I highly recommend it.  The shampoo, conditioner, and candle are also great items.  This is a high quality spa- worthy product that is also sold at Westin hotels. That speaks to the quality as wle.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it feels great.</li>
            <li> Whenever we stay at the Westin, I grab this lotion to take home and never really thought of looking online, but I did!  And yeah Amazon has this so easy ordering!  It&#x27;s a clean, fresh scent that just perks you up.  It dries quick and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy oily feel that some lotions have. All these other comments are on par...grab one and try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  Discovered this lotion while at spa in Maui. Wonderful fragrance, light lotion, non greasy, does not stain</li>
            <li> I stayed at the Westin and fell in love with the texture, aroma, and benefits of this lotion.  I had never really tried to find a sample of a lotion from a hotel before, but this lotion is fantastic.  I love how it feels and smells heavenly.  Makes your clothes smell wonderful as well!</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion.  It hydrates well, does not leave a &#x27;\\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling, the scent is clean and fresh, and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this lotion at the Westin Hotel.  Smells unbelievable fresh! Good price on line.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My friend got me started on this! A little pricey but it&#x27;sworth it!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells every bit as amazing as the white tea room fragrance which I love.  I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because the lotion is not really \\&quot;rich\\&quot; or thick enough to be an everyday body cream (my skin would dry out) but it&#x27;s great for special occasions.  Also, the bottle is not very big so won&#x27;t last very long - it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size of the bottle but worth it because the scent is so incredible.</li>
            <li> I used this product on a vacation in Cancun, Mexico at a Westin Resort and fell in love with it!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent for lotion. It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy at all. It leaves a fresh sensation on the skin. I will definitely be buying another one once I finish the one I currently have.</li>
            <li> The lotion is really wonderful. It makes the skin smooth and not sticky at all :) I just love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom. She loves this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!!! It is not heavy. Reminds me of the type of lotions they use in the spa&#x27;s. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It just takes me back to a happy place. This scent is always present at Westin Hotels and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> Like many others here, I discovered this lotion while staying at a Westin.  I was immediately in love with the scent, as it was diffused in the lobby.  I was equally thrilled to find soaps, lotions and shampoos in the room with a matching scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just by luck, I happened across it here on Amazon.  I purchased a large bottle and while it does smell similar, it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same scent.  It just seems a bit off.  Not sure if it was an old or bad batch.  It is still tolerable, just not as strong as the small bottle I had at the hotel.  No biggie.  I am still happy with the purchase and glad to have this scent with me every day now and not just while on vacations!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this item.  I stayed at the Westin Boston and kept the hotel sample in my purse.  Without fail, EVERY time I used it, I was asked what I was wearing...everyone loves it.  I would recommend everyone try a trial size, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells delightful!  Soft, clean and slightly sweet, but not overwhelming at all.  The only negative for me is the consistancy is very thin and watery.  I prefer a thicker body lotion.  For the price, I expected a richer lotion.  This is good for a slight scent after a shower, but not for use as a dry skin product or skin softener.  I&#x27;d buy a body butter in this scent but probably not the lotion-too watery for me.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product; it smells fresh and clean.  My only complaint is that it is expensive.</li>
            <li> The main reason I got this is for the scent. I visited the Westin hotel one time and they had this line of products and i was totally obsessed. The reason I only give 3 stars is because of the price and it does&#x27;t really have any healing properties that I know of, so if you are looking for something to soothe extremely dry skin, this may not be your best bet, but I would still recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome! I first came across this when I spent the night at the Westin with my son and mom for an appointment. There was a trial size of this lotion in the bathroom and I tried it reluctantly. I was in for a pleasant surprise! The smell was awesome. It wasn&#x27;t too greasy or too watery, just right. I found it on Amazon, to my delight. It&#x27;s the same lotion. The same smell, the same quality. I love it and I recommend!</li>
            <li> Best summer lotion.  It&#x27;s light and cooling.</li>
            <li> Love the Westinghouse White Tea Body Lotion.  Like the clean fresh scent that is not over powering like other lotions. Almost ready to buy some more.</li>
            <li> Same wonderful lotion as offered in hotel. Glad to be able to use at home.</li>
            <li> Was on vacation with my boyfriend and they had the Westin products in the bathroom!  Absolutely loved the fresh scent that when we came home I went online and ordered it for myself.  It&#x27;s a little pricey which is why I gave it only 4 stars .</li>
            <li> Not greasy but also not a great moisturizer.  I bought this and the conditioner after dating at the marriott in mammoth but feel that the bottle is way to small for the price and quality.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again  (not a good value) but it is the same hotel supplied product.</li>
            <li> Good！&lt;br /&gt;I like it!&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, I like her!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for giving me a small gift!</li>
            <li> Love the smell but I wasn&#x27;t able to find all ingredients prior to purchase. Disappointed there are parabens in it.</li>
            <li> We stayed at the Westin for the first time this past summer and I fell in love with this lotion. It goes on cool and is so refreshing...&lt;br /&gt;I have many products at home, but only reach for this one.</li>
            <li> clean sexy and not over powering fragrance. Used it at the Hotel and had to have it. You will love it too.</li>
            <li> I could smell this forever.  I first discovered it at the Westin in Disneyworld.  I wish they would make a body spray.</li>
            <li> Great for carrying in purchase se for quick refreshing lotion. Excellent scent.</li>
            <li> Husband and I stayed at a Westin in Snow Mass Colorado. The room smelled fantastic upon entry. I was in love. I used up all the products in the room and got some more samples. Then I ordered when I got home. I also got the massage oil and shower gel which are great. I will keep buying. Maybe they will make the lotion more creamy in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, the fragrance and moisturizer, I use it sparingly because I can swim in it! Huge recommendations.  :)</li>
            <li> I recently was in Scottsdale,AZ and stayed at the Westin Resort &amp; Spa. In the room was sample sizes of this most wonderful smelling body lotion, shampoo &amp; conditioner. I was so impressed with the body lotion and it&#x27;s lasting scent that I went online to see if I could purchase the product. Purchasing was simple and delivery was as promised. I will continue to order this product in the future as I am hooked.....great product!!!</li>
            <li> I love the lotion, received in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product during a stay at Westin 2 years ago. I was since looking for it, and found it on Amazon (thank you). The lotion is so light, and the scent unique. I shared it with co-workers and they love it too. I will definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I ran across this lotion while on vacation at a westin hotel. I really fell in love, and once my hotel-size bottle ran out, I did some digging to see if they made a full size version. This is seriously the best lotion I have ever used! I love it&#x27;s light, fresh scent, and it&#x27;s non-greasy, quick absorbing formula. It works wonders on my sensitive skin, and leaves me feeling velvety soft! I simply cannot recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> Love this body cream, first used it while vacationing @ Westin Hotel in Arizona at their spa..smells amazing and really moisturizes without leaving skin greasy.  Sinks in immediately and leaves skin with fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li> the recipient loved it. she had used it at a stay in a Westin Hotel and mentioned it to me so for her birthday I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very moisturizing and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> PERFECT as a freshener, I only wish it could last longer.  Just exactly as I like it, and I got it in only a few days.  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is wonderful, providing non-greasy feel and a lingering glorious fragrance.  The scent is fresh, tantalizing and sexy and the cream keeps the fragrance fresh for a long time on the skin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I will purchase this lotion again as well as other products in this same fragrance. I hope they expand on this line.</li>
            <li> Great product and well used.  My wife loves this lotion and will most likely reorder on a regular basis unless another product becomes more alluring.  Thank you, Bruce Raiter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love the Westin hotels and stay there whenever possible.  Keep up the good work!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love scent. Only wish is lasted  a bit longer than it does. The only complaint I have is that this line does not have a body spray or cologne in this scent. Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> SMELLS wonderful.... I first had found it in the mini hotel size, at the Detroit Westin. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is such a clean light scent. Every time I wear it someone mentions how good it smells. I originally fell in love with it while staying at a Westin Hotel in Arizona. They had a bottle at each counter as you check in. Great summer scent.</li>
            <li> This was a gift but and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Moisturizes without &amp;#34;stickiness.&amp;#34; Not by Bulgari, but still a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> The lotion that I used at the hotel had a beautiful fresh scent that lasted for hours.  This one should be the same, but isn&#x27;t.  The scent is very mild and fades quickly</li>
            <li> We stayed at a Westin hotel and I fell in love with all the products.  Very nice smelling!  This lotion is light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Smells just like I remembered it!!</li>
            <li> Light, absorbs quickly - no greasy feel.  Great after shower lotion, summer or winter.  I really love the great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews about this that I was expecting a lot. I thought it was kind of wattery and the  smell was just ok. Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom when she told me about a product she had bought at a spa that had a &amp;#34;white tea&amp;#34; scent. I couldn&#x27;t find the same product again, but she was very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just as described.</li>
            <li> my favorite feel and smell makes my skin feel so fresh</li>
            <li> Love the scent, it is like reliving a great stay at my favorite Westin resort. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I first used these products while at the Westin in Shanghai. It has such a soft fresh scent and is not overpowering at all. I am very sensitive to strong perfume so this is just perfect. The lotion is moisturizing, but not greasy. I have the hand soap in several of my bathrooms at home and guests have commented on how lovely it is.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order within 10 days and am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish there was a body splash or perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this product.We were introduced to it at the Westin in maui. She loves the scent, and feel of it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent...my only gripe...make them in bigger bottles for resale! :) Get compliments all the time on the fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li> We buy this lotion over and over and over when we run out. My husband loves it. He brought home a sample from the Westin Hotel and we&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> Light, crisp and fragrant that is perfect for when you don&#x27;t want to wear perfume, but you want to smell feminine. Perfect!</li>
            <li> My God where have you been all my life.  I need a pipeline of this lotion.  I will be looking at all the Westin products from now on.  When you smell and feel good it gives you a lift and I needed one.  Give me free shipping and I will be happier than ever.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Wonderful fragrance.  Doesn&#x27;t over power the users.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product! I have been using it for three years always buying at the Kierland Arizona&lt;br /&gt;Spa and it has been first class that was the reason I purchased three. however I have found with the ones I have&lt;br /&gt;just received there is not the stinct smell.....on phoning Weston at Home (four times) I was offered a refund of&lt;br /&gt;14bucks as a goodwill gesture (really)!!!!!!! I had offered to take them to the Weston Calgary but that was a no go&lt;br /&gt;as no Westons in Canada carry the product for sale! In short I will NEVER purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> LOVE these... smells great to me. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why it is so damned expensive.</li>
            <li> A wonderful, light, not greasy lotion that even a manly man can wear! I like it and it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this!</li>
            <li> Stayed at Westin and had a chance to use their sample bottle. Glad I could buy it online. I live in AZ and get sunburned so when I shave my skin hurts. I use this lotion and it relieves the pain. In my opinion one of the best made.</li>
            <li> The perfect combination of gentle skin therapy and relaxing aromatherapy. The smell is sophisticated, earthy, and yet quite simple. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion when I stayed at The Swan in Disney World in Orlando. I instantly loved it! The lotion really moisturizes and the scent lingers. I was faithful to a different lotion, but I&#x27;ve switched. Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells just like The Westin in Fort Lauderdale. Love it!</li>
            <li> The smell lasts for hours and everytime I use it I remember the time we spent in Hawaii for our honeymoon!</li>
            <li> My friend had a hotel tube of this and brought it to work.  I wanted to steal it!!  Love the scent and had to buy the conditioner because it was to die for!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever!  It is not greasy,  dry&#x27;s quickly.  I highly recommend buying this lotion.  Also smells lovely.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. I tried it when I stayed at a Westin once and had to have it. Very light, fresh smell. Almost like Bvlgari perfume scent.</li>
            <li> Same amazing smelling lotion I fell in love with while staying at the Westin.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I stayed at a Westin and fell in love with the scent so I bought a bottle. It&#x27;s nice but I noticed the smell wore off fairly quickly and is not ultra- moisturizing which is necessary in drier climates.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. A wonderfully heavenly smell, and it is not a greasy lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to everyone, and in fact I have.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift but after opening it I wanted to keep it.  I guess I will just have to purchase more. Speedy delivery</li>
            <li> I loved the lotion but it took 2 weeks to get to me. I read all the reviews about how quickly the product was shipped and I have to say I was disappointed in that regard. The smell is wonderful and I aggree that a spray would be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It smells amazing and I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it like the shampoo or body wash.  Unfortunately, Westin is the only one who makes this fragrance (that I know of), so you have to buy it from them.  The only reason I think I would keep buying this from them at the ridiculous price they charge is because my husband and I stayed at the Westin a few months ago and I used this lotion while there.  I liked it, he liked it and we ended up having an amazing weekend together.  They say memory is linked to scent, which is why I will keep buying this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful....but for goes too fast for $14 or so for a small amount of lotion!  I use way too much lotion, to make it feesable for me!  But it&#x27;s such a nice scent!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful. I just wish it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> My latest order is actually a reorder as I was so happy with the product the first time.  Like many who purchase online my first experience with Westin&#x27;s White Tea Aloe Body Lotion was while staying at a Westin hotel and wondered if it could be purchased elsewhere.  This lotion has a very clean scent, not perfumey or flowery.  As a man I prefer this scent.  The lotion itself I like also because it absorbs into the skin quickly and is not greasy or heavy oil feeling.  It just does a great job of rehydrating your skin.  I&#x27;m now middle age, so my skin often lacks moisture, so a clean scent, easily absorbed lotion with white Tea at this price and quality is hard to find!  I will continue to reorder and use this product on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I ordered because I love the smell of the White Tea Aloe Body Lotion.  It is so refreshing and light on the skin.  The smell stays quite long. I first tried it when I stayed in one of the Westin hotels and I have been looking for it.  I was so happy when I saw it at Amazon.  Its free shipping.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift.  Love this product. I would recommend to anyone who loves a fresh unique smell.  Feels like I&#x27;m at a spa.</li>
            <li> first used this when we stayed at hotel in florida. works well for dry skin and smells great. I now use this after shaving instead of aftershave.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lotions! Got it at the hotel I was staying at and reminds me of being in a spa. Glad I was able to find it without going to another hotel and even found a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> This was among the toiletries in the bathroom of our room at the Paris Westin Vendome and I immediately fell in love with it!  The fragrance is intoxicating and totally habit forming. I was delighted to find that I could order it online since I had almost used up my souvenir bottles from the hotel. Every time I put it on my hands, etc. it instantly takes me back to Paris -- a trip I shall never forget.  Yes, it was that fabulous!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My spouse and I took a business trip to the Westin Hotel in St. Martins. The sun was brutal, but the hotel supplied us with this fabulous Heavenly aloe tea lotion, and hair products. Where ever we went the scent was in the air as it wafted off of everyones bodies and hair. The most beautiful man made scent available that smells good on both sexes, and the products are wonderful to the hair and skin. We used the lotion all day long to help keep our skin hydrated.  My husband likes it as much as I do. Just on a whim, I Googled it, and voila, it comes directly to my door. You won&#x27;t find a more user friendly product. Some of the people in our hotel put it on their children, but I would say the scent is a little over the top for a child.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;White Tea is my favorite lotion EVER! The scent is clean but subtle. After obtaining as many samples as possible from a recent Westin overnight, was thrilled to determine availability online. I&#x27;m hooked!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  The smell is so fresh and gives you that &amp;#34;just showered&amp;#34; feel.  It&#x27;s not thick. I use it as a this layer over my arms and hands instead of perfume. Many compliments too!</li>
            <li> Was not the same as what you receive in the hotel. Pretty disappointed. It was a gift and the scent is very faint and the color of lotion is white, where as the one in the hotel is a mint green</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want a perfumed smell, this is the lotion to buy.  It has the freshest, cleanest smell of any lotion I have come in contact with.  I was tired of the Bath n Body Works perfumed smells and wanted something that smelled shower fresh.  I used this on a stay at a Westin Hotel and was hooked immediately.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this lotion when we stayed at the Westin in Philadelphia for our anniversary. I loved the scent of the travel size lotion so much that I searched online to see if I could purchase more of the lotion. Thankfully, I found it here on Amazon. The smell of this lotion is absolutely amazing and it leaves your skin feeling really soft. I love it so much that I have already placed a second order.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful.  It is a little thin but the smell trumps that.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I first experienced it at a Westin hotel, and the aroma stays with you. I tracked it down on the internet and found it on Amazon and have been buying it ever since.  It is a fresh clean aroma - and everyone around you asks &amp;#34;what is that, it smells so good&amp;#34;.</li>
