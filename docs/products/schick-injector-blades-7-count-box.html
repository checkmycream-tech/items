            <li>I was able to find a razor made in Pakistan!</li>
            <li>They used to be made in Germany &amp; were alot sharper &amp; better quality!</li>
            <li>I was glad I found them in Amazon!  </li>
            <li>So glad they are still made and sold!</li>
            <li>Schick still sells these injector blades even though they stopped selling the injector razor in 1999 because so many people still shave with them and they are an exelent blade and razor!  </li>
            <li>So glad you still carry these!</li>
            <li>Still, I am glad they still make them!</li>
            <li>He now can use his favorite old-style razor!</li>
            <li>Genuine Schick blades, go great with vintage injector razors.</li>
            <li>so we were thrilled to find them here.</li>
            <li>these are quite nice and still have a nice edge after 14 days.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his razor and was thrilled when I found I could purchase the blades on Amazon when he couldn&#x27;t find them in the store.</li>
            <li>It is nice to know that I can still purchase Schick Injector razors from Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Have been using that kind of razor for over 50 years.</li>
            <li>the injector blades, he was thrilled that I got them for him.</li>
            <li>Thrilled to have options for purchasing the blades.</li>
            <li>(She does the shopping for this kind of thing.)</li>
            <li>My husband really likes these blades but he can&#x27;t find them any where else, so he is very happy that he can get them here.</li>
            <li>The blades are as good as the ones that you pay lots more money for.</li>
            <li>The injector razor provides one of the best and most comfortable shaves available.</li>
            <li>I got them sooner than expected and was very happy and would buy them again as the price was great.</li>
            <li>shaves close get many usesThe older styles are the best,.</li>
            <li>I use an electric shaver most of the time but always liked the injector blades.</li>
            <li>best shave for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For my money the old injector razors are still the best.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice of Schick to consider making injectors with more than 7 blades again.</li>
            <li>so was thrilled to be able to order these at amazon and stock up</li>
            <li>these are my dad&#x27;s favorite kind of razor</li>

            <li>Glad to have found these.</li>
            <li>I like many think razors and blade systems shouldn&#x27;t be in locked cases, like premium champagne.</li>
            <li>I am glad I could find them through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relieved. :)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find these any more.</li>
            <li>glad he still had his razor tho...</li>
            <li>We were both so pleased to find them on this website.</li>
            <li>better tha the electrics, with no razor</li>
            <li>One more thing I don&#x27;t have to worry about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Schick injector razor for many, many years and using what ever blades I could find.</li>
            <li>A great product that hasn&#x27;t changed much since the 1920&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE BLADES.</li>
            <li>The blades when inserted into the tool allow us to safely remove matted hair that builds up in the dogs coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the manufacturing costs are tied up into the fancy dispensers.  </li>
            <li>These blades are ok.  </li>
            <li>My dad gave me my schick injector about 15 years ago and the blades then seemed to be better.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found these, since I was almost out.</li>
            <li>Can not find this style of blade in some stores any more.</li>
            <li>I love simple&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER SHAVE THAN TODAY&#x27;S DISPOSABLES.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>(most brick and mortar places don&#x27;t seem to carry them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure when you load the blade into the razor that the edge doesn&#x27;t rub against the retaining pins on the razor, as this can ruin the edge of the blade.</li>
            <li>I,am a happy shaver again Thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Razor is about 30 years old,I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order more when I need them.</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>so we save even more money &amp; have them delivered at our convenience.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find a source for my favorite razor blades which I have been using for more than fifty years.</li>

            <li>years ago, my then favorite shaver went off market.</li>
            <li>and I made his day when I was able to get him replacement blades.</li>

            <li>seems to be fine</li>
            <li>workes fine just like always</li>
            <li>Everything was fine.  </li>
            <li>Shipping from vendor was pleasingly quick!</li>
            <li>and if I&#x27;m lucky to  the cost much more..    </li>
            <li>Been using the shaver since high school, and it works just fine!!</li>
            <li>What makes this combination unique is that I can see through the opening between the blade in the razor and the bottom guide of the razor, making it easy to align the blade along the bottom of my sideburns and get a square trim.  </li>
            <li>I could easily get 15 to 20 shaves per blade with the original.</li>
            <li>Love these blades and lucky to have an original Schick Shaver.</li>
            <li>Very  good, sharp blades as usual,worked  fine.</li>
            <li>I am happy that even though they can no longer be found at any local stores, they are available online.</li>
            <li>uses is important.    </li>
            <li>I ordered these injector blades as they are no longer available in brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li>I started using them when I was travelling all over the world installing software for the Air Force and they give a great shave for the last fifty years, so why change and with a company like amazon</li>
            <li>He was thrilled with these and claims it&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s had in years after using low quality options that he could purchase locally, for years.</li>
            <li>DIDN&#x27;T KNOW THIS TYPE OF OPTION WAS AVAILABLE.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 4 packs to last me a year or two, great product, just like they have been for 30 years...</li>
            <li>However knowing they are still available thru your company is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>It is much more economical than using disposables.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the timely (and free) shipping.</li>
            <li>They stay sharper longer and are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, and</li>
            <li>I checked to see if they were available on line and learned that they were available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was OVERJOYED to find out that these blades are still available in Europe and can be purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s now easy to clean out the chips.  </li>
            <li>Schick injector blades fit my Schick razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please keep this item available.</li>
            <li>Quality of these blades seems good, so far.</li>
            <li>My husband had an old injector shaver that he loved</li>
            <li>I WAS EXCITED TO FIND THAT THESE REFILL  BLADES WERE STILL AVAILABLE.  </li>
            <li>I had not lost the technique of shaving with a blade, and can now enjoy a clean shave again;</li>
            <li>It is easy to order and arrives quickly.</li>
            <li>I like these injector razors so much better than using the modern multiblade razors that like to clog up too easily.</li>
            <li>My original order got lost.  </li>
            <li>None of these substitutes came close to the quality, nor durability, of the original Schick brand.</li>
            <li>I sincerely thank all responsible for my renewed shaving joy for &amp; making it all possible once again.</li>
            <li>He was very pleased with his surprised gift.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THE ORIGINAL RAZOR IN 1962 .  </li>
            <li>They were exactly what my father-in-law wanted...now he loves me even more.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t want to change from his old Schick Injector razor because he had been using it for years and was very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>The injector blades came quickly and are working fine.  </li>
            <li>Prompt delivery and clean shave.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t make up my mind if I like these injectors best or the old double edge safety razors</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever want to discard my Schick Injector Razor, and I never will as long as these blades are still available!!!</li>
            <li>most reliable and speedy delivery,item as expected,very positive.</li>
            <li>I learned to shave with a &#x27;Dutch Twin&#x27; straight razor, when I got to Marine Recruit Depot at San Diego, during WW2 the DI&#x27;s made me sent my razor home, in my &#x27;Bucket&#x27; was a Schick Razor, which has to be the best razor design ever made, I&#x27;ve worn out my first one and working on the second one now.</li>
            <li>Get a decent shave for a very good price and take the occasional &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; as the price you pay for helping to save the planet.</li>
            <li>These blades are great, sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>We use these Schick Injector blades in a special tool which we use to groom our two shaggy dogs.  </li>
            <li>The blades are good for several shaves and the injector cartridge accepts the used blade.</li>
            <li>The Shick blades are of superior quality to the generic brands my pharmacy was selling.</li>
            <li>I would like a lot better if I had real shick razor instead of a knock off gave close shave never cut my self</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>For us &amp;#34;Old&amp;#34; guys that still use the razor that we got when we turned 18 or so, this is a tried and true Blade.</li>
            <li>I love it and don&#x27;t know why anyone would need these modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>I would also say cheap but rarely do you find that combination.</li>
            <li>Remove the label, cut a slit in the top (with a knife you don&#x27;t care too much about), drain the broth, rinse the can, and put your used blades in the can.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s full, you can tape up the slit and throw it into the trash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to get the injectors from AMAZON.  </li>
            <li>He is really pleased that I was able to locate blades for it and is enjoying the performance of his old razor with the new blades</li>
            <li>Great to be able to get these hard to find blades.</li>
            <li>He says these are the only blades that shave him properly and amazon.com has the best deal around!</li>
            <li>Since the stores in my area have so many golf cart parking spaces (implying an older population), I figured one of the chains (food/pharmacy) would have them --</li>
            <li>Sevice was super from Amazon.will always by this  item when i can locate it</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>They actually do as good as a professional barber with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>It is just what I needed and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick ship as described</li>
            <li>These blades are a great compromise between the double edge razors and modern cartridges.</li>
            <li>These are the very best razor blades that have ever been made, I dont know why shick dont start making the injector razors again, and put the blades back on the store shelfs, It seems to me they have modernized themselfs almost out of business, They should have just kept it simple!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if I get 4 or 5 with these blades.</li>
            <li>A good sharp, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>So much better than all the new blade styles today.</li>
            <li>All these new razors with 2,3,&amp; 4 blades are not any better than the Schick injector blades that I have been using for almost 50 years.</li>
            <li>Like it says on the back of the box a clean smooth comfortable shave!</li>
            <li>I wonder why I ever stopped using good single blades.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Five CONSISTENT Stars!</li>
            <li>If you want a clean smooth shave, I highly recommend the schick injector blade.</li>
            <li>Great place (Amazon) to get hard to fine items.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise at finding them through Amazon.com, at a really reasonable price (free shipping too).    </li>
            <li>I have found nothing, especially electrics, that give a more smooth and close</li>
            <li>He is thrilled that he can go back to using it again.</li>
            <li>So glad to finally find these and at such a good price.</li>
            <li>My Schick Injector razor is more than 30 years old.</li>
            <li>The old ad&#x27;s for the razor was &amp;#34;The closest thing to a straight razor shave!&amp;#34; because the head angle was made to place the blade at the perfect angle for a wet shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing exciting.  </li>
            <li>This is an old sryle razor that delivers an outstanding shave.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the only kind my husband will use.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The old still works better than the new!!!</li>
            <li>would suggest to anyone,  buy a razor off e bay, stock up on these blades, and learn the CORRECT WAY TO SHAVE,&lt;br /&gt;and find the right shaving porducts that work for you and your beard.</li>
            <li>Tried and true, simplistic and a great shave!</li>
            <li>these blades are no longer available in the local drug store, so i am happy that i can keep shaving with a single edge razor.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I need and at the right price.</li>
            <li>The older ones in the box are better than the new one in the plastic covers.</li>
            <li>Although the box states the blades are made in China,I must say that I have gotten just as good a result with these blades as I got with previous Schick blades made in Germany.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean out the gunk that regularly clogs the muti-blade razors.</li>
            <li>That is, a company will not just start with its most recent design, there will be more sales if they run the new customers through the older versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>and they arrived very fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>He said the price was very reasonable even with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>My 40 year old Shick adjustable worked just fine</li>
            <li>The single edge shick is clog free and rinces out easily.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li>and I miss them for their consistent quality.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>For a simple single-blade razor, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Only place I have been able to find them.</li>
            <li>it is to be using the real thing again!</li>
            <li>No one locally carries these any more  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>We will be ordering more when he starts running low.</li>
            <li>My first blade carved me up</li>
            <li>exactly as described--prompt shipping</li>
            <li>And they last, are easy to clean, and don&#x27;t jam up as fast as the 2 blades; or I guess it&#x27;s 3</li>
            <li>They were shipped promptly and were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Basic, like chromium ones better</li>
            <li>The only problem is most stores don&#x27;t stock</li>
            <li>is the exact model this was created for.  </li>
            <li>but now that I have healed and gained back all the lost blood, I love them.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>I ordered the blades and I was very pleasantly surprised at how smooth the transaction was.  </li>
            <li>On time and exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been married for 25 years</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s been using them since before we got married.  </li>
            <li>The Schick Injector blades was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I have been ordering these for several years; they fit my old razor which I love.</li>
            <li>These are always a much better price especially when I buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and reasonable and the blades work VERY well.  </li>
            <li>no where near the original blade.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was great that they are still available - wrong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry these blades are no longer made in America, but I am happy they are still available.  </li>
            <li>recieved exactly what I wanted in very timely manner</li>
            <li>Product fills a need we&#x27;ve not been able to meet for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>Good to have my 25yr old razor back in action....</li>
            <li>The mechanism slides the new blade in easily and simultaneously ejects the old blade for disposal into a sharps container.  </li>
            <li>Recommend searching around the different vendors as some on amazon were much better deal than others and one company charged high shipping charges.  </li>
            <li>The original razor was popular in 1968 when bought and used in basic military training and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Schick single-blade injector razor since about 1962, and have no intention of graduating to multiple-blade razors, which in my view are not truly better than the single blade razor.</li>
            <li>Came as advertised and would certainly buy from seller again.</li>
            <li>I have a very heavy beard, and all of the multi-blade razors would either not cut good, clog, or wear out to fast.</li>
            <li>bought these blades a year ago and waited to see if they were going to lose their edge fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the people that I bought them from.   </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>Oh, yeah, he still uses a straight razor around your ears.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They were very much appreciated.</li>
            <li>The package says it contains stainless steel blades, metalized with chromium to ensure closeness and comfort.  </li>
            <li>I pick this product for my dad, he really likes this brand of blades.  </li>
            <li>Ireceived the blades in a very timely, just as i wanted.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>cost too much.  </li>
            <li>Why on earth they&#x27;re no longer available in the local drug store is beyond me.</li>
            <li>REAL razor blades for a change, instead of the multi-bladed over priced &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 6 different brands, and they were all comfortable.</li>
            <li>(besides, the blades are stainless steel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I did not know how much I was getting.  </li>
            <li>have read that travelers to more remote places can tell the point when that location opened to the world market by which legacy shaving gear is in the shops.</li>
            <li>I tried the newer multi blade razors but they soon clogged making them very un-effective and a pain to use.</li>
            <li>We really like the price too and would recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again</li>
            <li>fast delivery I like it</li>
            <li>fast delivery and was as advertized.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping would buy again Thank You</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Though I think I liked a different type back then.</li>
            <li>Forget all the ads about how delicate your face is and why you need 5 blades to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>The last batch of injector blades I purchased at a supermarket -- they were not the original Schick blades but a plastic cased knockoff -- and the only injector blades available.  </li>
            <li>I refuse to purchase those multi-blade gadgets that do the same thing as this good old single blade.</li>
            <li>They are becoming harder and harder to find in local stores and I was very pleased to find them on here</li>
            <li>Sent my wife to buy me some new blades about a month ago and found there were none available in our local drug stores.  </li>
            <li>Thus, the guy with an average beard should get better results.  </li>
            <li>1 to 2 more shaves from these than I can from a DE blade which costs a lot less.</li>
            <li>Those multi blade razors get clogged up so fast and trying to clear the clog is really a pain.</li>
            <li>I was not satisified with the product that I received from that particular seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying for years to find a decent substitute for the Schick injector razors I used for forty years.  </li>
            <li>Having become acquainted with Amazon not too long ago, I decided one day (after another of my brand \\&quot;x\\&quot; blades lost its edge after only two days on the job)on a whim, to run my need by Amazon and much to my surprise &amp; delight</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone using that type of razor.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a very short period of time, and it was exactly what we were looking for!</li>
            <li>and they are marked at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>I really miss the old ones.</li>
            <li>Previous blades have provided several weeks of clean, comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li>I ordered several 4-paks of those long lost friends &amp; have began enjoying my morning shave again.  </li>
            <li>Both blade and cartridge work fine; other brands of Injector blades were sometimes troublesome.</li>
            <li>These razors &amp; blades are simple, do a nice job, and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li>I have used the same Schick Injector Razor for over 30 years &amp; have not been able to locate the \\&quot;old\\&quot; single blade Schick injector blades anywhere no matter where I lived.</li>
            <li>They fit and shave like a dream in my decades old single blade injector razor..</li>
            <li>These are difficult to find, so when I gave these to m father, he was surprised and very pleased!</li>
            <li>BUT ALL THE STATES FROM SOUTH CAROLINA TO NEW YORK.&lt;br /&gt;PASQUALE</li>
            <li>to find, so he has tried all the new type of razors, but doesn&#x27;t like them.  </li>
            <li>Puts the new cartridges to shame</li>
            <li>My druggist ordered a pack of new blades</li>
            <li>I initially was able to purchase from drug stores back in the last century.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought enough blades to last me 5 years before they stopped selling them in the drug store, which I suspected would happen with all the multi blades out there.</li>
            <li>There is only so much I am willing to write about razor blades.</li>
            <li>My first and only razor that was my dad&#x27;s and that I used while it was still his</li>
            <li>It was my first time using Amazon to make a purchase but it will not be my last.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I ordered and they came in just a short time.</li>
            <li>All of the double and higher just gum up with wiskers.</li>
            <li>The old razor may have years in it yet, but I hope you can help me find a new one.</li>
            <li>Being bearded since retiring from military service in 1985, I can only keep straight lines and an otherwise clean look with a single-edge blade; the newer multi-blade products just don&#x27;t hack it (they do, but not where I want it to \\&quot;hack\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>For those of us, old fashioned guys, that still enjoy old fashioned shaves -and to save money!!!- a disposable blade that conserves its sharp edge after several (10-20)</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very sharp, and will fit any of the old Schick Injector razors.</li>
            <li>the advent of the new multi bade razors these old timer injector style blades are hard to find in the stores, and I was pleased to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Only complain was only get 2 shavers from a blade 3 if lucky</li>
            <li>My husband loves his old razor and this kind of blades are very hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li>These are very sharp 7-count Schick Injector single-edge blades, packaged in the familiar metal container with the extended prong that allows injection of blades into a Schick safety shaving razor with handle (not included).</li>
            <li>Hard to find locally in most of the front line drug stores, so I have to purchase them online.</li>
            <li>was so glad to have the in your inventory, they are extreemly hard to find.</li>
            <li>using injector razors make sure not to press too hard when shaving, or you can get some razor burn.</li>
            <li>More than not, the blades are dull and can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li>Only dislike is that Amazon is opening a distribution center in Florida and the tax free purchases will go out the window in a year.</li>
            <li>I have an old Schick injector, this is what I needed</li>
            <li>So, when you use the last blade, slide it in the injector and toss the whole thing away.</li>
            <li>I like using my old schick razor.</li>
            <li>My husband uses a razor that he has had since the early 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My husband still uses the old style razor.</li>
            <li>My husband has an old Schick Injector razor that he swears gives the smoothest shave and has for years, but the blades are&lt;br /&gt;difficult</li>
            <li>Only place I could find these at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and have used about every blade shaving method except streight razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for nearly 50 years.  </li>
            <li>This &#x27;old&#x27; guy likes his &#x27;old&#x27; razor.  </li>
            <li>husband has old razor--delighted to find them</li>
            <li>I wish the old platinum+ blades existed as they lasted a bit longer / cut cleaner longer.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to chance a straight razor or a double edge razor, the Schick Injector is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>I AM 60 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>Well, if you&#x27;re into the old Injector shaver, these are the blades for you.</li>
            <li>THESE OLD STYLE RAZORS GIVE</li>
            <li>So I bought an old Hydro-Magic razor and ordered these blades.</li>
            <li>I was very happily surprised by the quality and closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>Learning how to shave properly is also very helpful, instead of just throwing the blade at your face, like we do with cartridges.</li>
            <li>I got an old injector razor on an auction site and needed replacement blades for it.  </li>
            <li>Lately its been more \\&quot;blades\\&quot; -</li>
            <li>..love my old injector razor.</li>
            <li>And I am glad I can get them there, because all these fancy multiple blade razors are just s waste of money in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>They come seven to a container now, instead of ten, but they are still as smooth and sharp as the blades I remember.  </li>
            <li>It was so sharp and comfortable that I thought to use it along with my double edge baldes.</li>
            <li>love them as they are very difficult t fine in store in dunkirk</li>
            <li>They work the same as the older version made in the USA blades.</li>
            <li>I prefer the single edge blades over the double edge or multiple blades and these blades work fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I thought buying the actual Schick brand, rather than a generic, would make a positive difference.</li>
            <li>These razor blades were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Delivery fine, Only about 20 percent of blades from each package likely to be sharp.</li>
            <li>Although fitting the Shick Injector razor, these blades only lasted for four shaves before they became to dull to use.</li>
            <li>My third shave, with the second blade, was blood free as I was extremely cautious.  </li>
            <li>This year, he annoused he has to find a new rasor, he used his last blade.</li>
            <li>When I was a kid my father shaved with there as the new innovation to blue blades.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask of a blade other than it be comfortably smooth and sharp enough to cut without excessive tugging?</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like buying a whole razor for one blade usage, and I got tired of having the multiple rows of blades becoming clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades I have used are very dull, not cutting the hairs close as they should!!!</li>
            <li>blades are stiff, incredibly sharp and give a very smooth, close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>Injector razors mostly drive like a cartridge, but cost a lot less and are less wasteful.</li>
            <li>I can get a week out a a Feather, double edged blade, and a decent double sided razor.</li>
            <li>It was hard to find  blades until Amazon made them available.  </li>
            <li>use them every day to shave to bad they dpnt sell them in stores anymore but great for you thank you for haven them</li>
            <li>The blades are not as sharp as other blades I&#x27;ve used; however, I still manage to get a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>My razor is old and these are the only razors I prefer to use.</li>
            <li>Once you go old school you will never go back..</li>
            <li>I found my old razor and injector cartridge with one blade left, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>I kept my old razor from when I was younger.</li>
            <li>I threw my husband&#x27;s old injector blades away, Big mistake!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad we found them my husband is the only blade that he use cause his hair so thick and regular blades don&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li>These are the only kind of blades that my husband uses due to the fact he has a beard that is hard to shave and these do the job.  </li>
            <li>They  are not good for someone with a tuff or strong beard.</li>
            <li>Unable to locate these type of blades in Texas...can locate the generic but they are not near as good.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all the 3,4,5, multiple blade razors and end up coming back to&lt;br /&gt;my old stand by.</li>
            <li>I finally went back to my old standby and found a pack with two blades.  </li>
            <li>The blades are not sharp enough and do not provide a close shave.</li>
            <li>Guess most people don&#x27;t think it wastes enough resources to just throw away a few dozen blades a year....</li>
            <li>Of course the first few times I walked out with tissue dot</li>
            <li>The blades are work well although the first couple of shaves produce a few &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Good blades have been very hard to find for the past 20years.</li>
            <li>Keeping the fuzz down  thanks</li>
            <li>Thought of going on line and found the real deal which load without a problem and are very sharp.  </li>
            <li>YOU CAN BUY DOUBLE EDGE BLADES BUT NOT SINGLE EDGE.  </li>
            <li>I have an old single blade Schick injector razor that I have had since the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using The Schick single blade injector since he was 16 years old.  </li>

            <li> I was able to find a razor made in Pakistan!</li>
            <li> They used to be made in Germany &amp; were alot sharper &amp; better quality!</li>
            <li> I was glad I found them in Amazon!  </li>
            <li> So glad they are still made and sold!</li>
            <li> Schick still sells these injector blades even though they stopped selling the injector razor in 1999 because so many people still shave with them and they are an exelent blade and razor!  </li>
            <li> So glad you still carry these!</li>
            <li> Still, I am glad they still make them!</li>
            <li> He now can use his favorite old-style razor!</li>
            <li> Genuine Schick blades, go great with vintage injector razors.</li>
            <li> so we were thrilled to find them here.</li>
            <li> these are quite nice and still have a nice edge after 14 days.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his razor and was thrilled when I found I could purchase the blades on Amazon when he couldn&#x27;t find them in the store.</li>
            <li> It is nice to know that I can still purchase Schick Injector razors from Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Have been using that kind of razor for over 50 years.</li>
            <li> the injector blades, he was thrilled that I got them for him.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to have options for purchasing the blades.</li>
            <li> (She does the shopping for this kind of thing.)</li>
            <li> My husband really likes these blades but he can&#x27;t find them any where else, so he is very happy that he can get them here.</li>
            <li> The blades are as good as the ones that you pay lots more money for.</li>
            <li> The injector razor provides one of the best and most comfortable shaves available.</li>
            <li> I got them sooner than expected and was very happy and would buy them again as the price was great.</li>
            <li> shaves close get many usesThe older styles are the best,.</li>
            <li> I use an electric shaver most of the time but always liked the injector blades.</li>
            <li> best shave for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For my money the old injector razors are still the best.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice of Schick to consider making injectors with more than 7 blades again.</li>
            <li> so was thrilled to be able to order these at amazon and stock up</li>
            <li> these are my dad&#x27;s favorite kind of razor</li>
            <li> This was a great find and price and now all is right in his world</li>
            <li> Many thanks for many more years of happy shaving!</li>

            <li> I LOVE THESE BLADES.</li>
            <li> The blades when inserted into the tool allow us to safely remove matted hair that builds up in the dogs coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the manufacturing costs are tied up into the fancy dispensers.  </li>
            <li> These blades are ok.  </li>
            <li> My dad gave me my schick injector about 15 years ago and the blades then seemed to be better.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found these, since I was almost out.</li>
            <li> Can not find this style of blade in some stores any more.</li>
            <li> I love simple&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER SHAVE THAN TODAY&#x27;S DISPOSABLES.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> (most brick and mortar places don&#x27;t seem to carry them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure when you load the blade into the razor that the edge doesn&#x27;t rub against the retaining pins on the razor, as this can ruin the edge of the blade.</li>
            <li> I,am a happy shaver again Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Razor is about 30 years old,I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order more when I need them.</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> so we save even more money &amp; have them delivered at our convenience.  </li>
            <li> Glad to find a source for my favorite razor blades which I have been using for more than fifty years.</li>
            <li> I was able to find them on your site</li>
            <li> years ago, my then favorite shaver went off market.</li>
            <li> and I made his day when I was able to get him replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for years and I am so glad I found them on amazon.com.</li>

            <li> Its excellent to know that one ca still purchase single blades,they give me the smoothest shave compared to the systems</li>
            <li> the razor, I&#x27;m always have been able to fine them on amazon.  </li>
            <li> These chinese made blades are surprisingly very good.</li>
            <li> These blades are made for my obsolete razor and at a very good price, so stock up while they last.</li>
            <li> Great shave, easy transaction and a very efficient, customer friendly operation.  </li>
            <li> These blades will give you the closest and most comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Glad they are available on line.</li>
            <li> They are not what they used to be years ago but better than the CVS brand that also is no longer available .</li>
            <li> Now my old trusty razor gives me the great shaves I grew up with.</li>
            <li> Now we have a ready supply and the price is good.  </li>
            <li> He says they really work for him when he shaves and that it is a good product.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are very good quality and unlike many razor blades, each blades lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Nice to be able to get them at a decent price and to be able to sign up for a subcription to them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other blades but the injector blades work best for me.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my father because he doesn&#x27;t want to use any other razor , he says these are the best.</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast responds, this are very good blades.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for those of us who enjoy the old fashion shaving.</li>
            <li> The purchase process was easy, with the blades being shipped as presented.</li>
            <li> It was easy to place the order.</li>
            <li> Its really great when &amp;#34;trimming Up.&amp;#34;  Thanks for carrying thus rare item.</li>
            <li> The blades have burrs on them and can cut easily.</li>
            <li> Was just what my husband wanted&lt;br /&gt;Received in very quickly time.</li>
            <li> These are far superior to the fancy over advertised blades , a much better and closer shave</li>
            <li> and I liked very much, the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the decades, this exact style blade, with the two holes in the side for alignment with the razor housing, has remained popular.</li>
            <li> Found some at Amazon, they came and they are fine blades although I understand they are made in China.  </li>
            <li> They work fine</li>
            <li> The disposable razors are fine</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent, and they seem to be as sharp and as durable as the original made-in-America Schick Injector blades were of yesteryear.  </li>
            <li> they were fine according my husband.</li>
            <li> seems to be fine</li>
            <li> workes fine just like always</li>
            <li> Everything was fine.  </li>
            <li> Shipping from vendor was pleasingly quick!</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m lucky to  the cost much more..    </li>
            <li> Been using the shaver since high school, and it works just fine!!</li>
            <li> What makes this combination unique is that I can see through the opening between the blade in the razor and the bottom guide of the razor, making it easy to align the blade along the bottom of my sideburns and get a square trim.  </li>
            <li> I could easily get 15 to 20 shaves per blade with the original.</li>
            <li> Love these blades and lucky to have an original Schick Shaver.</li>
            <li> Very  good, sharp blades as usual,worked  fine.</li>
            <li> I am happy that even though they can no longer be found at any local stores, they are available online.</li>
            <li> uses is important.    </li>
            <li> I ordered these injector blades as they are no longer available in brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li> I started using them when I was travelling all over the world installing software for the Air Force and they give a great shave for the last fifty years, so why change and with a company like amazon</li>
            <li> He was thrilled with these and claims it&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s had in years after using low quality options that he could purchase locally, for years.</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T KNOW THIS TYPE OF OPTION WAS AVAILABLE.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 4 packs to last me a year or two, great product, just like they have been for 30 years...</li>
            <li> However knowing they are still available thru your company is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> It is much more economical than using disposables.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the timely (and free) shipping.</li>
            <li> They stay sharper longer and are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, and</li>
            <li> I checked to see if they were available on line and learned that they were available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was OVERJOYED to find out that these blades are still available in Europe and can be purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now easy to clean out the chips.  </li>
            <li> Schick injector blades fit my Schick razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please keep this item available.</li>
            <li> Quality of these blades seems good, so far.</li>
            <li> My husband had an old injector shaver that he loved</li>
            <li> I WAS EXCITED TO FIND THAT THESE REFILL  BLADES WERE STILL AVAILABLE.  </li>
            <li> I had not lost the technique of shaving with a blade, and can now enjoy a clean shave again;</li>
            <li> It is easy to order and arrives quickly.</li>
            <li> I like these injector razors so much better than using the modern multiblade razors that like to clog up too easily.</li>
            <li> My original order got lost.  </li>
            <li> None of these substitutes came close to the quality, nor durability, of the original Schick brand.</li>
            <li> I sincerely thank all responsible for my renewed shaving joy for &amp; making it all possible once again.</li>
            <li> He was very pleased with his surprised gift.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE ORIGINAL RAZOR IN 1962 .  </li>
            <li> They were exactly what my father-in-law wanted...now he loves me even more.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t want to change from his old Schick Injector razor because he had been using it for years and was very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The injector blades came quickly and are working fine.  </li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and clean shave.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t make up my mind if I like these injectors best or the old double edge safety razors</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever want to discard my Schick Injector Razor, and I never will as long as these blades are still available!!!</li>
            <li> most reliable and speedy delivery,item as expected,very positive.</li>
            <li> I learned to shave with a &#x27;Dutch Twin&#x27; straight razor, when I got to Marine Recruit Depot at San Diego, during WW2 the DI&#x27;s made me sent my razor home, in my &#x27;Bucket&#x27; was a Schick Razor, which has to be the best razor design ever made, I&#x27;ve worn out my first one and working on the second one now.</li>
            <li> Get a decent shave for a very good price and take the occasional &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; as the price you pay for helping to save the planet.</li>
            <li> These blades are great, sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> We use these Schick Injector blades in a special tool which we use to groom our two shaggy dogs.  </li>
            <li> The blades are good for several shaves and the injector cartridge accepts the used blade.</li>
            <li> The Shick blades are of superior quality to the generic brands my pharmacy was selling.</li>
            <li> I would like a lot better if I had real shick razor instead of a knock off gave close shave never cut my self</li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> For us &amp;#34;Old&amp;#34; guys that still use the razor that we got when we turned 18 or so, this is a tried and true Blade.</li>
            <li> I love it and don&#x27;t know why anyone would need these modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> I would also say cheap but rarely do you find that combination.</li>
            <li> Remove the label, cut a slit in the top (with a knife you don&#x27;t care too much about), drain the broth, rinse the can, and put your used blades in the can.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s full, you can tape up the slit and throw it into the trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to get the injectors from AMAZON.  </li>
            <li> He is really pleased that I was able to locate blades for it and is enjoying the performance of his old razor with the new blades</li>
            <li> Great to be able to get these hard to find blades.</li>
            <li> He says these are the only blades that shave him properly and amazon.com has the best deal around!</li>
            <li> Since the stores in my area have so many golf cart parking spaces (implying an older population), I figured one of the chains (food/pharmacy) would have them --</li>
            <li> Sevice was super from Amazon.will always by this  item when i can locate it</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> They actually do as good as a professional barber with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> It is just what I needed and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick ship as described</li>
            <li> These blades are a great compromise between the double edge razors and modern cartridges.</li>
            <li> These are the very best razor blades that have ever been made, I dont know why shick dont start making the injector razors again, and put the blades back on the store shelfs, It seems to me they have modernized themselfs almost out of business, They should have just kept it simple!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if I get 4 or 5 with these blades.</li>
            <li> A good sharp, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> So much better than all the new blade styles today.</li>
            <li> All these new razors with 2,3,&amp; 4 blades are not any better than the Schick injector blades that I have been using for almost 50 years.</li>
            <li> Like it says on the back of the box a clean smooth comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> I wonder why I ever stopped using good single blades.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Five CONSISTENT Stars!</li>
            <li> If you want a clean smooth shave, I highly recommend the schick injector blade.</li>
            <li> Great place (Amazon) to get hard to fine items.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise at finding them through Amazon.com, at a really reasonable price (free shipping too).    </li>
            <li> I have found nothing, especially electrics, that give a more smooth and close</li>
            <li> He is thrilled that he can go back to using it again.</li>
            <li> So glad to finally find these and at such a good price.</li>
            <li> My Schick Injector razor is more than 30 years old.</li>
            <li> The old ad&#x27;s for the razor was &amp;#34;The closest thing to a straight razor shave!&amp;#34; because the head angle was made to place the blade at the perfect angle for a wet shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting.  </li>
            <li> This is an old sryle razor that delivers an outstanding shave.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the only kind my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The old still works better than the new!!!</li>
            <li> would suggest to anyone,  buy a razor off e bay, stock up on these blades, and learn the CORRECT WAY TO SHAVE,&lt;br /&gt;and find the right shaving porducts that work for you and your beard.</li>
            <li> Tried and true, simplistic and a great shave!</li>
            <li> these blades are no longer available in the local drug store, so i am happy that i can keep shaving with a single edge razor.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I need and at the right price.</li>
            <li> The older ones in the box are better than the new one in the plastic covers.</li>
            <li> Although the box states the blades are made in China,I must say that I have gotten just as good a result with these blades as I got with previous Schick blades made in Germany.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean out the gunk that regularly clogs the muti-blade razors.</li>
            <li> That is, a company will not just start with its most recent design, there will be more sales if they run the new customers through the older versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> and they arrived very fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> He said the price was very reasonable even with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> My 40 year old Shick adjustable worked just fine</li>
            <li> The single edge shick is clog free and rinces out easily.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li> and I miss them for their consistent quality.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> For a simple single-blade razor, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Only place I have been able to find them.</li>
            <li> it is to be using the real thing again!</li>
            <li> No one locally carries these any more  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> We will be ordering more when he starts running low.</li>
            <li> My first blade carved me up</li>
            <li> exactly as described--prompt shipping</li>
            <li> And they last, are easy to clean, and don&#x27;t jam up as fast as the 2 blades; or I guess it&#x27;s 3</li>
            <li> They were shipped promptly and were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Basic, like chromium ones better</li>
            <li> The only problem is most stores don&#x27;t stock</li>
            <li> is the exact model this was created for.  </li>
            <li> but now that I have healed and gained back all the lost blood, I love them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blades and I was very pleasantly surprised at how smooth the transaction was.  </li>
            <li> On time and exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been married for 25 years</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s been using them since before we got married.  </li>
            <li> The Schick Injector blades was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I have been ordering these for several years; they fit my old razor which I love.</li>
            <li> These are always a much better price especially when I buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and reasonable and the blades work VERY well.  </li>
            <li> no where near the original blade.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was great that they are still available - wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry these blades are no longer made in America, but I am happy they are still available.  </li>
            <li> recieved exactly what I wanted in very timely manner</li>
            <li> Product fills a need we&#x27;ve not been able to meet for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Good to have my 25yr old razor back in action....</li>
            <li> The mechanism slides the new blade in easily and simultaneously ejects the old blade for disposal into a sharps container.  </li>
            <li> Recommend searching around the different vendors as some on amazon were much better deal than others and one company charged high shipping charges.  </li>
            <li> The original razor was popular in 1968 when bought and used in basic military training and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Schick single-blade injector razor since about 1962, and have no intention of graduating to multiple-blade razors, which in my view are not truly better than the single blade razor.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised and would certainly buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard, and all of the multi-blade razors would either not cut good, clog, or wear out to fast.</li>
            <li> bought these blades a year ago and waited to see if they were going to lose their edge fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the people that I bought them from.   </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> Oh, yeah, he still uses a straight razor around your ears.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> They were very much appreciated.</li>
            <li> The package says it contains stainless steel blades, metalized with chromium to ensure closeness and comfort.  </li>
            <li> I pick this product for my dad, he really likes this brand of blades.  </li>
            <li> Ireceived the blades in a very timely, just as i wanted.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> cost too much.  </li>
            <li> Why on earth they&#x27;re no longer available in the local drug store is beyond me.</li>
            <li> REAL razor blades for a change, instead of the multi-bladed over priced &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 6 different brands, and they were all comfortable.</li>
            <li> (besides, the blades are stainless steel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I did not know how much I was getting.  </li>
            <li> have read that travelers to more remote places can tell the point when that location opened to the world market by which legacy shaving gear is in the shops.</li>
            <li> I tried the newer multi blade razors but they soon clogged making them very un-effective and a pain to use.</li>
            <li> We really like the price too and would recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again</li>
            <li> fast delivery I like it</li>
            <li> fast delivery and was as advertized.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping would buy again Thank You</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Though I think I liked a different type back then.</li>
            <li> Forget all the ads about how delicate your face is and why you need 5 blades to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> The last batch of injector blades I purchased at a supermarket -- they were not the original Schick blades but a plastic cased knockoff -- and the only injector blades available.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to purchase those multi-blade gadgets that do the same thing as this good old single blade.</li>
            <li> They are becoming harder and harder to find in local stores and I was very pleased to find them on here</li>
            <li> Sent my wife to buy me some new blades about a month ago and found there were none available in our local drug stores.  </li>
            <li> Thus, the guy with an average beard should get better results.  </li>
            <li> 1 to 2 more shaves from these than I can from a DE blade which costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> Those multi blade razors get clogged up so fast and trying to clear the clog is really a pain.</li>
            <li> I was not satisified with the product that I received from that particular seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for years to find a decent substitute for the Schick injector razors I used for forty years.  </li>
            <li> Having become acquainted with Amazon not too long ago, I decided one day (after another of my brand \\&quot;x\\&quot; blades lost its edge after only two days on the job)on a whim, to run my need by Amazon and much to my surprise &amp; delight</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone using that type of razor.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a very short period of time, and it was exactly what we were looking for!</li>
            <li> and they are marked at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I really miss the old ones.</li>
            <li> Previous blades have provided several weeks of clean, comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several 4-paks of those long lost friends &amp; have began enjoying my morning shave again.  </li>
            <li> Both blade and cartridge work fine; other brands of Injector blades were sometimes troublesome.</li>
            <li> These razors &amp; blades are simple, do a nice job, and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> I have used the same Schick Injector Razor for over 30 years &amp; have not been able to locate the \\&quot;old\\&quot; single blade Schick injector blades anywhere no matter where I lived.</li>
            <li> They fit and shave like a dream in my decades old single blade injector razor..</li>
            <li> These are difficult to find, so when I gave these to m father, he was surprised and very pleased!</li>
            <li> BUT ALL THE STATES FROM SOUTH CAROLINA TO NEW YORK.&lt;br /&gt;PASQUALE</li>
            <li> to find, so he has tried all the new type of razors, but doesn&#x27;t like them.  </li>
            <li> Puts the new cartridges to shame</li>
            <li> My druggist ordered a pack of new blades</li>
            <li> I initially was able to purchase from drug stores back in the last century.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought enough blades to last me 5 years before they stopped selling them in the drug store, which I suspected would happen with all the multi blades out there.</li>
            <li> There is only so much I am willing to write about razor blades.</li>
            <li> My first and only razor that was my dad&#x27;s and that I used while it was still his</li>
            <li> It was my first time using Amazon to make a purchase but it will not be my last.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I ordered and they came in just a short time.</li>
            <li> All of the double and higher just gum up with wiskers.</li>
            <li> The old razor may have years in it yet, but I hope you can help me find a new one.</li>
            <li> Being bearded since retiring from military service in 1985, I can only keep straight lines and an otherwise clean look with a single-edge blade; the newer multi-blade products just don&#x27;t hack it (they do, but not where I want it to \\&quot;hack\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> For those of us, old fashioned guys, that still enjoy old fashioned shaves -and to save money!!!- a disposable blade that conserves its sharp edge after several (10-20)</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very sharp, and will fit any of the old Schick Injector razors.</li>
            <li> the advent of the new multi bade razors these old timer injector style blades are hard to find in the stores, and I was pleased to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Only complain was only get 2 shavers from a blade 3 if lucky</li>
            <li> My husband loves his old razor and this kind of blades are very hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> These are very sharp 7-count Schick Injector single-edge blades, packaged in the familiar metal container with the extended prong that allows injection of blades into a Schick safety shaving razor with handle (not included).</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally in most of the front line drug stores, so I have to purchase them online.</li>
            <li> was so glad to have the in your inventory, they are extreemly hard to find.</li>
            <li> using injector razors make sure not to press too hard when shaving, or you can get some razor burn.</li>
            <li> More than not, the blades are dull and can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> Only dislike is that Amazon is opening a distribution center in Florida and the tax free purchases will go out the window in a year.</li>
            <li> I have an old Schick injector, this is what I needed</li>
            <li> So, when you use the last blade, slide it in the injector and toss the whole thing away.</li>
            <li> I like using my old schick razor.</li>
            <li> My husband uses a razor that he has had since the early 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My husband still uses the old style razor.</li>
            <li> My husband has an old Schick Injector razor that he swears gives the smoothest shave and has for years, but the blades are&lt;br /&gt;difficult</li>
            <li> Only place I could find these at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and have used about every blade shaving method except streight razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for nearly 50 years.  </li>
            <li> This &#x27;old&#x27; guy likes his &#x27;old&#x27; razor.  </li>
            <li> husband has old razor--delighted to find them</li>
            <li> I wish the old platinum+ blades existed as they lasted a bit longer / cut cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to chance a straight razor or a double edge razor, the Schick Injector is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> I AM 60 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li> Well, if you&#x27;re into the old Injector shaver, these are the blades for you.</li>
            <li> THESE OLD STYLE RAZORS GIVE</li>
            <li> So I bought an old Hydro-Magic razor and ordered these blades.</li>
            <li> I was very happily surprised by the quality and closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Learning how to shave properly is also very helpful, instead of just throwing the blade at your face, like we do with cartridges.</li>
            <li> I got an old injector razor on an auction site and needed replacement blades for it.  </li>
            <li> Lately its been more \\&quot;blades\\&quot; -</li>
            <li> ..love my old injector razor.</li>
            <li> And I am glad I can get them there, because all these fancy multiple blade razors are just s waste of money in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> They come seven to a container now, instead of ten, but they are still as smooth and sharp as the blades I remember.  </li>
            <li> It was so sharp and comfortable that I thought to use it along with my double edge baldes.</li>
            <li> love them as they are very difficult t fine in store in dunkirk</li>
            <li> They work the same as the older version made in the USA blades.</li>
            <li> I prefer the single edge blades over the double edge or multiple blades and these blades work fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I thought buying the actual Schick brand, rather than a generic, would make a positive difference.</li>
            <li> These razor blades were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Delivery fine, Only about 20 percent of blades from each package likely to be sharp.</li>
            <li> Although fitting the Shick Injector razor, these blades only lasted for four shaves before they became to dull to use.</li>
            <li> My third shave, with the second blade, was blood free as I was extremely cautious.  </li>
            <li> This year, he annoused he has to find a new rasor, he used his last blade.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid my father shaved with there as the new innovation to blue blades.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask of a blade other than it be comfortably smooth and sharp enough to cut without excessive tugging?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like buying a whole razor for one blade usage, and I got tired of having the multiple rows of blades becoming clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades I have used are very dull, not cutting the hairs close as they should!!!</li>
            <li> blades are stiff, incredibly sharp and give a very smooth, close shave every time.  </li>
            <li> Injector razors mostly drive like a cartridge, but cost a lot less and are less wasteful.</li>
            <li> I can get a week out a a Feather, double edged blade, and a decent double sided razor.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find  blades until Amazon made them available.  </li>
            <li> use them every day to shave to bad they dpnt sell them in stores anymore but great for you thank you for haven them</li>
            <li> The blades are not as sharp as other blades I&#x27;ve used; however, I still manage to get a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> My razor is old and these are the only razors I prefer to use.</li>
            <li> Once you go old school you will never go back..</li>
            <li> I found my old razor and injector cartridge with one blade left, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> I kept my old razor from when I was younger.</li>
            <li> I threw my husband&#x27;s old injector blades away, Big mistake!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad we found them my husband is the only blade that he use cause his hair so thick and regular blades don&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li> These are the only kind of blades that my husband uses due to the fact he has a beard that is hard to shave and these do the job.  </li>
            <li> They  are not good for someone with a tuff or strong beard.</li>
            <li> Unable to locate these type of blades in Texas...can locate the generic but they are not near as good.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the 3,4,5, multiple blade razors and end up coming back to&lt;br /&gt;my old stand by.</li>
            <li> I finally went back to my old standby and found a pack with two blades.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not sharp enough and do not provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> Guess most people don&#x27;t think it wastes enough resources to just throw away a few dozen blades a year....</li>
            <li> Of course the first few times I walked out with tissue dot</li>
            <li> The blades are work well although the first couple of shaves produce a few &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Good blades have been very hard to find for the past 20years.</li>
            <li> Keeping the fuzz down  thanks</li>
            <li> Thought of going on line and found the real deal which load without a problem and are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> YOU CAN BUY DOUBLE EDGE BLADES BUT NOT SINGLE EDGE.  </li>
            <li> I have an old single blade Schick injector razor that I have had since the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using The Schick single blade injector since he was 16 years old.  </li>
            <li> doctor suggested i try a single edge blade, that cut the hair once, at skin level, and did not drag hair out and cut it, and then the hair would grow under the skin,  which equals ingrown hair, hair bump</li>
            <li> I guess I am old fashoned, and not willing to change my ways.  </li>
            <li> May be used to cut various items or scrape paint and stuff for flat surfaces.</li>
            <li> Have recently decided to try some of the razor blades I used in the past, before new technology made shaving a major expense.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Given their absence from large and small stores alike, I appreciate the ability to  replenish my supply of injector blades, in a convenient e-mail manner.  </li>
            <li> Why on earth do I need a razor &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; that apparently  comes with headlights, power steering and  stereo, when the timeless single edge injector blade works just as well, and at a fraction of the price!?</li>
            <li> Each of these blades has delivered at least 10 comfortable uses for me for decades and they are very sharp and durable.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp and hold their edge for a weeks worth of shaves on a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> The first two blades I used were dull.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this single blade cuts close and helps prevent facial problems related to shaving</li>
            <li> Hard to find these blades at a reasonable price at the local stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor companies introduce a new shaving gimmick every few years.</li>
            <li> single side razor, and these blades last me 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;M SHAVING WITH THE SAME SINGLE EDGE RAZER, A STICK SHICK</li>
            <li> The only razor I can use to shave with is a single edge.</li>
            <li> These blades are impossible to find in retail stores and I like the shave quality much better than the more expensive triple+ blade systems that are out there.</li>
            <li> Although the price was attractive, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to shave with an injector razor if you don&#x27;t have any of these very specialized blades.  </li>
            <li> I use these in a small leather shaving knife, they work great, and the price ain&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> found my long lost single-edge Schick injector blades.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 40 years and will always use it as long as they aer made.</li>
            <li> and I do not get a long life out of each blade.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I stocked up on spare injector blades and finally ran low on supply...after looking for the blades in local stores and not finding any I resorted to the internet and was glade to find them at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They shave smoother with fewer passes over the same rough area.</li>
            <li> My Schick adjustable injector razor still performs well for me, so I&#x27;m sticking with it as long as I can find blade cartridges for it.  </li>
            <li> Been using the single bladed Schick razor since high school - I even has another seldom used razor somewhere (just moved and not sure where it is).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these blades for many years but they are almost impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> I have tried other razors and blades, but always come back to Schick injectors.</li>
            <li> My husband has had this razor over the years and has tried other razors and keeps going back to this one.  </li>
            <li> He has tried other styles and always comes back to this brand.</li>
            <li> Some of the blades do not seem to be sharp enough.</li>
            <li> In other words, I only buy tried-and-true shaving products decades after they are introduced.</li>
            <li> I have always dry Shaved</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, to maximize the blade life, I dry the blade after each use by dobbing it on a towel.  </li>
            <li> Schnick Injector Blades use to be of high quality and was number one when the razors were commonly used.  </li>
            <li> THEY ARE VERY SHARP AND LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I thought I was hooped ever finding single blades for my razor.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the closeness of a single edge razor.</li>
            <li> Hope to keep my single edge raiser for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I remember I used single injectors because they shaved closer than electric razors and didn&#x27;t chew my face off like electric razors (electric razors make a callous you know, on your FACE)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t last very long, b. aren&#x27;t as sharp, and c. are rather rough to use.  </li>
            <li> My husband will only use single blades which are very difficult to fine, let alone</li>
            <li> I could not find blades in any drug store that I looked in, and I was down to my last blade.</li>
            <li> Due to the lack of availability for Schick Injector blades in local stores, I ordered the item on line because my husband would not use any other substitute blade.</li>
            <li> They feel rough when you use them</li>
            <li> last few yr. could not find, but ordered on amazon</li>
            <li> These blades are getting harder &amp; harder to find.</li>
            <li> The product was what we expected, no complaints at this time.</li>
            <li> I chose the middle rating because I&#x27;ve had trouble  getting the blades to eject from the dispenser.</li>
            <li> GETTING HARDER TO FIND INJECTOR BLADES, BUT</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> My order came as expected and everything was correct.</li>
            <li> There was no internet to search for remote sources</li>
            <li> They were what we expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my dad who was having a harder and harder time finding quality injector blades for his military issue 1950s razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard countless other men say the same thing over the past half dozen years.  </li>
            <li> Even though they are now manufactured in China (and I DON&#x27;T like that!), they are still dependably sharp and maintain their sharpness as well as ever.  </li>
            <li> The doctors won&#x27;t give me a surgically sharp blade to use, so I&#x27;ve always used these.</li>
            <li> And he received it from the seller before the due date.</li>
            <li> These SCHICK INJECTORS on the other hand are just like the Injector Razors of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> Now they are made in China and not as sharp.</li>
            <li> Everything was just as expected!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a sharp blade try these..</li>
            <li> Everything I Expected !</li>
            <li> They do not consistently hold their edge.</li>
            <li> Not seconds, as sharp as store bought.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these razors for years and was having trouble finding them in last few years.  </li>
            <li> However, over the past several years, the grocery and drug stores, where one could typically find this product, have been phasing them out of their regularly-carried stock.</li>
            <li> is a little tricky, but not much.  </li>
            <li> You can cut yourself if you aren&#x27;t careful, but just a little care can avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last about 4 or 5 shaves  for me before getting dull.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find these locally and lo and behold, here they are at Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> They are hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> Second blade cut me up but not as bad as the first.  </li>
            <li> But my beard is extremely thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> Men still need to get a straight edge for their sideburns and it is impossible to do with the double and triple razors that they not have.  </li>
            <li> Gets the job done and cuts down on disposable plastic pollution.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as yrs ago!</li>
            <li> Five SHARP Stars!</li>
            <li> I have found an odd brand in CVS about two years ago which I had been using &amp; a few other odd brands whenever &amp; whereever I could find them.  </li>
            <li> I typically get 10-12 shaves per blade...</li>
            <li> Always cheaper construction and less usable life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For whatever the reason, they are not easy to find at conventional suppliers.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t find injector blades in stores anylonger, they want you to buy the new 5 blades that are too expensive.</li>
            <li> He is a little happier.</li>
            <li> Since any brand of Injector Razor is very hard to find in a regular Retail Outlet Store now a days.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the price of these hard to find blades.</li>
            <li> LIKE THEY WERE A FEW YEARS AGO?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion:  Either the blades are poor or my razor has suddenly changed the way it directs the blade across my face.</li>
            <li> The secret to longevity is to store the loaded razor in baby oil (keeps the blade from rusting and actually prolongs the sharpness.</li>
            <li> In a matter of a few days, the order was delivered.</li>
            <li> Every blade I throw away, unused, is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty thick beard, but these blades just aren&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these blades don&#x27;t seem to be recyclable, as they&#x27;re considered medical waste</li>
            <li> For me, the Schick single-edge injector blade is the only way to go when you need to know where your blade is going to take out that unwanted stubble &amp; will keep its sharp cutting edge shave after shave.  </li>
            <li> Sharp enough to be dangerous.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to find Injector Razor Blades at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find single edge injector blades in any of our local stores.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> no more waxing...</li>
            <li> I could not see paying the outrageous prices for replacement cartridges any more.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is no local source for injector razor blades in my area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s all blade or partialy the razor itself.  </li>
            <li> Found them to be up to the usual standards.</li>
            <li> AS THERE IS NO BETTER BLADESMADE</li>
            <li> They are so hard to find anymore</li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> Its really hard to find this product in any store.</li>
            <li> These blades are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Others  dull and hurtful to my face.</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find these razor blades.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these blades in a store anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews of people having difficulty with their blades being dull or as having burrs on the edges.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these for years but, for some some reason, this batch&#x27;s blades are extremely dull.  </li>
            <li> These things are as hard to find as tits on an ant.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and now it seems the manufacture has stopped making them or at least distributing them.  </li>
            <li> so I will never run out of blades, at least not until Amazon runs out.  </li>
            <li> go slow and use a magnifying mirror...</li>
            <li> I have used these for the past 40 years...Can&#x27;t beat them...!</li>
            <li> If I did change the rating, I didn&#x27;t mean to.  </li>
            <li> Very irritating, even though they are sharp.</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s now so hard to buy them at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I hate all the new multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find locally.  </li>
            <li> and I found that it had a serious burr.  </li>
            <li> The blades are getting impossible to find in the stores, so online is about the only way I can still get them.  </li>
            <li> In some of the packs we are getting some blades are not good - don&#x27;t understand reason for this - doesn&#x27;t happen with all</li>
            <li> Thank you for a hard to find item!</li>
            <li> For the past 3 years or so, I was unable to find them in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Injector Blades have now become very hard to find.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND THESE BLADES IN STORES</li>
            <li> These new blades are terrible.</li>
            <li> They are real hard to find.</li>
            <li> But, blades are both expensive and very hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no more painful tweezing those brows....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using injector blades for almost 50 years and don&#x27;t see a need for expensive 3 or 5 blade cartridges.  </li>
            <li> They gave me a difficult time loading into the razor.</li>
            <li> wrong.  </li>
            <li> It looks to me as if the razor companies want us to buy that expensive stuff that they&#x27;re now putting on the shelves.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s now difficult for me to find these cartridge injector blades in stores.  </li>
            <li> It seems they are difficult to get in our area for some reason.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used these forever and was unable to find them in stores either in Michigan or Florida or any where else we were shopping.  </li>
            <li> I WAS AFRAID THEY STOPPED MAKING THEM</li>
            <li> Difficult to find these blades--especially at these prices!</li>
            <li> It is so difficult for my grandfather to find these razor blades in the stores!</li>
            <li> Sad :(</li>
            <li> These blades are very difficult to find-but my husband swears by the razor.  </li>
            <li> In this day and age, it is almost impossible to find these blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS&#x27;NT BAD ETHER.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the number of shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Schick; they are not what they use to be!</li>
            <li> These were absolutely awful.</li>

            <li> I have been using injector blades for 60 years.  I like them best of all others.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this brand for many years.</li>
            <li> Great blades at a great price!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what we were looking for.  They are so hard to find anymore so we were thrilled to find them here.</li>
            <li> The original razor was popular in 1968 when bought and used in basic military training and have used it ever since.  But, blades are both expensive and very hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these blades a year ago and waited to see if they were going to lose their edge fast.  They are as good as the original product of many years ago.  Recommend searching around the different vendors as some on amazon were much better deal than others and one company charged high shipping charges.  This purchase was excellent for me on quality and price of item and shipping.</li>
            <li> I have an old Schick injector, this is what I needed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad we found them my husband is the only blade that he use cause his hair so thick and regular blades don&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li> I have been using Schick injector razors and blades since the mid-late 1950&amp;#34;s.  I have found nothing, especially electrics, that give a more smooth and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only razor and blade for me.</li>
            <li> The older ones in the box are better than the new one in the plastic covers.</li>
            <li> My husband has been having a Schick injector razor for years and has not been a ble to find blades for it.  He is really pleased that I was able to locate blades for it and is enjoying the performance of his old razor with the new blades</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for 50 years and love it.  Sent my wife to buy me some new blades about a month ago and found there were none available in our local drug stores.  Found some at Amazon, they came and they are fine blades although I understand they are made in China.  They work fine and I am happy.  Thanks to the people that I bought them from.   Duane</li>
            <li> Although these blades are made in China you just can&#x27;t beat the shick injector razor.  Those multi blade razors get clogged up so fast and trying to clear the clog is really a pain. The single edge shick is clog free and rinces out easily.  They work the same as the older version made in the USA blades.</li>
            <li> For those of us, old fashioned guys, that still enjoy old fashioned shaves -and to save money!!!- a disposable blade that conserves its sharp edge after several (10-20) uses is important.    I have used this product for many years, more than I care to admit to, and found them reliable.  I recomend these blades     For whatever the reason, they are not easy to find at conventional suppliers.  Imagine my surprise at finding them through Amazon.com, at a really reasonable price (free shipping too).    My original order got lost.  I inquired at Amazon customer´s service.  They were not only helpful and corteous, they re-shipped the entiere order via priority mail and they assumed the cost(s).      SCHICK &#x3D; VERY GOOD PRODUCT, AMAZON &#x3D; EXCELENT SUPPLIER.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for these for a while. THey are no longer in stores. So he&#x27;s very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> In this day and age, it is almost impossible to find these blades.&lt;br /&gt;I got them through Amazon. They arrived in good time and order.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used the same Schick Injector Razor for over 30 years &amp; have not been able to locate the \\&quot;old\\&quot; single blade Schick injector blades anywhere no matter where I lived. I have found an odd brand in CVS about two years ago which I had been using &amp; a few other odd brands whenever &amp; whereever I could find them.  None of these substitutes came close to the quality, nor durability, of the original Schick brand. Being bearded since retiring from military service in 1985, I can only keep straight lines and an otherwise clean look with a single-edge blade; the newer multi-blade products just don&#x27;t hack it (they do, but not where I want it to \\&quot;hack\\&quot;). Having become acquainted with Amazon not too long ago, I decided one day (after another of my brand \\&quot;x\\&quot; blades lost its edge after only two days on the job)on a whim, to run my need by Amazon and much to my surprise &amp; delight found my long lost single-edge Schick injector blades. I ordered several 4-paks of those long lost friends &amp; have began enjoying my morning shave again.  I sincerely thank all responsible for my renewed shaving joy for &amp; making it all possible once again. For me, the Schick single-edge injector blade is the only way to go when you need to know where your blade is going to take out that unwanted stubble &amp; will keep its sharp cutting edge shave after shave.  [[ASIN:B001E6VHUQ Schick Injector Blades, 7-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> Genuine Schick blades, go great with vintage injector razors. Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> I could not find these in stores anymore. I use an electric shaver most of the time but always liked the injector blades. The disposable razors are fine but I don&#x27;t like the feather weight plastic. The injector razors just feel more substantial when shaving. The blades are good for several shaves and the injector cartridge accepts the used blade. So, when you use the last blade, slide it in the injector and toss the whole thing away.</li>
            <li> I use to use this  type, so ordered the wrong ones,  did find someone who does, and he was glad to receive them.</li>
            <li> These blades cannot be found in stores and I miss them for their consistent quality.  Even though they are now manufactured in China (and I DON&#x27;T like that!), they are still dependably sharp and maintain their sharpness as well as ever.  Shipping from vendor was pleasingly quick!</li>
            <li> I order these blades for my Dad who will only use his razor from \\&quot;way back when\\&quot; He says these are the only blades that shave him properly and amazon.com has the best deal around!</li>
            <li> I WAS AFRAID THEY STOPPED MAKING THEM YEARS AGO SO I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND THEM.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Great job! Thank you</li>
            <li> These blades will give you the closest and most comfortable shave.  They are becoming harder and harder to find in local stores and I was very pleased to find them on here and they are marked at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS</li>
            <li> these are quite nice and still have a nice edge after 14 days. I figure after 14 days might as well change blades! I just wish there was someone making injector razors in the USA. I was able to find a razor made in Pakistan!</li>
            <li> I have used these for the past 40 years...Can&#x27;t beat them...!</li>
            <li> no more waxing...no more painful tweezing those brows....Schick injectable blades (only) work the best for shaving your unwanted eye brow hair....go slow and use a magnifying mirror...works great</li>
            <li> My dad has been using these razors for 70+ years - glad we can find them here.</li>
            <li> These blades last quite a while for my schick injector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very sharp, and will fit any of the old Schick Injector razors.</li>
            <li> These chinese made blades are surprisingly very good. Nice smooth close shaves. Last about 4 or 5 shaves  for me before getting dull. Of course your milage may vary.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 40 years and will always use it as long as they aer made.</li>
            <li> Great place (Amazon) to get hard to fine items.</li>
            <li> I have used these blades and razor for over 50 years. I have tried other razors and blades, but always come back to Schick injectors. The purchase process was easy, with the blades being shipped as presented.</li>
            <li> use them every day to shave to bad they dpnt sell them in stores anymore but great for you thank you for haven them</li>
            <li> I ordered these injector blades as they are no longer available in brick and mortar stores.  It&#x27;s hard to shave with an injector razor if you don&#x27;t have any of these very specialized blades.  The shipping was quick and reasonable and the blades work VERY well.  I can only get +/- 3 shaves out of a double edge razor blade.  These blades are good for 7-8 very close and very smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these razors for years and was having trouble finding them in last few years.  This was a great find and price and now all is right in his world</li>
            <li> I initially was able to purchase from drug stores back in the last century.  Now I&#x27;m glad i can still get them even though i have to order them on-line.</li>
            <li> Received and in use !  Keeping the fuzz down  thanks</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these 4 packs (of 7 blades in each pack) on three separate occasions now. Although the box states the blades are made in China,I must say that I have gotten just as good a result with these blades as I got with previous Schick blades made in Germany. On the average,I get 3 or 4 shaves to a blade. But my beard is extremely thick and coarse.Thus, the guy with an average beard should get better results.  All in all, these blades are an excellent bargain.</li>
            <li> For a simple single-blade razor, this is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve been using these blades for years and they never disappoint.</li>
            <li> Work great I use them all the time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his razor and was thrilled when I found I could purchase the blades on Amazon when he couldn&#x27;t find them in the store. I bought enough for 10 years!</li>
            <li> WHY ARE INJECTOR BLADES NOT SOLD IN PHARMACY STORES LIKE THEY WERE A FEW YEARS AGO?  YOU CAN BUY DOUBLE EDGE BLADES BUT NOT SINGLE EDGE.  THIS IS NO ONLY THE CASE IN MY HOME STATE BUT ALL THE STATES FROM SOUTH CAROLINA TO NEW YORK.&lt;br /&gt;PASQUALE</li>
            <li> what can you say the best shave</li>
            <li> I recently went back to shaving with a double edge and an injector razor.  I could not see paying the outrageous prices for replacement cartridges any more.  Unfortunately, there is no local source for injector razor blades in my area.  I ordered these and that are as I remember them.  They come seven to a container now, instead of ten, but they are still as smooth and sharp as the blades I remember.  The price is reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> My husband will only use single blades which are very difficult to fine, let alone the razor, I&#x27;m always have been able to fine them on amazon.  Thank you for making my husband happy!</li>
            <li> The only way I can get blades for my husband&#x27;s razor, online, he refuses to change razors !</li>
            <li> My barber, Tim, is an old-fashion barber.  He reads a newspaper every morning before he starts work, and fashions interesting anecdotes on a variety of topics.  Oh, yeah, he still uses a straight razor around your ears. The shave with Schick blades is like that! Old-fashioned!  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> They fit and shave like a dream in my decades old single blade injector razor..</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades since the cows came home and believe me they haven&#x27;t left the barn.  I started using them when I was travelling all over the world installing software for the Air Force and they give a great shave for the last fifty years, so why change and with a company like amazon you can still buy things that have left the retails stores decades ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry these blades are no longer made in America, but I am happy they are still available.  The Schick Injector razor is a favorite razor design of mine.  These blades are excellent, and they seem to be as sharp and as durable as the original made-in-America Schick Injector blades were of yesteryear.  Thank you, Amazon, and I hope you carry Schick Injector blades forever!</li>
            <li> Difficult to find these blades--especially at these prices!</li>
            <li> Like they used to be.  Though I think I liked a different type back then.</li>
            <li> I like using my old schick razor. Hard to find these blades at a reasonable price at the local stores.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find these locally and lo and behold, here they are at Amazon.com! They are exactly what I need and at the right price. These blades fit my injector razor (probably 20 years old) perfectly. A great product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find injector blades at any local pharmacies.  I was pleased to find that I can still get them on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been using injector blades for almost 50 years and don&#x27;t see a need for expensive 3 or 5 blade cartridges.  The Shick blades are of superior quality to the generic brands my pharmacy was selling.</li>
            <li> After a career in NAVAIR walking and running the flight decks in crummy military-grade steel-toes, I use these to trim corns and callouses from my feet. The doctors won&#x27;t give me a surgically sharp blade to use, so I&#x27;ve always used these. I was hurting when I ran out because the stores don&#x27;t carry them anymore. Thankfully, Amazon still does. I buy them in great quantity now against the day Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry them.</li>
            <li> My husband has used shick injector blades for years.  I would buy several packages at a time for stocking stuffers.  For the past 3 years or so, I was unable to find them in the stores.  This year, he annoused he has to find a new rasor, he used his last blade. Not being computer savvy, I had to try and find them for him.  I went on line (all by myself) and found shick injector blades.  I placed my order 12/13/10 and they would be shipped in 5-10 days. I received my package in 4 days. He was very pleased with his surprised gift.</li>
            <li> I could not find injector blades anywhere; supermarkets or drug stores. Ordered these on line. Although the price was attractive, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the product. The blades are not sharp enough and do not provide a close shave. They feel rough when you use them and I do not get a long life out of each blade. Very disappointed in Schick; they are not what they use to be!</li>
            <li> I have used my Schick Injector razor for almost 40 years.  I borrowed it from my father-in-law and never returned it.  It was hard to find  blades until Amazon made them available.  Twice I have ordered, received and used them in a timely and efficient manner.  Great shave, easy transaction and a very efficient, customer friendly operation.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband had been looking everywhere for these blades and could not find them anywhere. I found them on Amazon.com and ordered them and he is very happy with the product. And he received it from the seller before the due date. He is happy, happy, happy!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has had this razor over the years and has tried other razors and keeps going back to this one.  The blades are not to be found.  So thank you Amazon for carrying these.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for those of us who enjoy the old fashion shaving. Great to use in shaping the beard. I like it very much</li>
            <li> These blades are great, sharp and smooth. I typically get 10-12 shaves per blade...I could probably get more but why push it?</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my dad who was having a harder and harder time finding quality injector blades for his military issue 1950s razor. He was thrilled with these and claims it&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s had in years after using low quality options that he could purchase locally, for years. Great price and they arrived very fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Since any brand of Injector Razor is very hard to find in a regular Retail Outlet Store now a days. I resorted to purchasing some off brand  injector razors from your standard &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; auction website. I was not satisified with the product that I received from that particular seller. These SCHICK INJECTORS on the other hand are just like the Injector Razors of yesteryear. I am truly satisified with this product and will probably purchase the Razor Blades in the future when the need arises. This is the 3rd time I have bought these Injector Blades. They work just as great as the first 2 orders. Very Very happy.</li>
            <li> Glad someone is still selling these blades.  Only place I have been able to find them.</li>
            <li> no where near the original blade. each blade is different..one might last a week, next one maybe a day or two. cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly in all my Injector Razors. A good sharp, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The best price and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original Schick; these are made in China and a. don&#x27;t last very long, b. aren&#x27;t as sharp, and c. are rather rough to use.  I really miss the old ones.</li>
            <li> Everything worked out great.  This was a different use for these blades as they are used in a machine.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish is more blades in the package.</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T KNOW THIS TYPE OF OPTION WAS AVAILABLE.  MY HUSBAND WOULD HUNT FOR THESE RAZORS EVERYWHERE AND COULD NOT FIND THEM.</li>
            <li> We could not find this product in the stores anymore and went on your website and found it.  A very happy husband</li>
            <li> The blades I have used are very dull, not cutting the hairs close as they should!!! The blades do not cutthe whiskers close enough.</li>
            <li> I have been running to all the stores for months looking for injector blades,nothing!&lt;br /&gt;Ahhh, but on the internet you can find everything! I ordered 4 packs to last me a year or two, great product, just like they have been for 30 years...</li>
            <li> I ordered for Christmas and received my order on time, for a great price.</li>
            <li> They were very much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this brand... now he has plenty &#x27;til the next order!</li>
            <li> The old still works better than the new!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the injectors for years. Then the stores stopped stocking them, as well as the razors. I just stumbled across them, when I was looking for Micro One (per their ads. on TV).</li>
            <li> I thought I was hooped ever finding single blades for my razor.  I originally bought enough blades to last me 5 years before they stopped selling them in the drug store, which I suspected would happen with all the multi blades out there. I bought some more  because &amp;#34;hey&amp;#34; maybe you won&#x27;t get them online one day either. Goes good with Edwin Jaggar shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for years to find a decent substitute for the Schick injector razors I used for forty years.  Hopeless quest.  You can&#x27;t imagine what a satisfying thrill it is to be using the real thing again!</li>
            <li> Good product, good customer service.</li>
            <li> Had for 30 years and I still love them.glad I could get on amazon</li>
            <li> Been using the single bladed Schick razor since high school - I even has another seldom used razor somewhere (just moved and not sure where it is).  The last batch of injector blades I purchased at a supermarket -- they were not the original Schick blades but a plastic cased knockoff -- and the only injector blades available.  They gave me a difficult time loading into the razor. Since the stores in my area have so many golf cart parking spaces (implying an older population), I figured one of the chains (food/pharmacy) would have them -- wrong.  Thought of going on line and found the real deal which load without a problem and are very sharp.  I didn&#x27;t see made in China on the boxes I bought. Four boxes of seven blades for 12 bucks (got 10 off for Amazon charge card).  I do not even want to think about those multi-bladed razors (3,4 or 5 blades) -- just more chance to cut yourself.  No worries now!  Only dislike is that Amazon is opening a distribution center in Florida and the tax free purchases will go out the window in a year.</li>
            <li> Hard to find. I have used these for years and now it seems the manufacture has stopped making them or at least distributing them.  Happy to know there is a place to get them..</li>
            <li> Packaging and delivery was great.  My dissatisfaction is with the blades.  The package says it contains stainless steel blades, metalized with chromium to ensure closeness and comfort.  Previous blades have provided several weeks of clean, comfortable shaves.  Two of two blades from this pack have only given about four shaves each that are close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Either the blades are poor or my razor has suddenly changed the way it directs the blade across my face.</li>
            <li> They used to be made in Germany &amp; were alot sharper &amp; better quality! Now they are made in China and not as sharp.</li>
            <li> The injector razor provides one of the best and most comfortable shaves available. The blades are very sharp and hold their edge for a weeks worth of shaves on a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Although fitting the Shick Injector razor, these blades only lasted for four shaves before they became to dull to use.</li>
            <li> I pick this product for my dad, he really likes this brand of blades.  Its really hard to find this product in any store. He has tried other styles and always comes back to this brand. My dad has use this brand since the 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It is nice to know that I can still purchase Schick Injector razors from Amazon.com.  I&#x27;ve been using them for many decades but they were not selling them at retail stores anymore, not even at Target or Walmart.  Men still need to get a straight edge for their sideburns and it is impossible to do with the double and triple razors that they not have.  Schick injector razors can do this.</li>
            <li> Unable to locate these type of blades in Texas...can locate the generic but they are not near as good.  I prefer the single edge blades over the double edge or multiple blades and these blades work fantastic.  I can get about 10 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> Husband loves these.  They are hard to find locally.  This was a great price.  This is the only type of&lt;br /&gt;shaver he has used for the best shave. So much better than all the new blade styles today.</li>
            <li> These blades are impossible to find in retail stores and I like the shave quality much better than the more expensive triple+ blade systems that are out there.</li>
            <li> We have been looking all over for these.  My husband uses a razor that he has had since the early 60&#x27;s.  He is thrilled that he can go back to using it again.</li>
            <li> Everything was just as expected!</li>
            <li> The Schick injector razors are simply the best shaving razors I have ever used. I only hope they never stop making these blades. Nothing else even comes close!</li>
            <li> I have an old single blade Schick injector razor that I have had since the 1980&#x27;s. I could not find blades in any drug store that I looked in, and I was down to my last blade. What a relief to find these blades on AMAzon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks............................P. Gaston White</li>
            <li> Have had schick razor since 1945 nd have  had 3 of them and I liked very much, the best.&lt;br /&gt;But last few yr. could not find, but ordered on amazon so have a  sufficient supply.&lt;br /&gt;LRP</li>
            <li> they were fine according my husband.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best ever and why they discontinued selling the blades was a great loss.  However knowing they are still available thru your company is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I have this razor that belong to my dad, when I went into booth camp in &#x27;58, I took it with me, i&#x27;m still using it and u can&#x27;t buy these blades in stores any more, TANKS to u I can still use it</li>
            <li> Ireceived the blades in a very timely, just as i wanted. It was easy to place the order. I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is so difficult for my grandfather to find these razor blades in the stores! Thank goodness for the availability and convenience of Amazon!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a friend .  He seems very happy with them.  He uses them in a vintage razor.  It is much more economical than using disposables.</li>
            <li> I was glad I found them in Amazon!  I used them for my pedicures and they work fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 4 packages and hope they never run out of it, even though they may be out of style!&lt;br /&gt;They work good and I would recommend it to anyone who still has an injector shaver.</li>
            <li> Injector Blades have now become very hard to find. Considering this quantity will last 6 months, a bargain when compared even to the cheapest twin-blade options.</li>
            <li> just what my husband is use to using glad to find the blades for him.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.  No one locally carries these any more  I have always dry Shaved and these are the best I have found.  If you are looking for a sharp blade try these..</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find locally.  Bought these for my father who has used them for years to trim his mustache.</li>
            <li> I have been a Schick fan for years.  These blades are hard to find.  I should have known that it anybody had them, it would be Amazon!.  Packaging, as always, allowed deliverance without incident.  Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> great purchase, you can&#x27;t find these in the stores anylonger..</li>
            <li> Delivery fine, Only about 20 percent of blades from each package likely to be sharp. Others  dull and hurtful to my face.</li>
            <li> For my dad .. he loves them - I was happy that I was able to find them for him.</li>
            <li> Given their absence from large and small stores alike, I appreciate the ability to  replenish my supply of injector blades, in a convenient e-mail manner.  I remain convinced that I am not the only person using injector blades; thus  please assure their continued availability.</li>
            <li> I cant Find These Schick Injector blades in my area and if I&#x27;m lucky to  the cost much more..    so this is a great Deal.....  I&#x27;ll be back  caddjoe</li>
            <li> Its excellent to know that one ca still purchase single blades,they give me the smoothest shave compared to the systems</li>
            <li> Good to have my 25yr old razor back in action.... It got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t buy the blades in a store... Been close to ten yrs since I&#x27;ve seen them....</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find these razor blades.  My husband still uses the old style razor.</li>
            <li> My husband has an old Schick Injector razor that he swears gives the smoothest shave and has for years, but the blades are&lt;br /&gt;difficult to find, so he has tried all the new type of razors, but doesn&#x27;t like them.  He was simply ecstatic when I found these&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon, and now he has a good supply.  We will be ordering more when he starts running low.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find Injector Razor Blades at a decent price.  These blades are made for my obsolete razor and at a very good price, so stock up while they last.</li>
            <li> Only place I could find these at a reasonable price. Have used my schick razor for more than 55 years and still love it.</li>
            <li> Have been looking all over for these blades I hate all the new multi blade razors. Glad to have found these.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent blade. shaves close get many usesThe older styles are the best,. Sevice was super from Amazon.will always by this  item when i can locate it</li>
            <li> My first blade carved me up and I found that it had a serious burr.  Second blade cut me up but not as bad as the first.  My third shave, with the second blade, was blood free as I was extremely cautious.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s all blade or partialy the razor itself.  Will continue with the remaining 26 if possible.</li>
            <li> Found them to be up to the usual standards. Have been using that kind of razor for over 50 years. Hard to find locally in most of the front line drug stores, so I have to purchase them online. But they have always been excelent and this time was no exception.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and have used about every blade shaving method except streight razor.  I use my fathers 1948&lt;br /&gt;injector razor with these blades for 10 years now. You cannot beat the results of a close shave with this system,&lt;br /&gt;I know, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  These multi blade plastic razors are a big marketing lie.  Sounds good, but don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;And cost too much.  I hope I can continue to get these blades since they don&#x27;t sell the razors here any more.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to anyone,  buy a razor off e bay, stock up on these blades, and learn the CORRECT WAY TO SHAVE,&lt;br /&gt;and find the right shaving porducts that work for you and your beard.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the 3,4,5, multiple blade razors and end up coming back to&lt;br /&gt;my old stand by. You can&#x27;t beat the closeness of a single edge razor.</li>
            <li> I would like a lot better if I had real shick razor instead of a knock off gave close shave never cut my self all I used when I was in the army in the 60s</li>
            <li> exactly as described--prompt shipping</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them at any retail outlets. Hope to keep my single edge raiser for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Blades work great.  Pack of 4 offer a great price.</li>
            <li> Great blade. I&#x27;ve been using for years. Couldn&#x27;t find them in the store anymore.</li>
            <li> love them as they are very difficult t fine in store in dunkirk</li>
            <li> Quality of these blades seems good, so far. Too bad it&#x27;s now so hard to buy them at the local drugstore. Guess most people don&#x27;t think it wastes enough resources to just throw away a few dozen blades a year....</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as yrs ago!</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and clean shave.</li>
            <li> These are the only kind of blades that my husband uses due to the fact he has a beard that is hard to shave and these do the job.  We can no longer find these blades in stores around us so this is the reason i ordered them off of amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I got the Schick Injector Blades today as I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them out. They are real hard to find. I got them sooner than expected and was very happy and would buy them again as the price was great.</li>
            <li> Works for the job intended.  Sharp enough to be dangerous.  These review length requirements need to be changed.  There is only so much I am willing to write about razor blades.</li>
            <li> Great, best of my knowledge they were not made in China!</li>
            <li> I like many think razors and blade systems shouldn&#x27;t be in locked cases, like premium champagne. THEY ARE RAZORS AND BLADES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single side razor, and these blades last me 2-3 days.  I can get a week out a a Feather, double edged blade, and a decent double sided razor.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using The Schick single blade injector since he was 16 years old.  He is now 62.  So I would say the blades are great .  He has tried others and does not like them.  Please keep making them</li>
            <li> Excellent service in processing and delivery of the order.  As to the blades themselves, I&#x27;ve ordered them before,  they&#x27;re the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used for nearly 50 years.  Why on earth they&#x27;re no longer available in the local drug store is beyond me. I&#x27;ve heard countless other men say the same thing over the past half dozen years.  It looks to me as if the razor companies want us to buy that expensive stuff that they&#x27;re now putting on the shelves. Why on earth do I need a razor &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; that apparently  comes with headlights, power steering and  stereo, when the timeless single edge injector blade works just as well, and at a fraction of the price!?</li>
            <li> Item is as described. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> See stars for recommendation.</li>
            <li> These are difficult to find, so when I gave these to m father, he was surprised and very pleased!</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend because he couldn&#x27;t find anywhere and he was very pleased because he&#x27;s been using them forever.  He said the price was very reasonable even with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I have had the razor that fits these razors,&lt;br /&gt;I was so glad to have the in your inventory, they are extreemly hard to find.</li>
            <li> Both blade and cartridge work fine; other brands of Injector blades were sometimes troublesome. Highly recommended for anyone using that type of razor.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE ORIGINAL RAZOR IN 1962 .  I WAS DISMAYED WHEN THE REFILL BLADES WERE DISCONTINUED IN THE PLACES I SHOP.  I WAS EXCITED TO FIND THAT THESE REFILL  BLADES WERE STILL AVAILABLE.  GREAT SERVICE.  WOULD REORDER THEN AGAIN.</li>
            <li> took longer than i thought it should, but then it was sent thru snail mail. the process to register for ebill to pay your amazon card was horrendous..the step by step listed on the card took you no where...call the 800 number listed and the procedure was easier, but still was horrendous/ridiculous...</li>
            <li> An excellent product which is no longer made, to my knowledge.  The blades are stout and durable and the razor is uncomplicated.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find.  I am glad I could find them through Amazon.  My razor is old and these are the only razors I prefer to use.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t find injector blades in stores anylonger, they want you to buy the new 5 blades that are too expensive. Only complain was only get 2 shavers from a blade 3 if lucky</li>
            <li> recieved exactly what I wanted in very timely manner</li>
            <li> What can I say?? REAL razor blades for a change, instead of the multi-bladed over priced &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34; currently in vogue !&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY I can shave like a grown up again !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these blades in a store anymore. These were perfect.</li>
            <li> These blades are getting harder &amp; harder to find. Nice to be able to get them at a decent price and to be able to sign up for a subcription to them so I will never run out of blades, at least not until Amazon runs out.  [[ASIN:B001E6VHUQ Schick Injector Blades, 7-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I have been using the Schick single-blade injector razor since about 1962, and have no intention of graduating to multiple-blade razors, which in my view are not truly better than the single blade razor. However, over the past several years, the grocery and drug stores, where one could typically find this product, have been phasing them out of their regularly-carried stock. I am happy that Amazon still carries this product. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> best shave for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My father-in-law couldn&#x27;t find these in any store, I said we can find them on Amazon.  They were exactly what my father-in-law wanted...now he loves me even more.  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;old&#x27; guy likes his &#x27;old&#x27; razor.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s now difficult for me to find these cartridge injector blades in stores.  I&#x27;m relieved. :)</li>
            <li> These are far superior to the fancy over advertised blades , a much better and closer shave</li>
            <li> Once you go old school you will never go back.. Puts the new cartridges to shame</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these any more. For us &amp;#34;Old&amp;#34; guys that still use the razor that we got when we turned 18 or so, this is a tried and true Blade. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> They actually do as good as a professional barber with a straight razor. I&#x27;ve always used them since I was a teenager (longer ago than I&#x27;d care to admit) until I could no longer find them. ATTENTION WORLD: progress isn&#x27;t always what it&#x27;s cracked up to be. And they last, are easy to clean, and don&#x27;t jam up as fast as the 2 blades; or I guess it&#x27;s 3; no, actually it&#x27;s up to 5. The secret to longevity is to store the loaded razor in baby oil (keeps the blade from rusting and actually prolongs the sharpness.</li>
            <li> Great blades!Fast shipping! Thank you!</li>
            <li> nice to know these can still be obtained - original razor 1969</li>
            <li> So glad to finally find these and at such a good price. They were shipped promptly and were exactly as advertised. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with the injector blades and these are all he uses.</li>
            <li> husband has old razor--delighted to find them</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised and would certainly buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> The first two blades I used were dull. I&#x27;m on the 3rd blade seems to be fine</li>
            <li> Perfect for my husband!</li>
            <li> I ordered these blades for my brother-in-law because he couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. He didn&#x27;t want to change from his old Schick Injector razor because he had been using it for years and was very satisfied with it. He said they were perfect.  I will be ordering them again in about a year.</li>
            <li> In some of the packs we are getting some blades are not good - don&#x27;t understand reason for this - doesn&#x27;t happen with all</li>
            <li> Just as Advertised &amp; a Great Seller.</li>
            <li> Basic, like chromium ones better</li>
            <li> Product received from seller just as described and very satisfied with sellers product.</li>
            <li> So glad they are still made and sold! I appreciate the timely (and free) shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This made my husband very happy to get these. We thought they were obsolete...glad he still had his razor tho...</li>
            <li> I use these in a small leather shaving knife, they work great, and the price ain&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and cuts down on disposable plastic pollution. I add the blades to the recycling bin. I wish the old platinum+ blades existed as they lasted a bit longer / cut cleaner longer. Forget all the ads about how delicate your face is and why you need 5 blades to get a good shave. Save the planet. Get a decent shave for a very good price and take the occasional &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; as the price you pay for helping to save the planet.</li>
            <li> Schick Injector Blades are the best I have found. They stay sharper longer and are comfortable to use. I&#x27;ve tried other blades but the injector blades work best for me.</li>
            <li> My husband has been shaving with an injector razor for years. This is the only razor that he likes. It finally got to the point that we couldn&#x27;t find the blades anywhere. We were both so pleased to find them on this website. We are having them delivered on a regular basis!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for having them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get them at grocery or pharmacy anymore. I refuse to purchase those multi-blade gadgets that do the same thing as this good old single blade.</li>
            <li> My Schick Injector razor is more than 30 years old. Good blades have been very hard to find for the past 20years. Taking a gamble on these, I hit the jackpot. I had not lost the technique of shaving with a blade, and can now enjoy a clean shave again; better tha the electrics, with no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li> I have used Schick Injector blades for over 25 years and they are great. The only problem is most stores don&#x27;t stock&lt;br /&gt;them anymore.</li>
            <li> When my local drugstore stopped carrying these blades I bought a five year supply online.  One more thing I don&#x27;t have to worry about.</li>
            <li> Shick injector razor and blades give best shave at best price.  have  used for over 40 years and beats others i&#x27;ve tried  in comfort</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to chance a straight razor or a double edge razor, the Schick Injector is the way to go.  Smooth shave, and it&#x27;s easy to clean out the gunk that regularly clogs the muti-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Everything I Expected !</li>
            <li> Made my Dad so happy to get these! Perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product was what we expected, no complaints at this time.</li>
            <li> It is just what I needed and it came quickly. I have purchased these before and am very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Schick injector razor for many, many years and using what ever blades I could find. The original Schick injector blades are by far the best.</li>
            <li> Some of the blades do not seem to be sharp enough.</li>
            <li> it is a perfect fit for a razor which I have been using for many years and haven&#x27;t any reason to change.  It is easy to order and arrives quickly.</li>
            <li> My first and only razor that was my dad&#x27;s and that I used while it was still his and he gave me when he started using the multi-blade ones is the exact model this was created for.  I love it and don&#x27;t know why anyone would need these modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Blades work as they should. They cut hair and whiskers. May be used to cut various items or scrape paint and stuff for flat surfaces.</li>
            <li> They do not consistently hold their edge.</li>
            <li> Wonderful blades. I will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard, and all of the multi-blade razors would either not cut good, clog, or wear out to fast. This is what a shave should be like.</li>
            <li> Schick still sells these injector blades even though they stopped selling the injector razor in 1999 because so many people still shave with them and they are an exelent blade and razor!  Wish they&#x27;d bring them back.  In fact you can still see the blades in their list of products on the Schick web site.  The old ad&#x27;s for the razor was &amp;#34;The closest thing to a straight razor shave!&amp;#34; because the head angle was made to place the blade at the perfect angle for a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are stiff, incredibly sharp and give a very smooth, close shave every time.  A great product that hasn&#x27;t changed much since the 1920&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> For my money the old injector razors are still the best.  The blades are getting impossible to find in the stores, so online is about the only way I can still get them.  And I am glad I can get them there, because all these fancy multiple blade razors are just s waste of money in my opinion.  These razors &amp; blades are simple, do a nice job, and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BLADES. I AM 60 YEARS OLD AND I&#x27;M SHAVING WITH THE SAME SINGLE EDGE RAZER, A STICK SHICK, THAT I STARTED SHAVING WITH WHEN I WAS 17. IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND THESE BLADES IN STORES NOW AND IF YOU DO FIND THEM THEY ARE PRICY. WHEN I FOUND THESE ON AMAZON I JUMPED ON UM. THEY ARE VERY SHARP AND LAST A LONG TIME. I CAN SHAVE 6 TIMES BEFORE I CHANGE BLADES. THE PRICE IS&#x27;NT BAD ETHER. I THINK YOU&#x27;LL LIKE UM.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid my father shaved with there as the new innovation to blue blades.  In the last 50 years I have been back and forth as I tested and tried all the multi bladed inventions.  I finally went back to my old standby and found a pack with two blades.  What a nice clean shave!  Of course the first few times I walked out with tissue dot and I smelled of Mennen after shave, but now that I have healed and gained back all the lost blood, I love them.</li>
            <li> We use these Schick Injector blades in a special tool which we use to groom our two shaggy dogs.  The blades when inserted into the tool allow us to safely remove matted hair that builds up in the dogs coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the advent of the new multi bade razors these old timer injector style blades are hard to find in the stores, and I was pleased to find them on Amazon.  My only complaint was the price of these hard to find blades.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> most reliable and speedy delivery,item as expected,very positive.</li>
            <li> So glad you still carry these! I don&#x27;t ever want to discard my Schick Injector Razor, and I never will as long as these blades are still available!!!</li>
            <li> these blades are no longer available in the local drug store, so i am happy that i can keep shaving with a single edge razor.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this product thank you</li>
            <li> I chose the middle rating because I&#x27;ve had trouble  getting the blades to eject from the dispenser. Once I get them out the blades give a great shave.</li>
            <li> Five CONSISTENT Stars! These are very sharp 7-count Schick Injector single-edge blades, packaged in the familiar metal container with the extended prong that allows injection of blades into a Schick safety shaving razor with handle (not included). Over the decades, this exact style blade, with the two holes in the side for alignment with the razor housing, has remained popular. Some of us also use the blades for edging and trimming by hand. Each of these blades has delivered at least 10 comfortable uses for me for decades and they are very sharp and durable. The container has a compartment for used blades on the bottom. My Highest Recommendation. Five SHARP Stars! (4 boxes of 1 injector container with 7 blades.)</li>
            <li> What more can you ask of a blade other than it be comfortably smooth and sharp enough to cut without excessive tugging? I would also say cheap but rarely do you find that combination. It would be nice of Schick to consider making injectors with more than 7 blades again. Most of the manufacturing costs are tied up into the fancy dispensers.  Still, I am glad they still make them!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase. I got the injector blades for a friend. You can&#x27;t seem to find them in drug stores anymore, and he has always&lt;br /&gt;used the injector blades, he was thrilled that I got them for him.</li>
            <li> These blades will cut yoour face as well as your beard. I found my old razor and injector cartridge with one blade left, so I tried it. It was so sharp and comfortable that I thought to use it along with my double edge baldes. My druggist ordered a pack of new blades and I thought it was great that they are still available - wrong. These new blades are terrible. Very irritating, even though they are sharp. I&#x27;ll stick to my double edge blades. I&#x27;ve used 6 different brands, and they were all comfortable. These were absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these blades for many years but they are almost impossible to find locally. Glad they are available on line.</li>
            <li> Product fills a need we&#x27;ve not been able to meet for quite a long time.  It fits the razor my husband likes best.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller. 5*****</li>
            <li> Due to the lack of availability for Schick Injector blades in local stores, I ordered the item on line because my husband would not use any other substitute blade. I checked to see if they were available on line and learned that they were available from Amazon.  I ordered the blades and I was very pleasantly surprised at how smooth the transaction was.  In a matter of a few days, the order was delivered. It was amazing that the transaction was so easy.  I would never hesitate to order items on line from Amazon in the future!  Amazon is just GREAT and the response time was outstanding!!!</li>
            <li> These blades are ok.  My dad gave me my schick injector about 15 years ago and the blades then seemed to be better.  I have a pretty thick beard, but these blades just aren&#x27;t cutting it.  Sad :(</li>
            <li> Well, if you&#x27;re into the old Injector shaver, these are the blades for you. Glad I found these, since I was almost out. Been using the shaver since high school, and it works just fine!! These will do the job!</li>
            <li> On time and exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Quick ship as described</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my father-in-law.  It seems they are difficult to get in our area for some reason.  He wanted them, and he got them.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for years. Great product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast responds, this are very good blades. Can not find this style of blade in some stores any more. Thank you a great product.</li>
            <li> These razor blades were exactly what I expected.  They arrived in great condition within the specified time.  It was my first time using Amazon to make a purchase but it will not be my last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find single edge injector blades in any of our local stores.  When I ask, clerks reply that &amp;#34;no one uses these types of razors anymore.&amp;#34;  I GOT NEWS FOR YOU--I DO.  If it ain&#x27;t broke why fix it with all these double/tripple blade razors.  I guess I am old fashoned, and not willing to change my ways.  I love simple&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leaved the razor in the shower as I shave during my daily cleansing.  I get 12-15 great shaves from each blade--they hold their edge very nicely.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard so the schick injector blades are the best for trimming and getting the straightest lines. They are not what they used to be years ago but better than the CVS brand that also is no longer available . Was happy to be able to find them .</li>
            <li> Great to be able to get these hard to find blades.</li>
            <li> GETTING HARDER TO FIND INJECTOR BLADES, BUT THESE OLD STYLE RAZORS GIVE A SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER SHAVE THAN TODAY&#x27;S DISPOSABLES.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE PERFECT AND  I AM SO GLAD YOU CARRY THEM FOR FUTURE USE AS WELL.  THEY CANNOT BE FOUND ELSEWHERE.</li>
            <li> These blades are very difficult to find-but my husband swears by the razor.  Thrilled to have options for purchasing the blades.</li>
            <li> Love these blades and lucky to have an original Schick Shaver.</li>
            <li> I remember switching to double blade razors and then triple and than quadruple and NOW quintuple blade razors.......................&lt;br /&gt;and I began to wonder when it was I started resenting dropping $50 for razor cartridge heads....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I remember I used single injectors because they shaved closer than electric razors and didn&#x27;t chew my face off like electric razors (electric razors make a callous you know, on your FACE)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought these and a LNIB Schick injector handle on ebay...........and I&#x27;m getting a GOOD clean, close shave again</li>
            <li> The blades are not as sharp as other blades I&#x27;ve used; however, I still manage to get a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The blades work  good the injector razor did not</li>
            <li> The Schick injector razor--the best shave ever since man has started scraping his face.  This tool has all the elements of the safety razor in a neat trim package without all the goo-gaws of multi-bladed, neon-colored, disposable plastic razors of today.  Electric doesn&#x27;t even come close!  I was OVERJOYED to find out that these blades are still available in Europe and can be purchased through Amazon.  Many thanks for many more years of happy shaving!</li>
            <li> workes fine just like always</li>
            <li> A few years ago I stocked up on spare injector blades and finally ran low on supply...after looking for the blades in local stores and not finding any I resorted to the internet and was glade to find them at Amazon.  The blades are work well although the first couple of shaves produce a few &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.....</li>
            <li> My husband loves his old razor and this kind of blades are very hard to find in the stores so was thrilled to be able to order these at amazon and stock up</li>
            <li> These blades are a great compromise between the double edge razors and modern cartridges. I wanted to ditch cartridges, and found that DE razors weren&#x27;t for me. So I bought an old Hydro-Magic razor and ordered these blades. I was very happily surprised by the quality and closeness of the shave. You&#x27;ll save quite a bit of money, as these blades cost around .78 (per blade), and cartridges can cost over $2.50 per blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using injector razors make sure not to press too hard when shaving, or you can get some razor burn. Injector razors mostly drive like a cartridge, but cost a lot less and are less wasteful. There are good forums like shave den and badger and blade. Learning how to shave properly is also very helpful, instead of just throwing the blade at your face, like we do with cartridges. There are some good videos on youtube that cover this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The injector magazine has a slot in the bottom for used blades, but I simply use a broth can. Remove the label, cut a slit in the top (with a knife you don&#x27;t care too much about), drain the broth, rinse the can, and put your used blades in the can. When it&#x27;s full, you can tape up the slit and throw it into the trash. Unfortunately, these blades don&#x27;t seem to be recyclable, as they&#x27;re considered medical waste (besides, the blades are stainless steel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to have discovered injector razors and that I can find the blades here on Amazon (most brick and mortar places don&#x27;t seem to carry them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 3/7/13*&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews of people having difficulty with their blades being dull or as having burrs on the edges. Make sure when you load the blade into the razor that the edge doesn&#x27;t rub against the retaining pins on the razor, as this can ruin the edge of the blade.</li>
            <li> All these new razors with 2,3,&amp; 4 blades are not any better than the Schick injector blades that I have been using for almost 50 years. I am happy that even though they can no longer be found at any local stores, they are available online.</li>
            <li> Have used the Schick Injector Razor for many years and was not about to give it up for the current trend of multi and multi-multi expensive blades.</li>
            <li> The blades must have been re-sharpened (or tried to be.)  My husband, a diabetic, was bleeding from several places and had blood all over the bathroom trying to shave.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine.  The injector blades came quickly and are working fine.  If I did change the rating, I didn&#x27;t mean to.  I&#x27;d give it a five star.</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting.  Received as expected.</li>
            <li> I got an old injector razor on an auction site and needed replacement blades for it.  This four pack is a great value.  The mechanism slides the new blade in easily and simultaneously ejects the old blade for disposal into a sharps container.  These blades give a great shave.  It&#x27;s reassuring to go with name brand blades for optimum consistency.</li>
            <li> i,ve tried 2,3,4, bladed razors and thay all suck. My 40 year old Shick adjustable worked just fine but I could not find the blades anymore until I tried online.I,am a happy shaver again Thanks.</li>
            <li> Its the only way to go since I just started a mustache and beard and I recalled this injector blade from years ago. I&#x27;m just glad I found it on Amazon. Its really great when &amp;#34;trimming Up.&amp;#34;  Thanks for carrying thus rare item. I could not find it in locap stores., john</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy I found these blades online. He had searched local stores and no one had this product. He now can use his favorite old-style razor!</li>
            <li> Arival Time was short. Could not find blade in any store. Just what I needed. Razor is about 30 years old,I love it. My kids tured me on to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very  good, sharp blades as usual,worked  fine.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an old-fashioned shaver ( mug and brush, or aerosol) and you like the simple shaving blade, then these are for you.  no quadruple, flexing, floating,etc.  just a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> This is an old sryle razor that delivers an outstanding shave.  The injectors are difficult to find in most retail outlets.  It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to get the injectors from AMAZON.  I will continue to get my injector blades on-line.</li>
            <li> These are the very best razor blades that have ever been made, I dont know why shick dont start making the injector razors again, and put the blades back on the store shelfs, It seems to me they have modernized themselfs almost out of business, They should have just kept it simple!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, works well, good price.</li>
            <li> Not seconds, as sharp as store bought.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I ordered and they came in just a short time. It was great!! I&#x27;ll order more when I need them.</li>
            <li> My order came as expected and everything was correct. I am 100% satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these for years but, for some some reason, this batch&#x27;s blades are extremely dull.  Unsure what is different or has changed since the package looks the same.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> These things are as hard to find as tits on an ant.  I had a problem with the multiple blade razor that seemed to clog up with hair chips.  I could not get the chips out between the blades and would have to throw it away and get another razor blade.  With only one blade it&#x27;s now easy to clean out the chips.  Thank goodness I kept my old razor from when I was younger.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a very short period of time, and it was exactly what we were looking for!</li>
            <li> I have used schick injector blades since I was in Vietnam, in fact it is the same razor. I cannot find these blades in the store anymore.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these blades for YEARS.  We&#x27;ve been married for 25 years and he&#x27;s been using them since before we got married.  The blades themselves are very good quality and unlike many razor blades, each blades lasts a very long time.  You can&#x27;t find them in stores, so my husband was using each blade forever trying to make them last, when we found them on Amazon.  Hooray!  Now we have a ready supply and the price is good.  Not only that, we have them on subscribe and save so we save even more money &amp; have them delivered at our convenience.  Good product.  Good service Amazon!</li>
            <li> I like these injector razors so much better than using the modern multiblade razors that like to clog up too easily. Can&#x27;t make up my mind if I like these injectors best or the old double edge safety razors so I switch back and forth.</li>
            <li> Glad to find a source for my favorite razor blades which I have been using for more than fifty years.</li>
            <li> Great razors good sharp work good for me</li>
            <li> The packaging says Schick Injector blades but they don&#x27;t cut like the Schick blades I have used for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> Schick injector blades fit my Schick razor.  What makes this combination unique is that I can see through the opening between the blade in the razor and the bottom guide of the razor, making it easy to align the blade along the bottom of my sideburns and get a square trim.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> They always meet or exceed my expectations</li>
            <li> Been using forever. Could not find them. Came perfectly.</li>
            <li> The Schick Injector blades was exactly what I needed.  The only problem was from the description I did not know how much I was getting.  The amount was correct however.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> looked for these in the store, so happy to find them online.  these are my dad&#x27;s favorite kind of razor and he was extremely happy to find them again.</li>
            <li> Usingh them for years.</li>
            <li> My husband has used these forever and was unable to find them in stores either in Michigan or Florida or any where else we were shopping.  He was happpy I was able to find them on your site</li>
            <li> I threw my husband&#x27;s old injector blades away, Big mistake! Ordered these to replace my misdeed. He is a little happier. Says the blades work well.</li>
            <li> This four pack is about the best package and best price on Amazon. If  this is your shaver, this is the what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor companies introduce a new shaving gimmick every few years. Lately its been more \\&quot;blades\\&quot; - in fact ever tinier stripes of ever thinner metal. Always cheaper construction and less usable life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point you will be asked to buy a blade covered glove because only 97 blades can possibly keep you chin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that travelers to more remote places can tell the point when that location opened to the world market by which legacy shaving gear is in the shops. That is, a company will not just start with its most recent design, there will be more sales if they run the new customers through the older versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago, my then favorite shaver went off market. There was no internet to search for remote sources so I moved to the Injector. Like others here, I find it works well. The old razor may have years in it yet, but I hope you can help me find a new one.[...], and Please send a comment if you have a source.</li>
            <li> I used the Schick Injector system for about 30 years and was very happy. About 10 years ago the blades began disappearing from stores, and my wife couldn&#x27;t find them anymore. (She does the shopping for this kind of thing.) So I reluctantly switched to Trac II decades after they came out, and I now prefer them to injector blades. They shave smoother with fewer passes over the same rough area. While I fondly remember my injector system, I won&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, history is repeating itself. Trac II blades are disappearing from stores, so I&#x27;m buying them from Amazon now. Maybe I&#x27;ll switch to triples in 5 or 10 years. In other words, I only buy tried-and-true shaving products decades after they are introduced. I think I&#x27;ll try this method when I buy my next computer.</li>
            <li> I have the blades now I need to find the razor. I will keep on looking. mike.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the number of shaves per blade. I could easily get 15 to 20 shaves per blade with the original. I&#x27;m lucky if I get 4 or 5 with these blades.</li>
            <li> I have used my Shick Injector razor for years but could not find replacement blades in any store locally. I was very happy to find them on Amazon. Now my old trusty razor gives me the great shaves I grew up with. I tried the newer multi blade razors but they soon clogged making them very un-effective and a pain to use. I am very happy with these blades.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS AS THERE IS NO BETTER BLADESMADE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD</li>
            <li> My husband had an old injector shaver that he loved and I made his day when I was able to get him replacement blades. Thank you Amazon !</li>
            <li> My husband really likes these blades but he can&#x27;t find them any where else, so he is very happy that he can get them here. Thank you very much. He says they really work for him when he shaves and that it is a good product. It was our son who found the injector blades on your sight. We really like the price too and would recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for years and I am so glad I found them on amazon.com. If you want a clean smooth shave, I highly recommend the schick injector blade.</li>
            <li> Must have Schick blades for my Schick razor. Great shave with a great razor and blades!</li>
            <li> They were what we expected. He has used that brand for over forty years.</li>
            <li> fast delivery I like it&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THESE BLADES FOR APPROXIAMATELY 60 YEARS AND DO NOT WANT TO CHANGE UNLESS THEY ARE NOT MADE ANYMORE.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> The only razor I can use to shave with is a single edge. All of the double and higher just gum up with wiskers. They  are not good for someone with a tuff or strong beard.</li>
            <li> Got into traditional DE shaving a couple of years ago and finally tried an SE Schick Injector.  Very nice shaves and these blades seem great.  Only downside I see is that I can only get maybe 1 to 2 more shaves from these than I can from a DE blade which costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> Schnick Injector Blades use to be of high quality and was number one when the razors were commonly used.  The blades have burrs on them and can cut easily.</li>
            <li> Was gift for father inlaw.He had this razor since the 50&#x27;s.Can not find the blades in stores.Amazon came through.He was very happy that I found them for him</li>
            <li> Not as good of a edge holding as the persona blades</li>
            <li> fast delivery and was as advertized. Bought it for my father because he doesn&#x27;t want to use any other razor , he says these are the best.</li>
            <li> I do not like paying over $3.50 for a shaving cartridge. Tried and true, simplistic and a great shave! I just wish they would bring back their razor to go along with these blades. Like it says on the back of the box a clean smooth comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> I learned to shave with a &#x27;Dutch Twin&#x27; straight razor, when I got to Marine Recruit Depot at San Diego, during WW2 the DI&#x27;s made me sent my razor home, in my &#x27;Bucket&#x27; was a Schick Razor, which has to be the best razor design ever made, I&#x27;ve worn out my first one and working on the second one now. But Amazon is the only place I could find blades.</li>
            <li> The only blades my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Have recently decided to try some of the razor blades I used in the past, before new technology made shaving a major expense.&lt;br /&gt;With a good shaving soap and lather I wonder why I ever stopped using good single blades.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m back.</li>
            <li> Was just what my husband wanted&lt;br /&gt;Received in very quickly time. Was very pleased</li>
            <li> More than not, the blades are dull and can&#x27;t be used. I thought buying the actual Schick brand, rather than a generic, would make a positive difference. It did not. Every blade I throw away, unused, is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like buying a whole razor for one blade usage, and I got tired of having the multiple rows of blades becoming clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went back to the injector blades.  The used blades are stored in the back of the dispenser.  When they are all used up, I put the dispenser in recycle metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not so happy with the volume of packaging for the injector blades, but I can recycle the cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting accustomed to using the injector blades again is a little tricky, but not much.  You can cut yourself if you aren&#x27;t careful, but just a little care can avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, to maximize the blade life, I dry the blade after each use by dobbing it on a towel.  A consumer program recommended doing this for all blades.</li>
            <li> over priced ,but needed.</li>
            <li> Hard to find. Perfect fit</li>
            <li> My husband swears by these!</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find these injector blades on Amazon...they&#x27;re getting scarce.  They&#x27;re the only kind my husband will use.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and with the service provided.!!! for sure I will buy this  item again.</li>
            <li> SCHICK INJECTOR BLADES using my father for 35 years.&lt;br /&gt;Can not find turkey last ten years. Father&#x27;s Day will be very happy. I guess I will start using SCHICK INJECTOR BLADES</li>
            <li> this is a great way to buy blades.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping would buy again Thank You</li>
            <li> quick service and good product</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a Shick razor for years but was unable to find the appropriate injector blades.  Not until I found them on Amazon has he had a better shave.  He loves the fact that you carry them!  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> ..love my old injector razor. These are the standard good-quality blades. (Says I need six, now five more words just one more... Such arcane rules!)</li>
            <li> Love and will buy again!1</li>
            <li> they have not improved on the single-edge razor.  It is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Three blades, 4, 5... does not matter--they are inferior, do not stay sharp,&lt;br /&gt;do not shave around mouth or under nose-- go with the single-edge&lt;br /&gt;razor!</li>
            <li> I have been ordering these for several years; they fit my old razor which I love. These are always a much better price especially when I buy in bulk. Thank you for a hard to find item!</li>
            <li> when you want a close shave, you can&#x27;t beat this product.  i suffered from ingrown hairs after shaving with the double and tripple blades.  doctor suggested i try a single edge blade, that cut the hair once, at skin level, and did not drag hair out and cut it, and then the hair would grow under the skin,  which equals ingrown hair, hair bump, what ever you want to call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this single blade cuts close and helps prevent facial problems related to shaving</li>
            <li> Great product,&lt;br /&gt;I have always used this product. But can now only get it on line.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep this item available.</li>
            <li> My Schick adjustable injector razor still performs well for me, so I&#x27;m sticking with it as long as I can find blade cartridges for it.  I like to buy them in bulk for additional savings.</li>
            <li> The blades are as good as the ones that you pay lots more money for.</li>
