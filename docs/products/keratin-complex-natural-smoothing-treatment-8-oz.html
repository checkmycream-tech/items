    <ol>
            <li> This keratin is applied very differently than the other treatments I&#x27;ve worked with, so follow the directions! The results were beautiful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s contain formaldehyde</li>
            <li> I received a different product with different label and bad results in my hair</li>
            <li> I have done the Brazilian several times. I like this much better. No smell. Took out my frizz, but my hair could hold some curl.</li>
            <li> Waste of money... Doesn&#x27;t do anything... I used to purchase this brand ( or when it had Coppola on it) and it used to be great and very effective ... Now same smell and product texture but totally ineffective!!!!</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job. I used it today for the second time and it worked better this time. It straighten my hair and was easy to put on but I have used other Keratin products before so knew kinda what I was doing.  I would use Softliss if I could find it. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> If you have frizzy, thick curly hair this is the best treatment you can splurge yourself to. It will eliminate about 95% of the curl and frizz. Keratin restores and restructures hair. By infusing (letting product sit and flat ironing it in) the keratin goes deep onto the damaged cuticle and your hair will come out silky smooth and shiny. It also penetrates the hair follicle with a keratinous bond to promote healing. I normally buy the 16 ounce bottle because I use about 3 to 4 ounces per application since my hair is very dense. It can last up to 3 to 5 months depending on how often you wash your hair. I am not a professional hairdresser and did not want to spend $400 to get this done in a salon. The bottle does NOT come with detailed instructions, just a brief overview printed on it. I was able to find more detailed instructions online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Dry, brittle, over-processed hair should be pre-conditioned prior to treatment. I used the [[ASIN:B00375L8JC Coppola Keratin Complex Vanilla Bean Deep Conditione]]. After shampooing my hair and towel drying, I applied the conditioner, put on a plastic cap and sat under a hair dryer for 20 minutes. Rinse only ONCE with a clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are NOT pre-conditioning your hair prior to treatment, you are to shampoo with a clarifying shampoo two times for chemically treated hair, three times for virgin, coarse, resistant or gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Blow dry until your hair is 100% dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Shake bottle well. Pour 2-3 oz. of Keratin Complex Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment solution into a bowl. Let the solution sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes. I usually let the solution sit while I am blow drying my hair. Using gloves, apply to hair with a brush using 1/2\\&quot; sections. Keep product away from scalp but try to get it as close as possible. Comb through every section with a fine tooth comb until hair is completely saturated. Do not over saturate the hair, it should not be dripping. If there is any solution collected on the comb, wipe the excess off with a towel. Make sure that the solution is evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Place hair in plastic cap such as [[ASIN:B002HWS7RM Diane Processing Caps]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. For chemically treated or damaged hair, allow hair to absorb solution for 20 minutes. For very resistant, coarse hair, allow hair to absorb solution for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. After the solution has absorbed for the specific time period, blow dry hair on medium or high heat with a paddle brush/vent brush until it is 100% dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. With a heat resistant comb, divide hair into 4 to 6 sections depending on length and density of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Using a 450 degree flat iron, start at the nape of the neck taking 1/8 inch sections. The sections should be small enough that you should be able to see your hand through the hair. Slowly move the iron from root to ends 5-7 times (7-10 times for extremely curly, coarse hair) infusing the keratin into the hair shaft. For chemically treated or damaged hair reduce heat to 420-430 degrees and pay special attention to not over iron the ends. If you have a heat safe resistance glove such as this: [[ASIN:B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron]]. Your hair will get really, really hot and may burn your hand and fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. After 3 days or 72 hours, hair should be washed with a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. You can pretty much use any conditioner you want since most conditioners do not have sulfrates in them. I suggest [[ASIN:B0036QQWAC Pureology Hydrate Shampoo 8.5oz and Hydrate Conditioner duo]]. DO NOT USE clips, handbands, place your hair behind your ears or pull it up in a pony tail during the 72 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will come out frizz free, extremely shiny and healthier. Blow drying time is cut in half and I normally do not even have to use a flat iron for retouch except for my bangs. When I let my hair dry naturally, my hair comes out with a soft wave that has no frizz. When it is necessary to have the treatment done again, it is applied to the entire head just like before. Build-up of keratin will improve you hair shaft giving lifeless dull hair a healthier feel and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coppola uses Aldehyde which is a derivative of formaldehyde. My eyes did sting a little bit when I applied the product to the front of my head but it did not cause me to be nauseous or light headed. Using a flat iron on high temperatures can cause evaporation of aldehyde or sulfurous fumes when applied to the hair. Use the product in a well ventilated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can color your hair the same day prior to doing the Coppola Keratin Smoothing Treatment. It will actually seal in the color, making it last longer. Otherwise, you will have to wait to color your hair 2 weeks after applying the keratin treatment. Just apply the color like you normally do and use the clarifying shampoo ONCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over three years now and will never try anything else now.

            <li> I Love my Keratin Treatment. Very good product to use. Wounder whether it would stand up to the coppola treatment that I previously used and it did!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, but product doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well since its name change. The formula must have been changed as well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> Works just as great as the one with Coppola used to if not better. Still no bad smells or crazy fumes. Actually no fumes at all. Will always choose this provider!</li>
            <li> Product is authentic! Fast ship packed great. Thank you. I will be back!</li>
            <li> Is a real good product</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I expected.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using keratin for more than 5 years now. I started doing my own treatment at home for 4 years. I used to use the old formula (coppola brand) and it was amazing, and let me tell you the texture was thick. After that when the formula was changed, I went ahead and gave it a try. At first it was okay (the first bottle I purchased) my mum, sister in maw and I used it and the results were okay (although it didn&#x27;t have the same thick texture as coppola had). After we finished the bottle we though about buying a new one so each of us bough one. Two 8oz&#x27;s and a 16oz, and I wish we never did!! The products (in the three bottles) was so watery that ut was very hard to apply it on our hair (which made us use more product, actually more than half the 8oz bottle) but we still did it anyway and we waited for the results. When we washed our hairs it actually looked pretty good, but in 2 weeks the product was gone!!! I mean isn&#x27;t it supposed to stay for 3 months or more! Belfre it used to last for 4-6 months with me and it used to last almost a year with my sister in law!! I&#x27;m really disappointed and I won&#x27;t be purchasing it ever again it&#x27;s terrible and now our money is wasted!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It gave me the same results as a treatment in the salon.  I have thick curly hair with the frizzies and this tamed it all.  I am at 5 weeks and still looks good.  I can get 3 uses out of one bottle which saves me a lot of money.  I just ordered a second bottle, both were delivered quickly.  I will continue ordering.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I just did the back at the nape of the neck.  If it was going to go horribly wrong I would at least be able to conceal the evidence.  It made my hair much smoother with less frizz.  I was pleased.  I used it the second time yesterday.  Did the whole head this time.  What a difference.  My hair is smooth and soft.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This product is so healthy for your hair.  Straightens the curliest of hair.  I have been using it since Dec. of 2008.</li>
