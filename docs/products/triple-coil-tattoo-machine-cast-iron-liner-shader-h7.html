            <li>it&#x27;s good for packing in color.</li>
            <li>i bought this one because i collect tattoo machines that i think look Good, and this one also works good.</li>
            <li>You got a 50/50 chance to get a good gun</li>
            <li>There is a reason good machines don&#x27;t have 3 coils.  </li>
            <li>u think a shader and liner combo sounds good.</li>
            <li>one sounds good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and the weight is perfect</li>
            <li>Very easy to modify and tune to your liking, and if your fine with a bit of weight this is a great purchase!</li>

            <li>Great strongly recommend will order again</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s an amazing machine for shading.</li>
            <li>Between our 2 apartments, we own 3 of these machines.</li>
            <li>it lays in ink really nice.</li>
            <li>it lays color nicely</li>
            <li>The gun came on time, it looked and felt nice.</li>
            <li>I have my own shop and have built my own machines.  </li>
            <li>than that, great price, great machine, 3 coils make sure it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>This new one works great!</li>
            <li>Thor is a great buy and it was shipped quickly</li>
            <li>very strong.</li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH I DIDN&#x27;T USE IT, I KNOW THE SOUND OF A GOOD MACHINE</li>
            <li>Nice solid machine, runs great and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>More garbage.</li>
            <li>So, I love mine and just thought I&#x27;d share.</li>
            <li>So, okay. :)</li>
            <li>and it looks a hell of a lot better than the one I made at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li>This is an OK Machine.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>I ordered this out of curiousity more than anything.  </li>
            <li>but Durable.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shading seems to be better</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I ordered it...</li>
            <li>She loved it from the point she saw it was her first triple coil.</li>
            <li>itd be pretty good buy to up my business</li>
            <li>Honestly you have nothing to lose here, sounds fantastic and works great at low volt levels.</li>
            <li>nice powerful stroke</li>
            <li>Quality control could be a bit better guys! ;-)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a machine that puts the color in great the first pass!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got some weight to it though, but is easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>now its really strong.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is it looks nice.</li>
            <li>the gun is so strong that a 5 hour job will bend the spring for word</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this machine is cheap as</li>
            <li>I will enjoy inflicting pain</li>
            <li>it not only looks great</li>
            <li>it runs smooth and will take a beating</li>
            <li>Then machine runs smooth</li>
            <li>Makes it stable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great color packer., runs smooth, once tuned.</li>
            <li>I really liked this machine, I have used it for lining and shading,runs nice at low power and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of heavy but still works great....</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>leaves clean outlines.</li>
            <li>Its solidly constructed and all the parts are good quality.</li>
            <li>Looks cool.</li>
            <li>~~~ WILL PURCHASE AGAIN FAST SHIPPING :)))</li>
            <li>i think she will love it as much as i do ...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s good quality, solid parts in it.</li>
            <li>so it was flat needed a fair amount of adjustments and got it to where it is a prestine machine at 8.1 volts as a liner</li>
            <li>For the price this machine works very well and has become my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several great machines on Amazon; in fact, the pink $8 gun that looks like a G i got for my girl runs alot better.</li>
            <li>This machine out-performs many basic cheap alternatives.</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll worth it</li>
            <li>on top of being way too heavy,its way too loud for no reason,and after just one tat,the coils shorted out.would not recommend this trash to anybody.they</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>shipping was pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li>It started right up</li>
            <li>I need to make a lot of adjustments to get it to run right.</li>
            <li>It just won&#x27;t hit right....</li>
            <li>Better keep ur tool near the whole time!</li>
            <li>it a bit heavy but not bad good seller</li>
            <li>very heavy in the hand, idont think its great at all</li>
            <li>like the gun very much I have turned it</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time tonite and have NO complaints about this machine.</li>
            <li>Thanks Monster Point!</li>
            <li>capacitor blew first tattoo  </li>
            <li>I read a review about it not getting hot.</li>
            <li>;-).  </li>
            <li>Came in 2 days, I really like this machine, definitely worth it</li>
            <li>good solid machine, however, I needed to re-adjust some stuff (as in filing the springs) to get the contact points right above the coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wires break loose very easily.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe what a good deal this was it runs smooth and cool a little heavy but not bad</li>
            <li>IT RUNS SUPER SMOOTH WITH MINOR TUNING.</li>
            <li>I was really intrigued when i first saw this machine, so i just had to have it</li>
            <li>Nice solid lines, sort of light (suprisingly) and not much vibration.</li>
            <li>highly recommended if you want a machine that gets the ink in right ...</li>
            <li>I am really glad i decided to get it, after the usual fine adjustments here</li>
            <li>The extra weight is fairly easy to get used to as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this on pure novelty alone.</li>
            <li>At the very least it is a great conversation piece.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is a great company,they stand behind there product.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really got to use it yet</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve gone over very thoroughly</li>
            <li>and it packs in color very well.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really tweak it much the gap between the coils is and the armature bar is off.  </li>
            <li>nice heavy weight.</li>
            <li>After having some problems with the first one that came in I contacted the seller and after talking for over a week he sent a new one.</li>
            <li>Was very excited to use it the day I got it and was very let down.</li>
            <li>it thought seeing decent stars</li>
            <li>yet I did find it pretty easy to get it humming just messing around with a few adjustments.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this machine for anyone.</li>
            <li>The thing I like most about this machine is that it sounds professional, it \\&quot;hums\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;clak\\&quot;, also it is an efficient machine and plays well with other equipment.</li>
            <li>Was hesitant because of mixed reviews but bought anyway because for the price it could be a paperweight and be worth it.</li>
            <li>i am ordering a few more</li>
            <li>and i needed a new shader anyway.</li>
            <li>We bought a new power box thinking the box was the issue since we had to keep turning it up, but it was not.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave this product 3 out of five stars is due to adjustments needed to rear spring.right out the box you can see that armature bar was not seated evenly level across from two coils,and it set too far forward off the coils.this was easily remedied by notching the rear spring</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a nice machine although heavy it shades well.</li>
            <li>, different power supplies will vary obviously, i use it as  a liner only, and it works great hard consistent hitting machine doesnt skip out, bogs as it should when making contact with the skin.</li>
            <li>so keep that in mind, the construction is quite heavy which is fine, the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t sit the best in hand, sort of awkward to hold but don&#x27;t let that change your mind, my hand probly isn&#x27;t the same as yours.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see it on Amazon but</li>
            <li>Fast service I purchased 3 machines one from here and 2 from another company at the same time off of amazon.</li>
            <li>and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been professional artist for 6 years.  </li>
            <li>but I use disposable tubes and u really have to squeeze the tube in the vice and I tried to open the vice with pliers but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a solid machine, it was ready to tattoo out of the package.</li>
            <li>Coils needed tightened and the back spring was creased unevenly so the contact with the coils was off but both were easy fixes.</li>
            <li>I sent it back to the company they sent me a new one</li>
            <li>this was done the machine hit hard and smooth for line and color</li>
            <li>Hopefully I can get it to work in the near future.</li>
            <li>So far not only this but also everything ive ordered on amazon has turned out well.</li>
            <li>by the way this machine was not as heavy or different to use as i thought it was going to be but on the other hand i do have big hands 5 stars all the way :)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use it for long sessions due to the weight (which is a logical thing based on the fact that it has 3 coils)</li>
            <li>then the first one and not as heavy</li>
            <li>First off i want to say if you have a few extra bucks and are on the fence about buying this gun, do it.</li>

            <li> on top of being way too heavy,its way too loud for no reason,and after just one tat,the coils shorted out.would not recommend this trash to anybody.they</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> shipping was pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li> It started right up</li>
            <li> I need to make a lot of adjustments to get it to run right.</li>
            <li> It just won&#x27;t hit right....</li>
            <li> Better keep ur tool near the whole time!</li>
            <li> it a bit heavy but not bad good seller</li>
            <li> very heavy in the hand, idont think its great at all</li>
            <li> like the gun very much I have turned it</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time tonite and have NO complaints about this machine.</li>
            <li> Thanks Monster Point!</li>
            <li> capacitor blew first tattoo  </li>
            <li> I read a review about it not getting hot.</li>
            <li> ;-).  </li>
            <li> Came in 2 days, I really like this machine, definitely worth it</li>
            <li> good solid machine, however, I needed to re-adjust some stuff (as in filing the springs) to get the contact points right above the coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wires break loose very easily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a good deal this was it runs smooth and cool a little heavy but not bad</li>
            <li> IT RUNS SUPER SMOOTH WITH MINOR TUNING.</li>
            <li> I was really intrigued when i first saw this machine, so i just had to have it</li>
            <li> Nice solid lines, sort of light (suprisingly) and not much vibration.</li>
            <li> highly recommended if you want a machine that gets the ink in right ...</li>
            <li> I am really glad i decided to get it, after the usual fine adjustments here</li>
            <li> The extra weight is fairly easy to get used to as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this on pure novelty alone.</li>
            <li> At the very least it is a great conversation piece.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a great company,they stand behind there product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really got to use it yet</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve gone over very thoroughly</li>
            <li> and it packs in color very well.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really tweak it much the gap between the coils is and the armature bar is off.  </li>
            <li> nice heavy weight.</li>
            <li> After having some problems with the first one that came in I contacted the seller and after talking for over a week he sent a new one.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to use it the day I got it and was very let down.</li>
            <li> it thought seeing decent stars</li>
            <li> yet I did find it pretty easy to get it humming just messing around with a few adjustments.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this machine for anyone.</li>
            <li> The thing I like most about this machine is that it sounds professional, it \\&quot;hums\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;clak\\&quot;, also it is an efficient machine and plays well with other equipment.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant because of mixed reviews but bought anyway because for the price it could be a paperweight and be worth it.</li>
            <li> i am ordering a few more</li>
            <li> and i needed a new shader anyway.</li>
            <li> We bought a new power box thinking the box was the issue since we had to keep turning it up, but it was not.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave this product 3 out of five stars is due to adjustments needed to rear spring.right out the box you can see that armature bar was not seated evenly level across from two coils,and it set too far forward off the coils.this was easily remedied by notching the rear spring</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a nice machine although heavy it shades well.</li>
            <li> , different power supplies will vary obviously, i use it as  a liner only, and it works great hard consistent hitting machine doesnt skip out, bogs as it should when making contact with the skin.</li>
            <li> so keep that in mind, the construction is quite heavy which is fine, the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t sit the best in hand, sort of awkward to hold but don&#x27;t let that change your mind, my hand probly isn&#x27;t the same as yours.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see it on Amazon but</li>
            <li> Fast service I purchased 3 machines one from here and 2 from another company at the same time off of amazon.</li>
            <li> and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been professional artist for 6 years.  </li>
            <li> but I use disposable tubes and u really have to squeeze the tube in the vice and I tried to open the vice with pliers but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a solid machine, it was ready to tattoo out of the package.</li>
            <li> Coils needed tightened and the back spring was creased unevenly so the contact with the coils was off but both were easy fixes.</li>
            <li> I sent it back to the company they sent me a new one</li>
            <li> this was done the machine hit hard and smooth for line and color</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can get it to work in the near future.</li>
            <li> So far not only this but also everything ive ordered on amazon has turned out well.</li>
            <li> by the way this machine was not as heavy or different to use as i thought it was going to be but on the other hand i do have big hands 5 stars all the way :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it for long sessions due to the weight (which is a logical thing based on the fact that it has 3 coils)</li>
            <li> then the first one and not as heavy</li>
            <li> First off i want to say if you have a few extra bucks and are on the fence about buying this gun, do it.</li>
            <li> I bought this machine a year and a half ago when I was new to tattooing.</li>
            <li> The Machine is heavy as expected and pretty sturdy in its built, the hardware is metric.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much this will limit the life of the machine but</li>
            <li> Got about a solid 2 hours of use and the wires broke loose causing the capacitor to pop.</li>
            <li> The spring is too long and pushes the needle foward against the tube.</li>
            <li> we will see actual contact surface area is limited to the front two coils only with only the edges making actual contact (not good).</li>
            <li> Vibrates itself loose way too often.</li>
            <li> The back coil was loose and wouldn&#x27;t tighten down.</li>
            <li> Then after a couple of months gun started to short and also could and other parts of the gun began to rust and unit was stored in dry place with 6 other guns</li>
            <li> I bought this machine and it out perform all my other one.</li>
            <li> no problem, you know I&#x27;m still waiting for my other two machines</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about the geometry being off and it causing problems and while I have not tattooed with this machine</li>
            <li> A 9 OUT 0F 10 DUE TO THE WEIGHT OF THE MACHINE.</li>
            <li> Not near as heavy as I figured and can sling some ink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by much</li>
            <li> My only complaint and the reason for three star review is the fact coil to needle bar contact alignment is off quite a bit (half) and there is no contact of the rear coil at all with no way to adjust it as the rear coil limits any bending or tweaking of the frame itself.</li>
            <li> I cut a 8 hour job down to 5</li>
            <li> I am planning to strip it down and have the frame powder coated black</li>
            <li> Broke down within a few days.</li>
            <li> a little heavy though so not good for long sessions</li>
            <li> but it still runs must have a heavy duty power supply.</li>
            <li> I believe it wa a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Durable AND heavy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heavy and will wear your arm out after a wile</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I can imagine it being a bit heavy for some people, but for me, I like the weight.</li>
            <li> made a few adjustments set it up and did a tat ...</li>
            <li> This is a soldi machine, i used it on a few tattoos.</li>
            <li> but this gun has fare past my expectations a few times</li>
            <li> I do sometimes think about getting a Polaco or Tommy&#x27;s machine for at least 3 bills just to have one, but this monster has never let me down you know.</li>
            <li> ITS HEAVY AND ITS HARD TO ADJUST</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> coils are really small.</li>
            <li> Could hardly get it to even take power.</li>
            <li> but if your hands are weak and scrawny this may not suit you.</li>
            <li> just cause I&#x27;m tired of chrome, but there you go.</li>
            <li> , chicks might find it heavy and awkward.</li>
            <li> Sorry but s***ty buy and wouldnt tell someone to buy it.</li>
            <li> so mad I bought</li>
            <li> i was shocked to see the quality of this machine for the money .</li>
            <li> that not gonna use Again highly disappointed</li>
            <li> so mad!</li>
            <li> it never worked a peice of crap lost my receipt</li>
            <li> Spotty, unreliable, crap.</li>
            <li> But its crap.</li>
            <li> worst machine i ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a Great Machine for a tattoo artist at any level. I will be buying another after thanksgiving. I used it for the first time tonite and have NO complaints about this machine. Note that you may need to tweek you power supply to accomodate your machine. Very Excellent machine. The extra weight is fairly easy to get used to as well. Tattoo artist 7 yrs experience.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a nice machine although heavy it shades well. My only complaint and the reason for three star review is the fact coil to needle bar contact alignment is off quite a bit (half) and there is no contact of the rear coil at all with no way to adjust it as the rear coil limits any bending or tweaking of the frame itself. Not sure how much this will limit the life of the machine but we will see actual contact surface area is limited to the front two coils only with only the edges making actual contact (not good). I just wish the one I received had the same alignment as the pictures here. Quality control could be a bit better guys! ;-)</li>
            <li> This machine out-performs many basic cheap alternatives. The thing I like most about this machine is that it sounds professional, it \\&quot;hums\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;clak\\&quot;, also it is an efficient machine and plays well with other equipment. Disposable tubes work wonders and standard tubes with twistlock grips feel like a dream while tattooing. Between our 2 apartments, we own 3 of these machines. Thanks Monster Point!</li>
            <li> ITS A PAPER WEIGHT SOUNDS LIKE A CHAINSAW THIS MACHINE IS JUST A LOOKER NOTHING FANCY AND ALTHOUGH I DIDN&#x27;T USE IT, I KNOW THE SOUND OF A GOOD MACHINE AND THIS ISN&#x27;T ONE. ITS HEAVY AND ITS HARD TO ADJUST I GAVE IT ONE EXTRA STAR FOR THE LOOK IT LOOKS GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S THE SELLER HASN&#x27;T REPLIED TO MY RETURN REQUEST</li>
            <li> I bought this machine and it out perform all my other one. This is the gun you wanna have I promise. And yes, I&#x27;m will be ordering another. Just because it&#x27;s so reliable. I don&#x27;t know if these guys plan on running out. Lol.</li>
            <li> This machine is wonderful, it has tons of power *which a \\&quot;stratcher\\&quot; should never use* love this gun!!!! Thor is a great buy and it was shipped quickly and I actually received it 3 days from when I ordered it!</li>
            <li> capacitor blew first tattoo  no capacitor but it still runs must have a heavy duty power supply. use only to color and its a beast</li>
            <li> More garbage. worst machine i ever used. Went to pieces on me. Please do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I really liked this machine, I have used it for lining and shading,runs nice at low power and its worked great set up both ways. Its solidly constructed and all the parts are good quality. I&#x27;m actually about to order another so I have one of each setup,  I think this is an excellent machine for the price. shipping was pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this machine is cheap as F*#%. I got mine when I started out five years ago. I changed out the springs for silver contact springs just because, and I have never had the need to get a second machine for any reason. I do sometimes think about getting a Polaco or Tommy&#x27;s machine for at least 3 bills just to have one, but this monster has never let me down you know. I am planning to strip it down and have the frame powder coated black just cause I&#x27;m tired of chrome, but there you go. I read a review about it not getting hot. Well if you turn up the power, twenty minutes into it, it will start cooking, so ya, keep an eye on your level. So, I love mine and just thought I&#x27;d share. I was surprised to see it on Amazon but just about everything&#x27;s on Amazon now except hookers.lol Anyway, it&#x27;s a man&#x27;s piece, chicks might find it heavy and awkward. So, okay. :)</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a great company,they stand behind there product. Fast service I purchased 3 machines one from here and 2 from another company at the same time off of amazon. I received my triple coil machine had problems some with it. I sent it back to the company they sent me a new one no problem, you know I&#x27;m still waiting for my other two machines HUMMM????.Black Label Tattoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was really intrigued when i first saw this machine, so i just had to have it and i needed a new shader anyway. I am really glad i decided to get it, after the usual fine adjustments here and there runs like a dream. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the triple coil machine especially for the price.</li>
            <li> great gun. very strong. all i need to change is the metal contact that touches the adjustable bar. now its really strong. it lays in ink really nice. great for lining, and color. leaves clean outlines.</li>
            <li> it never worked a peice of crap lost my receipt so i kept it but a waiste of my time and money</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really got to use it yet but I&#x27;ve gone over very thoroughly and it looks a hell of a lot better than the one I made at a fraction of the price thank you I will enjoy inflicting pain</li>
            <li> this machine is a beast. nice powerful stroke and it packs in color very well. a little heavy though so not good for long sessions</li>
            <li> Broke down within a few days. I was not satisfied at all. I believe it wa a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This is an OK Machine. Durable AND heavy. Can&#x27;t use it for long sessions due to the weight (which is a logical thing based on the fact that it has 3 coils) it&#x27;s good for packing in color. Recommended as a backup machine.</li>
            <li> Could hardly get it to even take power. Spotty, unreliable, crap. I was very excited when I ordered it... But its crap. The only good thing is it looks nice. Looks cool. But thats it.</li>
            <li> i bought this one because i collect tattoo machines that i think look Good, and this one also works good. It&#x27;s kind of heavy but still works great....</li>
            <li> Hooked this machine up and it doesnt work. Messed with the contact screw to see sparks and sputtering. Was very excited to use it the day I got it and was very let down. Hopefully I can get it to work in the near future.</li>
            <li> Great gun it lays color nicely it not only looks great it runs smooth and will take a beating it&#x27;s heavy and will wear your arm out after a wile but we&#x27;ll worth it I cut a 8 hour job down to 5 the only thing I&#x27;d recommend is changing the springs the gun is so strong that a 5 hour job will bend the spring for word a set of ringmaster or mob iron springs makes it runs like a dream 5 stars I&#x27;m not impressed by much but this gun has fare past my expectations a few times</li>
            <li> The gun came on time, it looked and felt nice. It started right up BUT.... The gun wasnt designed to run well. The frame was off and tweeked a bit. Anytime a put a needle in it would bend my needle and wouldnt allow it to run. After adjusting it it still would work well. The eye hole for your tube and needle to go threw was to low on the frame. Sorry but s***ty buy and wouldnt tell someone to buy it. You got a 50/50 chance to get a good gun</li>
            <li> awesome gun... looks better than the pics they show ... I have not tried it yet but i will soon</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my tattoo artist. She loved it from the point she saw it was her first triple coil. Set up was easy and machine worked great . Then after a couple of months gun started to short and also could and other parts of the gun began to rust and unit was stored in dry place with 6 other guns and this was only one to do that not gonna use Again highly disappointed</li>
            <li> There is a reason good machines don&#x27;t have 3 coils.  It throws off the balance. And makes you have to adjust everything about it.  I would never buy this machine. And you people need to stop calling them guns.  It&#x27;s a tattoo machine.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave this product 3 out of five stars is due to adjustments needed to rear spring.right out the box you can see that armature bar was not seated evenly level across from two coils,and it set too far forward off the coils.this was easily remedied by notching the rear spring so it could slide farther back on the saddle ,and also by twisting rear spring with needle nose pliers so armature hits both font coils evenly.once this was done the machine hit hard and smooth for line and color work.would definitely recommend to friends</li>
            <li> This machine is GREAT for shading, I love it I would recommend this to anyone who wants a machine that puts the color in great the first pass!</li>
            <li> so mad I bought it thought seeing decent stars itd be pretty good buy to up my business but it doesn&#x27;t run n doesn&#x27;t come with allen wrenches to adjust it n I threw my last kit away im so mad! Don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> I need to make a lot of adjustments to get it to run right. coils are really small. and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> if your buying this bc u think a shader and liner combo sounds good. dont it doesnt work as a shader, it wont run for me below 7.1 volts and that damages skin contrary to what you&#x27;ve heard it does, i reset the post screw so it was flat needed a fair amount of adjustments and got it to where it is a prestine machine at 8.1 volts as a liner, different power supplies will vary obviously, i use it as  a liner only, and it works great hard consistent hitting machine doesnt skip out, bogs as it should when making contact with the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this on pure novelty alone. The Machine is heavy as expected and pretty sturdy in its built, the hardware is metric. I have read other reviews about the geometry being off and it causing problems and while I have not tattooed with this machine yet I did find it pretty easy to get it humming just messing around with a few adjustments. I don&#x27;t yet know that I will ever use this machine, but I do believe one could if one was so implied. ;-).  I would recommend for anyone looking to add a &amp;#34;Triple&amp;#34; Coil machine to their collection. At the very least it is a great conversation piece.</li>
            <li> Nice solid machine, runs great and feels good in your hand. Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> like the gun very much I have turned it one sounds good have not used it yet but I think I will&lt;br /&gt;like it a bit heavy but not bad good seller</li>
            <li> For the price this machine works very well and has become my new favorite! It&#x27;s so smooth and the weight is perfect</li>
            <li> IT RUNS SUPER SMOOTH WITH MINOR TUNING. VERY GOOD MACHINE FOR SHADING AWESOME FOR OUTLINING AS WELL I RATE IT A 9 OUT 0F 10 DUE TO THE WEIGHT OF THE MACHINE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been professional artist for 6 years.  I have my own shop and have built my own machines.  I ordered this out of curiousity more than anything.  You can&#x27;t really tweak it much the gap between the coils is and the armature bar is off.  I changed the front and back springs out with a couple different kinds that had at the shop. It just won&#x27;t hit right.... this is for some kitchen table scratcher to use. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> After having some problems with the first one that came in I contacted the seller and after talking for over a week he sent a new one. This new one works great! You can tell it&#x27;s a lot different then the first one and not as heavy but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Vibrates itself loose way too often. Better keep ur tool near the whole time!</li>
            <li> Worked as it should. The weight was perfect for my but if your hands are weak and scrawny this may not suit you.</li>
            <li> I bought this machine a year and a half ago when I was new to tattooing. Out of all the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; machines I bought all have proven to be trash except for this machine. She&#x27;s an amazing machine for shading.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancee and about 6 months after he got it it stopped working. Or it would start jumping. We bought a new power box thinking the box was the issue since we had to keep turning it up, but it was not. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> upon arrival i opened the package, came in a lil cardboard box. nice heavy weight. cast iron great. the front spring i like a lot. machine runs great. feels great in my hand with a 1\\&quot; lock grip. performs great. never felt any heat from it. about to order a second one since you can tune for lining and shading. versatile buy. best value in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Then machine runs smooth but I use disposable tubes and u really have to squeeze the tube in the vice and I tried to open the vice with pliers but that has just worn the metal soon it will prob break the metal after a while so that&#x27;s why I give it a 3 star</li>
            <li> Yes its a good machine and works wonderful</li>
            <li> I advise against buying this machine. When i received it, it would not run at all. The back coil was loose and wouldn&#x27;t tighten down. After inspection i realized that the hole on the frame was threaded. After drilling it out and readjusting EVERYTHING it ran superb. Until i set it up. The spring is too long and pushes the needle foward against the tube. I&#x27;ve bought several great machines on Amazon; in fact, the pink $8 gun that looks like a G i got for my girl runs alot better.</li>
            <li> Once again Amazon did a great job I can&#x27;t believe what a good deal this was it runs smooth and cool a little heavy but not bad</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this machine for anyone. Nice solid lines, sort of light (suprisingly) and not much vibration. all in all great machine great price.</li>
            <li> This machine is great,runs great, doesnt stall at all puts the ink with no problem.Im definitely lookin foward to purshase me another on.So far not only this but also everything ive ordered on amazon has turned out well.Now most of my shopping is done here at amazon!Quality items at the best prices,no competition!</li>
            <li> First off i want to say if you have a few extra bucks and are on the fence about buying this gun, do it. I saw tripple coil and knew i had to try it, i&#x27;m not dissapointed. Obviously this isn&#x27;t a 400 dollar gun so keep that in mind, the construction is quite heavy which is fine, the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t sit the best in hand, sort of awkward to hold but don&#x27;t let that change your mind, my hand probly isn&#x27;t the same as yours. Delivery was prompt, i ordered it on the 6th and have it in hand here on the 8th (using amazon prime) Honestly you have nothing to lose here, sounds fantastic and works great at low volt levels. I&#x27;ve got 7 guns and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t stall at low volts. Very easy to modify and tune to your liking, and if your fine with a bit of weight this is a great purchase! Have fun!</li>
            <li> Heavier and bigger,&lt;br /&gt;Low-power.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not like the hybrid. but Durable.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shading seems to be better&lt;br /&gt;Will need to custom</li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s bf ordered this for her so he can teach her how to do tats. this was girlish style and color. he was impressed with it and got it within a week</li>
            <li> Perfection! Verrrrry happy with this gun.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant because of mixed reviews but bought anyway because for the price it could be a paperweight and be worth it. It arrived on schedule. Coils needed tightened and the back spring was creased unevenly so the contact with the coils was off but both were easy fixes. It was easy to tune for both lining and shading and works great. Not near as heavy as I figured and can sling some ink. Would recommend to experienced artists. Newbies don&#x27;t need the power or weight in their hands lol.</li>
            <li> good solid machine, however, I needed to re-adjust some stuff (as in filing the springs) to get the contact points right above the coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, great price, great machine, 3 coils make sure it doesn&#x27;t get hot. I can imagine it being a bit heavy for some people, but for me, I like the weight. Makes it stable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great color packer., runs smooth, once tuned.</li>
            <li> Great strongly recommend will order again</li>
            <li> This thing can sling some ink very well built frame is solid kinda heavy for a gun but what do u expect its a triple coil still using this gun bought it about 8 months ago</li>
            <li> CHEAPLY MADE!!!! Do not buy this product! Wires break loose very easily. Got about a solid 2 hours of use and the wires broke loose causing the capacitor to pop.</li>
            <li> AWESOME BUY ~~~ WILL PURCHASE AGAIN FAST SHIPPING :)))</li>
            <li> on top of being way too heavy,its way too loud for no reason,and after just one tat,the coils shorted out.would not recommend this trash to anybody.they have an awesome machine for 13 bucks (10 lap) already ordered 2.best machines ever.made by atsuno2.</li>
            <li> i was shocked to see the quality of this machine for the money . i opened the box  made a few adjustments set it up and did a tat ... i am ordering a few more i want a extra for me and one for a fellow tattoo artist friend of mine i think she will love it as much as i do ... highly recommended if you want a machine that gets the ink in right ... by the way this machine was not as heavy or different to use as i thought it was going to be but on the other hand i do have big hands 5 stars all the way :)</li>
            <li> This is a soldi machine, i used it on a few tattoos. it&#x27;s a solid machine, it was ready to tattoo out of the package. it&#x27;s got some weight to it though, but is easy to get used to. worth the price, it&#x27;s good quality, solid parts in it. works best as a liner but has no problem shading and coloring. it packs the ink in the skin well, i had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> very heavy in the hand, idont think its great at all i adjusted constantly i gave&lt;br /&gt;it away i was dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Came in 2 days, I really like this machine, definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Takes some tuning but hasnt stopped during use yet.</li>
