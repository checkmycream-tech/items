            <li>and it&#x27;s fabulous!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You are a company, you need to have good products to sell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll call again to complain, don&#x27;t know that it will do any good.     </li>
            <li>Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great with my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Great volumizer for fine hair</li>
            <li>This is a nice shampoo</li>
            <li>Smells nice though..</li>
            <li>not as good as original product&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think advertising to let people know what a great product it is would be more beneficial than changing it to save some money and as a result, making an inferior product that is no longer worth the $11 or $12 they&#x27;re asking for it.</li>
            <li>* Nexus Diametress, well it looks like the original was better for volume and people loved it.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I also tried anti-residue shampoos a couple of times to make sure.</li>
            <li>It kept their hair healthy and it was dependable.</li>
            <li>I used to love this product, used it for years.  </li>
            <li>I had not been able to find it anywhere in stores</li>
            <li>Love Nexus Volume shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker with more body with this shampoo</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>shampoo is ok</li>
            <li>It has strengthened for many years.</li>
            <li>You get the impression that something costly in the ingredients was reduced or removed and it performs more like that five dollar shampoo you can buy at the discount store.</li>
            <li>My favorite poo.</li>
            <li>so was very excited when I found it online.</li>
            <li>They insisted they market tested the new Diametress and it got great reviews.</li>
            <li>They insisted they market tested the new Diametress and it got great reviews.</li>
            <li>People stuck with Nexxus for a very good reason earlier.</li>
            <li>One of the great things about the old formula was the light, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>The volume gel works fine, but did not like the waxy feel of the volume mousse&lt;</li>
            <li>It cleans the hair very well and rinses off nicely</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I have to use a spray in conditioner after in order to make my hair manageable and control the fly aways.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, the new formulation is not a bad shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why Nexxus would change formulation on such a successful product.</li>
            <li>After I read some of the reviews for this shampoo, I thought maybe it really would make my hair feel thicker and have more body.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it did anything for my hair except clean it and give it a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>More detergent-like, not leaving hair as smooth and lustrous as the old formula.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;old&#x27; Diametress lather feels rich and silky and as if it&#x27;s making my hair better already.</li>
            <li>I have very baby fine yet plentiful hair and Diametress</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that works nearly as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is fuller, softer, more body, bouncier and easier to manage with the old one.</li>
            <li>My hair is fuller, softer, more body, bouncier and easier to manage with the old one.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Diametress for years, and I know whatever this company sent me is NOT the right stuff.  </li>
            <li>Those are good things, but I could have gotten them for a lot less money by using Suave.</li>
            <li>It does not work nearly as well for my type of fine hair.</li>
            <li>The new formulation has lost all of its original characteristics.</li>
            <li>People who have used this for years if not decades know exactly what that is.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t associate this with this shampoo at first.</li>
            <li>But these decisions come from higher up.</li>
            <li>I can only assume the people that were trying it out just wanted to appease the company and not be truthful about the shampoo.</li>
            <li>But these decisions come from higher up.</li>
            <li>I can only assume the people that were trying it out just wanted to appease the company and not be truthful about the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Might be I used too much hairspray when I used it the first time.</li>
            <li>to be sure, I waited to finish a whole bottle until reviewing in case it takes time for a new formulation to work properly.</li>
            <li>If Nexxus wants to change the formula then that is certainly up to them</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps my hair had accumulated too much residue and cleaned it with an anti-residue shampoo.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll have to really try now.</li>
            <li>first effect when I started to use this bottle was noticeable hair falling out (which has happened before when I have tried out new brands).</li>
            <li>When I styled my hair, it was more fly-away, not as manageable and not nearly as full.</li>
            <li>Yes, this new version appears much less richer than the version I&#x27;ve used from many years not.</li>
            <li>By looking at the review, I have decided NOT, I mean NOT to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>This ad needs to be updated to the new product as I assume Nexxus doesn&#x27;t make the older product anymore.</li>
            <li>Their old formula worked very well...</li>
            <li>Yes, I agree, the new product is only worth one star.</li>
            <li>Yes, I agree, the new product is only worth one star.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s in a new package.</li>
            <li>I tried the new one once and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;new&#x27; one lacked that feel.</li>
            <li>I have tried this new formula for over a month now and it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This is a new formulation with the same name now in light gray bottle (as opposed to the off-white/biege bottle earlier).</li>
            <li>It is simply not a premium shampoo anymore which justified the price earlier.</li>
            <li>She is a huge fan and states this does not weight down her hair.</li>
            <li>I compared the list of ingredients from the new bottle when I got home, with the &#x27;old&#x27; bottle and</li>
            <li>but so do so many shampoos at half or a third of the price.</li>
            <li>It is not even close to the old formulation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting to try it again when I&#x27;m not as busy.</li>
            <li>I have a list of the ingredients of the old Diametress.</li>
            <li>I have a list of the ingredients of the old Diametress.</li>
            <li>It works well as near as I can tell.</li>
            <li>Bring back the old Diametress, please!!!</li>
            <li>This shampoo works pretty well for fine and thin hair and helps add volume.  </li>
            <li>Different color design on label, but the same good shampoo for those of us with thin or thinning hair.</li>
            <li>expect as more people find this out and stop buying, it will move down in price along with the other products in the $4-$5 range.</li>
            <li>It really helps to add volume to thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Upon delivery it was not the same product but a new product that Nexxus is pushing</li>
            <li>Trying something new for my teenage daughter...</li>
            <li>* Hope they bring back the original or a Green product with no parabens</li>
            <li>But for my limp hair, it is worth if for the added &amp;#34;umph.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years and my hair is very fine and thin.</li>
            <li>I am affronted that they decided to sell this new formulation with the same branding and name and at the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave it too soft and it dooesn&#x27;t leave it too dry either.</li>
            <li>This new formula (Green Tea Extract) is NOT the same as the old Nexxus Diametress &amp;#34;Luscious&amp;#34; Volumizing Shampoo.</li>

            <li> The perfume has changed as well and this is not important for me but those who liked the old smell will be disappointed in this aspect as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s packaged differently and smells awful, which is really disappointing to me because I loved the smell of Diametress &amp; am now pregnant and very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> The ingredient list from the previous bottle is different so there is no doubt that the formulation has changed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw at least double the hair in my bathtub only after 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> not as volumizing as expected</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected despite the reviews given.  </li>
            <li> Nexxus really should go back to the old formula, this new shampoo is awful!</li>
            <li> And then the lathering feel was very different (feels thin and not very luxurious as the previous formulation).</li>
            <li> My hair appears slightly thicker and feels thicker.  </li>
            <li> It works, but your scalp gets a slight burning sensation while using.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is the \\&quot;New</li>
            <li> as described-a little smelly</li>
            <li> This and the conditioner together adds a crazy amount of volume to my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> when I saw the green tea in it, I knew they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I went to purchase it a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a knock-off or what,</li>
            <li> My heart sank when I saw that because it usually means they&#x27;ve been tampering with the ingredients.</li>
            <li> , you change them, dumb them down if you will, until you have an inferior product.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m forced to go looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, as the other reviewers have said, the formula changed and the new stuff is terrible!  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to buy in my area.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used it in the past, you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I was not really impressed</li>
            <li> Then, they reformulated it and it stinks.  </li>
            <li> It was really disappointing from the get go!</li>
            <li> But I was so disappointed when I used it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Someone at the company is making really bad decisions!</li>

            <li> Be careful.  The product increases the hair loss.  I saw at least double the hair in my bathtub only after 2 uses.  I discontinued to use both shampoo and conditioner.  If you want it I will sell you at half price almost new bottles</li>
            <li> I went in purchase this ... I too used for years ... when I saw the green tea in it, I knew they changed the formula. By looking at the review, I have decided NOT, I mean NOT to purchase this product. If Nexxus wants to change the formula then that is certainly up to them but they HAVE LOST a LOT of customers.</li>
            <li> as described-a little smelly</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. This is a new formulation with the same name now in light gray bottle (as opposed to the off-white/biege bottle earlier). It is not even close to the old formulation. The ingredient list from the previous bottle is different so there is no doubt that the formulation has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be sure, I waited to finish a whole bottle until reviewing in case it takes time for a new formulation to work properly. I also tried anti-residue shampoos a couple of times to make sure. The results are conclusive. The new formulation has lost all of its original characteristics. People who have used this for years if not decades know exactly what that is. The perfume has changed as well and this is not important for me but those who liked the old smell will be disappointed in this aspect as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first effect when I started to use this bottle was noticeable hair falling out (which has happened before when I have tried out new brands). I didn&#x27;t associate this with this shampoo at first. And then the lathering feel was very different (feels thin and not very luxurious as the previous formulation). I thought perhaps my hair had accumulated too much residue and cleaned it with an anti-residue shampoo. Nope that wasn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, the new formulation is not a bad shampoo. It cleans the hair very well and rinses off nicely but so do so many shampoos at half or a third of the price. It is simply not a premium shampoo anymore which justified the price earlier. People stuck with Nexxus for a very good reason earlier. It kept their hair healthy and it was dependable. Unfortunately, this is the \\&quot;New Coke\\&quot; of Nexxus. I am affronted that they decided to sell this new formulation with the same branding and name and at the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect as more people find this out and stop buying, it will move down in price along with the other products in the $4-$5 range. Unless, they reintroduce the \\&quot;Nexxus Classic\\&quot;, stay away from this product if what you are looking for is the one you were used to.oking for is the one you were used to.</li>
            <li> ...don&#x27;t fix it!  I used to love this product, used it for years.  Now, as the other reviewers have said, the formula changed and the new stuff is terrible!  Off to find another brand.</li>
            <li> The product shown was a product that I have used for years because I have allergies and this is the only product that I can use that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I had not been able to find it anywhere in stores so was very excited when I found it online. Upon delivery it was not the same product but a new product that Nexxus is pushing and I can&#x27;t use so I returned it. This ad needs to be updated to the new product as I assume Nexxus doesn&#x27;t make the older product anymore.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great with my fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave it too soft and it dooesn&#x27;t leave it too dry either.</li>
            <li> Anytime you buy a Nexxus product, you purchase quality; the price is good, delivery is great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Diametress for 20 years and this ain&#x27;t it.  I have very baby fine yet plentiful hair and Diametress was the one shampoo I could always count on to give me the fullness I wanted.  It was perfect.  Then, they reformulated it and it stinks.  Literally.  One of the great things about the old formula was the light, clean scent.  Now, it has a chemical odor to it.  And, it doesn&#x27;t work like it used to.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  Don&#x27;t try this shampoo.  If you&#x27;ve used it in the past, you will be disappointed.  Bring back the old Diametress, please!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother. She is a huge fan and states this does not weight down her hair.</li>
            <li> Love Nexus Volume shampoo. It is very hard to buy in my area.</li>
            <li> We have been using Diamatress for years. It really helps to add volume to thin, fine hair. And this is the best price I could find. I will keep buying this product as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Different color design on label, but the same good shampoo for those of us with thin or thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Diametress for years, and I know whatever this company sent me is NOT the right stuff.  Not sure if it&#x27;s a knock-off or what, but it&#x27;s packaged differently and smells awful, which is really disappointing to me because I loved the smell of Diametress &amp; am now pregnant and very sensitive to smells, so I can&#x27;t even use this over-priced garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.  What a waste.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair. I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus Diametress shampoo for years, twenty years +, and I&#x27;ve always been extremely happy with it. My hair is thicker with more body with this shampoo and I can wear my hair longer as a result. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that works nearly as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;ll have to really try now. I went to purchase it a few weeks ago and it&#x27;s in a new package. My heart sank when I saw that because it usually means they&#x27;ve been tampering with the ingredients. I compared the list of ingredients from the new bottle when I got home, with the &#x27;old&#x27; bottle and the list is a bit different. I tried the new one once and didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m waiting to try it again when I&#x27;m not as busy. Might be I used too much hairspray when I used it the first time. But I could tell the difference in the shower just by the way it lathered. The &#x27;old&#x27; Diametress lather feels rich and silky and as if it&#x27;s making my hair better already. The &#x27;new&#x27; one lacked that feel. It was really disappointing from the get go! When I styled my hair, it was more fly-away, not as manageable and not nearly as full. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the &#x27;new&#x27; Diametress!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I don&#x27;t understand why a company has a product that works great and then has to mess with it. I think advertising to let people know what a great product it is would be more beneficial than changing it to save some money and as a result, making an inferior product that is no longer worth the $11 or $12 they&#x27;re asking for it. Someone at the company is making really bad decisions! They stopped making Nexxus \\&quot;Retexxtur\\&quot; which used to be Rejuvaperm which was the BEST thing for permed hair. Now they&#x27;ve changed Diametress. Sadly, I&#x27;m forced to go looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are a company, you need to have good products to sell. You have great products. Instead of advertising that, you change them, dumb them down if you will, until you have an inferior product. How does this make any sense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company&#x27;s customer service department is great. But these decisions come from higher up. I&#x27;ll call again to complain, don&#x27;t know that it will do any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 19, 2010&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s over a year since I wrote my review. I changed the number of stars which someone suggested. Yes, I agree, the new product is only worth one star. I emailed the company again. They insisted they market tested the new Diametress and it got great reviews. I can only assume the people that were trying it out just wanted to appease the company and not be truthful about the shampoo. I have a list of the ingredients of the old Diametress. I still have a bottle, washed my hair with it today and it&#x27;s fabulous!!! Dang I miss it! My hair is fuller, softer, more body, bouncier and easier to manage with the old one. I have a list of the ingredients and I&#x27;m looking for a shampoo that has them or something similar. If anyone has any suggestions, please pass them along!! Thanks!any sense?

            <li> * Nexus Diametress, well it looks like the original was better for volume and people loved it.&lt;br /&gt;* I thought this shampoo had a medicine scent, I think i would only recommend the leave-in conditioner only&lt;br /&gt;* The volume gel works fine, but did not like the waxy feel of the volume mousse&lt;br /&gt;* Hope they bring back the original or a Green product with no parabens</li>
            <li> I have reviewed this before and keep buying it for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;This is the one she likes best.</li>
            <li> This and the conditioner together adds a crazy amount of volume to my fine, thin hair.  The only downside is that I have to use a spray in conditioner after in order to make my hair manageable and control the fly aways.  But for my limp hair, it is worth if for the added &amp;#34;umph.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my hair since using this product.  My hair appears slightly thicker and feels thicker.  Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> After I read some of the reviews for this shampoo, I thought maybe it really would make my hair feel thicker and have more body.  But I was so disappointed when I used it.  I didn&#x27;t find it did anything for my hair except clean it and give it a fresh smell. Those are good things, but I could have gotten them for a lot less money by using Suave.</li>
            <li> The wife likes it a great deal.</li>
            <li> Nexxus really should go back to the old formula, this new shampoo is awful!</li>
            <li> Great product for my thinning hair...smells great!!</li>
            <li> Bay hairs galore! I have a thyroid and hormonal recurrent issue that made my hair fall non stop. This shampoo has fortified, thickened, and replenished my hair. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> not as volumizing as expected</li>
            <li> Only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that actually adds volume</li>
            <li> Give it 3 stars- shampoo is ok but I was not really impressed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo.  All the rest is just BS.  And it&#x27;s overpriced.  I will stick with the $1 bottles from the dollar store.  They work just as well and don&#x27;t cost an arm and leg.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely wonderful shampoo,  I am so thankful that I can purchase  through AMAZON.  It has strengthened for many years. my hair and I have used it</li>
            <li> This shampoo works pretty well for fine and thin hair and helps add volume.  I have used it for several years and my hair is very fine and thin.</li>
            <li> Yes, this new version appears much less richer than the version I&#x27;ve used from many years not. More detergent-like, not leaving hair as smooth and lustrous as the old formula. You get the impression that something costly in the ingredients was reduced or removed and it performs more like that five dollar shampoo you can buy at the discount store.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected despite the reviews given.  This product was supposed to give body and volume, but it did not fulfill its expectations,</li>
            <li> This is a nice shampoo but I didn&#x27;t notice any big improvements on my hair. Smells nice though..</li>
            <li> Great volumizer for fine hair</li>
            <li> This new formula (Green Tea Extract) is NOT the same as the old Nexxus Diametress &amp;#34;Luscious&amp;#34; Volumizing Shampoo. It does not work nearly as well for my type of fine hair. I have no idea why Nexxus would change formulation on such a successful product.</li>
            <li> It works, but your scalp gets a slight burning sensation while using.  That goes away once you rise.  It works well as near as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Trying something new for my teenage daughter...she loves it!  Good value!</li>
            <li> My favorite poo. Great for thinning hair</li>
            <li> not as good as original product&lt;br /&gt;the formula has changed</li>
            <li> Great shampoo at a great price from Amazon</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever.  Thinning hair looks definitely thicker and feels thicker.  I changed shampoos just to see.  I used Nexxus Pro-mend and did not get the same results.  If you want body and lift to your hair use this shampoo.  I also use Nexxus ProMend Bodifying Mousse.  Best combination I&#x27;ve found.  It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried this new formula for over a month now and it just doesn&#x27;t work. Their old formula worked very well...I have no idea why they switched formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve the 1 star.</li>
