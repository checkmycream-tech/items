            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>see what suits you the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the greatest quality whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I loved it though!</li>
            <li>Inexpensive with great reviews:  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of straighteners and this one is great for the price and it does what it claims.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
            <li>Great seller, great product.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love it, trust me!!</li>
            <li>GREAT JOB REVLON!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li>Bought this tonight in a pinch at Walmart after leaving my good one on a cruise ship. .</li>
            <li>Looked like a good deal but wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  </li>
            <li>I just got this straightener for Christmas and have used it twice, just to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li>The fact that anyone would give this product a good rating is mind blowing....</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s nit good for my hair.</li>
            <li>I just bought it and simply love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own thing.</li>
            <li>Honestly this is a very cheap product.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Titanium is wayyyyy better is better for your hair because like a said I straighten my hair a lot</li>
            <li>The straightener has temperature control and has nice smooth plates that don&#x27;t pull on my hair.</li>
            <li>that works soooo much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find something that works for you.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Thanks Revlon for a great product.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off throwing the $25 cash paid for it in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing I could find a better straightener in my daughters doll set.  </li>
            <li>but should have more degrees of heat</li>
            <li>My hair looked shiny, healthy, and smooth with no frizz.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, once it did heat up, it lost that heat very quickly once I started straightening.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re probably excited about buying this so we&#x27;ll start out with the good- the straightener leaves my hair smooth and straight</li>
            <li>they must have baby fine hair...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair though.</li>
            <li>it is so fine</li>
            <li>I should have done more research, but needed one quickly.</li>
            <li>It also looks cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made and is</li>
            <li>just buy it because it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>but now all it does is light up and will not heat.</li>
            <li>This item has fit into both of those categories.</li>
            <li>My hair is now poker straight and sits nicely.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been this smooth and silky since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>a really great, but inexpensive Tourmaline flat iron?  </li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li>anyways in conclusion I suggest you buy this straightener because it&#x27;s been really good for me, I personally got it from Walmart for $25 and the only reason why I&#x27;m going to but another one is because my rabbit chewed the cord in pieces but from the rest the straightener is been really good to me</li>
            <li>Really, there are sooo many tools out there</li>
            <li>Warms up quickly.</li>
            <li>and i had it flat ironed and perfect till i stepped outside</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>It takes for ever to straighten your hair because this thing never gets warm enough.</li>
            <li>First pass success for frizzy think hair, though needs to have small-medium hair pieces engaged.</li>
            <li>I got it in a really pretty shade of pink, which I LOVE!</li>
            <li>First, it takes FOREVER</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I must have been on drugs when I wrote my first review.</li>
            <li>Works great on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron because you don&#x27;t need to spend over 100 dollars just for ypur hair.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron</li>
            <li>Time to get a new and bigger one :)</li>
            <li>I wanted Tourmaline, as I was told it would be much healthier for my hair.  </li>
            <li>However after using this iron, my hair looked and felt like hay straw, and it didn&#x27;t really do much for taking out the frizz and waves I have.  </li>
            <li>have straight frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does straightened but for girls that have straight to medium wavy hair</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it, I really did.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m talking at least a good 15 minutes) to heat up to full heat and even on its hightest setting, it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li>So, bottom line, if you have straight hair, go ahead and try it out.</li>
            <li>so wants not to like about it</li>
            <li>Your hair gets bone straight.</li>
            <li>KEEP IN MIND, I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li>I just like it to look perfectly straight,</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found these flat irons I just had to have them.</li>
            <li>like is said and on top of that my natural hair is very lon like 20 inch long hair, yes is all my natural hair</li>
            <li>So now I am using my old flat iron which is about 7 years old and it works a million times better.</li>
            <li>On top of that, as I previously stated, it takes forever to even do</li>
            <li>This one gets very hot to the touch, even on low settings, and I&#x27;ve come close to burning my forehead (not to mention my fingers)</li>
            <li>I got the pink version and it&#x27;s super pretty</li>
            <li>Okay so i had this flat iron for about 2 months and it broke down and for the first day of school i had to go with my hair frizzy</li>
            <li>This flat iron makes your hair super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to damage your hair.</li>
            <li>I needed a new straightener (my old one is over 4 years old and yanks my hair out)</li>
            <li>These things get hot so fast, just plug them in and they are ready in less than two min!</li>
            <li>Alright you guys, I&#x27;m not usually one to leave a review unless a product is outstandingly good or horribly wrong.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>but I should have kept my old one.</li>
            <li>This time, it really came back and bit me.  </li>
            <li>After several strokes with one secton of hair, it didn&#x27;t keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li>This is not heavy duty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good choice for a travel straightener to pack instead of my expensive Sedu.</li>
            <li>I have blown my hair straight to start with and have spent the last hour and a half trying to straighten and smooth my shoulder length hair!</li>
            <li>and you would think it be like super dead</li>
            <li>barely did a thing to it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this straightener when I left my old one at a hotel just before Christmas.</li>
            <li>It was to replace my old flat iron</li>
            <li>This flat iron is just like a professional.</li>
            <li>With this revlon flat iron I have terrible hair and I&#x60;d have better luck streightening my hair if I pointed at my hair and tried to magically turn it straight.</li>
            <li>I have thick coarse hair and this was nit strong enough.</li>
            <li>You can get the same results as a professional flat iron.</li>
            <li>Not pleased, and in an effort to save a few pennies, I&#x27;m going to end up spending more because now I have to buy another one or deal with the frustration of trying to use this one.</li>
            <li>But, I guess this straightener might work for someone that has naturally straight hair and needs it just to make little touch ups.</li>
            <li>I do not understand why there are so many bad reviews, if it didn&#x27;t work for you is because you are probably grabbing too much or not enough hair, no offense</li>

            <li> After 40 minutes, I got tired and ended up using my old straightener to do the job right</li>
            <li> and I totally reccomend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> So I got this same flat iron but pink, they&#x27;re the same just a different color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I could give this flat iron zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> I always buy inexpensive flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the logic in spending $100 - $200 on a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Try the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> If I flat iron my hair with thihs flat iron, my hair doesn&#x27;t become as oily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;y go wasting your money on a Chi, get this flat iron</li>
            <li> I exchanged this today for Remington pearl ceramic flat iron</li>
            <li> say this because i have really coarse hair thick and very curly</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a flat iron for long term I would not purchase this one!</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair and this straightener</li>
            <li> So, I attribute that last benefit to my hair care products and not really the straightener.</li>
            <li> Ceramic being the worst for your hair &amp; titanium being a better choice for your hair since the heat is transferred quickly, &amp; leaves it soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would only suggest it to people with thin hair who have mainly straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and only had to pass over one time.</li>
            <li> Okay onto the not-so-good: I used it for the first time this morning and it smells HORRIBLE while flat ironing my hair, smells almost like it&#x27;s being fried.</li>
            <li> So I kept having to put it down and wait for it to heat back up.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want a super expensive one since I don&#x27;t straighten my hair all that often.</li>
            <li> If you thick, wavy, curly, or damaged hair DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> , only one problem- it has to go over the same strand of hair at least three times to do the job.</li>
            <li> When clenching it together on your hair, you can feel it&#x27;s almost completely hollow inside.</li>
            <li> Just save your money up and get a Sedu or other salon quality straightener.</li>
            <li> I just bought mine because I wanted to try something other then ceramic.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for anyone with any sort of a weak or sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> And it was so not worth the time.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse medium length hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and breaks down quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> long length, thin to medium texture which becomes wavy when wet and frizzy when dry.&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> i have very very dark brown hair</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;y wash it everyday, my hair gets oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for about a year and half for at least twice a week</li>
            <li> Still have little waves ALL OVER MY HEAD!</li>
            <li> but if you go and purchase an expensive one but one that the plates are made out of titanium not ceramic because ceramic DAMAGES your hair if not use properly.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of garbage don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> the worst flat iron I have ever owned the titanium plates are pretty much pointless.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a different straightener, but this one doesn&#x27;t grip hair well, then when it does grip it pinches/pulls my hair, which is unfortunate because it takes at least 3 passes to straighten a small section.</li>
            <li> It took my hair from ringlets to waves and that was after passing it over a small strand at least 5 or 6 times.</li>
            <li> dismiss an item because it has some negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> it will be the worst 20-30 dollars you&#x27;ll ever spend and it damages hair quick</li>
            <li> with this flat iron it takes me about 2 hours to (badly) straighten my thick curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why this gets such bad reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a poorly made product.</li>
            <li> It could be worse</li>
            <li> but I was not impressed by the &amp;#34;Titanium&amp;#34; either.</li>
            <li> I had the pink version of it and hated it!</li>
            <li> Purchased it and am disappointed.</li>
            <li> but...it failed the preformance test miserably.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Biggest piece of crap straightener ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent seller, excellent product recommended.</li>
            <li> Warms up quickly. Simple to use. First pass success for frizzy think hair, though needs to have small-medium hair pieces engaged.</li>
            <li> So I got this same flat iron but pink, they&#x27;re the same just a different color.&lt;br /&gt;Percival I do not understand why there are so many bad reviews, if it didn&#x27;t work for you is because you are probably grabbing too much or not enough hair, no offense but if it did not work for you is simply because you&#x27;re not using it right.&lt;br /&gt;I say this because i have really coarse hair thick and very curly like is said and on top of that my natural hair is very lon like 20 inch long hair, yes is all my natural hair and I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for about a year and half for at least twice a week and it has always worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;And with all that said if you do not want to purchase this that&#x27;s okay but if you go and purchase an expensive one but one that the plates are made out of titanium not ceramic because ceramic DAMAGES your hair if not use properly. Titanium is wayyyyy better is better for your hair because like a said I straighten my hair a lot and you would think it be like super dead but it&#x27;s not the only reason why I have a bunch of split ends is because I don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; my hair because I have a feeling that they would cut it all off.&lt;br /&gt;But anyways in conclusion I suggest you buy this straightener because it&#x27;s been really good for me, I personally got it from Walmart for $25 and the only reason why I&#x27;m going to but another one is because my rabbit chewed the cord in pieces but from the rest the straightener is been really good to me</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good choice for a travel straightener to pack instead of my expensive Sedu. This is a poorly made product. I have thick coarse medium length hair. It pulled and snagged on my hair and did nothing to straighten it. I set it at the highest temp to see if that would help, nope, it did not. The titanium feature did nothing for smoothing out the hair nor did it help my hair to glide through the plates.  Just save your money up and get a Sedu or other salon quality straightener. It also looks cheaply made. I guess that&#x27;s what $25 buys you these days.</li>
            <li> No complaints on this product at all. It heats up well but would low it if it had a gripper on the handle. But otherwise I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Okay so i had this flat iron for about 2 months and it broke down and for the first day of school i had to go with my hair frizzy and i had it flat ironed and perfect till i stepped outside&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT WORK WELL&lt;br /&gt;and breaks down quickly&lt;br /&gt;if you buy this it will be the worst 20-30 dollars you&#x27;ll ever spend and it damages hair quick i have very very dark brown hair and i found a white hair and red hair on me one of my friends found it while i was doing work and i was so embarrassed&lt;br /&gt;(i use heat tamer spray)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  The straightener has temperature control and has nice smooth plates that don&#x27;t pull on my hair. Great buy!</li>
            <li> If I could give this flat iron zero stars I would. I had the pink version of it and hated it! It is cheaply made and is the worst flat iron I have ever owned the titanium plates are pretty much pointless. They do nothing to help you. It takes for ever to straighten your hair because this thing never gets warm enough. I would only suggest it to people with thin hair who have mainly straight hair. I only had it for 4-5 months and it has already quit working. It won&#x27;t turn on. So if you are looking for a flat iron for long term I would not purchase this one! I wish I never had!</li>
            <li> Terrible product!  I had the one inch for about a year, it died. Replaced it with this one because my hair is longer now. Doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to do much for my hair. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got this for christmas 4 months ago.It was to replace my old flat iron but I should have kept my old one. with this flat iron it takes me about 2 hours to (badly) straighten my thick curly frizzy hair. So now I am using my old flat iron which is about 7 years old and it works a million times better. With this revlon flat iron I have terrible hair and I&#x60;d have better luck streightening my hair if I pointed at my hair and tried to magically turn it straight. Just whatever you do do not use this product you will regret it.</li>
            <li> Bought this tonight in a pinch at Walmart after leaving my good one on a cruise ship. . Looked like a good deal but wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  Going back to the store tonight.</li>
            <li> I always buy inexpensive flat irons.  I don&#x27;t see the logic in spending $100 - $200 on a flat iron.  This time, it really came back and bit me.  What a terrible iron.  I wanted Tourmaline, as I was told it would be much healthier for my hair.  However after using this iron, my hair looked and felt like hay straw, and it didn&#x27;t really do much for taking out the frizz and waves I have.  A note about my hair:  long length, thin to medium texture which becomes wavy when wet and frizzy when dry.&lt;br /&gt;Want a really great, but inexpensive Tourmaline flat iron?  Try the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  I just bought it and simply love it!  Inexpensive with great reviews:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MA0QY2/ref&#x3D;ox_ya_os_product</li>
            <li> This flat iron is just like a professional. I bought this at my local Walgreens and I got it for 15 dollars. I love this flat iron because you don&#x27;t need to spend over 100 dollars just for ypur hair. You can get the same results as a professional flat iron. This flat iron makes your hair super soft and silky. I have silky hair but if I don&#x27;y wash it everyday, my hair gets oily. If I flat iron my hair with thihs flat iron, my hair doesn&#x27;t become as oily. I love this flat iron and I totally reccomend this flat iron. Don&#x27;y go wasting your money on a Chi, get this flat iron and you&#x27;ll love it, trust me!!</li>
            <li> JUNK! I have blown my hair straight to start with and have spent the last hour and a half trying to straighten and smooth my shoulder length hair! Still have little waves ALL OVER MY HEAD! I even used a straightening product in my hair to start with. Highest heat setting and STILL no results! This thing is a piece of garbage don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised on TV. Purchased it and am disappointed. Revlon states that this product will straighten hair with one stroke. Not true. I have thick shoulder length hair. After several strokes with one secton of hair, it didn&#x27;t keep my hair straight. Ripped and tore pieces of hair while running this Revlon straightener through a section of hair. I do not recommend this product. It&#x27;s a waste of money. Product does NOT do what it says. Not on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a replacement item. I have a smaller set and I did not know it was made in a larger size until a searched on Amazon. I was so excited when I found these flat irons I just had to have them. I have had the smaller set now for 4 years now and it is still working like the day I bought it. This just confirms the product was made to last!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this simply because my sephora straightener stopped working and I was freaking out since I had to meet my fiance&#x27;s family. Ran to the nearest Walmart and looked over for 5 minutes and I decided to purchase this one.&lt;br /&gt;You should understand the difference between ceramic, tourmaline and titanium plates. Ceramic being the worst for your hair &amp; titanium being a better choice for your hair since the heat is transferred quickly, &amp; leaves it soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have straight frizzy hair. It&#x27;s managable. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to curly haired girls. This is not heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;It does straightened but for girls that have straight to medium wavy hair (maybe mild)&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews to see if a straightener is suited for you according to your hair&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t just buy it because it&#x27;s cheap&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t dismiss an item because it has some negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Just see what suits you the best.</li>
            <li> I just got this straightener for Christmas and have used it twice, just to give it a fair chance. I really wanted to like it, I really did. I got the pink version and it&#x27;s super pretty but...it failed the preformance test miserably. I needed a new straightener (my old one is over 4 years old and yanks my hair out) but I didn&#x27;t want a super expensive one since I don&#x27;t straighten my hair all that often. I have long, curly hair and this straightener barely did a thing to it. First, it takes FOREVER (I&#x27;m talking at least a good 15 minutes) to heat up to full heat and even on its hightest setting, it wasn&#x27;t hot enough. Not to mention, once it did heat up, it lost that heat very quickly once I started straightening. So I kept having to put it down and wait for it to heat back up. And it was so not worth the time. It took my hair from ringlets to waves and that was after passing it over a small strand at least 5 or 6 times. After 40 minutes, I got tired and ended up using my old straightener to do the job right (but, ouch, it still pulled my hair). But, I guess this straightener might work for someone that has naturally straight hair and needs it just to make little touch ups. So, if you are said person and plan on buying this, let me give you a couple of things I DID like about this product. 1) It didn&#x27;t pull my hair except for 2 or 3 times. 2) It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to damage your hair. 3) I got it in a really pretty shade of pink, which I LOVE! 4) It does seems to make my hair shiney...but then again, my hair is shiney whether I straighten it or not. So, I attribute that last benefit to my hair care products and not really the straightener. So, bottom line, if you have straight hair, go ahead and try it out. If you thick, wavy, curly, or damaged hair DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Really, there are sooo many tools out there that works soooo much better. Just search around I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find something that works for you.</li>
            <li> Bought mine a couple of years ago but now all it does is light up and will not heat. I loved it though! Time to get a new and bigger one :)</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron! I have tried a lot of straighteners and this one is great for the price and it does what it claims. I have thick, naturally curly hair and only had to pass over one time. My hair looked shiny, healthy, and smooth with no frizz. I love it and I think some people are just looking for a reason to complain. Thanks Revlon for a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a different straightener, but this one doesn&#x27;t grip hair well, then when it does grip it pinches/pulls my hair, which is unfortunate because it takes at least 3 passes to straighten a small section. Not pleased, and in an effort to save a few pennies, I&#x27;m going to end up spending more because now I have to buy another one or deal with the frustration of trying to use this one.</li>
            <li> Biggest piece of crap straightener ever purchased.  I would have been better off throwing the $25 cash paid for it in the garbage.  I&#x27;m guessing I could find a better straightener in my daughters doll set.  The fact that anyone would give this product a good rating is mind blowing....they must have baby fine hair... Wish there was a Zero star rating.</li>
            <li> good product but should have more degrees of heat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why this gets such bad reviews. I just bought mine because I wanted to try something other then ceramic. I like it. It does it&#x27;s job so wants not to like about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I must have been on drugs when I wrote my first review. this is the worst straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thick coarse hair and this was nit strong enough. I&#x27;d have to turn it all the way up for it to do it&#x27;s job and that&#x27;s nit good for my hair. my last straightener I was at 15 an it did marvellous. I exchanged this today for Remington pearl ceramic flat iron and I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener when I left my old one at a hotel just before Christmas. I should have done more research, but needed one quickly. This one gets very hot to the touch, even on low settings, and I&#x27;ve come close to burning my forehead (not to mention my fingers) several times. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> These things get hot so fast, just plug them in and they are ready in less than two min! Your hair gets bone straight. The quality, to me is comparable to Pro Bliss and Chi brand styling tools. GREAT JOB REVLON!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Alright you guys, I&#x27;m not usually one to leave a review unless a product is outstandingly good or horribly wrong. This item has fit into both of those categories. You&#x27;re probably excited about buying this so we&#x27;ll start out with the good- the straightener leaves my hair smooth and straight, only one problem- it has to go over the same strand of hair at least three times to do the job. Okay onto the not-so-good: I used it for the first time this morning and it smells HORRIBLE while flat ironing my hair, smells almost like it&#x27;s being fried. On top of that, as I previously stated, it takes forever to even do it&#x27;s job. KEEP IN MIND, I have naturally straight hair I just like it to look perfectly straight, yeah there should not be this problem. Also, it pulls on my hair quite a bit. Would not recommend for anyone with any sort of a weak or sensitive scalp. Honestly this is a very cheap product. When clenching it together on your hair, you can feel it&#x27;s almost completely hollow inside. It&#x27;s not the greatest quality whatsoever. It could be worse but I was not impressed by the &amp;#34;Titanium&amp;#34; either. Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> Great seller, great product. Thanky</li>
            <li> I actually like the straightener. I have fine hair though. It can be fuzzy or just do it&#x27;s own thing. I used this iron on a lower setting bc it is so fine I didn&#x27;t want to burn the ends off. My hair is now poker straight and sits nicely. It hasn&#x27;t been this smooth and silky since I was a kid.</li>
