            <li>But I&#x27;m telling you men right up front, &amp;#34;GET</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo and is one of the few that will wash out easily if you have soft water.</li>
            <li>The bottles received in the mail missed the VERY FINE PRINT on the back of the one I purchased in person.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I am listing some of the most obvious and egregious.  </li>
            <li>kind of cologne-ey like other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I really made out because you are receiving 100 mL more shampoo, but then I compared the bottles, which look VERY similar.  </li>

            <li>REALLY WANTED THE ADVERTIZED PRODUCT (I.E., THE REAL ONE)</li>
            <li>I think the listing makes it legal, but not what is shown in the picture upon close inspection, nor what you are really</li>

            <li>Acid\\&quot;  among the many other ingrediants.  </li>
            <li>I just received: 2 of Redken Go Clean Daily Shampoo, 10 Ounce&lt;</li>
            <li>tried this out because my main shampoo was OOS.  </li>
            <li>I advise to buy a larger bottle (33oz) and use it to refill the smaller bottles for a more manageable sized container in the shower.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend any of their products.  </li>
            <li>but I think the price is high, though I see it is high everywhere.</li>
            <li>I know as men, a lot of us simply do not place very much importance on the brand of shampoo we use, or how much it costs or how it smells.</li>
            <li>Been using product for years and Amazon&#x27;s price is usually 5 bucks cheaper than most stores have it for</li>
            <li>Amazon is considerably cheaper that anywhere else that I have found...</li>
            <li>BECAUSE THAT ONE WORKS BETTER THAN ANY SHAMPOO IN MEMORY (at least for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will parch your hair with all that acid and Alcohol, which will wash the natural oils out of your hair leaving it to blow around in the breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First the Green Label is inverted.  </li>
            <li>It has the ability to clean your hair and let people know how serious you are about it.  </li>

            <li> Came in a different bottle than advertised.  It smelt a little different than the Redken Go Clean I have gotten from the store.  Made me suspicious about being fake.  Seemed to do the same as the product I had previously bought</li>
            <li> works great, and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I love the NON-floral scent for men.  Unfortunately, this product did not clean my hair well.  Seems to have a conditioner in it.  Hair feels a little greasy after shampoo.  Noticed my bath towel would smell badly within five days.  Does not happened with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> It does the job but the smell is not great...kind of cologne-ey like other reviewers have mentioned.  Kind of pricey as well but it does lather up with a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out because my main shampoo was OOS.  If I didn&#x27;t already have a regular shampoo I might stick with this one.  But I like the American Crew smell much better.</li>
            <li> Buy these to try out my favorite shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years, and love the smell and the amount of lather I get. On vacation, I&#x27;ve even used it as body wash. I advise to buy a larger bottle (33oz) and use it to refill the smaller bottles for a more manageable sized container in the shower.</li>
            <li> Recommended by hair stylist and think it&#x27;s great.  Lasts a very long time as only use a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> This is good shampoo... the best I can find now that the redken express that has been discontinued and is no longer available..... Amazon is considerably cheaper that anywhere else that I have found...</li>
            <li> It has the ability to clean your hair and let people know how serious you are about it.  Not recommended for bald people.</li>
            <li> I know why you want to buy this product...the one you think it is works really well, but what you get in the mail will not be what you think you are buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY WANTED THE ADVERTIZED PRODUCT (I.E., THE REAL ONE) BECAUSE THAT ONE WORKS BETTER THAN ANY SHAMPOO IN MEMORY (at least for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very unfortunate.  I just received: 2 of Redken Go Clean Daily Shampoo, 10 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Redken&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sold by: [THE STORE IN QUESTION HAS NOW PULLED THE PRODUCT FROM THEIR SHELVES...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is 13.5 ozs and labeled very similarly...However, totally reformulated and has \\&quot;Citric Acid, Denatured Alcohol, Salicylic Acid\\&quot;  among the many other ingrediants.  These things will parch and dry your hair out.  This is not the advertized product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other ingrediant differences.  I am listing some of the most obvious and egregious.  You are not getting anything extra here.  This will parch your hair with all that acid and Alcohol, which will wash the natural oils out of your hair leaving it to blow around in the breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact I cannot recall a shampoo that would put these aweful ingrediants in their product.  I think the listing makes it legal, but not what is shown in the picture upon close inspection, nor what you are really pursuing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It LOOKS VERY SIMILAR, BUT ONE MUST READ THE \\&quot;INGREDIENTS\\&quot; LISTING.  I already have the actual product advertized here in my current possession, so I compared them.  It took a few minutes to tell what was different.  At first I thought I really made out because you are receiving 100 mL more shampoo, but then I compared the bottles, which look VERY similar.  First the Green Label is inverted.  Mine was picked up at a Hair Stylist shop...so, like everyone I wanted to save money.  The bottles received in the mail missed the VERY FINE PRINT on the back of the one I purchased in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the other difference you will notice is that only the letters on the front of the bottles you receive will say \\&quot;Go Clean\\&quot; will be colored metalic green, NOT the relief (i.e. inverse or background) of the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be great if it stopped there, but the closer I looked this is a completely reformulated product that will make your hair look very bad and lead you back to the original product you thought you were getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS SELLER HAD XXX PERCENT POSITIVE REVIEWS WHEN I PURCHASED FROM THEM...SO, THIS HAS SLIPPED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE.  BEWARE, IF YOU DO TRY TO BUY THIS ON LINE TRY ELSEWHERE...OR JUST GO TO YOUR STYLIST (I was trying to avoid that trip) TO BE SURE WHAT YOU ARE BUYING...IF YOU REALLY WANT THE REAL PRODUCT (AND IT WILL ONLY BE 10 oz, when you buy it ...just like the picture and description here...so, unfortunately no free bee)  GOOD LUCK.he bottles you receive will say \\&quot;Go Clean\\&quot; will be colored metalic green, NOT the relief (i.e. inverse or background) of the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be great if it stopped there, but the closer I looked this is a completely reformulated product that will make your hair look very bad and lead you back to the original product you thought you were getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS SELLER HAD XXX PERCENT POSITIVE REVIEWS WHEN I PURCHASED FROM THEM...SO, THIS HAS SLIPPED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE.

            <li> Makes my hair feel nice, smooth and shiny. Been using product for years and Amazon&#x27;s price is usually 5 bucks cheaper than most stores have it for</li>
            <li> Highly recommend any of their products.  Seems to help with build up from gels, spray, etc.  You can&#x27;t go wrong and shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what my salon uses. I have always liked the smell of it each time I had my hair washed at the salon. Decided it was time to purchase this for home use as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo and is one of the few that will wash out easily if you have soft water.</li>
            <li> I usually use the cheap stuff everyday and have had no problems, but when someone told me to try this Redkin Shampoo, I did.  I believe this shampoo may have some conditioner in it since the hair was easier to comb.  I also needed less hair gel to get the hair to lay down the way I wanted.  So I now use this brand all the time.  I would have given it 5 stars but I think the price is high, though I see it is high everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love redken it makes my hair soft and clean and the sent is awesome I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and fast service</li>
            <li> I know as men, a lot of us simply do not place very much importance on the brand of shampoo we use, or how much it costs or how it smells. But I&#x27;m telling you men right up front, &amp;#34;GET THIS SHAMPOO&amp;#34;!. This shampoo has a great scent, without reminding one of a drugstore, old man cologne. This shampoo lathers up nicely and cleans without drying the hair.</li>
            <li> Pair with the conditioner tor perfect results. Long time fan</li>
            <li> I bought this to change up the shampoo. It&#x27;s nothing fancy, and felt like it dried out my hair. It&#x27;s ok in a pinch if I run out of shampoo but I probably won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> My wife and myself love the smell!</li>
