            <li> It&#x27;s a flexible plastic oval with stick--one piece of plastic that bends in the center.  It&#x27;s soft enough to lean back against the chair comfortably.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t get them in stores any more and they are great for working out.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much that I bought four. However, I received one brown and the rest black! I know that the colors vary but since I am paying the same price as I did in the store where I bought my first one, I think a color option should be offered!  Out of eight total, only one was brown. That hardly constitutes &amp;#34; colors may vary&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for many years now. Came across it by accident at one of the stores. Easy to use, hold hair well and I believe better for your hair than the regular bands.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and all made. They work very well for fine hair. Will hold portion of hair back but not large enough for a full adult updo.  Larger version of this same item works well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> These clips are very versatile, easy to use and do not damage the hair! They are awesome! Two packs are convenient.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are great!  Hold hair great without getting caught or tangled.</li>
            <li> one minus for not showing the other color option, since I only wanted BLACK.&lt;br /&gt;however, they are comfortable. They even stayed in while sleeping. I have very thick hair and it did not tug.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be two of the same color but no!  Also they are kinda big is your hair is not long.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!!!  Good purchase!</li>
            <li> Payed more than I would at a local store, but I love these barrettes. I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores when the last one I had broke after 2 years of daily use. When I found them here I bought 2 packs. Delivered as expected too.</li>
            <li> I really like this style of barrette and have been using the larger style for a while.  Quality and style are good.  I know it says that colors may very but I was expecting the pair to at least be the same color.  I got one black and one gold.  I purchased the smaller barrettes so I could wear them at the same time.  Can&#x27;t do that when they don&#x27;t match.</li>
            <li> These clips are amazing!!! I bought for my daughter since most clips and ponytail holder are usually too tight for her. These clips doesn&#x27;t tug or pull her hair out.</li>
            <li> I received one of these as a &amp;#34;freebie&amp;#34; attached to some ponytail bands I purchased.  It isn&#x27;t normally something I would buy.  But since I had it, I tried it.  I love it for my hair.  It is very easy to use and actually holds my hair.  I wanted to buy some more because with just one, I was always afraid of misplacing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t realize this.  You get 4 in total.  2 packages of barrettes that have 2 pieces.  There is also a large size.  I ordered that first, but I originally had the small size and prefer that for my uses.</li>
            <li> way to small gave them away Will get the larger ones next time</li>
