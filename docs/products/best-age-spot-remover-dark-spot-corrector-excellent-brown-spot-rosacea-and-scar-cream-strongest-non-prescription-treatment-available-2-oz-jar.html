            <li>Thanks for this great product.</li>

            <li>glad I bought two jars...</li>
            <li>and I must say that i love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to see what results more continuous use brings.</li>
            <li>The many \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; who gave it five stars</li>
            <li>Just like a couple of people said, most of the reviews were written by the people who did not buy the product at all.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a top rated fade cream and thought this looked interesting till I studied the reviews.</li>
            <li>I started using this product on the top of my hands to see if it would work and to see if I would have any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe a dermatologist might be better, and it is permanent.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>It sure did, it lightened the age spot i had</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s probably a lot better off than you were before you started using the product.</li>
            <li>For $30 and all its claims, this should work better.  </li>
            <li>Many days I even re-applied it, but with no change.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work at all after I have tried for three weeks sincerely.</li>
            <li>Bought something else that works better.</li>
            <li>After a month of using it to remove some age spots near my mouth, I noticed an incredible thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to report that after the month and applying the cream twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have just ordered more jars.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could give it 10 stars...or 20...or 100  :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li>but I think my spots are lighter  ...  :)</li>
            <li>At such a great price too!</li>
            <li>Well, When this stuff is available, you gotta get it!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product is great and adds exuberance to my skin, it works very well for removing my age spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this stuff.</li>
            <li>For the price this is okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many creams and lotions to remove my age spots.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>She feels a lot better about herself.</li>
            <li>and I recommend you try it for yourself to see how great this product really is.</li>
            <li>So--when I saw the ad for BEST age remover, I figured that the outcome would be more of the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Best Age Spot Remover twice a per day for the last week</li>
            <li>Truthfully I have noticed No difference at all.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on my third jar of Best Age Spot Remover.  </li>
            <li>As my 5 sisters like to continually remind me, I&#x27;m the oldest in the family :-)</li>
            <li>Their customer service is superb and even if my spots never go away, I will still use the product as a daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li>and I put more in those two spots and let my skin absorb it, like for about 30-45 minutes then continue on applying the rest of my make up.  </li>
            <li>does nothing a $7 purchase at the drug store is better.</li>
            <li>or not it is still ok to use.</li>
            <li>or not it is still ok to use.</li>
            <li>All spots have lightened and some very significantly.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>With BEST i can see an improvement pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for yourself, or a great gift.</li>
            <li>This is a good product at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied and I highly recommend Best Age Spot Remover because it really works!  </li>
            <li>They have before / after pictures, which look pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is the best product I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>I am so excited!  </li>
            <li>It is a smooth light cream that smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product and will remain a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>This was a great buy it completely removed age spot from my mother&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>Best Age Spot Remover does work gently &amp; I do not have any reaction to the cream.  </li>
            <li>The spots are not gone completely, but are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth cream feel of the product.</li>
            <li>after seeing all the positive reviews i decided to try best age and  am surprisingly happy.didn&#x27;t think it would work, but after almost a month of using it as prescribed, my lines are less noticeable(around my eyes).</li>
            <li>I have been using the Best, I having seen  any huge results, but I am going to keep on using it until the jar is empty.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE AS</li>
            <li>This product is easy to put on once a day, at night.</li>
            <li>This cream has greatly improved the texture of my skin, and made for a much more even skin tone, making my hands look younger!</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell</li>
            <li>I received my merchandise, so far so good, be sure while using this product, you apply a sunscreen during the day, and a nite cream at night.</li>
            <li>Okay I admit I am a true skeptic</li>
            <li>This is the best dark spot corrector I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The spots on my hands are starting to fade more and more, and I must say, its a welcome change to success</li>
            <li>This product lightened age spots, freckles, skin blotches as well as removed fine lines.</li>
            <li>It has been the best non RX I&#x27;ve tried, however, the spot on the forehead is pretty big and still there.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if I were more consistent with applying every day the age spots would fade more rapidly.</li>
            <li>(Almost half of my two ounce jar of Best Age Spot Remover remains).</li>
            <li>However, after using it for a little over a month I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I cant believe that I found this cream for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>and I even suggest a friend great result definitely recommend any one if they have any problem</li>
            <li>But this cream showed the most efficient impact on my face , it is the Best so far, and I have ordered 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>My spots do get lighter but when they get to be light brown</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the fact its not greasy and the price is affordable.</li>
            <li>A few months ago I ordered a jar of BEST age spot remover from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I hope my friends will enjoy the gift.</li>
            <li>I have age spots on my hands (sun damage) and have been using this primarily on my hands every day for about a month.</li>
            <li>but I liked the cream so much I&#x27;m using it as an all over moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I see a noticable fading of the most distinct sun spots.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally found something that is working for &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Although a bit early in use, I like this product -- feels good and spots are fading.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind it as it is good on my skin so far.</li>
            <li>So far, so good...</li>
            <li>The product went right into my skin and did not &#x27;sit on top&#x27; and make my face feel like it needed to be washed again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to find something that really works and is nice to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly recommendable because of its great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>(this is my 3rd jar and I have ordered another already) and the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited and grateful for this product.</li>
            <li>Check out the five star reviews and see how many have exactly one review to their name.</li>
            <li>Significant reduction in the color of the spot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>Have been using about seven weeks and has significantly reduced age spots.</li>
            <li>just smooth cool and creamy.  </li>
            <li>The gross liver spot lookin hands now look so much better - thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>The age spots on my face by my eyes have gotten lighter but like I wrote, I need to be more consistent with applying the cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it until I&#x27;ve finished the jar, but I&#x27;ll invest my money for laser treatments which in the past have worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>Company had even contacted me about 2 weeks or so after my purchase to make sure I was satisfied with the product but at that time it was to early to tell.  </li>
            <li>my skin absorbed it easily.  </li>
            <li>I chose it after reading many of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I saw the small print under the bright red BEST on the front of the jar.  </li>
            <li>my lite brown spots are now bright RED</li>
            <li>I have almost leopard spots on my left arm from driving and Best even fades that to the point that I can barely see them.</li>
            <li>IT TURNED MY SKIN BRIGHT RED</li>
            <li>Mine is a lot darker so need professional treatment of some kind.</li>
            <li>....as I continued to use this product...after a couple of weeks I noticed that my face looked smooth and fresh</li>
            <li>My fair skin only burns, does not tan.</li>
            <li>and I will be needing a full refund for it.</li>
            <li>just right in the light to see the spot.  </li>
            <li>initially experienced tightest around the head, and other indescribable feelings, after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was not greasy like some of the other ones and it just worked great.</li>
            <li>Skin never turned red or scaled, just gradually looked better and better.  </li>
            <li>A MORNING QUICK RUB</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many supposed spot removers over the years, and still had one big age spot on the side of my face the size of a nickel.</li>
            <li>Must use as directed to see mild change over time.</li>
            <li>I have been using Best Age for a month now, targeting specific spots and using ONLY at night.</li>
            <li>- I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a huge difference, but I don&#x27;t use it as consistently</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight cream; absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit suspect when you have 40 reviews appear in the first two weeks of selling this product, and no reviews for a month after that?!?  </li>
            <li>I saw significant results within the first four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure most of the reviews for this product is bogus because it simply doesn&#x27;t work for age spots.</li>
            <li>The product is comfortable to use and has certainly reduced the color intensity of the spots.  </li>
            <li>So far the best cream for Age spots Issues, it gradually lighted the color of the spots after a few weeks of using.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is fast and care about my results with this product, ordering was secure and</li>
            <li>I must say that the product itself comes in a very generous size jar, does not have any noticeable odor and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>As far as we are concerned, there&#x27;s nothing better anywhere.</li>
            <li>For me, this is definitely worth the $.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and spent years in the sun with never using sun block or protecting myself.</li>
            <li>It was very reasonably priced and shipped out to me quickly.  </li>
            <li>came quick and was exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li>However, to my delight, the spot began to fade quickly; it&#x27;s about 2/3 gone, and I just finished the first jar.</li>
            <li>Good product, my aunt told me about it, she said it wasnt greasy like the other products i was using</li>
            <li>I consider this good news and suggest other men try it.    </li>
            <li>It does exactly what is says it will do for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>THE BEFORE PICTURE IS THE RIGHT HAND, AND</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Seems to have hit a plateau right now, but maybe there will be a slower decrease - hopefully so.</li>
            <li>I used this product after I had a spot on my face right under where I wear my glasses.</li>
            <li>I noticed a discount code for this product and ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Go have chemical peels done or order the chemical peel and do it yourself to get rid of dark spots and use a good spf lotion</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and a lot of dark spots.  </li>
            <li>but I think I need a little more time to be sure.</li>
            <li>Once the cream has been absorbed I put a layer of my Aveeno tinted facial cream with an spf of 30 on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase a fresh jar, as the reasonable  price makes it well worth it.</li>
            <li>I will purchase a fresh jar, as the reasonable  price makes it well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it over-lightening the surrounding area.</li>
            <li>And it also had very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and it shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>it removed all of his age spot, he looks younger than me now :)</li>
            <li>but willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>I am getting married this September</li>
            <li>i thought wow $5.00 that is extremely cheap why not try it out?</li>
            <li>At first I was using it twice a day and started to see results within a week.  </li>
            <li>For personal reasons I neglected to stay on top of it</li>
            <li>the results I have been getting from this product have been pretty consistent and noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it pretty faithfully each night and sometimes twice a day.</li>
            <li>please be aware of this product  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly, but there was no change at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Linked to cancer and organ-system toxicity, it is one of the most toxic ingredients used in personal care products.</li>
            <li>This product removed age spots on my face and this product really WORKS!</li>
            <li>Many are reviewing the same products with 5 star ratings as well.</li>
            <li>It is much better than all the big name brands I used before.</li>
            <li>Not only did it not work, I am convinced my spots are more noticeable now than before I used the product.</li>
            <li>and I would have NOT ordered this in the first place</li>
            <li>I should have had my glasses on when I first ordered it.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>jar is pretty generous.</li>
            <li>Tried it the second day to make sure and again, redness and a bit of a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used the product.  </li>
            <li>you SO much, M  &amp; M Beauty and Wellness and Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending so fast!</li>
            <li>After the first jar (about a two month supply)</li>
            <li>but at our reunion this year, I was the only one who didn&#x27;t have any age spots :-)</li>
            <li>This is the first age spot remover I have tried.</li>
            <li>The best method is to apply twice a day without fail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line is it works if applied consistently, be patient and give it some time..</li>
            <li>because I saw that some people quit using it because it made the spots darker at first.  </li>
            <li>My hands are looking softer and, I am hesitant to say, because, to me...an RN,  the spots really are fading so soon!  </li>
            <li>sure to wash the area clean of any other cosmetics, oils, lotions etc before application so that the cream is actually applied to the skin instead of on top of another</li>
            <li>There doing fast shipping right now.</li>
            <li>Left my age spots irritated &amp; bright red, would never buy again.  </li>
            <li>The product does not work in line with positive reviews.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t believe me click for yourself on any one of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>THE MANUFACTURE HAD EMPLOYEES/FRIENDS GIVE POSITIVE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li>But the first day when I used this, it hurt my skin so much.</li>
            <li>I have just about used the first jar and it is really working.  </li>
            <li>This product was not at all effective for my dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I received it three days earlier then the estimated arrival, which I was very pleased with, and not only did i use it,</li>
            <li>On second jar, worked great on dark spots I have on my face and on my hands.  </li>
            <li>There comes a time when you hit a certain age</li>
            <li>am certainly considering canceling my Amazon account and credit card and buying elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I certainly would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;No side effects noted</li>
            <li>This was an impulse purchase and I am using it on a large age spot on my hand.  </li>
            <li>and I made certain I stayed out of the sun.</li>
            <li>Bought this item after reading the positive reviews, but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream only about three weeks and can already see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It is non greasy and really lightens all kinds of discolorations</li>
            <li>my dad bought this 2 weeks ago and it worked very well</li>
            <li>the shipping was so fast it came after 5 days.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and the fact it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>A product that really works.  </li>
            <li>I really cannot tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I swear to you this really does work.</li>
            <li>Thank you Age Spots for getting your product here so fast,</li>
            <li>It really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how fast and</li>
            <li>I really do believe this product will get me there,</li>
            <li>I really like this age spot remover.</li>
            <li>It has really improved my skin and discoloration.</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>and she loves it as its not too much oily</li>
            <li>so I stumbled upon this product it was reasonable priced</li>
            <li>and it really cleared up the places on my face.</li>
            <li>They have become somewhat lighter; they might not ever really fade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  A representative for the company contacted us and was very concerned about the result we had with the product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to return the unused portion per your 30 day satisfaction</li>
            <li>The price is in the reasonable range.</li>
            <li>If this occurs will readily give you a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use it to see if it really works.  </li>
            <li>really works, I&#x27;m 67 yrs.old  with sun damaged skin, &amp;#34;liver/age&amp;#34; spots.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I will use the whole jar</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and really lightens all kinds of discolorations</li>
            <li>It is important to apply and rub into spots 2 times per day to actually see results.</li>
            <li>Also, kudos to the seller because the product arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts but this stuff really worked.  </li>
            <li>A real bargain that works over a period of time.</li>
            <li>The Best Age Spot Remover not only lighten my age spots within a few but also smoothed my entire face.</li>
            <li>This age spot remover really works.</li>
            <li>This really does work</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I saw results even faster.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this product which works very well.</li>
            <li>Both fore arms are now much lighter in color.</li>
            <li>All spots but one  are still visible but much  lighter.</li>
            <li>My wife got it and it really helped with her wrinkles.</li>
            <li>THE INFORMATION ON THE BOX/LABEL DIDN&#x27;T REALLY TELL YOU ANYTHING</li>
            <li>this stuff did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>I have not seen much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>I got this product looking at number reviews that really saw the difference.  </li>
            <li>Follow up call was appreciated...</li>
            <li>I had 2 very noticeable age spots on my face on my temple.</li>
            <li>This one really works.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work much on me</li>
            <li>Am so impressed about this product: / almost gone my dark spots</li>
            <li>I had basically given up, and just kept adding more and more concealers over the spot, which, of course, just made it look worse.</li>
            <li>The application is quick and easy and leaves no greasy mess when applied.</li>
            <li>The doc told me that&#x27;s very normal and means it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>This product was very effective in fading some very dark spots on my hands in a very short time.  </li>
            <li>I had an old stain and it got it right up.</li>
            <li>Many other products smell toxic-this does not.</li>
            <li>BUT to be FAIR, it did the Job for much less money than Dermato&#x27;s Laser Offer !!!</li>
            <li>I was a teenage sun goddess and needed to undo a lot of sun damage that started becoming visible in my early 30s.</li>
            <li>Short of an expensive peel, BEST really does make the brown spots on my face fade.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will lighten the dark spots some more.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t completely finished the first jar, and I have seen a reduction in size and darkness where I have been applying.</li>
            <li>I would not mind to mailing you back the rest of the jar for a full credit.</li>
            <li>Not only did my age spots fade, but it left my face very smooth.</li>
            <li>very useful, it can Substantially improve the overall appearance of skin pigmentation,  reduce age and liver spots, and removed age spot, one of my friends started to use it from last month, and recommended it highly, it is worth a try</li>
            <li>You will not find a better product that does half of this for this price.</li>
            <li>This lightens slightly but prescription strength (4 percent) which I used once was much better.  </li>
            <li>And to top it all off, I still have half of my jar leftover.</li>
            <li>This has shown more results with less use.</li>
            <li>Quickly followed by another 20 reviews in a second one week time span?  </li>
            <li>I only gave it one star because it arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>tried many products and this one actually does what it says--would continue buying it in the future--</li>
            <li>The health gurus say not to use a product with the main ingredient in this one.  </li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and my facial skin and neck and chest area are now free from blemishes and sun damage (from youth) freckles.  </li>
            <li>One thing I suggest is that at night especially, I do not apply my regular lotion on top.</li>
            <li>After just shy of two months, though, I&#x27;m to see more and more improvement.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, it looks like they were all posted right on top of each other.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;many, many cream products make claims that are not true....</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say that my dark spots are gone, but are much lighter so they easily cover with makeup now.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it for all you</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend..</li>
            <li>it was little overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li>But after using it my skin felt little irritated for a while and then was ok and after a while</li>
            <li>i see no reason to continue to use this product when there has been absolutely no change in even my most lightest and barely there spots!</li>
            <li>this really helped lighten  age spots on face and  completely removed them for the price</li>
            <li>After using this product for two weeks on clean dry skin, twice a day -I can report the results now.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much unscented so not offensive as some facial care products are.  </li>
            <li>The areas I needed help w/ were the top of each hand &amp; a few (humiliating) spots on my face.</li>
            <li>Need to use it a few more days to write a review</li>
            <li>So it is fairly simple to use and seems to be working for me, so I would recommend it being worth a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only drawback, and frankly it isn&#x27;t enough to even make me consider not using it, is the fact that the odor is quite strong and more than a little off-putting.  </li>
            <li>the spots are virtually impossible to see in bright light with a magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>The spot comes right back even with sunscreen if you stop.</li>
            <li>I have just ordered a new jar.  </li>
            <li>There is a very light smell, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I gave the product a good 2 months of applying it very constant ( at least 2 times a day ) and bed time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a very fast acting mover unlike the others.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(I have VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>The places do turn dark, which at first worried me, but then I realized that the product acts as an effolient and the spots literally rub right off.  </li>
            <li>At first, I saw very little change, but since using twice a day, I have noticed a significant lightening in my sun/age spots.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying the cream to a large red spot on my right cheek and several sun spots on my face and chest.  </li>
            <li>First, they all read like they were written by the same person.</li>
            <li>Seriously, do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>ALL reviewed the exact same group of products (giving them five stars as well!).</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>In comparison to other products, I would definitely say it is much better.  </li>
            <li>I am so-so-so surprised that this cream performs so well!</li>
            <li>but it is far too soon to know if it is working as it takes 4-6 weeks to show results!</li>
            <li>My second jar just arrived ( as promptly as the first one ), and I&#x27;m looking forward to this jar finishing off the job!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have used other more expensive products with no results.  </li>
            <li>The U.S. Cosmetics Ingredients Review Panel indicates that hydroquinone is unsafe for use in products that are left on the skin [1,2], but because of lax enforcement, directions for skin-lightening products containing hydroquinone encourage frequent and consistent use on the skin [3].</li>
            <li>I was using mornings and evenings the first six weeks but now using only evenings to eliminate a few remaining light spots.</li>
            <li>I have noticed several smaller and lighter spots are almost gone and what is left of them are easily covered by makeup.</li>
            <li>I have been treating one large spot on the back of my hand.  </li>
            <li>I have not finished the pot yet and am just concentrating on a smaller area where the more stubborn pigmentation is still a bit visible (if you really look hard), and it keeps improving every day.</li>
            <li>This clearly is a scam.</li>
            <li>It works on my skin so well that I don&#x27;t even look at the pricier &#x27;clear skin&#x27; products.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product - my ugly spots are gone</li>
            <li>Im using for 1 month and clear 50% my sun and acné spots</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a 62 year old self contious guy and couldn&#x27;t beleive i had age spots of all places, on my frigging head for all to see.</li>
            <li>This product makes me look young because it removed age spot on parts of my face with severe wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This almost completely removed age spot that I had.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a topical creme to see if they really worked.  </li>
            <li>only up really close</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried similar products that were very greasy.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it all up to give complete try.</li>
            <li>So far this is the &amp;#34; best&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Did not find any difference after using for nearly 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I have developed a burning sensation so I will probably stop using&lt;br /&gt;it.  </li>
            <li>This product really works my age spots are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>It could not erase the age spots yet ( at least in my case), I think that you have to accept the nature&#x27;s rule, it is age and health issues, not for one cream to play all the magic.</li>
            <li>With my sensitive skin I am cautious of which products I can use.  </li>
            <li>but I want completely gone.  </li>
            <li>So far haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and home remedies to reduce the appearance of my \\&quot;experience spots\\&quot; but nothing really blew them away like this age spot remover.  </li>
            <li>As the days went by I could tell the spot was lightening and on the 30th day I had no need to reapply the cream because the spot was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 3 months</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re in our early 60&#x27;s and</li>
            <li>It completely removed her age spots.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for it to disappear completely.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to friends and family if they wish to stay looking young.</li>
            <li>The marks are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in a very short time but wanted to see how well it would really work before I reviewed it.</li>
            <li>This product completely removed my age spot on my forehead that ive had for years.</li>
            <li>So far there is no improvement.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, after continued use they will disappear completely.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft on the locations that I apply this cream to.</li>
            <li>Took awhile to see the difference, but it really did make one totally go away.</li>
            <li>The spots are definitely fading away and are MUCH easier to cover.</li>
            <li>The contrast between my natural color and the spots has reduced 50%.    </li>
            <li>this has not worked so far for me.</li>
            <li>I find it very encouraging with the results and especially that the lighter spots have almost disappeared so I am sticking with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or loaded with scent.  </li>
            <li>My age spots are definately less dark and not standing out so much any more.</li>
            <li>so not sure if it really works or is strong enough yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on my face where I had large areas with very visible dark spots (melasma)</li>
            <li>In the first month I could tell a pretyy big difference but after my third month the spots aren&#x27;t noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>large size---lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I put the sunscreen on top of product after I let it dry a little.  </li>
            <li>i only looked at positive reviews and no further-but have used this product several times a day for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>It removed all the aged spots on my body and for that I am really thankful!</li>
            <li>After a little over three weeks of use,the light brown spots on my left hand are now gone.</li>
            <li>I noticed I am using less makeup now due to the better color it is giving me.</li>
            <li>on my second jar and think I can see a real difference on my arms,hand &amp; face.&lt;br /&gt;Not all spots respond the same</li>
            <li>But A+ for standing behind the product !&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I think it only fair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed my rating to 4 stars instead of 5 because I expected a little more change than I currently see.</li>
            <li>I will tell you something CLEAR later on.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my husband so far he likes it no irritation , at this time i ca not comment for benefit further .</li>
            <li>I would say that it works, not as fast as I expected however.</li>
            <li>Hoping in the next 3 weeks spots may be completely gone.</li>
            <li>Caution, used on my face and got a rash which apparently has been known to happen.</li>
            <li>You can barely tell I have used any of the cream</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 weeks so far and my age spots are already starting to fade.</li>
            <li>The first month I didn&#x27;t see results, but couple weeks ago dark spots of my face started to be lighter and lighter..</li>
            <li>One thing I want to mention, if your spots become red with the first few applications, I believe this is normal and it improves with use.</li>
            <li>One thing I want to mention, if your spots become red with the first few applications, I believe this is normal and it improves with use.</li>
            <li>Used it on a sun spot on my hand and well as a little sun kiss under my right eye.  </li>
            <li>Have been using spot remover for a little over 2 weeks and the spots on my face and arm are more than half faded from what they were.  </li>
            <li>The age spots on my right hand are numerous and dark.  </li>
            <li>At first, like I&#x27;ve seen from other reviewers, I was starting to feel disgruntled, but I just kept on with my regimen of morning and night.</li>
            <li>I had two very large age spots on my checks and no matter what I put on it and believe me I have used quite a few products trying to get rid of them never worked.</li>
            <li>It works fast too, faster than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate getting to try this and will continue to try on some other spots.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t  used  it long enough to rate high</li>
            <li>so the due date for the return policy would expire and sure enough I&#x27;m not able to return this</li>
            <li>Large brown spot on fore ARM turned red, pink and finally vanished...</li>
            <li>Like some other reviewers, I have noticed some disturbing trends with the many positive reviews of this product.</li>
            <li>It really reduces the sign of dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>it has lighten up my dark spots so much.</li>
            <li>The dark spots are really lightening up.</li>
            <li>I dab it on my individual spots with a cotton swab lightly but thick enough</li>
            <li>The other &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; thing about it (and main reason I bought it):  no animal testing.  </li>
            <li>but I could see a small difference right away</li>
            <li>Have not really noticed too much lighting on age spots, must take a long time to work, am using twice a day but still see all the colored age spots on face</li>
            <li>I give 3 star rating because I like the quick response from the seller and the refund after I complained.</li>
            <li>delivery was quick as my order was priced less than other competing products.</li>
            <li>they obviously were aware that there was an issue with their product and they don&#x27;t want amazon to remove them-i contacted amazon as these people have already wasted enough of my time and my dimes!</li>
            <li>It is a slow process but much better than previous inexpensive cream from drugstore.</li>
            <li>I also have some very light, faint spots and this cream didn&#x27;t even help that.</li>
            <li>The dark spots from acne are fading away even the older ones</li>
            <li>It seems to dry quickly and since you apply it before your moisturizer, I wait a little bit for it to dry then put moisturizer on.</li>
            <li>Due to my darker skin color i was down to my last straw in finding the right cream.</li>
            <li>This product does not work has a very bad smell their customer service is very good</li>

            <li> Note effective at all.  </li>
            <li> I was considering purchasing this product based on all the good reviews alone, then I examined the reviews more closely.</li>
            <li> though price was great and quick</li>
            <li> I do follow this during the day with a strong sun block - don&#x27;t want to undo all good</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be more effective with the twice a day application.  </li>
            <li> just a nice healthy glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be most effectively when used EVERY day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now it is a really great price.</li>
            <li> Best Age Spot Remover was a quick, effective and positive solution to my skin woes, and also helped with wrinkles.</li>

            <li> I really appreciate the timely manner in which M&amp;M Beauty and Wellness filled my order of Best Age Spot Remover.  </li>
            <li> The cream is not heavy and very pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> So, all in all, worth a try as it is inexpensive and somehwat effective!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not totally gone (and may never be - too soon to tell), but I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far and have recommended Best to my mom as well and would to anyone else who asked.</li>

            <li> My mom is pleased with it</li>
            <li> When this stuff is available, you gotta get it!</li>
            <li> Thanks for this great product.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with it as soon as I tried it actually.</li>
            <li> This product had fast shipping at a great price and best of all it was not greasy when I applied it directly on my facial skin!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to safely remove age spots.</li>
            <li> this point, I can only comment on the timeliness of my shipment, and for that, it was excellent.</li>
            <li> glad I bought two jars...</li>
            <li> and I must say that i love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to see what results more continuous use brings.</li>
            <li> The many \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; who gave it five stars</li>
            <li> Just like a couple of people said, most of the reviews were written by the people who did not buy the product at all.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a top rated fade cream and thought this looked interesting till I studied the reviews.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on the top of my hands to see if it would work and to see if I would have any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe a dermatologist might be better, and it is permanent.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> It sure did, it lightened the age spot i had</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s probably a lot better off than you were before you started using the product.</li>
            <li> For $30 and all its claims, this should work better.  </li>
            <li> Many days I even re-applied it, but with no change.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all after I have tried for three weeks sincerely.</li>
            <li> Bought something else that works better.</li>
            <li> After a month of using it to remove some age spots near my mouth, I noticed an incredible thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to report that after the month and applying the cream twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have just ordered more jars.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could give it 10 stars...or 20...or 100  :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li> but I think my spots are lighter  ...  :)</li>
            <li> At such a great price too!</li>
            <li> Well, When this stuff is available, you gotta get it!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is great and adds exuberance to my skin, it works very well for removing my age spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this stuff.</li>
            <li> For the price this is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many creams and lotions to remove my age spots.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> She feels a lot better about herself.</li>
            <li> and I recommend you try it for yourself to see how great this product really is.</li>
            <li> So--when I saw the ad for BEST age remover, I figured that the outcome would be more of the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Best Age Spot Remover twice a per day for the last week</li>
            <li> Truthfully I have noticed No difference at all.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my third jar of Best Age Spot Remover.  </li>
            <li> As my 5 sisters like to continually remind me, I&#x27;m the oldest in the family :-)</li>
            <li> Their customer service is superb and even if my spots never go away, I will still use the product as a daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li> and I put more in those two spots and let my skin absorb it, like for about 30-45 minutes then continue on applying the rest of my make up.  </li>
            <li> does nothing a $7 purchase at the drug store is better.</li>
            <li> or not it is still ok to use.</li>
            <li> or not it is still ok to use.</li>
            <li> All spots have lightened and some very significantly.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> With BEST i can see an improvement pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for yourself, or a great gift.</li>
            <li> This is a good product at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied and I highly recommend Best Age Spot Remover because it really works!  </li>
            <li> They have before / after pictures, which look pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is the best product I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li> I am so excited!  </li>
            <li> It is a smooth light cream that smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product and will remain a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy it completely removed age spot from my mother&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Best Age Spot Remover does work gently &amp; I do not have any reaction to the cream.  </li>
            <li> The spots are not gone completely, but are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth cream feel of the product.</li>
            <li> after seeing all the positive reviews i decided to try best age and  am surprisingly happy.didn&#x27;t think it would work, but after almost a month of using it as prescribed, my lines are less noticeable(around my eyes).</li>
            <li> I have been using the Best, I having seen  any huge results, but I am going to keep on using it until the jar is empty.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE AS</li>
            <li> This product is easy to put on once a day, at night.</li>
            <li> This cream has greatly improved the texture of my skin, and made for a much more even skin tone, making my hands look younger!</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell</li>
            <li> I received my merchandise, so far so good, be sure while using this product, you apply a sunscreen during the day, and a nite cream at night.</li>
            <li> Okay I admit I am a true skeptic</li>
            <li> This is the best dark spot corrector I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The spots on my hands are starting to fade more and more, and I must say, its a welcome change to success</li>
            <li> This product lightened age spots, freckles, skin blotches as well as removed fine lines.</li>
            <li> It has been the best non RX I&#x27;ve tried, however, the spot on the forehead is pretty big and still there.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if I were more consistent with applying every day the age spots would fade more rapidly.</li>
            <li> (Almost half of my two ounce jar of Best Age Spot Remover remains).</li>
            <li> However, after using it for a little over a month I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I cant believe that I found this cream for such a great price.  </li>
            <li> and I even suggest a friend great result definitely recommend any one if they have any problem</li>
            <li> But this cream showed the most efficient impact on my face , it is the Best so far, and I have ordered 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> My spots do get lighter but when they get to be light brown</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the fact its not greasy and the price is affordable.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I ordered a jar of BEST age spot remover from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I hope my friends will enjoy the gift.</li>
            <li> I have age spots on my hands (sun damage) and have been using this primarily on my hands every day for about a month.</li>
            <li> but I liked the cream so much I&#x27;m using it as an all over moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I see a noticable fading of the most distinct sun spots.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally found something that is working for &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Although a bit early in use, I like this product -- feels good and spots are fading.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind it as it is good on my skin so far.</li>
            <li> So far, so good...</li>
            <li> The product went right into my skin and did not &#x27;sit on top&#x27; and make my face feel like it needed to be washed again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to find something that really works and is nice to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s highly recommendable because of its great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> (this is my 3rd jar and I have ordered another already) and the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited and grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> Check out the five star reviews and see how many have exactly one review to their name.</li>
            <li> Significant reduction in the color of the spot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Have been using about seven weeks and has significantly reduced age spots.</li>
            <li> just smooth cool and creamy.  </li>
            <li> The gross liver spot lookin hands now look so much better - thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> The age spots on my face by my eyes have gotten lighter but like I wrote, I need to be more consistent with applying the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it until I&#x27;ve finished the jar, but I&#x27;ll invest my money for laser treatments which in the past have worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Company had even contacted me about 2 weeks or so after my purchase to make sure I was satisfied with the product but at that time it was to early to tell.  </li>
            <li> my skin absorbed it easily.  </li>
            <li> I chose it after reading many of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I saw the small print under the bright red BEST on the front of the jar.  </li>
            <li> my lite brown spots are now bright RED</li>
            <li> I have almost leopard spots on my left arm from driving and Best even fades that to the point that I can barely see them.</li>
            <li> IT TURNED MY SKIN BRIGHT RED</li>
            <li> Mine is a lot darker so need professional treatment of some kind.</li>
            <li> ....as I continued to use this product...after a couple of weeks I noticed that my face looked smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> My fair skin only burns, does not tan.</li>
            <li> and I will be needing a full refund for it.</li>
            <li> just right in the light to see the spot.  </li>
            <li> initially experienced tightest around the head, and other indescribable feelings, after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not greasy like some of the other ones and it just worked great.</li>
            <li> Skin never turned red or scaled, just gradually looked better and better.  </li>
            <li> A MORNING QUICK RUB</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many supposed spot removers over the years, and still had one big age spot on the side of my face the size of a nickel.</li>
            <li> Must use as directed to see mild change over time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Best Age for a month now, targeting specific spots and using ONLY at night.</li>
            <li> - I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a huge difference, but I don&#x27;t use it as consistently</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight cream; absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit suspect when you have 40 reviews appear in the first two weeks of selling this product, and no reviews for a month after that?!?  </li>
            <li> I saw significant results within the first four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure most of the reviews for this product is bogus because it simply doesn&#x27;t work for age spots.</li>
            <li> The product is comfortable to use and has certainly reduced the color intensity of the spots.  </li>
            <li> So far the best cream for Age spots Issues, it gradually lighted the color of the spots after a few weeks of using.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is fast and care about my results with this product, ordering was secure and</li>
            <li> I must say that the product itself comes in a very generous size jar, does not have any noticeable odor and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> As far as we are concerned, there&#x27;s nothing better anywhere.</li>
            <li> For me, this is definitely worth the $.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and spent years in the sun with never using sun block or protecting myself.</li>
            <li> It was very reasonably priced and shipped out to me quickly.  </li>
            <li> came quick and was exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li> However, to my delight, the spot began to fade quickly; it&#x27;s about 2/3 gone, and I just finished the first jar.</li>
            <li> Good product, my aunt told me about it, she said it wasnt greasy like the other products i was using</li>
            <li> I consider this good news and suggest other men try it.    </li>
            <li> It does exactly what is says it will do for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> THE BEFORE PICTURE IS THE RIGHT HAND, AND</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> Seems to have hit a plateau right now, but maybe there will be a slower decrease - hopefully so.</li>
            <li> I used this product after I had a spot on my face right under where I wear my glasses.</li>
            <li> I noticed a discount code for this product and ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Go have chemical peels done or order the chemical peel and do it yourself to get rid of dark spots and use a good spf lotion</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and a lot of dark spots.  </li>
            <li> but I think I need a little more time to be sure.</li>
            <li> Once the cream has been absorbed I put a layer of my Aveeno tinted facial cream with an spf of 30 on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase a fresh jar, as the reasonable  price makes it well worth it.</li>
            <li> I will purchase a fresh jar, as the reasonable  price makes it well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it over-lightening the surrounding area.</li>
            <li> And it also had very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and it shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> it removed all of his age spot, he looks younger than me now :)</li>
            <li> but willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> I am getting married this September</li>
            <li> i thought wow $5.00 that is extremely cheap why not try it out?</li>
            <li> At first I was using it twice a day and started to see results within a week.  </li>
            <li> For personal reasons I neglected to stay on top of it</li>
            <li> the results I have been getting from this product have been pretty consistent and noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it pretty faithfully each night and sometimes twice a day.</li>
            <li> please be aware of this product  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, but there was no change at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Linked to cancer and organ-system toxicity, it is one of the most toxic ingredients used in personal care products.</li>
            <li> This product removed age spots on my face and this product really WORKS!</li>
            <li> Many are reviewing the same products with 5 star ratings as well.</li>
            <li> It is much better than all the big name brands I used before.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not work, I am convinced my spots are more noticeable now than before I used the product.</li>
            <li> and I would have NOT ordered this in the first place</li>
            <li> I should have had my glasses on when I first ordered it.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> jar is pretty generous.</li>
            <li> Tried it the second day to make sure and again, redness and a bit of a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used the product.  </li>
            <li> you SO much, M  &amp; M Beauty and Wellness and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending so fast!</li>
            <li> After the first jar (about a two month supply)</li>
            <li> but at our reunion this year, I was the only one who didn&#x27;t have any age spots :-)</li>
            <li> This is the first age spot remover I have tried.</li>
            <li> The best method is to apply twice a day without fail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line is it works if applied consistently, be patient and give it some time..</li>
            <li> because I saw that some people quit using it because it made the spots darker at first.  </li>
            <li> My hands are looking softer and, I am hesitant to say, because, to me...an RN,  the spots really are fading so soon!  </li>
            <li> sure to wash the area clean of any other cosmetics, oils, lotions etc before application so that the cream is actually applied to the skin instead of on top of another</li>
            <li> There doing fast shipping right now.</li>
            <li> Left my age spots irritated &amp; bright red, would never buy again.  </li>
            <li> The product does not work in line with positive reviews.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t believe me click for yourself on any one of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> THE MANUFACTURE HAD EMPLOYEES/FRIENDS GIVE POSITIVE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> But the first day when I used this, it hurt my skin so much.</li>
            <li> I have just about used the first jar and it is really working.  </li>
            <li> This product was not at all effective for my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I received it three days earlier then the estimated arrival, which I was very pleased with, and not only did i use it,</li>
            <li> On second jar, worked great on dark spots I have on my face and on my hands.  </li>
            <li> There comes a time when you hit a certain age</li>
            <li> am certainly considering canceling my Amazon account and credit card and buying elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I certainly would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;No side effects noted</li>
            <li> This was an impulse purchase and I am using it on a large age spot on my hand.  </li>
            <li> and I made certain I stayed out of the sun.</li>
            <li> Bought this item after reading the positive reviews, but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream only about three weeks and can already see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It is non greasy and really lightens all kinds of discolorations</li>
            <li> my dad bought this 2 weeks ago and it worked very well</li>
            <li> the shipping was so fast it came after 5 days.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the fact it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> A product that really works.  </li>
            <li> I really cannot tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I swear to you this really does work.</li>
            <li> Thank you Age Spots for getting your product here so fast,</li>

            <li> I really like this age spot remover.</li>

            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> and she loves it as its not too much oily</li>
            <li> so I stumbled upon this product it was reasonable priced</li>
            <li> and it really cleared up the places on my face.</li>
            <li> They have become somewhat lighter; they might not ever really fade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  A representative for the company contacted us and was very concerned about the result we had with the product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to return the unused portion per your 30 day satisfaction</li>
            <li> The price is in the reasonable range.</li>
            <li> If this occurs will readily give you a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use it to see if it really works.  </li>
            <li> really works, I&#x27;m 67 yrs.old  with sun damaged skin, &amp;#34;liver/age&amp;#34; spots.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I will use the whole jar</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and really lightens all kinds of discolorations</li>
            <li> It is important to apply and rub into spots 2 times per day to actually see results.</li>
            <li> Also, kudos to the seller because the product arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but this stuff really worked.  </li>
            <li> A real bargain that works over a period of time.</li>
            <li> The Best Age Spot Remover not only lighten my age spots within a few but also smoothed my entire face.</li>
            <li> This age spot remover really works.</li>
            <li> This really does work</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I saw results even faster.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product which works very well.</li>
            <li> Both fore arms are now much lighter in color.</li>
            <li> All spots but one  are still visible but much  lighter.</li>
            <li> My wife got it and it really helped with her wrinkles.</li>
            <li> THE INFORMATION ON THE BOX/LABEL DIDN&#x27;T REALLY TELL YOU ANYTHING</li>
            <li> this stuff did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> I have not seen much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I got this product looking at number reviews that really saw the difference.  </li>
            <li> Follow up call was appreciated...</li>
            <li> I had 2 very noticeable age spots on my face on my temple.</li>
            <li> This one really works.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work much on me</li>
            <li> Am so impressed about this product: / almost gone my dark spots</li>
            <li> I had basically given up, and just kept adding more and more concealers over the spot, which, of course, just made it look worse.</li>
            <li> The application is quick and easy and leaves no greasy mess when applied.</li>
            <li> The doc told me that&#x27;s very normal and means it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> This product was very effective in fading some very dark spots on my hands in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> I had an old stain and it got it right up.</li>
            <li> Many other products smell toxic-this does not.</li>
            <li> BUT to be FAIR, it did the Job for much less money than Dermato&#x27;s Laser Offer !!!</li>
            <li> I was a teenage sun goddess and needed to undo a lot of sun damage that started becoming visible in my early 30s.</li>
            <li> Short of an expensive peel, BEST really does make the brown spots on my face fade.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will lighten the dark spots some more.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t completely finished the first jar, and I have seen a reduction in size and darkness where I have been applying.</li>
            <li> I would not mind to mailing you back the rest of the jar for a full credit.</li>
            <li> Not only did my age spots fade, but it left my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> very useful, it can Substantially improve the overall appearance of skin pigmentation,  reduce age and liver spots, and removed age spot, one of my friends started to use it from last month, and recommended it highly, it is worth a try</li>
            <li> You will not find a better product that does half of this for this price.</li>
            <li> This lightens slightly but prescription strength (4 percent) which I used once was much better.  </li>
            <li> And to top it all off, I still have half of my jar leftover.</li>
            <li> This has shown more results with less use.</li>
            <li> Quickly followed by another 20 reviews in a second one week time span?  </li>
            <li> I only gave it one star because it arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> tried many products and this one actually does what it says--would continue buying it in the future--</li>
            <li> The health gurus say not to use a product with the main ingredient in this one.  </li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and my facial skin and neck and chest area are now free from blemishes and sun damage (from youth) freckles.  </li>
            <li> One thing I suggest is that at night especially, I do not apply my regular lotion on top.</li>
            <li> After just shy of two months, though, I&#x27;m to see more and more improvement.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, it looks like they were all posted right on top of each other.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;many, many cream products make claims that are not true....</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that my dark spots are gone, but are much lighter so they easily cover with makeup now.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it for all you</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend..</li>
            <li> it was little overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li> But after using it my skin felt little irritated for a while and then was ok and after a while</li>
            <li> i see no reason to continue to use this product when there has been absolutely no change in even my most lightest and barely there spots!</li>
            <li> this really helped lighten  age spots on face and  completely removed them for the price</li>
            <li> After using this product for two weeks on clean dry skin, twice a day -I can report the results now.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much unscented so not offensive as some facial care products are.  </li>
            <li> The areas I needed help w/ were the top of each hand &amp; a few (humiliating) spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Need to use it a few more days to write a review</li>
            <li> So it is fairly simple to use and seems to be working for me, so I would recommend it being worth a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback, and frankly it isn&#x27;t enough to even make me consider not using it, is the fact that the odor is quite strong and more than a little off-putting.  </li>
            <li> the spots are virtually impossible to see in bright light with a magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> The spot comes right back even with sunscreen if you stop.</li>
            <li> I have just ordered a new jar.  </li>
            <li> There is a very light smell, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a good 2 months of applying it very constant ( at least 2 times a day ) and bed time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a very fast acting mover unlike the others.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (I have VERY sensitive</li>
            <li> The places do turn dark, which at first worried me, but then I realized that the product acts as an effolient and the spots literally rub right off.  </li>
            <li> At first, I saw very little change, but since using twice a day, I have noticed a significant lightening in my sun/age spots.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying the cream to a large red spot on my right cheek and several sun spots on my face and chest.  </li>
            <li> First, they all read like they were written by the same person.</li>
            <li> Seriously, do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> ALL reviewed the exact same group of products (giving them five stars as well!).</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> In comparison to other products, I would definitely say it is much better.  </li>
            <li> I am so-so-so surprised that this cream performs so well!</li>
            <li> but it is far too soon to know if it is working as it takes 4-6 weeks to show results!</li>
            <li> My second jar just arrived ( as promptly as the first one ), and I&#x27;m looking forward to this jar finishing off the job!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have used other more expensive products with no results.  </li>
            <li> The U.S. Cosmetics Ingredients Review Panel indicates that hydroquinone is unsafe for use in products that are left on the skin [1,2], but because of lax enforcement, directions for skin-lightening products containing hydroquinone encourage frequent and consistent use on the skin [3].</li>
            <li> I was using mornings and evenings the first six weeks but now using only evenings to eliminate a few remaining light spots.</li>
            <li> I have noticed several smaller and lighter spots are almost gone and what is left of them are easily covered by makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been treating one large spot on the back of my hand.  </li>
            <li> I have not finished the pot yet and am just concentrating on a smaller area where the more stubborn pigmentation is still a bit visible (if you really look hard), and it keeps improving every day.</li>
            <li> This clearly is a scam.</li>
            <li> It works on my skin so well that I don&#x27;t even look at the pricier &#x27;clear skin&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product - my ugly spots are gone</li>
            <li> Im using for 1 month and clear 50% my sun and acné spots</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a 62 year old self contious guy and couldn&#x27;t beleive i had age spots of all places, on my frigging head for all to see.</li>
            <li> This product makes me look young because it removed age spot on parts of my face with severe wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This almost completely removed age spot that I had.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a topical creme to see if they really worked.  </li>
            <li> only up really close</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried similar products that were very greasy.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it all up to give complete try.</li>
            <li> So far this is the &amp;#34; best&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Did not find any difference after using for nearly 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I have developed a burning sensation so I will probably stop using&lt;br /&gt;it.  </li>
            <li> This product really works my age spots are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> It could not erase the age spots yet ( at least in my case), I think that you have to accept the nature&#x27;s rule, it is age and health issues, not for one cream to play all the magic.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin I am cautious of which products I can use.  </li>
            <li> but I want completely gone.  </li>
            <li> So far haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and home remedies to reduce the appearance of my \\&quot;experience spots\\&quot; but nothing really blew them away like this age spot remover.  </li>
            <li> As the days went by I could tell the spot was lightening and on the 30th day I had no need to reapply the cream because the spot was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 3 months</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re in our early 60&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> It completely removed her age spots.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for it to disappear completely.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to friends and family if they wish to stay looking young.</li>
            <li> The marks are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in a very short time but wanted to see how well it would really work before I reviewed it.</li>
            <li> This product completely removed my age spot on my forehead that ive had for years.</li>
            <li> So far there is no improvement.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, after continued use they will disappear completely.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft on the locations that I apply this cream to.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to see the difference, but it really did make one totally go away.</li>
            <li> The spots are definitely fading away and are MUCH easier to cover.</li>
            <li> The contrast between my natural color and the spots has reduced 50%.    </li>
            <li> this has not worked so far for me.</li>
            <li> I find it very encouraging with the results and especially that the lighter spots have almost disappeared so I am sticking with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or loaded with scent.  </li>
            <li> My age spots are definately less dark and not standing out so much any more.</li>
            <li> so not sure if it really works or is strong enough yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my face where I had large areas with very visible dark spots (melasma)</li>
            <li> In the first month I could tell a pretyy big difference but after my third month the spots aren&#x27;t noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> large size---lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I put the sunscreen on top of product after I let it dry a little.  </li>
            <li> i only looked at positive reviews and no further-but have used this product several times a day for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> It removed all the aged spots on my body and for that I am really thankful!</li>
            <li> After a little over three weeks of use,the light brown spots on my left hand are now gone.</li>
            <li> I noticed I am using less makeup now due to the better color it is giving me.</li>
            <li> on my second jar and think I can see a real difference on my arms,hand &amp; face.&lt;br /&gt;Not all spots respond the same</li>
            <li> But A+ for standing behind the product !&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I think it only fair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed my rating to 4 stars instead of 5 because I expected a little more change than I currently see.</li>
            <li> I will tell you something CLEAR later on.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband so far he likes it no irritation , at this time i ca not comment for benefit further .</li>
            <li> I would say that it works, not as fast as I expected however.</li>
            <li> Hoping in the next 3 weeks spots may be completely gone.</li>
            <li> Caution, used on my face and got a rash which apparently has been known to happen.</li>
            <li> You can barely tell I have used any of the cream</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks so far and my age spots are already starting to fade.</li>
            <li> The first month I didn&#x27;t see results, but couple weeks ago dark spots of my face started to be lighter and lighter..</li>
            <li> One thing I want to mention, if your spots become red with the first few applications, I believe this is normal and it improves with use.</li>
            <li> One thing I want to mention, if your spots become red with the first few applications, I believe this is normal and it improves with use.</li>
            <li> Used it on a sun spot on my hand and well as a little sun kiss under my right eye.  </li>
            <li> Have been using spot remover for a little over 2 weeks and the spots on my face and arm are more than half faded from what they were.  </li>
            <li> The age spots on my right hand are numerous and dark.  </li>
            <li> At first, like I&#x27;ve seen from other reviewers, I was starting to feel disgruntled, but I just kept on with my regimen of morning and night.</li>
            <li> I had two very large age spots on my checks and no matter what I put on it and believe me I have used quite a few products trying to get rid of them never worked.</li>
            <li> It works fast too, faster than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate getting to try this and will continue to try on some other spots.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t  used  it long enough to rate high</li>
            <li> so the due date for the return policy would expire and sure enough I&#x27;m not able to return this</li>
            <li> Large brown spot on fore ARM turned red, pink and finally vanished...</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I have noticed some disturbing trends with the many positive reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> It really reduces the sign of dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> it has lighten up my dark spots so much.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are really lightening up.</li>
            <li> I dab it on my individual spots with a cotton swab lightly but thick enough</li>
            <li> The other &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; thing about it (and main reason I bought it):  no animal testing.  </li>
            <li> but I could see a small difference right away</li>
            <li> Have not really noticed too much lighting on age spots, must take a long time to work, am using twice a day but still see all the colored age spots on face</li>
            <li> I give 3 star rating because I like the quick response from the seller and the refund after I complained.</li>
            <li> delivery was quick as my order was priced less than other competing products.</li>
            <li> they obviously were aware that there was an issue with their product and they don&#x27;t want amazon to remove them-i contacted amazon as these people have already wasted enough of my time and my dimes!</li>
            <li> It is a slow process but much better than previous inexpensive cream from drugstore.</li>
            <li> I also have some very light, faint spots and this cream didn&#x27;t even help that.</li>
            <li> The dark spots from acne are fading away even the older ones</li>
            <li> It seems to dry quickly and since you apply it before your moisturizer, I wait a little bit for it to dry then put moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> Due to my darker skin color i was down to my last straw in finding the right cream.</li>
            <li> This product does not work has a very bad smell their customer service is very good</li>
            <li> Click on the \\&quot;see my other reviews\\&quot; link on nearly any one of these reviewers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lightened and removed all the age spots so fast and that for such a small price.</li>
            <li> Maybe I want instant results but so far I don&#x27;t see any change dark spots while using this product.  </li>
            <li> Not completely, but perhaps with further use they may totally disappear.  </li>
            <li> Applying it this way, and only at night, it should last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using 2 times per day and I have noticed a considerable reduction in the dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks and my dark spots are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> The dark spots did not appear overnight, and I know that it will take some time for them to blend in with the natural color of my skin.</li>
            <li> After I had been using this for 2 days, I developed these dark spots over the spots I had.  </li>
            <li> I particularly notices to small age spots above my lip a couple of months ago.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase the product because of my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it EVERY day for over 2 months, just as the directions say (&amp;#34;thin layer, morning &amp; evening&amp;#34;) &amp; I guess the spots have faded a little -- but only a little.  </li>
            <li> As others have stated, this works where many other such creams have failed.</li>
            <li> My big surprise was the surrounding skin was totally unaffected !</li>
            <li> So far, have used a half of the jar, but did reorder to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Not only did it lighten my dark spots so that I can bare see them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks, and after following the directions (use twice daily, apply sunscreen) I have noticed a definite difference in the dark spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> It only lasted a few days and there were no other side effects so this did not bother me in the least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had spots on my cheeks for as long as i can remember, when i came across this product on amazon</li>
            <li> and I received it on the 27th, about 3 days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Took care of some developing wrinkles on my face, and I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As a long time</li>
            <li> I knew it would take a long time for any improvement.  </li>
            <li> some minor results and it made some spots a reddish color.  </li>
            <li> The largest spot is roughly the size of a dime and the smaller the size of my pinkie finger tip.</li>
            <li> They are not completely gone</li>
            <li> They are not completely gone</li>
            <li> Third, if you look into the previous reviews written by these reviewers, you will see a TON of the same products!  </li>
            <li> Finally there is an age spot remover that is not greasy and it not only lightened or removed age spots but actually faded small lines.  </li>
            <li> I have several types of skin discoloration due to age and hormones and after a month, none of them have faded at all.  </li>
            <li> i ordered a second bottle for any other spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually associated with use in skin lighteners, especially those products marketed to women of color, hydroquinone may also be a contaminant in other cosmetics ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only tried 1 other which did not work AT ALL even after 2 months of continuous use.  </li>
            <li> I also applied it to one forearm for a week and saw a definite lightening compared to the other forearm.</li>
            <li> I finished the whole jar but it did not change my dark spot even very little bit.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> I have a few larger spots clustered on my left cheek - the side that faces the driver window on my car, caused by sun damage from driving kids around for years.</li>
            <li> I used this product and got limited to no results.</li>
            <li> but I will get back into the routine, eager to be rid of the dark spots on my neck and arms from over exposure to sun in my youth.  </li>
            <li> This product has almost totally removed my dark spot.</li>
            <li> The larger darker ones are still there but not as dark as they were 5 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended to me as a possible was to lighten dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I tried several things that supposedly got rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> My dark spots were actually growing in number and darking</li>
            <li> Definitely saw my dark spots lighted up.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it will continue to fade the spots competely away, but based on what it had done so far, and the ease of use, I will stick with it!&lt;br /&gt;April</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it will continue to fade the spots competely away, but based on what it had done so far, and the ease of use, I will stick with it!&lt;br /&gt;April</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews because I&#x27;m busy, but I had to let you guys know</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised because you usually read everything about the product and it turns out to be hype.  </li>
            <li> These were just 4 spots, not very large and NOT super-dark.  </li>
            <li> it actually work i had black spots on my face it been using for 2 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using the cream, still have half a jar left.</li>
            <li> only drawback was a slight irritation, redness, but I did not use moisturizing cream as was recommended.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for an over the counter product, I am on my 2nd jar and can notice a difference help skin and makes spots less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was careless and only used sunscreen consistently on face, arms, and legs--not hands.</li>
            <li> Same ingredients and effect at half the cost &amp;#34</li>
            <li> I became lazy over the winter with using the product and think my larger age spots are getting darker, so I am back to using the product again.</li>
            <li> Also, I still have plenty of product left as I only  use it at night and on about four small areas on my face.</li>

            <li> Also, I still have plenty of product left as I only  use it at night and on about four small areas on my face.</li>
            <li> When I found this product on Amazon, at first I was doubtful, but I figured that 25.00 was worth the try.</li>
            <li> Applied a dab of the product, mostly on non-consecutive days, due to concerns regarding negative side effects, like Ochronosis, to the small brown spots, for no more than six hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> I wash my face and my skin felt very dry</li>
            <li> I had two dark spots, one in my left cheek and the other one on my nose</li>
            <li> The bigger ones are getting a little lighter.</li>
            <li> and I can actually see the dark spots on my face beginning to fade!</li>
            <li> Very simply, it did not work at all....not even a little bit...Period.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not real that this stuff works like it does.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product last night, so we&#x27;ll have to see in a few weeks/months.</li>
            <li> I have a few and my husband has several on his head</li>
            <li> READ THEM CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li> Had hoped this would actually get RID of a few age spots on my hand.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several which did nothing that I could see, and while it does require patience, the results were noticeable in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I saw her again a few days later and the age spots were gone -</li>
            <li> Not much smell</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> but I have been using this for only a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days and can already tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Saw absolutely no change after using for almost 2 months.</li>
            <li> I was careful to use sunscreen, though, because the product does induce photosensitivity.</li>
            <li> used every day for a month no real results did start to brake out.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different over the counter remedies for age spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Has the same active ingredient recommended by dermatologists (at least according to multiple web sites) but in a lower concentration.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other serums but never really saw any difference.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I bought this without looking at the reviews more carefully.</li>
            <li> I was struck down by a few viruses over the winter that kept me from caring about my appearance, but now am getting back on track again.</li>
            <li> I was struck down by a few viruses over the winter that kept me from caring about my appearance, but now am getting back on track again.</li>
            <li> So far, approximately three weeks, it has worked on some small spots, but has only slightly faded a couple of larger spots.  </li>
            <li> some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> At 45, I am beginning to notice a lot of imperfections in my skin on both my face and other areas of my body.  </li>
            <li> Other age spot treatment medications I have used had grease and gave me acne.</li>
            <li> Cream\\&quot; and a bunch of other \\&quot;Best\\&quot; products are all scams.</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone, tocopheral acetate, tocopheral, tocopheral linoleate, other ingredients with the root “toco”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do your research by checking the rave reviewers OTHER reviews.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not much to say except this product WORKS!</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams but haven&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> and it is not greasy like the other products I have used before.</li>
            <li> I only use a small dab also and it seems to work instead of over saturating the face and wasting the cream.</li>
            <li> While purchasing other thins I came across this product.  </li>
            <li> I am willong to give it one more month but up to this point I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> So I started applying it to the other forearm.</li>
            <li> This is so like other brands, no difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products.</li>
            <li> Plus a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to remove is the cream left behind.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist says it is because the active ingredients are drawn to a darker pigment so as the spot gets lighter</li>
            <li> This product really works and should be tried by all those who have trie other remedied for age spots and failed</li>
            <li> My former girlfriend had spots on her hands and used the product a month and the spots got lighter and you would be hard pressed to see them...</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that my husband thought the cream had an unpleasant smell, &amp; my dog thought it was really tasty</li>
            <li> I got your &amp;#34;Best Age Spot Remover&amp;#34; because of a dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of use I can&#x27;t see the dark spot on my neck anymore.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for my money.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a fanatic hand washer so for several days I would end up reapplying the cream because before I realized what I was doing</li>
            <li> I would recommend this lotion to anyone wanting to remove dark spots or scars.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave comments, but I just want people to know that not only does not this product work, but also dangerous.  </li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my forearms.</li>
            <li> This dark spot remover works.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are gone.</li>
            <li> All my dark spots are fading away.  </li>
            <li> i got the product today,by nighttime my dark spots on my hands were disappearing.</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my hands are &amp;#34;slowly&amp;#34; disappearing.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 2 weeks and have seen no difference in my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but the dark spots comes through the makeup</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want a lighter dark spot, I want a gone dark spot.  </li>
            <li> It was a dark spot, now, although the spot is still there, I need to hold the hand</li>
            <li> Dark spots seem to be lightening up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive broad-based laser (BBL)treatments and both prescription and over-the-counter fade creams, but this product really works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the spot remover for two months and have not seen any change whatsoever of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> This lightened the age spots I have had popping up over the last couple years and has even help a bit with some newly found wrinkles I was unhappy with.</li>
            <li> Have found that the sun spots have gone down by around 40% from where they started.</li>
            <li> you seen the White Squirrel?\\&quot; Well, just about everyone who likes this age spot remover also likes that book and several other random items.</li>
            <li> Slightly lightened dark spots on face, however after two weeks of using the product had to discontinue use because&lt;</li>
            <li> It was awful, the only one I had and on the middle of my right hand!</li>
            <li> I can see she has less wrinkles now.</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th week and spots have lighten by half.</li>
            <li> It did lighten about half the amount.</li>
            <li> did notice a slight drying out of the spot after about 10 days of application.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product less than a week and can already tell a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> less is more&lt;</li>
            <li> Yes, BBL is a 90% solution in 10 days, but it cost $500, it&#x27;s painful, you can&#x27;t use it near your eyes, and no matter what they say, there is no makeup on earth that can cover your face so you can appear in public for at least a week--and within a year, the spots were back.  </li>
            <li> as little as you have to use i would pay 100.00 for this little jar.</li>
            <li> On my face and neck, the spots look a little lighter, but I guess it will take time.</li>
            <li> been using over 1 1/2 months see a little difference.</li>
            <li> that were a little spot they told me to keep it and keep applying it</li>
            <li> Not quickly and not easily</li>
            <li> I have 2 spots on my cheekbone which were very dark.</li>
            <li> fading but still a few places that show even through foundation.</li>
            <li> I also applied it to a burn I received on my arm a few years ago hoping it would fade out the site.  </li>
            <li> so I have quite a few age/sun spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for the pass 6wks, didn&#x27;t do what it claim to do,  all I have to say is that I wasted my money.....</li>
            <li> I have a few on my face, but I have also put it on my arm.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste ur money on it.</li>
            <li> I used this to get ride a few wrinkles i had around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Noticed improvement after a few weeks of recommended use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and will add this to the numerous other products I&#x27;ve tried without success.</li>
            <li> I have used it faithfully everyday for three weeks+</li>
            <li> What a waste of $30.00.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea on my face to the point that I was forever looking sunburned even though I use a 110 SPF sunscreen everyday.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to put on foundation over a green concoction to reduce redness.  </li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;ll have a verdict in a few months.</li>
            <li> It is waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> but you have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It removed a number of dark sun spots, improved the texture of my skin and helped reduce the oil I usually fight with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and tried, but for me it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I noticed within a few days that it removed age spots I had as well as it is not greasy when you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> It does work if you keep using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> USED THE ITEM EVERYDAY FOR 2-1/2 MONTHS.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want people to buy this product and waste their money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months.  </li>
            <li> few things I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No results a lot of money waste of time.</li>
            <li> does not work waste of money</li>
            <li> According to directions, you only need to use a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to let everyone know a few things I found out from my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> This goes away in a few days and the spots begin lightening.  </li>
            <li> I put some on my hands and a few spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Probably used less than 1% of the amount that comes in the jar!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money folks-like other negative reviewers said-</li>
            <li> Over the two month period I have used the product I have seen considerable reduction in serious  age spots that have annoyed me for years.</li>
            <li> Hav been using 2xday fr approx 4 wks &amp; hav seen very slight lightening.</li>
            <li> So, as I&#x27;m not surprised it didn&#x27;t touch darkened spots, I can still give it a horrible review because it doesn&#x27;t handle light spots either.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if I will use it again and little hesitant to use it if it might cause damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> i usually put the cream before i go to sleep</li>
            <li> unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I suspect these reviews are fake for multiple reasons.</li>
            <li> , I prefer Olay just don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk!</li>
            <li> The writing style and dates of posting lead me to believe that these are not actual reviews but a blatant attempt to mislead Amazon shoppers.</li>
            <li> Further, they use those fake accounts to downgrade the reviews that tell the truth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product did lighten the small brown spots, but not a solution, for permanent elimination of the brown spots.</li>
            <li> one&lt;br /&gt;age spot and two small areas  of discoloration.  </li>
            <li> I think that it is lightening a stubborn spot on my face, but I&#x27;m not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> So needless to say i look and ever fell younger as my skin has even gotten lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m caucasian, not sure how it would work on darker skin</li>
            <li> not sure if it works</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it looks like the only solution is to go to the dermatologist if you want to really get rid of age spots.  :-(</li>
            <li> Used the whole jar and still have the spots that were the worst, they were lightened some but not gone.&lt;br /&gt;Did not reorder and the others are coming back now</li>
            <li> I decided a few months ago to seriously attempt to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> How long before they pull the same crap?</li>
            <li> I mix it with moisturizer or night cream when I feel that my skin looks dull.</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried others with hardly any results.</li>
            <li> Age spots are extremely hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes :(  </li>
            <li> You have to be diligent and apply it at least once a day.  </li>
            <li> I was dragged to dermatologist appointments, and forced to listen to paid programs for anti aging skin care products.</li>
            <li> I emphasize slowly.  </li>
            <li> The process is slow.</li>
            <li> The spots are fading slowly.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!!</li>
            <li> but I am somewhat disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> this raises serious questions for me.</li>
            <li> I always suspected these spot-removing products were a hoax until one day when I went on-line w/ a determination to do some serious research.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S working quickly without the awful smell</li>
            <li> I used a very expensive product before and got limited to no results.</li>
            <li> After almost 2 months, the results have been at least a 75 percent improvement on my hands, &amp; about 80 percent on my face!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a very hard person to satisfy with anything</li>
            <li> I have some tough spots from age and sun.  </li>
            <li> Very slow working.  </li>
            <li> Product seems to be working but very slow.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I had an age spot approximately the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li> It decreased my age spots, and helped with wrinkles too.  </li>
            <li> and  makes your face look worse</li>
            <li> Took about 3 weeks using the product overnight to work, but haven&#x27;t used it in a month and the spots haven&#x27;t gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> so I can see it, rather than so thin it is transparent.</li>
            <li> The tiniest thin dot of concealer now does the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I got rid of a bad age spot I couldn&#x27;t get rid of with other age spot removers.</li>
            <li> The other \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; creme smelled bad and I could see no visible results.  </li>
            <li> --they were NOT a good research group!</li>
            <li> Hate to think I spent $30 for nothing.</li>
            <li> I have porcelain like skin, but some evil sun spots/giant freckles were making an unwanted appearance over the past few years.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical until I tiried it myself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fake reviews.</li>
            <li> These reviews are so obviously fake, it&#x27;s laughable.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and still am, but I have to say that I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks now</li>
            <li> sorry,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this product is not working at all</li>
            <li> All reviews are fake.  </li>
            <li> I tried home remedies including lemon juice, expensive lotions, creams, and everything in between.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was skeptical about the product&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately Laser treatments are expensive.</li>
            <li> I thought I had gotten the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> People you wont go wrong try .</li>
            <li> WELL, NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE PRODUCT DID NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really sad</li>
            <li> so sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Product is expensive and</li>
            <li> She hit 50 and hated what 50 came with, wrinkles and dark spots!</li>
            <li> Expensive cold cream.</li>
            <li> contains dangerous ingredient for the skin</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy</li>
            <li> However, now that my skeptical husband has seen the results, he never complains about the scent!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I have seen no results!</li>
            <li> and my hands were really bad with sun spots.</li>
            <li> This smells so bad I can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> never again bad product</li>
            <li> cream I have used for fading those ugly brown spots.</li>
            <li> It may work for some, but I truly am disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Was rather disappointed with the result.</li>
            <li> It removed that stupid tattoo.</li>
            <li> and hate my brown spots on hands,face and wherever visible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , well that was me for about 3 years hated to go out.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awful.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible too.</li>
            <li> but nope, it just reeks of a nasty chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I still apply once or twice a day to my face to work on my smattering of freckles, and am now using it on my arms (for freckles and a nasty scar), followed by sunscreen.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product seems to work quite well.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changs but goes on nicely</li>
            <li> after 6 weeks of use twice a day, it has made no difference at all to either my hyperpigmentation or an age spot. .</li>
            <li> I got your &amp;#34;Best Age Spot Remover&amp;#34; because of a dark spot on my face. I started to use the cream once a day then twice a day every evening too. I began using it on my hand too. It works. I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> it actually work i had black spots on my face it been using for 2 months and i can see results. i usually put the cream before i go to sleep and sometime when i wake up. i put moisturize cream before i put this cream just in case i don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL , STILL SEEING RESULTS AS I USE EVERY DAY.  .  BEST SPOT AGE FADING CRÈME I’VE EVER USED. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It made me break-out so I discontinue the use after the frst night.</li>
            <li> Might be starting to work now, after using it for almost 3 months. Spots appear to be fading.</li>
            <li> Although a bit early in use, I like this product -- feels good and spots are fading.  It is a slow process but much better than previous inexpensive cream from drugstore.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  Used the whole jar and still have the spots that were the worst, they were lightened some but not gone.&lt;br /&gt;Did not reorder and the others are coming back now so it seems if you start using it you have to use it forever.&lt;br /&gt;Minimal results after using twice a day for 6 weeks for darkish spots &amp; freckles.&lt;br /&gt;Some fading but still a few places that show even through foundation.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work after an extended use.</li>
            <li> What a great product!!! I noticed I am using less makeup now due to the better color it is giving me. Great price and really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> very useful, it can Substantially improve the overall appearance of skin pigmentation,  reduce age and liver spots, and removed age spot, one of my friends started to use it from last month, and recommended it highly, it is worth a try</li>
            <li> This was a great buy it completely removed age spot from my mother&#x27;s face. I will definitely recommend this product. My mom is pleased with it HOPE you are.</li>
            <li> When this stuff is available, you gotta get it! It is non greasy and really lightens all kinds of discolorations all of us tend to have.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW! This product has got to be the best age spot remover on the market today. Finally there is an age spot remover that is not greasy and it not only lightened or removed age spots but actually faded small lines.  All this at a wonderful price and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i gotta say guys my dad bought this 2 weeks ago and it worked very well it removed all of his age spot, he looks younger than me now :)&lt;br /&gt;it also helped with wrinkles, this is amazing guys compared to its price i say its a great price.&lt;br /&gt;plus the shipping was so fast it came after 5 days. thats amazing!</li>
            <li> The BEST age spot remover IS.  IT&#x27;S working quickly without the awful smell&lt;br /&gt;of  some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Have not really noticed too much lighting on age spots, must take a long time to work, am using twice a day but still see all the colored age spots on face so not sure if it really works or is strong enough yet</li>
            <li> I must say I am liking this product. The price is great! It is not greasy and it removed an age spot I had for a while. I like the smell and the fact it shipped fast. Recommending this to my peers.</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I are very happy with this product. As far as we are concerned, there&#x27;s nothing better anywhere. Thanks for this great product.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!  A product that really works.  I&#x27;ve been applying the cream to a large red spot on my right cheek and several sun spots on my face and chest.  I&#x27;ve used this cream only about three weeks and can already see a huge difference.  I was a little hesitant to purchase the product because of my very sensitive skin.  No problem.  I apply as directed - twice a day and follow with moisturizer.  I also use a daytime moisturizer with UV protection.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for over 3 weeks.  I really cannot tell a difference. I also applied it to a burn I received on my arm a few years ago hoping it would fade out the site.  Can&#x27;t say I have noticed a big difference.  It may work for some, but I truly am disappointed.</li>
            <li> unbelievable. after all the reviews ive seen on spot removers (mine on my forehead) i thougt B.S. but willing to try anything. i&#x27;m telling you this sht works. ive used it only 2 weeks and forgot to put it on several days and my spots are not fading they are gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. as little as you have to use i would pay 100.00 for this little jar. it&#x27;s just not real that this stuff works like it does. they should pay me and put me in a time lapse commercial. i just can&#x27;t beleive it. i&#x27;m stating on my arm spots today. i&#x27;m a 62 year old self contious guy and couldn&#x27;t beleive i had age spots of all places, on my frigging head for all to see. i&#x27;m a very hard person to satisfy with anything but this is prob. the best thing ive ever bought on amazon or anywhere. get it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I swear to you this really does work. I was skeptical until I tiried it myself. Wish I could post before and after pictures as a picture tells a story.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fragrance of it, and it did nothing for my brown spots.  Would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product at a great price. This product removes age spots, improves Skin Pigmentation, diminishes skin discoloration ect. I used this and it works great. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Best Age Spot is amazing.  I am so excited!  I was always in the sun when I was a kid so I have quite a few age/sun spots on my face.  Best Age Spot lightened them after the first couple of uses.  An added bonus is how it is reducing the wrinkles on my forehead and around my mouth.  I put Best Age Spot on at night before bed and it does not rub on pillowcase because of the nongreasy forumla.  Thank you Age Spots for getting your product here so fast, I was impressed with the super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am well above 45 and I have wrinkles already. This product makes me look young because it removed age spot on parts of my face with severe wrinkles. It&#x27;s highly recommendable because of its great price and fast delivery. Tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li> This almost completely removed age spot that I had. It also helped with my wrinkles. I was very impressed with it as soon as I tried it actually. It was a very fast acting mover unlike the others. You will not find a better product that does half of this for this price.</li>
            <li> At 45, I am beginning to notice a lot of imperfections in my skin on both my face and other areas of my body.  I particularly notices to small age spots above my lip a couple of months ago.  I was mortified when I realized it was an AGE SPOT.  I decided to try a topical creme to see if they really worked.  I decided to go with BEST age spot remover by Michelle.  Three weeks later, the age spot appeared lighter. I am continuing to use it and anticipate that it will disappear over time.  Right now it is a really great price. Try it out.  It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Only using it on the face but I think I&#x27;m seeing a change.  It feels good on the face in any event.</li>
            <li> I am getting married this September and I started to worry about a couple of spots on my face so I decided to give this product a try.  It was one of the best choices I ever made!  Not only did it lighten my dark spots so that I can bare see them but it also helped with my fine lines and wrinkles!  This is an amazing product and I could not be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised; returned the product and was assured of refund.  Good return policy with postage being paid.</li>
            <li> I was online looking for a spot corrector and came across this product. I suspect these reviews are fake for multiple reasons. First, they all read like they were written by the same person. Secondly, it looks like they were all posted right on top of each other. Third, if you look into the previous reviews written by these reviewers, you will see a TON of the same products!  It is a bit suspect when you have 40 reviews appear in the first two weeks of selling this product, and no reviews for a month after that?!?  Quickly followed by another 20 reviews in a second one week time span?  Not very likely.</li>
            <li> Just what product said it!</li>
            <li> I am always weary when it comes to any cosmetic product or age spot remover applied toward my facial skin. I tried this product because of they great reviews it had. This product had fast shipping at a great price and best of all it was not greasy when I applied it directly on my facial skin! Best Age Spot Remover also helped with my wrinkles and I would highly recommend this product to any woman who is looking for a great anti-aging product. This works!</li>
            <li> Product does not work.  I have several types of skin discoloration due to age and hormones and after a month, none of them have faded at all.  I only gave it one star because it arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for the pass 6wks, didn&#x27;t do what it claim to do,  all I have to say is that I wasted my money.....</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to safely remove age spots. It is very gentle, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it over-lightening the surrounding area. After using it for a week, I got rid of a bad age spot I couldn&#x27;t get rid of with other age spot removers.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that works and you cant beat the great price with super fast shipping. This lightened the age spots I have had popping up over the last couple years and has even help a bit with some newly found wrinkles I was unhappy with. Great product, you got to try it.</li>
            <li> I have had spots on my cheeks for as long as i can remember, when i came across this product on amazon i thought wow $5.00 that is extremely cheap why not try it out? I received it three days earlier then the estimated arrival, which I was very pleased with, and not only did i use it, i ordered a second bottle for any other spots. I can&#x27;t tell you how fast and well this product worked on making my spots vanish!</li>
            <li> I had truly excellent results.  I&#x27;m using it on my face where I had large areas with very visible dark spots (melasma) and they are almost unoticeable now.  I have not finished the pot yet and am just concentrating on a smaller area where the more stubborn pigmentation is still a bit visible (if you really look hard), and it keeps improving every day. It took about two to three weeks to start seeing the results.  Been using it twice a day after cleaning my face every day for about 5 weeks now and am staying away from the sun as advised.  Skin never turned red or scaled, just gradually looked better and better.  The other &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; thing about it (and main reason I bought it):  no animal testing.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This product lightened age spots, freckles, skin blotches as well as removed fine lines. I can&#x27;t be happier with this cream.</li>
            <li> At first I was using it twice a day and started to see results within a week.  For personal reasons I neglected to stay on top of it but I will get back into the routine, eager to be rid of the dark spots on my neck and arms from over exposure to sun in my youth.  I really do believe this product will get me there, one jar at a time.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of use I can&#x27;t see the dark spot on my neck anymore. It also helped with wrinkles, people say I look 10 years younger! Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I cant believe that I found this cream for such a great price.  It reduced my age spots and I look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> It has been the best non RX I&#x27;ve tried, however, the spot on the forehead is pretty big and still there.  I can&#x27;t complain for the price.  It has worked fairly well so I would give it a try if the age spots are carmel colored.  Mine is a lot darker so need professional treatment of some kind.</li>
            <li> Bought  this one for my mom, she said it caused itching and rashes, so she stopped. That means never again.</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to remove is the cream left behind. Usless</li>
            <li> It did not work for me.  Followed instructions by the book, protected areas with 70SPF sunscreen and the spots are intact.</li>
            <li> No difference in the color may take longer</li>
            <li> Update: 2/19/2015&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this product religiously for the last 3 weeks, putting it on in the morning and evening after washing my face and before I put on my moisturizer. I am trying this product on my face, neck and arms. I find that the best improvement are on sun spots on my arm. The smaller spots are getting visibly smaller. The bigger ones are getting a little lighter. On my face and neck, the spots look a little lighter, but I guess it will take time. I&#x27;ve changed my rating to 4 stars instead of 5 because I expected a little more change than I currently see. We&#x27;ll see what happens in the next 3 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I can only comment on the timeliness of my shipment, and for that, it was excellent. I ordered it on the 21st and I received it on the 27th, about 3 days earlier than expected. Very happy with that. I just started using the product last night after reading all the reviews on how people have been using it and what tips they offer. I start with cleaning my face - I use the aveeno exfoliating cleanser. then using a q-tip, i dab on best on my sun spots. I have a few on my face, but I have also put it on my arm. (I have one sun spot on my arm that I am not treating with best, just to compare the treated spots to an untreated spot.) And then I put a moisturizer on. At night I use vaseline&#x27;s intensive care moisturizer. In the morning, I use Aveeno&#x27;s daily moisturizer with spf 15. I just started using this product last night, so we&#x27;ll have to see in a few weeks/months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working....Best Age Spot Remover....glad I bought two jars...they are now sold out.  I have a few and my husband has several on his head he is bald....</li>
            <li> Spots are almost gone...amazing product. My former girlfriend had spots on her hands and used the product a month and the spots got lighter and you would be hard pressed to see them...only up really close could you tell what they were.</li>
            <li> it takes a while to work and you have to say with it but the age spots on my wrists are GONE GONE. thanks BEST.</li>
            <li> I love this for my age spots it works great. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now and the results I have been getting from this product have been pretty consistent and noticeable. Plus it&#x27;s non-greasy so I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking shiny.</li>
            <li> It works I finally found something that works I have used creams from all over the world&lt;br /&gt;and the best is Best</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and I must say that i love it!&lt;br /&gt;It lightened and removed all the age spots so fast and that for such a small price. I would definately recommend this!</li>
            <li> dont waist your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> It works, I have been using for a month, 2 Xs a day, and my age spots on face are fading.</li>
            <li> I am skeptical of most things but rely as well as trust customer reviews. I wish I had taken before pictures but I didn&#x27;t. This product has almost totally removed my dark spot. It was awful, the only one I had and on the middle of my right hand! It&#x27;s not totally gone but I feel with continued use it will be. I&#x27;ve used it pretty faithfully each night and sometimes twice a day. I&#x27;m so excited and grateful for this product. Keep up the great work and thank you.</li>
            <li> This product does not work has a very bad smell their customer service is very good please be aware of this product  it does not do anything at all don&#x27;t waste ur money on it.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband so far he likes it no irritation , at this time i ca not comment for benefit further . it takes time to hill</li>
            <li> I really like this age spot remover. It has really improved my skin and discoloration. It works fast too, faster than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. The best part is it&#x27;s not greasy, I&#x27;ve tried similar products that were very greasy.</li>
            <li> i need to tell that it is a very good product. I am using it for 2 months and I really like it, is not greasy at all. I am happy that i tried it and now that i am using it. i highly recommend it for all you</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother in really good price. And what i heard from her this is the best product she used to remove her age and she loves it as its not too much oily neither. I can see she has less wrinkles now.</li>
            <li> Took care of some developing wrinkles on my face, and I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> been using over 1 1/2 months see a little difference.</li>
            <li> I used this to get ride a few wrinkles i had around my mouth. Within two weeks i could see a substantial improvement. Give it a try, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  It has done a great job of clearing up age spots on my hands.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> The product does not work in line with positive reviews. 2 of 5 stars would be proper for this product.</li>
            <li> Am so impressed about this product: / almost gone my dark spots and I even suggest a friend great result definitely recommend any one if they have any problem</li>
            <li> It removed the age spots which of course I was expecting it too but it also had a nice lack of grease. Other age spot treatment medications I have used had grease and gave me acne. This did not. And it also had very fast shipping. Loved it and I do indeed recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product was not at all effective for my dark spots.  I followed the directions exactly, but there was no change at all.</li>
            <li> My mothers birthday was coming around and her years of saying \\&quot;I&#x27;m 29\\&quot; every year for 20 years were over! She hit 50 and hated what 50 came with, wrinkles and dark spots! I was dragged to dermatologist appointments, and forced to listen to paid programs for anti aging skin care products. Heard about this product from a friends mother ( who looks great for 48!) She raved about this, so of course I told my mom to try it! She saw her spots fade, fine lines reduce and is sooooo happy, you gave her confidence in a bottle!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product because of the great reviews. Well it did not work, never saw any difference.</li>
            <li> Fell for the rigged reviews stating how wonderful this product was. Now I see how they were written by the same individuals $ how it was a marketing set up. Instead I should have done some research into this product. Turned out to be a total scam. Came in a jar with scotch tape and a name that wiped off the second I touched it.Smelled 100% like bleach. Trust me...do your research!!</li>
            <li> Use once ever couple of days and have seen no lightening. You are suppose to use daily, and it might work faster.</li>
            <li> This age spot remover did just the trick. I had an old stain and it got it right up. Not greasy at all. Try it out. There doing fast shipping right now.</li>
            <li> after seeing all the positive reviews i decided to try best age and  am surprisingly happy.didn&#x27;t think it would work, but after almost a month of using it as prescribed, my lines are less noticeable(around my eyes). can&#x27;t wait to see what results more continuous use brings.</li>
            <li> Seriously, do not waste your money! This product does not work. I should have read all the reviews before ordering. Go have chemical peels done or order the chemical peel and do it yourself to get rid of dark spots and use a good spf lotion, I prefer Olay just don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk!</li>
            <li> There comes a time when you hit a certain age and you need the help of a miracle product to help with you apperance this really helped lighten  age spots on face and  completely removed them for the price it is a great deal</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I have noticed some disturbing trends with the many positive reviews of this product. Click on the \\&quot;see my other reviews\\&quot; link on nearly any one of these reviewers. The many \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; who gave it five stars ALL reviewed the exact same group of products (giving them five stars as well!). The writing style and dates of posting lead me to believe that these are not actual reviews but a blatant attempt to mislead Amazon shoppers. This is an abuse of the Amazon reviews system and should be flagged immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** If you don&#x27;t believe me click for yourself on any one of the positive reviews. What are the chances that someone who is reviewing an age spot reviewer is also reviewing a childrens&#x27; electronic book download called \\&quot;Have you seen the White Squirrel?\\&quot; Well, just about everyone who likes this age spot remover also likes that book and several other random items. Coincidence? I think not.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of the review rate. But the first day when I used this, it hurt my skin so much. Then I went back and review these reviews. Just like a couple of people said, most of the reviews were written by the people who did not buy the product at all. READ THEM CAREFULLY. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fake reviews.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a top rated fade cream and thought this looked interesting till I studied the reviews. I know. I haven&#x27;t tried the product. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone else try it either. The seller of this product appears to be incredibly unethical. Check out the five star reviews and see how many have exactly one review to their name. Scam scam scam. Further, they use those fake accounts to downgrade the reviews that tell the truth. I deleted my last one and am reposting. How long before they pull the same crap?</li>
            <li> Im sooooo glad i decided to buy this product ive been look for a good skin product specifically for my blemishes and decided to just try something so I stumbled upon this product it was reasonable priced so I purchased it. Received it in no time The 2nd week of use I could already see some fading this is really a good product this will def. be added as a staple!!</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t see it working</li>
            <li> I have been using the &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; spot remover cream for almost a month. Some of the spots have faded a lot but I am still working on a couple of them that seem to be a bit resistant. I would say that it works, not as fast as I expected however.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on the top of my hands to see if it would work and to see if I would have any skin irritation. I started using only once a day for 2 weeks then went to twice a day. At first, I saw very little change, but since using twice a day, I have noticed a significant lightening in my sun/age spots. I am 56 years old. I am on my 4th week and spots have lighten by half. Hoping in the next 3 weeks spots may be completely gone. So far, have used a half of the jar, but did reorder to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results from the Best Age Spot Remover. I&#x27;ve purchased this product 4 times over the last couple years and I&#x27;m very happy with the results from it&#x27;s use. I would recomend this product to anyone wishing to see their age spots disappear.</li>
            <li> This was basically a moisturizer.  Did not break my skin out.  My skin is very sensitive.  Did not help my spots at all!</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference in using this product,</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it all up to give complete try. It did lighten about half the amount.Still have sun spots. Did facials to soften skin.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for me. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use sunscreen daily &amp; I have seen improvement. Spots are fading &amp; I will order another jar when this one is gone. I only use it at night as I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> is fading the age spots well. i also have sun damage to my arms and this product is working well to fade them. love it. great seller also. came quick and was exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li> No lightening effect, just moisturizing without any problems for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very slow working.  Maybe a dermatologist might be better, and it is permanent.</li>
            <li> These reviews are so obviously fake, it&#x27;s laughable. Notice how this seller shows no picture of the actual product? The \\&quot;Best Eye Cream\\&quot; and a bunch of other \\&quot;Best\\&quot; products are all scams. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 5 weeks on the back of my hands .  I have fair skin and a lot of dark spots.  The smaller lighter spots have faded away.  The larger darker ones are still there but not as dark as they were 5 weeks ago.  So far this is the &amp;#34; best&amp;#34; cream I have used for fading those ugly brown spots. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF HAS HYDROQUINONE IN IT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS BANNED IN EUROPE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually associated with use in skin lighteners, especially those products marketed to women of color, hydroquinone may also be a contaminant in other cosmetics ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linked to cancer and organ-system toxicity, it is one of the most toxic ingredients used in personal care products. &amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW&lt;br /&gt;FOUND IN: Skin lighteners, facial and skin cleansers, facial moisturizers, hair conditioners, nail glue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT TO LOOK FOR ON THE LABEL: Hydroquinone, tocopheral acetate, tocopheral, tocopheral linoleate, other ingredients with the root “toco”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEALTH CONCERNS: Cancer, organ-system toxicity, allergies and immunotoxicity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VULNERABLE POPULATIONS: Women of color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REGULATIONS: Banned from cosmetics in the European Union; restricted use in Canadian cosmetics.

            <li> Best age spot remover FADES Age Spots so quickly.  It also  MINIMIZES Liver Spots &amp; greatly  IMPROVES Skin Pigmentation.  DIMINISHES Skin Discoloration and makes skin all one color.  I just love it. It is non greasy.  Great price and it shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Good product, my aunt told me about it, she said it wasnt greasy like the other products i was using and it really cleared up the places on my face. It sure did, it lightened the age spot i had, i put it on my arms for my wrinkles because my aunt said  it did do wrinkles on her face, so i thought why not? and it did indeed help with the wrinkles. Shipping was pretty fast and it was cheap. I like this product.</li>
            <li> This product removed age spots on my face and this product really WORKS! It&#x27;s like bees being attracted to honey and that&#x27;s probably a lot better off than you were before you started using the product.Recommended for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Best, I having seen  any huge results, but I am going to keep on using it until the jar is empty.</li>
            <li> Significant reduction in the color of the spot.  Noticed improvement after a few weeks of recommended use.  Wonderful item!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of the cream and was hopeful it would work, but it did nothing to fade the age spots on my face. I&#x27;m very disappointed and will add this to the numerous other products I&#x27;ve tried without success.</li>
            <li> contains dangerous ingredient for the skin and I don&#x27;t want to take that risk. I wish I read it before I purchased and opened it.</li>
            <li> I like it. its not greasy, alot of lotions cant say that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I though price was great and quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a long time Amazon customer. I give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money folks-like other negative reviewers said- i only looked at positive reviews and no further-but have used this product several times a day for a couple of weeks and there is no difference whatsoever-which is why i went back to re-read reviews-i see no reason to continue to use this product when there has been absolutely no change in even my most lightest and barely there spots! company also emailed me before i received product requesting i contact them rather than amazon in case there was an issue- they obviously were aware that there was an issue with their product and they don&#x27;t want amazon to remove them-i contacted amazon as these people have already wasted enough of my time and my dimes!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for over 2 mos now.  The age spots on my right hand are numerous and dark.  I knew it would take a long time for any improvement.  They have become somewhat lighter; they might not ever really fade.  With this cream application, though, I am hopeful for continuing improvement.  It is very lightweight cream; absorbs easily.  Once the cream has been absorbed I put a layer of my Aveeno tinted facial cream with an spf of 30 on top of it.  I&#x27;ll keep using the cream, still have half a jar left.</li>
            <li> It seems like one morning you wake up with all these brown sunspots or age spots.  This cream is great I use it wherever I have these unattractive spots.  On my hands, face, arms, legs, etc.  I saw a difference in about two weeks.  Using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Had hoped this would actually get RID of a few age spots on my hand.  I&#x27;ve used it EVERY day for over 2 months, just as the directions say (&amp;#34;thin layer, morning &amp; evening&amp;#34;) &amp; I guess the spots have faded a little -- but only a little.  For $30 and all its claims, this should work better.  Many days I even re-applied it, but with no change.  These were just 4 spots, not very large and NOT super-dark.  Waste of my money!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and still am, but I have to say that I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks now and I can actually see the dark spots on my face beginning to fade!</li>
            <li> It works though you have to keep using it. My age spots are definately less dark and not standing out so much any more. You have to keep using the cream, but if you make it a habit it&#x27;s a breeze. I recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> my holy grail, it never disappoints, I always have it on standby in case any spot works its way onto my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 10 weeks..  I won&#x27;t say that my dark spots are gone, but are much lighter so they easily cover with makeup now.  The instructions say in one place to use once a day, and in another to apply morning and night.  I found it to be more effective with the twice a day application.  Another thing I liked about it is the scent.  It is pretty much unscented so not offensive as some facial care products are.  I have recommended this to others already.  It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> Did not find any difference after using for nearly 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Do your research by checking the rave reviewers OTHER reviews. Many are reviewing the same products with 5 star ratings as well. This clearly is a scam. Save your money! This company needs to be reported. So you know, after doing my research I never bought it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all after I have tried for three weeks sincerely. Do not let this product ruining our Amazon.com.  This company needs to be reported. Do not waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended to me as a possible was to lighten dark spots on my face. After using the entire container, I see no noticeable change in the age spots. Not worth it for my money.</li>
            <li> my lite brown spots are now bright RED</li>
            <li> Wife and I both used for over a month with no visible difference...sorry, but  I would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  A representative for the company contacted us and was very concerned about the result we had with the product.  They refunded our money immediately and apologized for any inconvenience.  They are even sending out another product for us to try at their cost.  Their customer service was excellent and we are happy with the end result.</li>
            <li> At 63, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for my skin. Short of an expensive peel, BEST really does make the brown spots on my face fade. I can see the results after about a week of using the cream at night. I have almost leopard spots on my left arm from driving and Best even fades that to the point that I can barely see them. This is a good product at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10.4.16 update: &amp;#34;At 67, I&#x27;m still using this stuff and loving it. I mix it with moisturizer or night cream when I feel that my skin looks dull. It works on my skin so well that I don&#x27;t even look at the pricier &#x27;clear skin&#x27; products. Even K-beauty items don&#x27;t work as well for me as this stuff does. For me, this is definitely worth the $. I will keep buying!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> tried many products and this one actually does what it says--would continue buying it in the future--large size---lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t  used  it long enough to rate high</li>
            <li> Slightly lightened dark spots on face, however after two weeks of using the product had to discontinue use because&lt;br /&gt;It caused red burning areas where applied. After two weeks of not using the redness s still very prominent. Would not order again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes in my age spots.  Bought something else that works better. I will not order this again.  I wish I knew why the reviews were so good on this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. Amazing.  I can hardly believe it.  The health gurus say not to use a product with the main ingredient in this one.  I am wonderfing if it might do more harm than good.  G.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this product is not working at all and I have developed a burning sensation so I will probably stop using&lt;br /&gt;it.  I have used it faithfully everyday for three weeks+ and I&#x27;m ready to return the unused portion per your 30 day satisfaction policy.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin so I may not be the best review for your product; it seems to work for most according to reviews.</li>
            <li> Not yet, I&#x27;ve used as speifed, some have lightened but there still there, I&#x27;ll keep trying for the next two weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased Best 2 months ago but didn&#x27;t start using it until 1 month ago. It seems to be lighten the age spots. I use it twice a day and will continue to do so. Hopefully it will lighten the dark spots some more.</li>
            <li> I have tried several which did nothing that I could see, and while it does require patience, the results were noticeable in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product really works my age spots are starting to fade. i&#x27;ve been using every night my spots on face and also on my chest. I am very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> The product is comfortable to use and has certainly reduced the color intensity of the spots.  I will admit to sometimes forgetting to apply it as prescribed (twice daily) and I didn&#x27;t expect miracles in three weeks.  So, all in all, worth a try as it is inexpensive and somehwat effective!</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one month now, with NO results. What a waste of $30.00. Will never buy again!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Tried it faithfully twice a day since I purchased it and I see no change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> So far the best cream for Age spots Issues, it gradually lighted the color of the spots after a few weeks of using. It is much better than all the big name brands I used before. The price is in the reasonable range. It could not erase the age spots yet ( at least in my case), I think that you have to accept the nature&#x27;s rule, it is age and health issues, not for one cream to play all the magic. But this cream showed the most efficient impact on my face , it is the Best so far, and I have ordered 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> Applied a dab of the product, mostly on non-consecutive days, due to concerns regarding negative side effects, like Ochronosis, to the small brown spots, for no more than six hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did initially experienced tightest around the head, and other indescribable feelings, after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did lighten the small brown spots, but not a solution, for permanent elimination of the brown spots.</li>
            <li> Product did not work for me.  I used the product on one age spot on my face and the discoloration on my upper lip, no improvement.</li>
            <li> After a month of using it to remove some age spots near my mouth, I noticed an incredible thing. The wrinkles on my upper lip were disappearing. I had used every cream imaginable but nothing had worked until now. As for the age spots, I see some improvement after 3 months, nothing drastic. But I&#x27;ll keep using it forever to get rid of my lines.</li>
            <li> Have been using about seven weeks and has significantly reduced age spots. I was using mornings and evenings the first six weeks but now using only evenings to eliminate a few remaining light spots. I saw significant results within the first four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback was a slight irritation, redness, but I did not use moisturizing cream as was recommended. I thought it would reduce effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product one month ago.....They sent me three emails to write a review......I didn&#x27;t answer, wanted to give the product a fair trial. I&#x27;m pleased to report that after the month and applying the cream twice a day. The spots on my hand are nearly&lt;br /&gt;gone. Not completely, but perhaps with further use they may totally disappear.  I will purchase this product again....As I have learned&lt;br /&gt;many, many cream products make claims that are not true....I have personally found that this &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; cream does reduce the brown&lt;br /&gt;spots on the back of the hand....Perhaps, I&#x27;ll see a total elimination with continued use??</li>
            <li> Best Age Spot Remover does work gently &amp; I do not have any reaction to the cream.  With my sensitive skin I am cautious of which products I can use.  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be working but very slow.  I had an age spot approximately the size of a dime.  It seems to be fading somewhat but I want completely gone.  Will continue to use in the hopes that it will eventually go away.  If this occurs will readily give you a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> This cream did not work at all........ I used the product every night before I went to bed to get rid of age/dark spots on my face.  Not only did it not work, I am convinced my spots are more noticeable now than before I used the product.</li>
            <li> Okay I admit I am a true skeptic and I would have NOT ordered this in the first place had I known it was a &#x27;spot remover&#x27;.  I would have just thought it was hype.  Just wanted to let you all know that up front.&lt;br /&gt;Why did I use Best Age Spot Remover?  It was by accident that I found it..as I thought I was ordering a moisturizer when I got this. Can I say AWESOME..product now?  YES,,and had to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;  I have Rosacea on my face to the point that I was forever looking sunburned even though I use a 110 SPF sunscreen everyday.  As I put this product on my face it felt so nice.  Not sticky..just smooth cool and creamy.  The scent was nice also.  The product went right into my skin and did not &#x27;sit on top&#x27; and make my face feel like it needed to be washed again.  Soooo ....as I continued to use this product...after a couple of weeks I noticed that my face looked smooth and fresh.. NO REDNESS...just a nice healthy glow to my skin.  I went back to the jar and read the ingredients and it was at this time I saw the small print under the bright red BEST on the front of the jar.  AGE SPOT REMOVER.  I should have had my glasses on when I first ordered it.  I am 64 years old and my facial skin and neck and chest area are now free from blemishes and sun damage (from youth) freckles.  I have just ordered more jars.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this product ... EVER.  Do you know how good it feels to be able to go out without makeup if I want to?  I used to have to put on foundation over a green concoction to reduce redness.  Well not anymore!  Happy me!!!!  I wish I could give it 10 stars...or 20...or 100  :)</li>
            <li> could not tell that it worked at all</li>
            <li> I use this age spot remover regularly.  So far haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  Will continue to use it to see if it really works.  The jury is still out.  Maybe i&#x27;ll have a verdict in a few months.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:6ae67695220262dad26af8a8fd41cce0]] There&#x27;s really not much to say except this product WORKS! I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and home remedies to reduce the appearance of my \\&quot;experience spots\\&quot; but nothing really blew them away like this age spot remover.  I used Best faithfully for 30 days and I videoed the process from start to finish.  As the days went by I could tell the spot was lightening and on the 30th day I had no need to reapply the cream because the spot was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did notice a slight drying out of the spot after about 10 days of application.  It only lasted a few days and there were no other side effects so this did not bother me in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I recommend applying the cream at night.  I initially applied the cream in the morning to the spot on my hand but I&#x27;m a fanatic hand washer so for several days I would end up reapplying the cream because before I realized what I was doing I had washed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Be sure to wash the area clean of any other cosmetics, oils, lotions etc before application so that the cream is actually applied to the skin instead of on top of another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t get discouraged.  It took about a week or so before I noticed any lightening of the spot but once it started lightening I could see the differences daily.</li>
            <li> I did notice an improvement and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is the best dark spot corrector I have ever used. It really reduces the sign of dark spots on my face. It is a smooth light cream that smells amazing. I have been using 2 times per day and I have noticed a considerable reduction in the dark spots on my face.  I would recommend this lotion to anyone wanting to remove dark spots or scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 3 months and I don&#x27;t notice a difference.  Save your money or look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> really works, I&#x27;m 67 yrs.old  with sun damaged skin, &amp;#34;liver/age&amp;#34; spots.  Noticeably within one week saw a difference.  still using it after 2-3 weeks for the stubborn  spots.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised.  Used on arms and hands and the &amp;#34;high pigmentation&amp;#34; spots are gone!  Is really amazing.  Has the same active ingredient recommended by dermatologists (at least according to multiple web sites) but in a lower concentration.  Caution, used on my face and got a rash which apparently has been known to happen.</li>
            <li> Left my age spots irritated &amp; bright red, would never buy again.  Do not recommend</li>
            <li> AGE SPOTS REDUCED IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS. WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT. IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE AS A MORNING QUICK RUB AND THE RESULTS ARE EAST TO SEE.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product.  While it does require consistency in application, and patience, it is working or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it a second time.  I use it once in the morning and once at night.  I haven&#x27;t completely finished the first jar, and I have seen a reduction in size and darkness where I have been applying.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust the seller.  All reviews are fake.  I normally don&#x27;t leave comments, but I just want people to know that not only does not this product work, but also dangerous.  It contains hydroquinone which is carcinogenic chemical and thus may lead to cancer. It has been banned in Europe ,Australia and parts of Asia, so you should definitely stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe this works for younger people but I used this product two times a day for two months on brown/age spots on my face and hands and nothing changed.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to write a glowing review of this product but I think this age spot remover is really the best I have tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m male,80 yrs.old and hate my brown spots on hands,face and wherever visible.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second jar and think I can see a real difference on my arms,hand &amp; face.&lt;br /&gt;Not all spots respond the same but I&#x27;m happy some do quite noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;Quite amazing.Those creams dont work for everybody I have noticed but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product - my ugly spots are gone - I never thought I&#x27;d see the day. The gross liver spot lookin hands now look so much better - thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> I almost gave up because the spot was still there after a week but I stuck with it. After a little over three weeks of use,the light brown spots on my left hand are now gone. This does exactly what it says its supposed to do. I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is pretty generous. I have quite a bit left. Oh well.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using it my face got red.  Tried it the second day to make sure and again, redness and a bit of a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all. I finished the whole jar but it did not change my dark spot even very little bit. DO NOT BUY!! It is waste of money and time. I am using Clarins and it works but it takes time.</li>
            <li> Hav been using 2xday fr approx 4 wks &amp; hav seen very slight lightening. Wil continue to use til gone.</li>
            <li> Very simply, it did not work at all....not even a little bit...Period.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working, it took about two weeks to start showing.</li>
            <li> Im using for 1 month and clear 50% my sun and acné spots</li>
            <li> I used four jars.  Product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> No instruction on how to use or how it would it would take.</li>
            <li> Its an awesome spot remover. It worked well</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the timely manner in which M&amp;M Beauty and Wellness filled my order of Best Age Spot Remover.  I noticed a difference the first time I used the product.  I am completely satisfied and I highly recommend Best Age Spot Remover because it really works!  It is also made in the USA!</li>
            <li> I just started using this and it has been three days now and I can already see my acne scars starting to fade. I will try using this with a dermal roller from banish acne scars.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my face and hands for two months. My spots do get lighter but when they get to be light brown the cream doesn&#x27;t help anymore. My dermatologist says it is because the active ingredients are drawn to a darker pigment so as the spot gets lighter it can&#x27;t &#x27; find&#x27; it anymore.</li>
            <li> never worked&lt;br /&gt;Very dissappointing</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my forearms. I decided a few months ago to seriously attempt to get rid of them. I tried home remedies including lemon juice, expensive lotions, creams, and everything in between. If the spots were a bigger problem for me and money was no object frankly I would probably pay for laser treatments and be done with it. But that is not an option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this. Initially - nothing - no results. I stuck with it using it every day for about 3 weeks like they say you’re supposed to. This dark spot remover works. Not quickly and not easily but it works. My dark spots are gone.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I bought this without looking at the reviews more carefully. I feel like I was taken to the cleaners.</li>
            <li> I was considering this product.  They have before / after pictures, which look pretty good. EXCEPT THAT THE BEFORE PICTURE IS THE RIGHT HAND, AND THE AFTER PICTURE IS THE LEFT HAND.  this was intentional, because they switched the person&#x27;s ring.  this raises serious questions for me.</li>
            <li> The best spot remover I&#x27;ve had but you have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Yes I do believe it works  ...  only been 3 weeks but I think my spots are lighter  ...  :)</li>
            <li> Not doing what the bottle claims it does.</li>
            <li> Still waiting on something to happen ! !</li>
            <li> It really works. All my dark spots are fading away.  It has a strong smell but I don&#x27;t mind it as it is good on my skin so far.</li>
            <li> I am only using this for several  weeks and for discrete facial lesions .... one&lt;br /&gt;age spot and two small areas  of discoloration.  To date there is no difference.</li>
            <li> On second jar, worked great on dark spots I have on my face and on my hands.  Takes a while but then you have to expect that, doesnt happen overnight.</li>
            <li> Have been using spot remover for a little over 2 weeks and the spots on my face and arm are more than half faded from what they were.  Very Happy</li>
            <li> I used a very expensive product before and got limited to no results. I used this product and got limited to no results. Have been using it twice a day and, of course, use a sunscreen. Not too impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for a couple of months now, and cannot see ANY DIFFERENCE in the age spots we were trying to lighten up.  We&#x27;re in our early 60&#x27;s and these unsightly spots have begun to appear.  Unfortunately it looks like the only solution is to go to the dermatologist if you want to really get rid of age spots.  :-(</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for an over the counter product, I am on my 2nd jar and can notice a difference help skin and makes spots less noticeable. Would  order future jars .</li>
            <li> does not work at all after using for about a month.  no changes at all after applying&lt;br /&gt;different amounts. disappointed.</li>
            <li> some minor results and it made some spots a reddish color.  I will use the whole jar but I am somewhat disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> This product was very effective in fading some very dark spots on my hands in a very short time.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have put this on daily for two-three weeks on my age and spots on my hands, I have not noticed any difference at all.  you just never know</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and spent years in the sun with never using sun block or protecting myself. I have tried other creams but haven&#x27;t notice any difference. After using this product a couple of weeks I notice the spots starting to fade even my husband notice. At such a great price too! Wow!</li>
            <li> This is a great age spot remover. It helps my face feel refreshed and it is not greasy like the other products I have used before. I ordered it online and it shipped the next day. I received the products in 2 days!!! I love this product and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Well, When this stuff is available, you gotta get it! It is non greasy and really lightens all kinds of discolorations all of us tend to have. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother who was just beginning to get age spots on her hands!  I saw her again a few days later and the age spots were gone - she had terrific results!  She was happy with her gift and I was happy with the results.  Just what I had hoped for.  It completely removed her age spots.</li>
            <li> I have almost used a jar of this,and i can tell a big difference,</li>
            <li> using the product now do know if it&#x27;s working,will continue till it is used up</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Age spots are getting lighter and I have only been using a week.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have noticed a lightening of my facial skin. I suppose if I were more consistent with applying every day the age spots would fade more rapidly. The age spots on my face by my eyes have gotten lighter but like I wrote, I need to be more consistent with applying the cream. I only use a small dab also and it seems to work instead of over saturating the face and wasting the cream.</li>
            <li> Very effective. I can see the improvement on those spots, which have been there for years, after using the product for 3 weeks. I keep using it and plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> Last year I took a trip to mexico and sun burn spots on my forehead. I tried several things that supposedly got rid of dark spots. I tried for months and gave up. While purchasing other thins I came across this product.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and my dark spots are almost completely gone. This product does what it announces it does.  This is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that has any type of discoloration on their skin. Just be patient and it will work.. Great product..</li>
            <li> Update.  I&#x27;ve now been using this 2x per day since October.  It has lightened my stubborn spot will it is still there.  I am disappointed.  I was hoping for it to disappear completely.  Will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks faithfully twice a day.  I think that it is lightening a stubborn spot on my face, but I&#x27;m not sure yet.  That is my reason for the 3 stars.  I hope to be back with a 5 star review.  In comparison to other products, I would definitely say it is much better.  Not much smell and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> I love my skin after Best Age Spot Remover. I was a teenage sun goddess and needed to undo a lot of sun damage that started becoming visible in my early 30s. Best Age Spot Remover was a quick, effective and positive solution to my skin woes, and also helped with wrinkles. It removed a number of dark sun spots, improved the texture of my skin and helped reduce the oil I usually fight with.</li>
            <li> This product is great and adds exuberance to my skin, it works very well for removing my age spots and wrinkles. So needless to say i look and ever fell younger as my skin has even gotten lighter. The application is quick and easy and leaves no greasy mess when applied. Their customer service is fast and care about my results with this product, ordering was secure and delivery was quick as my order was priced less than other competing products. I would recommend to friends and family if they wish to stay looking young.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I have only tried 1 other which did not work AT ALL even after 2 months of continuous use.  It is important to apply and rub into spots 2 times per day to actually see results.</li>
            <li> The Spot Remover works wonders. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it! I am so in love with this product! It removed all the aged spots on my body and for that I am really thankful!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing it has lighten up my dark spots so much. In the first month I could tell a pretyy big difference but after my third month the spots aren&#x27;t noticeable at all. I also enjoy the fact its not greasy and the price is affordable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, on Mother&#x27;s Day. Since she&#x27;s used this product, It&#x27;s removed age spots and even helps with wrinkles. I highly recommend this for yourself, or a great gift.</li>
            <li> I am so-so-so surprised that this cream performs so well! I am 65 &amp; have been embarrassed by &amp;#34;old-age spots&amp;#34; since I turned 50. I always suspected these spot-removing products were a hoax until one day when I went on-line w/ a determination to do some serious research. BEST Age Spot Remover had great reviews for great reasons! The areas I needed help w/ were the top of each hand &amp; a few (humiliating) spots on my face. After almost 2 months, the results have been at least a 75 percent improvement on my hands, &amp; about 80 percent on my face! My only criticism is that my husband thought the cream had an unpleasant smell, &amp; my dog thought it was really tasty--they were NOT a good research group! However, now that my skeptical husband has seen the results, he never complains about the scent!</li>
            <li> used it for 3 weeks and no results at all. Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It  did not work for me</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy but I have been using this for only a few days and I can already see a difference. I would recommend this to anyone. I have tried others with hardly any results. So glad I found this one!!</li>
            <li> This product really works and should be tried by all those who have trie other remedied for age spots and failed</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t buy this product but did read the reviews. The people who said the reviewers are phony and review the same products are 100% correct!! Amazon, you should be ashamed of yourselves!!! I purchase a lot of merchandise off your site~and I now feel like I have been duped!!I am certainly considering canceling my Amazon account and credit card and buying elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Have only been using a week, however can tell a definitely difference on some of the areas on my chest.  The places do turn dark, which at first worried me, but then I realized that the product acts as an effolient and the spots literally rub right off.  Amazing stuff!  I will definitely continuing using it.  The only drawback, and frankly it isn&#x27;t enough to even make me consider not using it, is the fact that the odor is quite strong and more than a little off-putting.  Again, the product works so well, I can get used to it.  Also, kudos to the seller because the product arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but this stuff really worked.  Took between 2 and 3 weeks and I was done.  Probably used less than 1% of the amount that comes in the jar!</li>
            <li> This will work if you apply and give it time took 3 week for me on back of hands and my hands were really bad with sun spots. Very happy with the product..</li>
            <li> Works well. Takes time. But works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and iI have not seen any results. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> it works, i&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement so I give up to purchase again.</li>
            <li> i got the product today,by nighttime my dark spots on my hands were disappearing. I kid you not. My dark spots were actually growing in number and darking so I googled and this product appeared. So delighted😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months twice a day for melasma that appeared above my upper lip when I was about 26. I&#x27;m really pleased with the results. The marks are almost completely gone. I noticed a difference in a very short time but wanted to see how well it would really work before I reviewed it. The melasma made me never want to leave my house. If you have it, you know the feels...it&#x27;s emotionally crippling. The looks, the whispers. It&#x27;s been awful. So glad I found this stuff. Id definitely recommend trying it. I&#x27;m caucasian, not sure how it would work on darker skin but hey, never know, right? Plus a little goes a very long way so the tub will last forever. Side note, I had some luck using silicon scar strips overnight on the melasma, but the marks would always come back if I missed even one night. I bet the combination of the strips and this stuff would be killer...</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work instead gave me a big rash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days and can already tell a difference. I would recommend this to anyone with hand spots or discoloration.</li>
            <li> This lightens slightly but prescription strength (4 percent) which I used once was much better.  For the price this is okay.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my hands. Switched back to Murad serum. My fair skin only burns, does not tan. I was careless and only used sunscreen consistently on face, arms, and legs--not hands. So hands show the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li> I have just tried it but it is far too soon to know if it is working as it takes 4-6 weeks to show results!</li>
            <li> It starts fading immediately, but it needs sustained use for maximum results. A real bargain that works over a period of time.</li>
            <li> This smells so bad I can&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;ve tried and tried, but for me it was a waste of money.  Actually makes me nauseous when I put it on.</li>
            <li> It works!  I must admit that I was skeptical about the product&#x27;s effectiveness.  However, after using it for a little over a month I am very happy with the results.  The dark spots on my hands are &amp;#34;slowly&amp;#34; disappearing.  I emphasize slowly.  The dark spots did not appear overnight, and I know that it will take some time for them to blend in with the natural color of my skin. Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many creams and lotions to remove my age spots. And i have to say none come to close to being this great as this one. Due to my darker skin color i was down to my last straw in finding the right cream. The Best Age Spot Remover not only lighten my age spots within a few but also smoothed my entire face. I love this product.</li>
            <li> The product does what it is supposed to do.  It decreased my age spots, and helped with wrinkles too.  It was very reasonably priced and shipped out to me quickly.  What&#x27;s not to like?  I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is too good to be true. I know someone who has ordered this product. She applied it. I immediately began to notice a difference in her appearance. She looked a lot younger. This item gives helps with the skin complexion and it is not greasy. She feels a lot better about herself. If there is one product that I would recommend for anti-aging, it is this one.</li>
            <li> This age spot remover really works. I noticed within a few days that it removed age spots I had as well as it is not greasy when you apply it to your skin. This really does work and I recommend you try it for yourself to see how great this product really is.</li>
            <li> this works okay, not the best. you have to use it daily every day, just to keep the spots away. not permanent.</li>
            <li> This product completely removed my age spot on my forehead that ive had for years. The shipping was fast and I saw results even faster. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was looking for some cream to fade age spots, and I found this by accident. I decided to purchase a bottle and it worked wonders to remove age spots.</li>
            <li> Been using the product now for around four weeks. Have found that the sun spots have gone down by around 40% from where they started. Seems to have hit a plateau right now, but maybe there will be a slower decrease - hopefully so. Overall the product does what is says it will do and it is good value for money. Also the seller was very good and had prompt delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> I used this product after I had a spot on my face right under where I wear my glasses. This product works good. It has removed mist of the sun damage. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Caused my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> No results after 2 months.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I have seen no results!</li>
            <li> I have been using the spot remover faithfully since I received it.  So far, approximately three weeks, it has worked on some small spots, but has only slightly faded a couple of larger spots.  I really appreciate getting to try this and will continue to try on some other spots.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months. No effect what so ever. Now I used up all of it.  I don&#x27;t think I should buy another one and continue to try it. I give 3 star rating because I like the quick response from the seller and the refund after I complained.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I ordered a jar of BEST age spot remover from Amazon.  The item was purchased from  M &amp; M Beauty and Wellness; it arrived in perfect condition and ahead of the estimated date.  I have tried many, many supposed spot removers over the years, and still had one big age spot on the side of my face the size of a nickel. I had basically given up, and just kept adding more and more concealers over the spot, which, of course, just made it look worse. So--when I saw the ad for BEST age remover, I figured that the outcome would be more of the same. However, to my delight, the spot began to fade quickly; it&#x27;s about 2/3 gone, and I just finished the first jar. My second jar just arrived ( as promptly as the first one ), and I&#x27;m looking forward to this jar finishing off the job!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you SO much, M  &amp; M Beauty and Wellness and Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have always used age spot remover on my hands and my hands do not reveal my age.  This has been one of the best ones I have use.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product which works very well. I certainly would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;No side effects noted</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week and have not seen any results.  I will keep using it to see what the results might be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Best Age Spot Remover twice a per day for the last week and I am totally impressed with the results.  I have used more expensive creams and not had the results I&#x27;ve had to date.</li>
            <li> worked well...only after a week it was noticeable</li>
            <li> Truthfully I have noticed No difference at all. I am using it on my arms. When going outside I use 70 sunblock. I am willong to give it one more month but up to this point I am disappointed. I give it 3 stars because no have not had any adverse affects.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Totally comparable to Murad. Same ingredients and effect at half the cost &amp;#34; Well worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice daily for two months. So far there is no improvement. NONE. I&#x27;ll use it until I&#x27;ve finished the jar, but I&#x27;ll invest my money for laser treatments which in the past have worked perfectly for me. Unfortunately Laser treatments are expensive.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about six weeks ago. Applied it to 6 rather noticeable spots and some smaller spots on my face and neck. Also applied it to middle of chest over 6&amp;#34; area. I also applied it to one forearm for a week and saw a definite lightening compared to the other forearm. So I started applying it to the other forearm. Both fore arms are now much lighter in color. All spots have lightened and some very significantly.  I have just ordered my second jar.  I am satisfied with the results. All spots but one  are still visible but much  lighter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the great reviews.  I used it faithfully for a couple months but I didn&#x27;t see any improvement with the age spots on my face.  The packaging was even incorrect.  The container was correct but the box it came in was for something different. I thought I had gotten the wrong product.  I&#x27;m pretty sure most of the reviews for this product is bogus because it simply doesn&#x27;t work for age spots.</li>
            <li> From the testimonials, I ordered and quantity of 2 so that I would not run out before seeing any results.  I have been using it for almost 2 weeks and have seen no difference in my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it make me break out so now I am not even using it.</li>
            <li> Think it will take quite some time to remove spots</li>
            <li> I ordered Best Age Spot Remover in April and now I&#x27;ll give my review.I had two very large age spots on my checks and no matter what I put on it and believe me I have used quite a few products trying to get rid of them never worked.You know how it is when you put on make up but the dark spots comes through the makeup and then you put blush on it and  makes your face look worse, well that was me for about 3 years hated to go out.When I saw the product read the reviews figured why not tried just about every thing I&#x27;d try this.THANK YOU THIS ONE WORKS !People you wont go wrong try . I never thought those large spots would ever go away as we say in Hawaii Mahalo for this very excellent product LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This age spot remover has got to be the best on the market. My wife got it and it really helped with her wrinkles. It was not greasy like some of the other ones and it just worked great. It also lightened some age spots too. Would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I got an email from M&amp;M asking me to rate Best Age Spot Remover.  This was an impulse purchase and I am using it on a large age spot on my hand.  After a month the spot is fading and the edges are losing definition.  I gave it three stars because it is advertised as a spot remover.  I don&#x27;t want a lighter dark spot, I want a gone dark spot.  I will continue to use it night and day as I have and give it another review next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I have been using Best Age Spot Remover for three months.  I have been treating one large spot on the back of my hand.  It was a dark spot, now, although the spot is still there, I need to hold the hand just right in the light to see the spot.  I apply the cream morning and evening and, on days when I wash my hands a lot, during the day.  You can barely tell I have used any of the cream so I will keep applying it.  I have changed my rating from three to four going on five.</li>
            <li> Must use as directed to see mild change over time.</li>
            <li> Saw absolutely no change after using for almost 2 months.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working!</li>
            <li> Is not working for me, I have use it 1-2 weeks I see nothing different... Beside it make my face look darker and my spot darker...</li>
            <li> I have used the product now for about 14 days now, it seems to be working but I think I need a little more time to be sure.</li>
            <li> This spot remover didn&#x27;t work for me. This is so like other brands, no difference.</li>
            <li> Have seen no results after two weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks so far and my age spots are already starting to fade. Hopefully, after continued use they will disappear completely.  I will try to update this review as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Has not done a thing! Use twice a day!</li>
            <li> Plan to give as a gift and have not used because I do not need to use. I hope my friends will enjoy the gift.</li>
            <li> Best product.  Result of lighten skin tone shows after 15 days of using it.  Very easy to use.  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does work if you keep using it everyday.  The spot comes right back even with sunscreen if you stop.</li>
            <li> Maybe I want instant results but so far I don&#x27;t see any change dark spots while using this product.  I chose it after reading many of the positive reviews.  I will continue to use it and hopefully it will kick in.  Hate to think I spent $30 for nothing.</li>
            <li> It is working!  Works well!  love it will buy it again and tell my friends about it too also.  Thank you for sending so fast! Ginger</li>
            <li> Best Age Spot Remover:  I am already seeing  a change.  Plus it has a pleasant smell.  I would buy it again</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have tried for lightening sun spots and redness caused by sun damage. I have been using it for over 6 months (this is my 3rd jar and I have ordered another already) and the results are amazing!  The cream is non abrasive and hasn&#x27;t caused me any discomfort (I have VERY sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> Used it on a sun spot on my hand and well as a little sun kiss under my right eye.  The one under my eye is almost all gone after about 2 weeks and the one on my hand is starting to fade.  I have the best results when I put it on at night just befire I go to bed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is working. I have 2 spots on my cheekbone which were very dark. I would estimate they are 60-70% than when I started. This product is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Note effective at all.  I would not mind to mailing you back the rest of the jar for a full credit.</li>
            <li> So far, so good... Dark spots seem to be lightening up.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximatley 4 weeks now and I do not see a difference. My age spots are still the same they have not lightened. I had high hopes :(  [[ASIN:B006UUTNCU Best Age Spot Remover]]</li>
            <li> I READ THE REVIEWS AND THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY. THE INFORMATION ON THE BOX/LABEL DIDN&#x27;T REALLY TELL YOU ANYTHING WHATSOEVER.&lt;br /&gt;I USED THE ITEM EVERYDAY FOR 2-1/2 MONTHS. I APPLIED IT TO 4 AREAS ON MY FACE. IT TURNED MY SKIN BRIGHT RED AND IT DIDN&#x27;T REMOVE MY DEVELPING AGE SPOTS! EVERYONE SAID TO ME, \\&quot;DID YOU GET BIT? LOOK AT YOUR FACE!\\&quot;. WELL, NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE PRODUCT DID NOT WORK. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M THINKING THE MANUFACTURE HAD EMPLOYEES/FRIENDS GIVE POSITIVE REVIEWS. THE PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> This does fade brown spots BUT don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight.  Took about 3 weeks using the product overnight to work, but haven&#x27;t used it in a month and the spots haven&#x27;t gotten worse.  Course, I do wear sunscreen outside always...but I do think this products works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product less than a week and can already tell a difference in my face. The dark spots are really lightening up. I am thrilled!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months twice a day, and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in removing my blemishes.</li>
            <li> This product works.  You have to be diligent and apply it at least once a day.  I like the scent and I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily moisturizer.  It&#x27;s affordable and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my sun spots are lightening! This product is easy to put on once a day, at night. There is a very light smell, not overwhelming. My skin feels soft on the locations that I apply this cream to. I noticed a discount code for this product and ordered it right away. I am happy to give a review for this cream and  to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It is the best product I have used in a long time. Not only did my age spots fade, but it left my face very smooth. Would recommened to anyone.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this works where many other such creams have failed. I have age spots on my hands (sun damage) and have been using this primarily on my hands every day for about a month. This cream has greatly improved the texture of my skin, and made for a much more even skin tone, making my hands look younger! The spots are not gone completely, but are greatly reduced. I do follow this during the day with a strong sun block - don&#x27;t want to undo all good this cream does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite finished this jar but I didn&#x27;t want people to buy this product and waste their money. Age spots are extremely hard to get rid of. I think you probably need prescription strength or have them lasered or burned off the skin. I also have some very light, faint spots and this cream didn&#x27;t even help that. So, as I&#x27;m not surprised it didn&#x27;t touch darkened spots, I can still give it a horrible review because it doesn&#x27;t handle light spots either. Hopefully with online help, companies like this that want to scam the public will disappear (unlike the age spots). It smells horrible too. I checked the expiration date to see if it had expired but nope, it just reeks of a nasty chemical smell.</li>
            <li> The first month I didn&#x27;t see results, but couple weeks ago dark spots of my face started to be lighter and lighter..&lt;br /&gt;So, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> this stuff did absolutely nothing and I will be needing a full refund for it. Please advise. Lightened my skin but did nothing for the age spots.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> I was considering purchasing this product based on all the good reviews alone, then I examined the reviews more closely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my third jar of Best Age Spot Remover.  It has worked miracles on my age spots and freckles. After two weeks of use, I had noticable improvement in my age spots on my face and the backs of my hands.  After the first jar (about a two month supply) the spots are virtually impossible to see in bright light with a magnifying mirror.  I still apply once or twice a day to my face to work on my smattering of freckles, and am now using it on my arms (for freckles and a nasty scar), followed by sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve tried expensive broad-based laser (BBL)treatments and both prescription and over-the-counter fade creams, but this product really works.  The other \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; creme smelled bad and I could see no visible results.  Yes, BBL is a 90% solution in 10 days, but it cost $500, it&#x27;s painful, you can&#x27;t use it near your eyes, and no matter what they say, there is no makeup on earth that can cover your face so you can appear in public for at least a week--and within a year, the spots were back.  As my 5 sisters like to continually remind me, I&#x27;m the oldest in the family :-) but at our reunion this year, I was the only one who didn&#x27;t have any age spots :-)</li>
            <li> Took awhile to see the difference, but it really did make one totally go away. One spot I&#x27;m still working on.</li>
            <li> Over the two month period I have used the product I have seen considerable reduction in serious  age spots that have annoyed me for years. I am impressed. The process is slow. Based on this experience, however,  I believe that further improvement may occur  with continued  use. (Almost half of my two ounce jar of Best Age Spot Remover remains). This is the first age spot remover I have tried.</li>
            <li> The best method is to apply twice a day without fail. I did so, and in a couple weeks the brown spot on my face was faded. I was careful to use sunscreen, though, because the product does induce photosensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months.  I have some tough spots from age and sun.  Initially I was only using it on the spots themselves but I liked the cream so much I&#x27;m using it as an all over moisturizer.  Their customer service is superb and even if my spots never go away, I will still use the product as a daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about three months and I can see excellent results.  I had two dark spots, one in my left cheek and the other one on my nose and I see they are fading out.  I use it twice a day and I put more in those two spots and let my skin absorb it, like for about 30-45 minutes then continue on applying the rest of my make up.  Honestly, I have used other more expensive products with no results.  With BEST i can see an improvement pretty fast.  I recommend others to try it.</li>
            <li> I have porcelain like skin, but some evil sun spots/giant freckles were making an unwanted appearance over the past few years. I have tried other products. When I found this product on Amazon, at first I was doubtful, but I figured that 25.00 was worth the try. The cream is not heavy and very pleasant smelling. Many other products smell toxic-this does not. At first, like I&#x27;ve seen from other reviewers, I was starting to feel disgruntled, but I just kept on with my regimen of morning and night. One thing I suggest is that at night especially, I do not apply my regular lotion on top. I just lather it on and let it soak in. The spots are definitely fading away and are MUCH easier to cover. I am thrilled with this product and will remain a loyal customer. I started my regimen on September 10th and I&#x27;ve taken before photos and plan to take after photos. Hopefully I can make an addendum to this review!    Today is October 13th and it has been about 33 days since I started my regimen with BEST age spot remover. I promised before and after, but I do not see an option to upload these. Please note that I am fair skinned and I made certain I stayed out of the sun. This meant wearing the strongest block I could, staying in the shade when possible and wearing a hat. And to top it all off, I still have half of my jar leftover. Really thrilled!</li>
            <li> I bought my jar a while ago for the age spots on my hands and for a while, I was unimpressed. I figured I&#x27;d keep using it and get a refund if I didn&#x27;t see results.  Around a month I started to some fading occur, but still not what I wanted. After just shy of two months, though, I&#x27;m to see more and more improvement.  The spots on my hands are starting to fade more and more, and I must say, its a welcome change to success I&#x27;ve had with over the counter items in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be most effectively when used EVERY day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 less is more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 It takes a while to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 Rub in thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a quarter jar left and at this rate my age spots might be a memory instead of nuisance, so chances are I&#x27;ll be buying again!</li>
            <li> read the reviews could not wait to use it. used every day for a month no real results did start to brake out. maybe I was jest allergic</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any changes at all after using two containers.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much of a difference at all. My age spots on my face still look the same &amp; it&#x27;s been 3 weeks. I&#x27;m going to finish the jar but as of now, I overspent on this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the spot remover for two months and have not seen any change whatsoever of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a whim after seeing my Dermatologist numerous times over the course of ten years. I have a dozen Sun spots of brown [and blackish] tint on my forehead and temples. She said there is nothing operable here and no cancer. After using this product for two weeks on clean dry skin, twice a day -I can report the results now. I see a noticable fading of the most distinct sun spots. The contrast between my natural color and the spots has reduced 50%.    I consider this good news and suggest other men try it.    Thank you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.. Definitely saw my dark spots lighted up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now and I can see great result and improvement in my skin. The dark spots from acne are fading away even the older ones but they take longer time to fade than newer ones.</li>
            <li> I received my merchandise, so far so good, be sure while using this product, you apply a sunscreen during the day, and a nite cream at night. Preferably Oil of Olay Regenerist..nite cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product is a must have  to maintain a beautiful complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks, and after following the directions (use twice daily, apply sunscreen) I have noticed a definite difference in the dark spots on my hands. They&#x27;re not totally gone (and may never be - too soon to tell), but I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far and have recommended Best to my mom as well and would to anyone else who asked. Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I got it today but did not like the smell it was little overwhelming for me. I don&#x27;t think this is good quality product. I got this product looking at number reviews that really saw the difference.  But after using it my skin felt little irritated for a while and then was ok and after a while I wash my face and my skin felt very dry so I am not sure if I will use it again and little hesitant to use it if it might cause damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> Follow up call was appreciated... It does take a while (almost 2 months of daily appilcations !) BUT to be FAIR, it did the Job for much less money than Dermato&#x27;s Laser Offer !!! Large brown spot on fore ARM turned red, pink and finally vanished...</li>
            <li> This broke my skin out in a itchy rash.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I purchased this for a totally different reason. I had a hens tattoo and it would not come off. I washed it and scrubbed and nothing would take it off. I had a wedding to go to and did not want this tattoo. So I read how great this cream was on removing age and sun spots. So I gave it a try. It worked!!!! It removed that stupid tattoo. Gave the rest to my mom and she loves it and said that it has lighten some spots on her face and hands. good product.</li>
            <li> I will tell you something CLEAR later on. Need to use it a few more days to write a review</li>
            <li> I use this on the backs of my hands and it does what it says.</li>
            <li> this has not worked so far for me. is there a money back on this, if it does&#x27;nt work?</li>
            <li> No results a lot of money waste of time. I think it&#x27;s really sad I bought this product and it didn&#x27;t even work on my freckles they I wrote them a review told them this does not work not at all one bit not even on my freckles that were a little spot they told me to keep it and keep applying it so the due date for the return policy would expire and sure enough I&#x27;m not able to return this please do not buy this product does not work waste of money</li>
            <li> does nothing a $7 purchase at the drug store is better. so sorry I bought it. never again bad product</li>
            <li> I am getting results, noticed that one has to wait about 30 minutes after applying the cream to start cleaning. That&#x27;s how I noticed the effects of this cram</li>
            <li> I had 2 very noticeable age spots on my face on my temple. I gave the product a good 2 months of applying it very constant ( at least 2 times a day ) and bed time.&lt;br /&gt;, Now 2 Months later I would say 92% lightened .. My big surprise was the surrounding skin was totally unaffected !&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend this product ABSOLUTLY..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Company had even contacted me about 2 weeks or so after my purchase to make sure I was satisfied with the product but at that time it was to early to tell.  But A+ for standing behind the product !&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I think it only fair I share my great experience with it..&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line is it works if applied consistently, be patient and give it some time..&lt;br /&gt;  Great Product !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks  ..</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different over the counter remedies for age spots on my face. I did not see any difference with similarly advertised products by Garnier, Avon or even Clinique - which was quite costly. I have been using Best Age for a month now, targeting specific spots and using ONLY at night. I have noticed several smaller and lighter spots are almost gone and what is left of them are easily covered by makeup. I have a few larger spots clustered on my left cheek - the side that faces the driver window on my car, caused by sun damage from driving kids around for years. There are two spots that I am working on and would like to get under control.. The largest spot is roughly the size of a dime and the smaller the size of my pinkie finger tip. I THINK that they are getting lighter since they seem easier to cover up with concealer. I find it very encouraging with the results and especially that the lighter spots have almost disappeared so I am sticking with this product. If it lightens those larger spots up noticeably I will come back and give it five stars. I must say that the product itself comes in a very generous size jar, does not have any noticeable odor and goes on smoothly. According to directions, you only need to use a thin layer. I dab it on my individual spots with a cotton swab lightly but thick enough so I can see it, rather than so thin it is transparent. Applying it this way, and only at night, it should last quite a long time. It seems to dry quickly and since you apply it before your moisturizer, I wait a little bit for it to dry then put moisturizer on. So it is fairly simple to use and seems to be working for me, so I would recommend it being worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 9,2013..... Product continues to lighten my spots - it is getting easier and easier to cover them with concealer. The tiniest thin dot of concealer now does the trick for me.  I have been using the product for approx. 3 months now, only at night and sometimes even skip a night, but still am noticing a difference. My spots have definitely faded. They are not completely gone but I think the fact of them visibly lightening makes this product earn five stars. I am not sure if it will continue to fade the spots competely away, but based on what it had done so far, and the ease of use, I will stick with it!&lt;br /&gt;April 2014 update: I became lazy over the winter with using the product and think my larger age spots are getting darker, so I am back to using the product again. It definitely worked, but you need to be diligent. I was struck down by a few viruses over the winter that kept me from caring about my appearance, but now am getting back on track again. One thing I want to mention, if your spots become red with the first few applications, I believe this is normal and it improves with use. Also, I still have plenty of product left as I only  use it at night and on about four small areas on my face. But the product is starting to change colors and I am looking into  whether  or not it is still ok to use. It is almost a year since I purchased it so it may have expired. I will purchase a fresh jar, as the reasonable  price makes it well worth it. I still am happy with the results and will continue to use it., but still am noticing a difference.

            <li> Love the product ....hate the smell but works awesomely so can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I have been using for over a month and see no results. I use it every night, so once a day.</li>
            <li> I wanted to let everyone know a few things I found out from my dermatologist.  After I had been using this for 2 days, I developed these dark spots over the spots I had.  I was horrified and stopped using it.  The doc told me that&#x27;s very normal and means it&#x27;s working.  She also said this is a good product for what I had in mind.  I didn&#x27;t know if you could put it all over your hands or just on the spots.  She said you could put it all over the skin.  I have just about used the first jar and it is really working.  I&#x27;m so excited to find something that really works and is nice to use.  It&#x27;s not heavy or loaded with scent.  I don&#x27;t usually do reviews because I&#x27;m busy, but I had to let you guys know because I saw that some people quit using it because it made the spots darker at first.  This goes away in a few days and the spots begin lightening.  I use a lot of it and I got almost a month out of the jar.  I use it on both hands, arms, chest and a couple of spots on face.  I have just ordered a new jar.  I&#x27;m surprised because you usually read everything about the product and it turns out to be hype.  This one really works.  Don&#x27;t forget the sunscreen or they will come back.  I put the sunscreen on top of product after I let it dry a little.  Use sunscreen everyone.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of skin cancers from being a sun goddess in my youth.</li>
            <li> So far so good! The spots are fading slowly. I am so happy I finally found something that is working for &amp;#34; me&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> This stuff is clearly amazing! It does exactly what is says it will do for a very reasonable price! -will purchase again and again!! Try it and you will love it!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work much on me</li>
            <li> Bought this item after reading the positive reviews, but it didn&#x27;t really work for me. Was rather disappointed with the result.</li>
            <li> not sure if it works but crème seems to turn brown in time!</li>
            <li> I have used Best every day for about 4-5 weeks  on my hands &amp; face, it has eliminated the spots about 80 to 90% . It works I recommend it. you won&#x27;t be sorry.  Merv. in Michigan.</li>
            <li> I tried it for six weeks and none of my spots has gone away.&lt;br /&gt;Product is expensive and just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;waste of money.</li>
            <li> Nada - no difference. Expensive cold cream.</li>
            <li> This product arrived a couple days from purchase.  I put some on my hands and a few spots on my face.  It is not greasy.  my skin absorbed it easily.  By the second day, I do believe the brown spots were just beginning to fade.  By the third day I could see the difference.  My hands are looking softer and, I am hesitant to say, because, to me...an RN,  the spots really are fading so soon!  I do not understand it.  But there it is.  I do believe this product is working.</li>
            <li> I know this is supposed to take a while but I could see a small difference right away - I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a huge difference, but I don&#x27;t use it as consistently as I should either which is twice a day. And I just started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am happy to see results imagining the improvement when I start using it like I should. I love the smooth cream feel of the product. I have tried other serums but never really saw any difference.  This has shown more results with less use.</li>
