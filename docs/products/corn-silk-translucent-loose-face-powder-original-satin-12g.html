            <li>Best translucent powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for all ages.</li>
            <li>Its the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the cornsilk too.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>If you want to have flawless looking skin I recommend this product..</li>
            <li>I was impressed that  even though it was delivered out of The United Kingdom I received it in 3 days!</li>
            <li>The product itself is very good.</li>
            <li>Great for maintaining oily skin underneath make-up.</li>
            <li>So happy to have a place I can continue to purchase from on line.</li>
            <li>It will definitely be great if you are looking for a powder to absorb oil.  </li>
            <li>So happy to have found this product again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Corn Silk powder for many years and even though the formulation has changed somewhat over the years, it&#x27;s still the best face powder I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to continue purchasing it from this dealer, as it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I then found a good substitute for it, Clinique&#x27;s Invisable Blend.  </li>
            <li>The translucent powder does not change the color of your foundation and it feels sooooo-oo good on your skin and does not cake.  </li>
            <li>I am a make up artist and for fair skin tones nothing else compares</li>
            <li>I have always loved Corn Silk powder.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this was the laugh I got from the expression on my husband&#x27;s face, when he brought it home from our P.O. Box &amp; reported &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have my favorite face powder again, even if I have to have it shipped from the UK.</li>

            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin &amp; not only does this powder absorb it &amp; provide a great matte finish, but it sets my makeup beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I love this powder.  </li>
            <li>I love the we sparkle that&#x27;s in this cult product.</li>

            <li>my all time favorite face powder..doesn&#x27;t cake or look like you have it on..</li>
            <li>I love my product. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more years than I can remember.  </li>
            <li>I tried many when I could no longer buy it here &amp;</li>
            <li>great product and shipping fast</li>
            <li>I have used it for more than three decades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can still purchase it here.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hypoallergenic and I love it.</li>
            <li>It is all it claims to be and more.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it was more readily available.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a very long time and find it very good and</li>
            <li>I have searched months for this product that I have used for years, I am so excited.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the original had a detectable fragrance .</li>
            <li>Been using this since the 60&#x27;s and original &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; of the original product.  </li>
            <li>This is not the original corn silk made by sally Hansen from USA.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for a more reasonably priced substitute.</li>
            <li>GOT ITEMS ORDERED FIRST TIME!</li>
            <li>I so loved the original product that I decided to take a chance on this, despite the high price, mixed reviews, &amp; absurdity of having it shipped from England.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks young and healthy and I am 62.</li>
            <li>awesome product..wish they would bring it back, as do thousands of other women..</li>
            <li>The powder is exactly what I expected and have used for many, many years.</li>
            <li>This is my second order, excellent powder, soft, sheer, does not change makeup color.  </li>
            <li>I seems very much like the Sally Hanson Corn Silk powder I bought for years.</li>
            <li>So, I was happily surprised  to find it available through Amazon from across the pond.  </li>
            <li>After an initial rocky start, I ended up extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and have always been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>and I was very dissapointed by it.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and has super shine control for those areas that are slightly oily.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years because it does not cake on my skin, does not emphasize wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;, and it does not change color as many other face powders do.</li>
            <li>This is a very neutral soft silky pretty look.</li>
            <li>This does seem to be the same Corn Silk I knew and loved but the small amount that floats around the fancy box that&#x27;s too big for it is definitely not cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Corn Silk for years and highly recommend it for use with oily/combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, somewhere in the shipping process someone had scrawled the word &amp;#34;corn&amp;#34; on the outside of the lumpy padded envelope.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m surprised the agricultural inspectors even let it in to California!</li>
            <li>This new design doesn&#x27;t let you do that with it spilling over the sides.</li>
            <li>Controls oil when young and doesn&#x27;t sit in your creases when you are older.</li>
            <li>It definitely is not the same formulation as the original Cornsilk.</li>
            <li>It is a bit gritty and does not have the same sparkle in the sun as the original.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is not the same.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering it frequently.</li>
            <li>It is too white, and has too much of a&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This corn silk comes from a company in the UK and has a rougher texture than the old Sally Hanson version.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I buy it in bulk, no other place sells this product.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I&#x27;m not crazy about it and am really missing the Sally Hanson version.</li>
            <li>It has been dying a slow death for the past handful of years, first becoming increasingly scarce, then reappearing under the Sally Hansen label, only to disappear again until now, in this form.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Suggest blotting finished makeup with tissue, use puff with very little powder and press gently onto makeup then swipe downward with a very soft fluffy brush to wipe off excess powder.</li>
            <li> The powder doesn&#x27;t have the same texture and coverage, and there is far less product in the box than I expected</li>
            <li> #34;You got a strange package today.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not only does it not measure up to the original product, there are only about 2 meager tablespoons in the container.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely buy it again and would recommend it to other women.</li>
            <li> After 30-some years of using Corn Silk loose powder, I guess it&#x27;s time to admit that it is not what it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I have been using corn silk loose face powder for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> I like to flip it over before opening, just to get some loose powder to put on my makeup brush.</li>
            <li> I use Estee loose powder and wanted to compare.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be a little gritty.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and used a couple decades ago</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and nothing gives the finished look or lasts throughout a day&#x27;s work like this product.</li>
            <li> However, it appears to be what I wanted, so I am anxious to try it after my present face powder runs out.</li>
            <li> This was due to customs so not the company&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li> it was like the regular translucent corn silk that is so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> The product is average.  </li>
            <li> The price is ok, but I hate paying $5 shipping for every box.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a slight fragrance</li>
            <li> Very hard to find this product; had to look outside the United States for this.</li>
            <li> I wear very little makeup, but this is one of those products that I don&#x27;t know how I would do without.  </li>
            <li> No more shiney noses for me. . . .</li>
            <li> This has become very hard to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find now that Sally Hansen has decided to not produce.  </li>

            <li> After 30-some years of using Corn Silk loose powder, I guess it&#x27;s time to admit that it is not what it used to be.  It has been dying a slow death for the past handful of years, first becoming increasingly scarce, then reappearing under the Sally Hansen label, only to disappear again until now, in this form.  I so loved the original product that I decided to take a chance on this, despite the high price, mixed reviews, &amp; absurdity of having it shipped from England.  Unfortunately, not only does it not measure up to the original product, there are only about 2 meager tablespoons in the container.  I&#x27;m finally resigned to the fact that it is time to search for a replacement. The best thing about this was the laugh I got from the expression on my husband&#x27;s face, when he brought it home from our P.O. Box &amp; reported &amp;#34;You got a strange package today.  It says it&#x27;s from the United Kingdom, &amp; it has something to do with corn.&amp;#34;  Sure enough, somewhere in the shipping process someone had scrawled the word &amp;#34;corn&amp;#34; on the outside of the lumpy padded envelope.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m surprised the agricultural inspectors even let it in to California!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and have always been pleased with it.  Don&#x27;t understand why it is no longer on store shelves.</li>
            <li> I love this powder.  It doesn&#x27;t look like you are wearing powder.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and used a couple decades ago</li>
            <li> Would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Great for maintaining oily skin underneath make-up.</li>
            <li> This has been around for years . I love the we sparkle that&#x27;s in this cult product. Makes your skin look radiant  and last all day. Top product</li>
            <li> The only place I have found this face powder ! I will be ordering it frequently.</li>
            <li> Best translucent powder.</li>
            <li> this was discontinued years ago and i am sooo glad i found it again..my all time favorite face powder..doesn&#x27;t cake or look like you have it on..awesome product..wish they would bring it back, as do thousands of other women..</li>
            <li> I have searched months for this product that I have used for years, I am so excited. Thank you! I love my product. :)</li>
            <li> It definitely is not the same formulation as the original Cornsilk. It is a bit gritty and does not have the same sparkle in the sun as the original. It seems to have a slight fragrance and I don&#x27;t think the original had a detectable fragrance . I will use up the container but I probably will not buy another. I will just try to find another US brand. I miss the original&lt;br /&gt;Cornsilk!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more years than I can remember.  The fact that I can no longer just walk into a store here &amp; buy it makes me nuts.  I never have to worry if the color matches my skin because it doesn&#x27;t have a color.  I have oily skin &amp; not only does this powder absorb it &amp; provide a great matte finish, but it sets my makeup beautifully.  When I look in the mirror I can tell the difference if I&#x27;m wearing Corn Silk or another company&#x27;s powder.  I tried many when I could no longer buy it here &amp; Corn Silk is still for me.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 40 years, and then supposedly, the manufacturer discontinued&lt;br /&gt;it.  I then found a good substitute for it, Clinique&#x27;s Invisable Blend.  I accidentally&lt;br /&gt;saw a site for discontinued products, and saw where I could order Corn Silk once&lt;br /&gt;again.  Unfortunately, it is not the same.  It is too white, and has too much of a&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.  I don&#x27;t think I will re-order unless Clinique discontinues their product.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Corn Silk at Fedco, if anyone remembers that store, and then it disappeared off of the market.  I was told that it was not manufactured any longer.  So, I was happily surprised  to find it available through Amazon from across the pond.  The translucent powder does not change the color of your foundation and it feels sooooo-oo good on your skin and does not cake.  No more shiney noses for me. . . .</li>
            <li> I have been using corn silk loose face powder for over 30 years. So happy to have a place I can continue to purchase from on line. I buy it in bulk, no other place sells this product. I hope I can always have a source that I can buy this from, because it is no longer sold in the USA.</li>
            <li> The product is average.  I&#x27;ve been using Derma Blend &amp; wanted to give this product a try.  I prefer Derma Blend.</li>
            <li> I like to flip it over before opening, just to get some loose powder to put on my makeup brush. This new design doesn&#x27;t let you do that with it spilling over the sides. The product itself is very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Corn Silk powder for many years and even though the formulation has changed somewhat over the years, it&#x27;s still the best face powder I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> I love this powder!  I have been using Corn Silk for years and highly recommend it for use with oily/combination skin.  I have tried other products and nothing gives the finished look or lasts throughout a day&#x27;s work like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have my favorite face powder again, even if I have to have it shipped from the UK. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Been using this since the 60&#x27;s and original &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; of the original product.  Difficult to find now that Sally Hansen has decided to not produce.  So good to be able to find it.  This company is prompt and without problems on delivery.</li>
            <li> great product and shipping fast</li>
            <li> I had no idea I&#x27;d have to purchase this from outside the U.S.  This does seem to be the same Corn Silk I knew and loved but the small amount that floats around the fancy box that&#x27;s too big for it is definitely not cost effective.  I&#x27;ll be looking for a more reasonably priced substitute.</li>
            <li> Although I have received this product, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  However, it appears to be what I wanted, so I am anxious to try it after my present face powder runs out.</li>
            <li> This corn silk comes from a company in the UK and has a rougher texture than the old Sally Hanson version.  It does contain talc so beware if you have issues with talc.  It will definitely be great if you are looking for a powder to absorb oil.  Because it comes from the UK it took about a month to arrive - well beyond the estimated delivery date.  This was due to customs so not the company&#x27;s fault.  I have to admit I&#x27;m not crazy about it and am really missing the Sally Hanson version.</li>
            <li> This has become very hard to find in retail stores. It is perfect for all ages. Controls oil when young and doesn&#x27;t sit in your creases when you are older. Also you can powder around your eyes to set your shadow without irritation. I have used it for more than three decades. I just wish it was more readily available.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I use Estee loose powder and wanted to compare. This is a very neutral soft silky pretty look. I like it.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m so glad I can still purchase it here. It is the only powder that does not change your concealer. I am a make up artist and for fair skin tones nothing else compares</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this product again. Please do not stop making this face powder. Its the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Can&#x27;t find anything that compares to it at all.</li>
            <li> This is not the original corn silk made by sally Hansen from USA.  This product comes from london. Sally hansen no longer makes corn silk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the Cornsilk of yesteryear.  The powder doesn&#x27;t have the same texture and coverage, and there is far less product in the box than I expected</li>
            <li> Overpriced for amount of powder in the container.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Corn Silk powder. I wish we could still get it in the stores. It was cheaper there!!!</li>
            <li> Very hard to find this product; had to look outside the United States for this. After an initial rocky start, I ended up extremely satisfied. Would definitely buy it again and would recommend it to other women.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years because it does not cake on my skin, does not emphasize wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;, and it does not change color as many other face powders do.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a very long time and find it very good and the size plus the cost keep it on my list!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the cornsilk too. Thank u.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like this face powder.  I hope to be able to continue purchasing it from this dealer, as it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it was like the regular translucent corn silk that is so hard to find.  It is not.  It is very gritty feeling and I was very dissapointed by it.</li>
            <li> I wear very little makeup, but this is one of those products that I don&#x27;t know how I would do without.  I have used this for many years now.  It goes on light and has super shine control for those areas that are slightly oily.  It stays put, making it though a 10 hour workday with no problem.</li>
            <li> The powder is exactly what I expected and have used for many, many years. It&#x27;s hypoallergenic and I love it.</li>
            <li> still available and as good as ever! Will deal w/ CHATTEM GLOBEL CONSUMER PRODUCTS AGAIN, PROMPT SHIPPING. GOT ITEMS ORDERED FIRST TIME!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It is all it claims to be and more.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> If you want to have flawless looking skin I recommend this product.. My skin looks young and healthy and I am 62.</li>
            <li> This is my second order, excellent powder, soft, sheer, does not change makeup color.  Suggest blotting finished makeup with tissue, use puff with very little powder and press gently onto makeup then swipe downward with a very soft fluffy brush to wipe off excess powder. Finish with a setting spray but not necessary</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected. I seems very much like the Sally Hanson Corn Silk powder I bought for years. The price is ok, but I hate paying $5 shipping for every box.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same Corn Silk that I purchased years ago. It does seem to be a little gritty. I was impressed that  even though it was delivered out of The United Kingdom I received it in 3 days!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Been using it for yrs.</li>
