            <li>the fit is perfect for when I make full wigs With closure.</li>
            <li>The material feels very strong as well.</li>
            <li>I just would have liked to get doubled for a better price.</li>
            <li>It has a great snug fit and it&#x27;s light and airy.</li>
            <li>fit perfect will be buying more thanks</li>
            <li>Very secure and snug.</li>
            <li>Good size good material very soft</li>
            <li>It was everything and more.</li>
            <li>I make wigs I have tried them all and have been in satisfied...</li>
            <li>I love it .  </li>
            <li>I love this cap</li>
            <li>I LOVE these caps.  </li>
            <li>I love this wig cap.</li>
            <li>it fits ok, i will buy another.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super thrilled about that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong breathable and fits snug on my head.</li>
            <li>So strong.</li>
            <li>The fit is snug and feels secure.</li>
            <li>I had been using Dri Sweat Fit Women&#x27;s Style Protector Caps, but those dye in those things never stop running.  </li>
            <li>my wigs fit snug without having to use combs</li>
            <li>I sewed my weave on this wig and it looks nice and is still very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Really nice fit, snug but not hard strapped.</li>
            <li>These are excellent for making wigs dry fast when wash</li>
            <li>I have a small head so the cap fits me perfectly.</li>
            <li>cheap, fast shipping is what i like...:)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this cap for wigs especially if you cant find a good cap to sew your wefts instead of gluing.</li>
            <li>but its a good product kind of small but stretches</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both weaving caps and dome caps for making wigs: weaving caps easily rip, get smaller as I sew and are too small for my head, while some caps are the perfect fit and are more durable</li>
            <li>but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>But I think this will be far more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I used this cap on a wig my sister made and it fit pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>It is certainly stronger than a wig cap and comfortable for wig making.</li>
            <li>The cap works great but was a little to for my head.</li>
            <li>Although the shipping takes a bit, it certainly is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing many more in the near future!</li>
            <li>And the SUPER FAST delivery even with NYE holidays.</li>
            <li>It was exactly the way it was described.</li>
            <li>First review I&#x27;ve ever done on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I used it to make a u part unit today and I can honestly say I&#x27;ll never use any other cap for my wigs.</li>
            <li>These wig caps were ok&#x27; not thick enough for me</li>
            <li>It seems strong enough to support sown tracks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the cap it didn&#x27;t fit properly</li>
            <li>I use them for all kinds of wigs, love the wide band</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable yet gentle on your hair, the dye doesn&#x27;t run (thank God).</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>i Like this product.. fast delivery..</li>
            <li>It was way better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>new to this...</li>
            <li>If they offered different sizes (including large)</li>
            <li>This cap is very sturdy and it stretches if you have a big head.</li>
            <li>but I did have to reinforce with wig clips and a few hair pins to stay secure.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>It may seem a bit flimsy but its very sturdy and long lasting.</li>
            <li>For that reason I went to a professional stylist and the cap was in place after the wig was sewn just the same.</li>
            <li>The only downside is I found them much cheaper ($2.99) on MULTIPLE beauty supply sites, which means I could have gotten almost the double the amount for the same price.  </li>

            <li> Qfitt, Please, please, please make these caps in small, medium and large.</li>
            <li> If the sizes could coincide with standard lace wig sizes (22.5-23 inches in circumference being the largest WHEN STRETCHED)</li>
            <li> If one is not careful you can sew the wefts too tight and the cap will draw up a bit causing it to be smaller.</li>
            <li> I received this product a day earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I was making a wig with super expensive hair, I might have bought one with straps and combs and pull tabs.</li>
            <li> The quality of the caps are not great, nothing special and for a cap that is nothing special, was very expensive the postage.</li>
            <li> It is what was expected  </li>

            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I wish it came with clips because it does get a bit slippery at times but for now I use bobbi pins and hold it down.</li>
            <li> no glue with these caps and when u see it doesn&#x27;t get tight ither</li>
            <li> It  fits tight on my head and</li>
            <li> Too tight and slides up.</li>
            <li> Fits tightly and does NOT shrink at all when hair is being sewn onto it.  </li>
            <li> A little heavy/thick for the summertime.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money ordering this because I doubt I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s too small for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the braids I had underneath</li>
            <li> Unbelievably expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Product is not good.</li>
            <li> the mesh material is too thick to me.  </li>

            <li> This cap if perfect for making wigs. The fit is snug and feels secure. Even though it wasnt a prime item i recieved my shipment in two days.</li>
            <li> It is what was expected  that came I just would have liked to get doubled for a better price.</li>
            <li> I love this cap but I can&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s too small for me. Yes Lord, I got a big head AND I have a lot of hair. All I need is another inch or two of flexibility. I&#x27;m going to keep it for my niece when I make her wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Qfitt, Please, please, please make these caps in small, medium and large. If the sizes could coincide with standard lace wig sizes (22.5-23 inches in circumference being the largest WHEN STRETCHED) I&#x27;d be a customer for here to the end. Even the inside is made well. Damn, I wish they came bigger.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these caps.  I had been using Dri Sweat Fit Women&#x27;s Style Protector Caps, but those dye in those things never stop running.  I have a small head so the cap fits me perfectly. It&#x27;s durable yet gentle on your hair, the dye doesn&#x27;t run (thank God). The only downside is I found them much cheaper ($2.99) on MULTIPLE beauty supply sites, which means I could have gotten almost the double the amount for the same price.  Other than that I&#x27;d definitely recommend these caps.</li>
            <li> A little heavy/thick for the summertime. But it does what outta supposed to do. Very sturdy. Good foundation.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for making my wigs...my wigs fit snug without having to use combs</li>
            <li> Too tight and slides up. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> The quality of the caps are not great, nothing special and for a cap that is nothing special, was very expensive the postage. Unbelievably expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Product is not good. Don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li> This review pertains to the product. I have no problems with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this dome cap to make a wig and I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  You can&#x27;t adjust the cap to your head the mesh material is too thick to me.  I actually ordered this before realizing I can purchase at my local beauty supply.  I wasted my money ordering this because I doubt I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li> Great for makling your own wig.</li>
            <li> Its so perfect! Fit is on point, great stretch!</li>
            <li> superb seller.fast shipping.wig cap is made of good quality material though the edges could run if over manipulated while sewing. cap runs colour too after washing but it dries quickly. one size fits all head.comfortable and has good ventilation while wearing with weave sewn on.pricy here though</li>
            <li> This cap is very sturdy and it stretches if you have a big head. I sewed my weave on this wig and it looks nice and is still very sturdy. If one is not careful you can sew the wefts too tight and the cap will draw up a bit causing it to be smaller. For that reason I went to a professional stylist and the cap was in place after the wig was sewn just the same. The material feels very strong as well. I wish it came with clips because it does get a bit slippery at times but for now I use bobbi pins and hold it down. When I do have the time I sew the edge of the wig on to my hairline, but I do not wear it for moe than two days this way since it can be damaging to the hairline. I would recommend this cap for wigs especially if you cant find a good cap to sew your wefts instead of gluing.</li>
            <li> I love this wig cap. It has a great snug fit and it&#x27;s light and airy.</li>
            <li> This cap is wonderful. It is certainly stronger than a wig cap and comfortable for wig making. Just as it is pictured. Really nice fit, snug but not hard strapped. Perhaps if I was making a wig with super expensive hair, I might have bought one with straps and combs and pull tabs. But I think this will be far more comfortable. The mesh can hold up to glue, but I cant comment on sewing hair to the mesh because I havent tried that. It seems strong enough to support sown tracks. Excellent price, quick delivery</li>
            <li> i Like this product.. fast delivery..</li>
            <li> new to this...it fits ok, i will buy another. cheap, fast shipping is what i like...:)</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! So sturdy. So strong. Probably one of the best caps for wig making!</li>
            <li> Perfect wig mesh dome cap for making units.</li>
            <li> This in my opinion is the best cap for creating your very own personalized wig! It may seem a bit flimsy but its very sturdy and long lasting. I will be purchasing many more in the near future!</li>
            <li> I used this cap on a wig my sister made and it fit pretty sturdy. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the braids I had underneath but I did have to reinforce with wig clips and a few hair pins to stay secure. However I will be buying this  for my next wig.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both weaving caps and dome caps for making wigs: weaving caps easily rip, get smaller as I sew and are too small for my head, while some caps are the perfect fit and are more durable but my scalp can&#x27;t breathe. I debated buying this cap online for a while but I finally found it in a BSS for $5. I knew as soon as I opened it that it was perfect! It&#x27;s breathable, it&#x27;s stretchy enough for us girls with bigger heads, and it&#x27;s sturdy and durable. I used it to make a u part unit today and I can honestly say I&#x27;ll never use any other cap for my wigs.</li>
            <li> I LOVEEEEE these for making wigs!!!  Fits tightly and does NOT shrink at all when hair is being sewn onto it.  Its soo durable and breathable.</li>
            <li> Fits my head perfectly. Used to make a wig. Will definitely but again</li>
            <li> It was way better than I expected.  Has breathable material and a great price.  Although the shipping takes a bit, it certainly is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Perfect for U-part wigs.. very sterdy ..</li>
            <li> The cap works great but was a little to for my head.</li>
