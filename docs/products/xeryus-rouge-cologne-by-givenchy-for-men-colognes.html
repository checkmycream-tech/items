            <li>Xeryus Rouge is simply the best.  </li>
            <li>This is my Husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Xeryus Rouge for many years.  </li>
            <li>what more can i say</li>
            <li>this fragrance is certainly a sure fire</li>
            <li>Its lovely</li>
            <li>a clasical fragance I love it</li>
            <li>A nice clean scent that&#x27;s not too over-powering and lingers on you</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on for the first time and my fiance and her friend walks in and both immediately loved it..</li>
            <li>I honestly think it has a purpose, it has a bold personality and purpose that can&#x27;t just be pulled off whenever.</li>
            <li>It is easily my all time favorite now.</li>
            <li>The most important reason for you to buy it is because you cannot find this scent elsewhere for this price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong too...</li>
            <li>I like this scent, but it&#x27;s rather strong.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances, specially for winter</li>
            <li>This is not a jack of all trades type of fragrance, but a fragrance that does what it does so well; smell good and sexy and romantic on that occasion when you most need it.</li>
            <li>It is unique and its just not all sweetness, but it is very sweet.</li>
            <li>I women rubbing the nose across my neck when I huge them</li>
            <li>I am a huge Givenchy fan and I purchase Givenchy colognes for myself and perfumes for the ladies.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit with every event in which you need a fragrance, but it&#x27;s great to have in the wardrobe for those romantic outings or even out to a club!</li>
            <li>I enjoy smelling the fragrance on him.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see it for purchase at this web site, and will use this facility when I find myself in need of the product in future.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more intriguing.</li>
            <li>still available.</li>
            <li>it was in great condition when i recieved it and the shipping time was totally acceptable.</li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;LL BE BACK FOR SURE  !!</li>
            <li>glad I was able to find a new source!</li>
            <li>I first got it in Toronto over 10 years ago,  still my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>If the scent resembled the original authentic scent I wouldn&#x27;t mind that much.</li>
            <li>He wears it on special occasions or just to lounge around the home.</li>
            <li>it makes you special comfort among friends and long-lasting light&lt;br /&gt;Light musk scent Givenchy Mmtmiz make you all the time</li>
            <li>Hey let&#x27;s not go there and stop it right here!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear to me why Givenchy has been producing Xeryus Rouge since the mid-1990s and why it has stayed popular over all this time.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t this a good enough reason to buy something that doesn&#x27;t smell like you do your perfume shopping at walmart or 7-11.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what a real man should wear its spicy,little sweet,sophisticated ,sexy....</li>
            <li>I had it before, and i like the smell (good and lasting, but very aggressive), and here is best price for it (some $25 less).</li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy the many unexpected complements you&#x27;ll get from women you don&#x27;t even know.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much my husband and I BOTH love this product!!</li>
            <li>This cologne has been around for many years although not as long as Givenchy Gentlemen, which is my long-time favorite.</li>
            <li>This is a great scent to wear with a nice red designer dress shirt and black slacks.  </li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, pleasant, not too strong, mellow, sexy and a long lasting flavor.</li>
            <li>girlfriend take to the mall and bought a givenchy sample for $14.00 and try different one out between pi and xeryus rouge these two or my good favorite following by Jean Paul gutter / Givenchy</li>
            <li>some of them ask me what is that with va flirting smile</li>
            <li>classy, elegant yet understated.</li>
            <li>It was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite cologne scents.</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>like it because I get plenty of compliments and it&#x27;s not the generic popular scent</li>
            <li>Not at all overpowering just very clean, crisp, rich and masculine with a romantic and sexy twist.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve tried other products, I always return to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong, lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Not a typical Givenchy smell, Comes on strong, over powering and then dies off.</li>
            <li>exactly a like I remember as a kid grown up one of friends had that scent</li>
            <li>Try buying this in department store and see how much it costs you!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>️I would like to take a bath in this fragrance, it&#x27;s so yummy;-)</li>
            <li>First time user of Xeryus Rouge but do also use Givenchy Gentlemen.  </li>
            <li>Love it, actually I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>SO Glad they brought it back!!!</li>
            <li>Luscious, sexy, passionate, romantic (in a good way), yet mysterious.     </li>
            <li>It gets positive attention every time out.  </li>
            <li>Givenchy Xeryus Rouge for those special daytime occasions and also for frequent nighttime use when going out on the town, and (3) Vera Wang for Men for those special nights that require a strong, exotic, very complex</li>
            <li>Pretty much that is what is reminds me of.    </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS ITEM FOR A LONG TIME</li>
            <li>This has been a steady item in my arsenal stash of colognes for decades!</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I tell you it smells very closeted or</li>
            <li>very irresistible threw the fall and winter months</li>
            <li>Amazon is surely reasonable for fragrances.</li>
            <li>Very spicy...</li>
            <li>It has a bouquet that tends to straddle the space between a milder day-time cologne and a much stronger/fuller nighttime cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was very please with my purchase of Givenchy&#x27;s Xeryus Rouge.</li>
            <li>no one could find better than givenchy xeryus rough.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what else to say.  </li>
            <li>I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>So you don&#x27;t need to spray much.</li>
            <li>THANKS ...</li>
            <li>the scent is very alluring and attention grabbing...</li>
            <li>I really like this product but cannot find it in stores,</li>
            <li>(though it&#x27;s pretty strong while it&#x27;s still wet).  </li>
            <li>right before I get home from work, so it has a chance to settle and combine with his natural smell.  </li>
            <li>have gotten more favorable comments on this than any other one I ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a modern smelling classic for men.  </li>
            <li>I sampled it, liked it, and bought some, but all the reviewers on various websites saying that it lasts as long as Joop are sorely mistaken in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I use a combination of Sodium Alum (aka &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34;) anti-perspirant, lotion, and cologne in lieu of deodorants with aluminum in them because I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to use a product linked with Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.  </li>
            <li>This is a classic and up there with the likes of: Fahrenheit, A*Men, ... .    </li>
            <li>This is just a Classic scent.</li>
            <li>This bottle is replacing a taller older bottle</li>
            <li>highly recommend it as both an every day and evening cologne.</li>
            <li>It can bee worn as a everyday scent or for a more formal event.</li>
            <li>Givenchy has also made other great colognes which I have bought a few times and would recommend too!</li>
            <li>Now has a new bottle design.</li>
            <li>Switched to new after shaves.</li>
            <li>I usually say if you want to know more, follow me home...</li>
            <li>When you look at red medicine, you know its sweet and will taste, well, like something red.</li>
            <li>I like this scent - somewhat masculine, long-lasting, complex, but not flowery, just makes you interesting.</li>
            <li>is an absolute monster of longevity and sillage, and Xeryus Rouge is not in the same league.  </li>
            <li>He was pleasantly surprised when he got it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply it directly.  </li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot return this.</li>
            <li>Versatile, good for casual and formal use.</li>
            <li>more than two sprays\\&quot; which is correct if you&#x27;re walking into a small office or other small enclosed space, but if you&#x27;re outdoors or in a large indoor environment, you can use as many as eight sprays...</li>
            <li>Xeryus Rouge keeps up with it&#x27;s original Xeryus, the rouge has a very potent start and is not to be sprayed inside of an automobile this can and does cause one to be overpowered by the scent and almost disappointed.</li>
            <li>It dries down rather quickly, but spray on when you are *not</li>
            <li>No other company comes close to it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>It is neither one of those dated old, leather-bound, musty smelling \\&quot;men&#x27;s colognes\\&quot; of yesteryear or one of the newer, odd chemical smelling colognes which I can&#x27;t stand -- who wants to smell like acetone?  </li>
            <li>buy 3 different colognes to place on my shelf as \\&quot;keepers\\&quot;: (1) Nautica Voyage as an inexpensive and mild &#x27;aquatic&#x27; day cologne for use on most work days, (2)</li>
            <li>The perfume was not original I had to wait too much for the delivery</li>
            <li>A bit expensive, yes, but you will certainly get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Women really love it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Xeryus Rouge for many years.  </li>
            <li> what more can i say</li>
            <li> this fragrance is certainly a sure fire</li>
            <li> Its lovely</li>
            <li> a clasical fragance I love it</li>
            <li> A nice clean scent that&#x27;s not too over-powering and lingers on you</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on for the first time and my fiance and her friend walks in and both immediately loved it..</li>
            <li> I honestly think it has a purpose, it has a bold personality and purpose that can&#x27;t just be pulled off whenever.</li>
            <li> It is easily my all time favorite now.</li>
            <li> The most important reason for you to buy it is because you cannot find this scent elsewhere for this price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong too...</li>
            <li> I like this scent, but it&#x27;s rather strong.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances, specially for winter</li>
            <li> This is not a jack of all trades type of fragrance, but a fragrance that does what it does so well; smell good and sexy and romantic on that occasion when you most need it.</li>
            <li> It is unique and its just not all sweetness, but it is very sweet.</li>
            <li> I women rubbing the nose across my neck when I huge them</li>
            <li> I am a huge Givenchy fan and I purchase Givenchy colognes for myself and perfumes for the ladies.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit with every event in which you need a fragrance, but it&#x27;s great to have in the wardrobe for those romantic outings or even out to a club!</li>
            <li> I enjoy smelling the fragrance on him.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see it for purchase at this web site, and will use this facility when I find myself in need of the product in future.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more intriguing.</li>
            <li> still available.</li>
            <li> it was in great condition when i recieved it and the shipping time was totally acceptable.</li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;LL BE BACK FOR SURE  !!</li>
            <li> glad I was able to find a new source!</li>
            <li> I first got it in Toronto over 10 years ago,  still my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> If the scent resembled the original authentic scent I wouldn&#x27;t mind that much.</li>
            <li> He wears it on special occasions or just to lounge around the home.</li>
            <li> it makes you special comfort among friends and long-lasting light&lt;br /&gt;Light musk scent Givenchy Mmtmiz make you all the time</li>
            <li> Hey let&#x27;s not go there and stop it right here!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear to me why Givenchy has been producing Xeryus Rouge since the mid-1990s and why it has stayed popular over all this time.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t this a good enough reason to buy something that doesn&#x27;t smell like you do your perfume shopping at walmart or 7-11.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what a real man should wear its spicy,little sweet,sophisticated ,sexy....</li>
            <li> I had it before, and i like the smell (good and lasting, but very aggressive), and here is best price for it (some $25 less).</li>
            <li> Buy it and enjoy the many unexpected complements you&#x27;ll get from women you don&#x27;t even know.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much my husband and I BOTH love this product!!</li>
            <li> This cologne has been around for many years although not as long as Givenchy Gentlemen, which is my long-time favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent to wear with a nice red designer dress shirt and black slacks.  </li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, pleasant, not too strong, mellow, sexy and a long lasting flavor.</li>
            <li> girlfriend take to the mall and bought a givenchy sample for $14.00 and try different one out between pi and xeryus rouge these two or my good favorite following by Jean Paul gutter / Givenchy</li>
            <li> some of them ask me what is that with va flirting smile</li>
            <li> classy, elegant yet understated.</li>
            <li> It was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite cologne scents.</li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> like it because I get plenty of compliments and it&#x27;s not the generic popular scent</li>
            <li> Not at all overpowering just very clean, crisp, rich and masculine with a romantic and sexy twist.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve tried other products, I always return to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong, lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Not a typical Givenchy smell, Comes on strong, over powering and then dies off.</li>
            <li> exactly a like I remember as a kid grown up one of friends had that scent</li>
            <li> Try buying this in department store and see how much it costs you!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> ️I would like to take a bath in this fragrance, it&#x27;s so yummy;-)</li>
            <li> First time user of Xeryus Rouge but do also use Givenchy Gentlemen.  </li>
            <li> Love it, actually I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> SO Glad they brought it back!!!</li>
            <li> Luscious, sexy, passionate, romantic (in a good way), yet mysterious.     </li>
            <li> It gets positive attention every time out.  </li>
            <li> Givenchy Xeryus Rouge for those special daytime occasions and also for frequent nighttime use when going out on the town, and (3) Vera Wang for Men for those special nights that require a strong, exotic, very complex</li>
            <li> Pretty much that is what is reminds me of.    </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM FOR A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> This has been a steady item in my arsenal stash of colognes for decades!</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I tell you it smells very closeted or</li>
            <li> very irresistible threw the fall and winter months</li>
            <li> Amazon is surely reasonable for fragrances.</li>
            <li> Very spicy...</li>
            <li> It has a bouquet that tends to straddle the space between a milder day-time cologne and a much stronger/fuller nighttime cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was very please with my purchase of Givenchy&#x27;s Xeryus Rouge.</li>
            <li> no one could find better than givenchy xeryus rough.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what else to say.  </li>
            <li> I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t need to spray much.</li>
            <li> THANKS ...</li>
            <li> the scent is very alluring and attention grabbing...</li>
            <li> I really like this product but cannot find it in stores,</li>
            <li> (though it&#x27;s pretty strong while it&#x27;s still wet).  </li>
            <li> right before I get home from work, so it has a chance to settle and combine with his natural smell.  </li>
            <li> have gotten more favorable comments on this than any other one I ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a modern smelling classic for men.  </li>
            <li> I sampled it, liked it, and bought some, but all the reviewers on various websites saying that it lasts as long as Joop are sorely mistaken in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I use a combination of Sodium Alum (aka &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34;) anti-perspirant, lotion, and cologne in lieu of deodorants with aluminum in them because I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to use a product linked with Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.  </li>
            <li> This is a classic and up there with the likes of: Fahrenheit, A*Men, ... .    </li>
            <li> This is just a Classic scent.</li>
            <li> This bottle is replacing a taller older bottle</li>
            <li> highly recommend it as both an every day and evening cologne.</li>
            <li> It can bee worn as a everyday scent or for a more formal event.</li>
            <li> Givenchy has also made other great colognes which I have bought a few times and would recommend too!</li>
            <li> Now has a new bottle design.</li>
            <li> Switched to new after shaves.</li>
            <li> I usually say if you want to know more, follow me home...</li>
            <li> When you look at red medicine, you know its sweet and will taste, well, like something red.</li>
            <li> I like this scent - somewhat masculine, long-lasting, complex, but not flowery, just makes you interesting.</li>
            <li> is an absolute monster of longevity and sillage, and Xeryus Rouge is not in the same league.  </li>
            <li> He was pleasantly surprised when he got it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply it directly.  </li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot return this.</li>
            <li> Versatile, good for casual and formal use.</li>
            <li> more than two sprays\\&quot; which is correct if you&#x27;re walking into a small office or other small enclosed space, but if you&#x27;re outdoors or in a large indoor environment, you can use as many as eight sprays...</li>
            <li> Xeryus Rouge keeps up with it&#x27;s original Xeryus, the rouge has a very potent start and is not to be sprayed inside of an automobile this can and does cause one to be overpowered by the scent and almost disappointed.</li>
            <li> It dries down rather quickly, but spray on when you are *not</li>
            <li> No other company comes close to it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> It is neither one of those dated old, leather-bound, musty smelling \\&quot;men&#x27;s colognes\\&quot; of yesteryear or one of the newer, odd chemical smelling colognes which I can&#x27;t stand -- who wants to smell like acetone?  </li>
            <li> buy 3 different colognes to place on my shelf as \\&quot;keepers\\&quot;: (1) Nautica Voyage as an inexpensive and mild &#x27;aquatic&#x27; day cologne for use on most work days, (2)</li>
            <li> The perfume was not original I had to wait too much for the delivery</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, yes, but you will certainly get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I use three sprays on each side and that&#x27;s enough to last all day (about 6-8 hours with minimal physical labor/sweating) without being overpowering</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> still a little left over sent the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the color red in a bottle with a touch of black as the cap suggests.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my previous bottle was running low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne in the past and recently ran out.</li>
            <li> To bad it&#x27;s not available any more</li>
            <li> I have to agree with a previous review women dig this cologne.</li>
            <li> is not original, not recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and never have I paid so little for it.</li>
            <li> but I have been using this cologne at least once every other week for years.</li>
            <li> Been my smell for past 12 years.</li>
            <li> and I am a hard to please,</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cologne at least since 1997.....</li>
            <li> You know what I mean...</li>
            <li> This scent is subtle and does not linger in the air as others.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of what they are; these cologne can never go wrong</li>
            <li> Not all of them are astronomically expensive but some of them are affordable.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with this?</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with</li>
            <li> Sadly i was sold a fake version.</li>
            <li> it is fake</li>
            <li> go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I was afraid they weren&#x27;t even gonna make it anymore</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice price for the Rouge and delivery on time!</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance. It is a great nighttime, going out, sexy scent. Have gotten a lot of compliments from girls on this one.</li>
            <li> This one of my favorite Cologne It smells good I can tell y&#x27;all I used vanilla and lavender fabrics softener when washing my clothes I tell you it smells very closeted or exactly a like I remember as a kid grown up one of friends had that scent I never ask what it was I just stumbled across from then girlfriend take to the mall and bought a givenchy sample for $14.00 and try different one out between pi and xeryus rouge these two or my good favorite following by Jean Paul gutter / Givenchy very irresistible threw the fall and winter months there&#x27;s a couple more I can&#x27;t think of what they are; these cologne can never go wrong I women rubbing the nose across my neck when I huge them some of them ask me what is that with va flirting smile</li>
            <li> Not a typical Givenchy smell, Comes on strong, over powering and then dies off. The smell does not last</li>
            <li> This cologne has been around for many years although not as long as Givenchy Gentlemen, which is my long-time favorite. Now has a new bottle design. Smell is airy, sexy and uplifting. Good for any guy who needs some attention. You know what I mean...</li>
            <li> Yes, as the name says, it fits perfectly. It is the color red in a bottle with a touch of black as the cap suggests. Luscious, sexy, passionate, romantic (in a good way), yet mysterious.     This fragrance projects; it lasts, and smells very, very good. It is unique and its just not all sweetness, but it is very sweet. Again, this is red in a bottle.When you look at red medicine, you know its sweet and will taste, well, like something red. Growing up,     This is a classic and up there with the likes of: Fahrenheit, A*Men, ... .    This fragrance however, isn&#x27;t something you just wear every day. I honestly think it has a purpose, it has a bold personality and purpose that can&#x27;t just be pulled off whenever. Just like Fahrenheit or A*Men, you have to know the &#x27;situation&#x27; in order to pull it off. This scent is perfect for Valentines day. This scent is perfect for a night out in the evening, for dinner with a woman or a date.     What does this scent most remind me of? You know those ruby ring candies? The red ones? Pretty much that is what is reminds me of.    This is not a jack of all trades type of fragrance, but a fragrance that does what it does so well; smell good and sexy and romantic on that occasion when you most need it. Great addition to anyone building their collection or what like to add variety.</li>
            <li> This has been a steady item in my arsenal stash of colognes for decades! I always keep 16 colognes in stock. Not all of them are astronomically expensive but some of them are affordable. This one is a solid fragrance for years. I am a huge Givenchy fan and I purchase Givenchy colognes for myself and perfumes for the ladies. Givenchy in my opinion is the best. No other company comes close to it. Year after year and decade after decade Givenchy has been releasing top hits and some of the greatest essences in the globe. Well, this one is surely in top 20. Xeryus is not a big deal but Xeryus Rouge (red) is a smash. How can you go wrong with this? This is a solid scent. Soft, smooth, pleasant, not too strong, mellow, sexy and a long lasting flavor. I don&#x27;t want to advertise for Givenchy but I have been using this cologne at least once every other week for years. This cologne is a lady killer. Throughout the years, I had so many comments about this scent by the ladies. Do you know how many ladies I have been .... Hey let&#x27;s not go there and stop it right here! Let&#x27;s just say that this scent has been tested and approved by me and I am a hard to please, nit picking wishy washy perfectionist in life. I only purchase the best scents in the globe and this is surely one. The most important reason for you to buy it is because you cannot find this scent elsewhere for this price. Only in Amazon indeed. When I travel around the globe, this is one of my favorites to carry along. Amazon is surely reasonable for fragrances. Try buying this in department store and see how much it costs you!</li>
            <li> I chose this fragrance for my husband and gave him as a gift. Xeryus Rouge by Givenchy is now one of his favorites! He wears it on special occasions or just to lounge around the home. He ALWAYS GETS COMPLIMENTS. I enjoy smelling the fragrance on him. Not at all overpowering just very clean, crisp, rich and masculine with a romantic and sexy twist. The fragrance lasts all day though...classy, elegant yet understated. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t arrive in the room before he does!   Men will love wearing this fragrance and women will really love smelling it on them.  The product arrived in excellent condition, very quickly and with no shipping charges. The price is really great also. A \\&quot;steal\\&quot; for such a wonderful fragrance!  I can&#x27;t say enough about how much my husband and I BOTH love this product!!</li>
            <li> I orginally purchased this on a cruise as a gift from my husband and it is his favorite cologne!  It smells very nice and I love it when he wears it!  The delivery was very fast and we are very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Another of my standards. Very spicy...kumquat adds an interesting tang. One of your better bangs for your buck, to be sure. Comments abound.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it!  wont let me buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I am defiantly not a connoisseur of colognes, but I have found this product to be both pleasing to my nose and the nose of females. I have gotten more complements from dates and friends alike to the smell of this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it as both an every day and evening cologne.</li>
            <li> Bab memories.  Switched to new after shaves.</li>
            <li> I first got it in Toronto over 10 years ago,  still my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this for literally over 10 years and I finally bought a bottle. I was afraid they weren&#x27;t even gonna make it anymore but I found it! It was totally worth it. One spray goes all day, and I can smell it most of the time. Also it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The perfume was not original I had to wait too much for the delivery and when I come it turns out that they sent a copy is not original, not recommended</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne with many hours of staying power.  It&#x27;s clear to me why Givenchy has been producing Xeryus Rouge since the mid-1990s and why it has stayed popular over all this time.  It&#x27;s a modern smelling classic for men.  A bit expensive, yes, but you will certainly get your money&#x27;s worth.  Buy it and enjoy the many unexpected complements you&#x27;ll get from women you don&#x27;t even know. It has a bouquet that tends to straddle the space between a milder day-time cologne and a much stronger/fuller nighttime cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy 3 different colognes to place on my shelf as \\&quot;keepers\\&quot;: (1) Nautica Voyage as an inexpensive and mild &#x27;aquatic&#x27; day cologne for use on most work days, (2) Givenchy Xeryus Rouge for those special daytime occasions and also for frequent nighttime use when going out on the town, and (3) Vera Wang for Men for those special nights that require a strong, exotic, very complex scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Givenchy never stops producing this product.  It is neither one of those dated old, leather-bound, musty smelling \\&quot;men&#x27;s colognes\\&quot; of yesteryear or one of the newer, odd chemical smelling colognes which I can&#x27;t stand -- who wants to smell like acetone?  Next time you go by the toiletry counter in a department store, test this one out.  You might discover that you like it.</li>
            <li> What can I say...I just love this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten more favorable comments on this than any other one I ever used. It is easily my all time favorite now.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. The ladies love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent to wear with a nice red designer dress shirt and black slacks.  It gets positive attention every time out.  I sampled it, liked it, and bought some, but all the reviewers on various websites saying that it lasts as long as Joop are sorely mistaken in my opinion.  I have also heard \\&quot;no more than two sprays\\&quot; which is correct if you&#x27;re walking into a small office or other small enclosed space, but if you&#x27;re outdoors or in a large indoor environment, you can use as many as eight sprays... yes you heard me correct... 8 sprays! It dries down rather quickly, but spray on when you are *not* directly next to somebody! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joop is an absolute monster of longevity and sillage, and Xeryus Rouge is not in the same league.  I would say it has \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; attributes in this regard, although the initial application is quite strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Rouge smells better than Joop, much more smooth with great fruity/musky notes.  It doesn&#x27;t fit with every event in which you need a fragrance, but it&#x27;s great to have in the wardrobe for those romantic outings or even out to a club!</li>
            <li> I wore it and got laid.  She is not my GF.  What more do you want to know?  Isn&#x27;t this a good enough reason to buy something that doesn&#x27;t smell like you do your perfume shopping at walmart or 7-11.</li>
            <li> Xeryus Rouge keeps up with it&#x27;s original Xeryus, the rouge has a very potent start and is not to be sprayed inside of an automobile this can and does cause one to be overpowered by the scent and almost disappointed. The scent carries on nicely as the day wears on, and lives into the night.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite cologne scents. A definite must have in your cologne arsenal.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews from men who aren&#x27;t fond of it, but as a woman I absolutely love it and bought it for my son. He hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li> Everyone asks me about it makes you special comfort among friends and long-lasting light&lt;br /&gt;Light musk scent Givenchy Mmtmiz make you all the time</li>
            <li> This is great works well with my body sent and the women love it.  Its nice having all the women smell you and . . .</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the quality of the parfume. It is identical to the product I used to buy in Macy&#x27;s before it was discontinued. I will purchase this product again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance I have ever used. Women really love it. To bad it&#x27;s not available any more</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what a real man should wear its spicy,little sweet,sophisticated ,sexy....You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne.every woman will fall in love with the way u smell</li>
            <li> I was very please with my purchase of Givenchy&#x27;s Xeryus Rouge. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and never have I paid so little for it. Great service, great price.</li>
            <li> GIVENCHY Xeryus Rouge For Men Is A Great Fragrance And Will Def Get The Attention Of Anyone Who Has The Chance To Get Close And Experience How Great U Smell.. Ttly Have My Go Ahead To Try This Great Cologne For Men..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne in the past and recently ran out. I looked for this brand at Macy&#x27;s and they didn&#x27;t carry it so I logged onto Amazon and to my surprise they had it, I&#x27;m just thrilled to have received. This is a great smelling cologne!!! Go ahead and get it for your man ladies, and men get it for your lady.</li>
            <li> My favorite!! thanks!</li>
            <li> no one could find better than givenchy xeryus rough. it is the best cologn ever you must try and wear it.</li>
            <li> I heard about this Cologne from one of my good friends uncles, couldn&#x27;t find it in stores but got it here....goes great with my body...I sprayed it on for the first time and my fiance and her friend walks in and both immediately loved it..I walked past a woman my first day wearing it and she said more men should smell like me lol....great buy and arrived on time.......Definitely recommended for all ages...I&#x27;m 23 and it will be in my signature fragrances</li>
            <li> Any &amp;#34;man-man&amp;#34; would smell sooooo good wearing this cologne!!  Love it.  I bought it for my son, he has been wearing this fragrance for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Xeryus Rouge is simply the best.  I really don&#x27;t know what else to say.  It&#x27;s just the absolute best you can buy.  Period.</li>
            <li> Been my smell for past 12 years.</li>
            <li> This is my Husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  He was pleasantly surprised when he got it.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.  Givenchy makes some good-smelling long-lasting colognes.  I use a combination of Sodium Alum (aka &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34;) anti-perspirant, lotion, and cologne in lieu of deodorants with aluminum in them because I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to use a product linked with Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.  I use three sprays on each side and that&#x27;s enough to last all day (about 6-8 hours with minimal physical labor/sweating) without being overpowering (though it&#x27;s pretty strong while it&#x27;s still wet).  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Xeryus Rouge for many years.  I constantly receive complements on the scent from both friends and strangers.  Though I&#x27;ve tried other products, I always return to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong, lasts most of the day.  Versatile, good for casual and formal use.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne and its at a great price. what more can i say</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM FOR A LONG TIME DONT USE BUT I FOUND!!!</li>
            <li> A nice clean scent that&#x27;s not too over-powering and lingers on you</li>
            <li> I bought this as my previous bottle was running low. Sadly i was sold a fake version. But per amazon policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot return this. If the scent resembled the original authentic scent I wouldn&#x27;t mind that much. but this scent is completely different. This smells like rubbing Alcohol mixed with johnson and johnson baby perfume. Plus it last a total of 15 mins after you spray it. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good smelling cologne if you like the smell of the 80&#x27;s. I would pass on this cologne. Save your money and get something from Jo Malone.</li>
            <li> I had it before, and i like the smell (good and lasting, but very aggressive), and here is best price for it (some $25 less).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cologne at least since 1997.....my all time favorite!  Its been disappearing an appearing on the market...don&#x27;t knowhat&#x27;sts happening with Givechy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father, he just let me know ***it is fake***</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances, specially for winter</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> This has been my go to fragarance since &#x27;95! It is a musky,rich (in a good way) scent. It&#x27;s strong too...So you don&#x27;t need to spray much. It also stays on even hours later, or even after going outside in the cold,ect..I have bought Nautica over the years and Tommy too! But Givenchy&#x27;s Xeryus Rouge is the s***! Givenchy has also made other great colognes which I have bought a few times and would recommend too! But this is the one I roll with above all!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious &amp; women find me irresistible. ❤️❤️❤️I would like to take a bath in this fragrance, it&#x27;s so yummy;-)</li>
            <li> Good price for this excellent cologne.  The scent lasts all day.  My son suggested I try Xeryus Rouge a couple of years ago and I became instantly hooked.</li>
            <li> First time user of Xeryus Rouge but do also use Givenchy Gentlemen.  This scent is subtle and does not linger in the air as others.  I find it very comfortable for my use.</li>
            <li> I like this scent - somewhat masculine, long-lasting, complex, but not flowery, just makes you interesting. This has been my scent of choice and the only one I wear for over 20 years now, and I will keep using it until they stop making it.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this product for years albeit at local shopping outlets.  I was happy to see it for purchase at this web site, and will use this facility when I find myself in need of the product in future.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE FOR MY FAV PRODUCT...SAME ITEM COST TRIPLE THE AMOUNT IN SAUDI ARABIA..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THANKS ...AND I&#x27;LL BE BACK FOR SURE  !!</li>
            <li> this fragrance is certainly a sure fire hi! simple packaging and design but man oh man the scent is very alluring and attention grabbing...I&#x27;ll call this a head turner...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and I can&#x27;t quite sniffing him.  I tell him to spray it on right before I get home from work, so it has a chance to settle and combine with his natural smell.  Its lovely</li>
            <li> Each time I wear this, some chick some where, some place, will always ask what I am wearing...I usually say if you want to know more, follow me home...works 8 outta 10 times...lol...</li>
            <li> I heard a bout Givenchy from a rapper named DJ Quik&lt;br /&gt;and i saw this one had a lot of ratings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xeryus Rouge by Givenchy is a very Strong Citrus musky type smell&lt;br /&gt;and you do not need a lot  it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i spray some on at 7:45 am and it last til 6:30 pm and there&lt;br /&gt;was still a little left over sent the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF for some reason you were trying to be stealthy your opposition would smell you a mile away&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s like an assault on their nose but in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part about it smells good, not too pricy and i had free shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but cannot find it in stores, glad I was able to find a new source!</li>
            <li> Love it, actually I don&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t buy. Save them all for me. Honestly, I get compliments on it and like it because I get plenty of compliments and it&#x27;s not the generic popular scent so it&#x27;s more intriguing.</li>
            <li> This is just a Classic scent. This bottle is replacing a taller older bottle&lt;br /&gt;that I was not using because it was almost out. Did not know if the fragrance&lt;br /&gt;was still available. Found it on Amazon at a good price and quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh! this is an awesome price for this product and since my boyfriend goes through it so fast i need a good price. it was in great condition when i recieved it and the shipping time was totally acceptable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing these since I was a teenager, one of the best perfumes ever in my opinion.</li>
            <li> a clasical fragance I love it</li>
            <li> Arrived early and everything was as expected.  Great fragrance at a great price.  Can&#x27;t beat that. Purchased with Givenchy&#x27;s Pi, another great fragrance.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used it for ten years. I get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> I like this scent, but it&#x27;s rather strong.  Don&#x27;t apply it directly.  Also, I think that there is a similar female perfume out there.  So whether you don&#x27;t want to be mistaken for wearing that scent, or be accused of being with another woman, Beware!</li>
            <li> SO Glad they brought it back!!! Wonderful smell!!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with a previous review women dig this cologne. It&#x27;s a very good scent. It can bee worn as a everyday scent or for a more formal event.</li>
