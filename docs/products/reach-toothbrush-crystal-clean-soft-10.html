            <li>I love the way it feels in your hand while you&#x27;re brushing and the way it brushes in the mouth as well!</li>
            <li>but I was happy to find some available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad to be able to find this on Amazon as Wal-mart doesn&#x27;t carry this anymore.</li>
            <li>Buying them in bulk is more cost effective.</li>
            <li>I am so glad you carry it.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they were easier to find, locally.  :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well pleased with them and will order again.</li>
            <li>My favorite style and brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>(not quite sure why)</li>
            <li>So glad to find these.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 dozen so I would run out for A long time, All I can say is these are the best tooth brushes !</li>
            <li>Most important is to  USE  the brush.</li>
            <li>do a great job and the soft bristles do not damage the tooth enamel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good Item Fast shipping</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t find Fine toothbrushes by reach anywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad to be able to find this on Amazon as Wal-mart doesn&#x27;t carry this anymore in the SOFT bristles.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for b/c</li>
            <li>Maybe I should buy some more to last the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>The handles actually fit our old, built in to the wall, ceramic tile, toothbrush holder.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stand the fat, multi level, gum massaging, ergonomic rubber handle that doesnt fit any toothbrush holder, barely fitr in my hand toothbrushes so am buying as many of these as I can to last me for years to come.</li>
            <li>If you just want a good plain toothbrush can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>Most all of the other toothbrushes have extremely large handles.</li>
            <li>I like these better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I been using this particular toothbrush for years.</li>
            <li>I been using this particular toothbrush for years.</li>
            <li>For some reason the only kind available in my local area are the firm.  </li>
            <li>Excellent deal on a hard to find plain old toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I have been using these toothbrushes for about 15 years - they are thrifty enough to have a fresh brush every month, so this is a year&#x27;s supply for me.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>It seem as if manufactures come out with a new  &#x27; gimmick&#x27;  toothbrush every 6 months.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft also.  </li>
