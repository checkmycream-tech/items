            <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>My favorite sent.</li>
            <li>I loved this when it first came out</li>
            <li>Smells good, but too soft for me.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for everyday use, and even special occasions.</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh!</li>
            <li>Love this scent and its much cheaper here than anywhere else</li>
            <li>I love the bottle that it&#x27;s in too, haha.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and the fragrance last throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>She loved the scent, and it&#x27;s her second bottle.</li>
            <li>I loved this perfume back when it came out.  </li>
            <li>It shipped extremely fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li>My favorite scent by far</li>
            <li>It smells youthful, sexual, and mature all at once.</li>
            <li>So I was wonderfully surprised when I found it on here and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great combination of old and new - A little spice and power like older perfumes, but very floral, light, and airy like many modern perfumes.</li>
            <li>This has quickly become my new favorite perfume, i wear it everyday and receives so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Even using the shea butter and collagen lotion first.</li>
            <li>It was more than what i thought i actually thought i bought.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li>and I said flower, sweet, and soft.</li>
            <li>I hope they never stop making it because I would be very upset.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced in the cologne/perfume world with all of the quality of a bottle</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>but I still like it just not as much.</li>
            <li>3.3 oz is plenty big - wow, didn&#x27;t really exactly know what to expect</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on it and people hardly believe that it&#x27;s Baby Phat.  </li>
            <li>I like loud perfume that sticks around after you have left the room.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this scent and its much cheaper here than anywhere else</li>
            <li> This product arrived several days before the estimated shipping time. That was excellent! The product was exactly as I expected, no damage and it&#x27;s a great value for the money even with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> This perfurm is one of my favorit perfumes of all times!! It shipped extremely fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price!! Will be purchasing again!!!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by the sales clerk at Perfumania in the mall, and I must say that this stuff smells good! The clerk asked me what type of scents do I like and I said flower, sweet, and soft. She recommended Baby Phat (Goddess) and I&#x27;m in love. I figured it had to smell good since it&#x27;s by KIMORA SIMMONS. She expects PERFECTION! She has come through on this one! Ladies, you got to get Baby Phat (Goddess)! Men get this for the significant other, she won&#x27;t be disappointed!  I purchased it at half off too! What a steal!  BTW...It didn&#x27;t come with the lotion, but the clerk told me to buy non scented COLLAGEN lotion and rub it on before spraying, and it will last all day! I used shea butter instead, and I can still smell it like I just sprayed, and it been 6 hours since I sprayed it!   Update 07/06/2011...I found that after a few days of wearing this perfume, it doesn&#x27;t stay on long at all. Even using the shea butter and collagen lotion first. I&#x27;ve changed the rating.  Update 11/18/11---okay. I want to be fair. After not using it continuously, it appears to stay on longer. Changing the rating again.     Overall rating: 3.0</li>
            <li> It was a gift from my hubby and I loved it from the time I got it.. Its a great perfume</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my girl and let me just say that the aroma is awesome. She loved the gift...</li>
            <li> It was more than what i thought i actually thought i bought. Did not expect the lotion and whatever else in the package.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites and get a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> This is one of the freshest, cleanest smelling fragrances I have ever purchased. I absolutely love this parfum, it is one that I tell my husband and children that I cannot run out of.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite still!</li>
            <li> I love this scent,it is one of my favorites! I hope they never stop making it because I would be very upset.My husband even likes it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend...she loved it!! Great price for the size. I ordered in December and it came before Christmas!! Yay!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but too soft for me. I like loud perfume that sticks around after you have left the room.</li>

            <li> Gave this to my daughter for a birthday gift. She LOVEs it.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced in the cologne/perfume world with all of the quality of a bottle 5x it&#x27;s price. My Wife has used this perfume for the last 5 years, at least 3-4 days a week, and I never get sick of it. It&#x27;s a great combination of old and new - A little spice and power like older perfumes, but very floral, light, and airy like many modern perfumes. It smells youthful, sexual, and mature all at once. Any Woman wearing this perfume is exponentially more attractive than without it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. It is perfect for everyday use, and even special occasions. I always get compliments, especially from men. A couple have asked what it is that I&#x27;m wearing as they indicated to want to purchase it for their wives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and handling was excellent. Arrived within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we wanted.  And what a great price, better than going all the way downtown and searching for it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and find that I&#x27;m always getting compliments on it! 3.3 oz is plenty big - wow, didn&#x27;t really exactly know what to expect but it should last me a while. I love the bottle that it&#x27;s in too, haha. (I looooove pink!)&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this perfume again. Another perfume I like, by Kimora Lee Simmons, is Fabulosity. My sister has it and it smells soooooo good! I&#x27;m always wanting use it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! It smells so good and the fragrance last throughout the day.  I get many compliments on it and people hardly believe that it&#x27;s Baby Phat.  The seller shipped quickly, which I appreciate because it&#x27;s difficult to find this in stores.</li>
            <li> My favorite sent. Smells so fresh!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased a number of Kimora Lee Simmons Baby Phat perfumes and each one smells nice.  As a man I can say they are attractive scents and they make my wife smell really good!</li>
            <li> It was pretty fast when it shipped over to my place, I&#x27;m not that disappointed. This item was perfect for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; perfume that delivers. My only complaint would be with the manufacturer. They changed the bottle for worse. I guess to save money? Oh well, still works.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, good smell, I recommend it, you will feel fresh, and receives compliments are good, comes in good condition, well packaged. Thank You. I would buy again</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a birthday present for my daughter. She loved the scent, and it&#x27;s her second bottle. Would buy again at this price.</li>

            <li> Fast delivery, and $20 for 3oz is awesome .. Thanks a lot ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I loved this when it first came out I havent had any or smelled it in years. the manufacture must have changed it some since it came out years back it smells different then i remembered but I still like it just not as much. I recieved this product before the expected date basically it came the next day after being shipped out.</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume back when it came out.  I have searched for it at different department stores and they no longer sell it.  So I was wonderfully surprised when I found it on here and at such a great price.  Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Smells delightful and lasts forever! I&#x27;ve used this daily for years-it is my go to scent. I receive compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Found lower cost in retail store after bought it. My fault not do mre research. Still a great sent.</li>
