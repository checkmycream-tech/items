            <li>Favorite clips in the world!!</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t hold all of my hair up, and is very easy to break!</li>
            <li>I LOVED this clip.</li>

            <li>... works good...</li>
            <li>It is still a good price considering</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Within an hour, a good portion of my hair was escaping from the clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is what I need for my type of hair but  need a stronger clip with a good grip and good construction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>nice gripper... works well and feels good on the head....</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this octopus clip!</li>
            <li>Found better ones at Jewel--cheaper there!</li>
            <li>Like I said, the first one I ordered works wonderfully, but just be warned!</li>
            <li>First the price is great!  </li>
            <li>, LOVE this item!  </li>
            <li>I love these clips!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I love the design it holds all my hair doesn&#x27;t dig into the scalp never slips!</li>
            <li>Hopefully this one lasts me more than a month!</li>
            <li>Worked out great, even for my fine hair type.</li>
            <li>I tried wearing it a number of ways and honestly it just wouldn&#x27;t stay put.  </li>
            <li>I own Scunci octopus clips and DCNL Octopus</li>
            <li>Kind of does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even with user reviews you can&#x27;t quite be sure what you&#x27;re getting because something that fits someone with a lot of hair might not be good for someone with a TON of hair.</li>
            <li>This is a nice size and I can get all my hair up and in it.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my niece in her Christmas stocking and she was really excited and happy.</li>
            <li>ok - it&#x27;ll be great cheap plastic or not</li>
            <li>thank you very much, the item was as descriped and it was in great condition.</li>
            <li>This gives it a more polished appearance -- making it suitable to use for a wider range of circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my favorite clip.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>One of the best purchases I didn&#x27;t actually need.</li>
            <li>i love this clip.</li>
            <li>I hope they make more of these and don&#x27;t discontinue them.</li>
            <li>Love this clip for my waistline hair.</li>
            <li>I love these clips, because they will hold up my hair all days without leaving any crease marks, but I&#x27;ve probably been through about 10 of them.</li>
            <li>These clips cost five dollars or more in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I love the no slip grips...</li>
            <li>I definitely love how the hair clip holds your hair in place.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I would like to have another color :)</li>
            <li>I bought two just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>love the design (Octopus shape)</li>
            <li>So, I thought if I went on line, I would maybe be able to find one that is made for my hair type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing more.</li>
            <li>perfect (: Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>These octopus grip clips are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incredibly cheap!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>When this came in, I was so excited!</li>
            <li>I love this kind of clip to hold my hair when it&#x27;s long and get many compliments for it, but this one is kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li>Unless you have fine, slippery hair, you will probably have luck with this clip.  </li>
            <li>I can see where fine hair would slip out of this clip, but if you have a bunch of hair to put up, this clip is for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and comfortable and stays in place.  </li>
            <li>This does a pretty good job of holding it all in place, although some of the shorter layers tend to slip out if I don&#x27;t put in on right.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is that unlike pony tails if I decide to take my hair down at some point it looks GOOD!</li>
            <li>I wish this one was stronger and would last longer, but it really is great while it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li>I have on occasion worn it all day and forgotten about it because it really is comfortable,</li>
            <li>She uses it often and says it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>I chose this one based on the great reviews by people that describe their hair the same way I&#x27;d describe mine.</li>
            <li>I like it, it is very useful.</li>
            <li>but it has a really great hold with the long prongs</li>
            <li>If you have very fine straight hair it may slide.</li>
            <li>absolutely wonderful for my thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt; has not snapped , and stays secure.</li>
            <li>I love this hair clip and it absolutely does work fabulously for keeping hair up-- until the clip breaks.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much i bought two more to stash all over when i want to pull my hair back.</li>
            <li>Looks cool</li>
            <li>I have the big size and the smaller size in this clip and they are all wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and it broke under mild pressure.</li>
            <li>and this is the very first clip that truly lived up to it&#x27;s advertised capabilities.</li>
            <li>It holds hair pretty well!</li>
            <li>It holds it tight and it looks nice :)</li>
            <li>Years back I had an Octopus hair clip of very good quality that allowed for a little more diversity in hair styles for myself</li>
            <li>At the same time it doesn&#x27;t dig into your scalp as the teeth are nicely folded over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it holds well and is worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I only got one, instead of the two I was originally planning on getting.</li>
            <li>This clip is much more comfortable than the long ones.  </li>
            <li>I love these because I can quickly run my fingers through my hair, pull it back, twist, and clip.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>If I put my hair up with this clip, all of it stays exactly where I put it.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it out of the shipping container it snapped and broke.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using one of these.</li>
            <li>It works great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>Works great with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>But I got stuck with handling/shipping charges, which made me pay more for the same clip as the ones in stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought it&#x27;d be, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Or better yet, stick to standard colors.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks and feels on my head,I just wish the product lasted longer,I&#x27;ve boughten quite a few and then tend to break easily</li>
            <li>It also has effective but not too sharp tines.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t do anything with it other than a hair rake (which isn&#x27;t so cute at 31 years old) or a pony tail that looks like it belongs on a teenager (which also isn&#x27;t so cute).</li>
            <li>Look great, professional and not cheap made.</li>
            <li>Anyways, if you have hair that is to the middle of your back or shorter, it may work well for you, if it is longer, than good luck getting it to stay in place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also sort of soft and pliable and so it has been much more comfortable to wear than harder plastic clips.     </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and most of the people said they had long hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have long or heavy hair (I do), the DCNL clip will hold your hair more securely than the Scunci.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Also, the DCNL clip has tine tips that angle back in towards the clip (away from your head) making it much more comfortable against the scalp.</li>
            <li>This is the first clip to really hold all my hair &amp; stay in the whole day</li>
            <li>perfect for long or thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it is big enough for all my hair, lays flat, looks nice and stays in so snug</li>
            <li>If you have a large amount of hair you want to put up, this clip will hold it.  </li>
            <li>This clip is really great for my very thick just below shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>People with HUGE hair should plan on this only holding sections...</li>
            <li>The claws are also shaped in a smooth way so that you don&#x27;t feel them poking into the back of your head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And really at this price, it&#x27;s not too much of a loss if it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>The scunci clips do angle in, but not as much and still poke my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it no longer clips very well</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY THICK,Heavy and curly hair</li>
            <li>absolute no slip hold during house work,shopping,walking the dog,yard work, you name it.</li>
            <li>but i have so much hair</li>
            <li>as described, fast shipping, thank you</li>
            <li>have too much hair to put it all in a bun underneath this clip, but I can put in a ponytail elastic, pull my hair up, put the clip on, and then the rest of the hair drapes over the clip, hiding it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I just threw the whole thing</li>
            <li>* Doesn&#x27;t really hold up your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s straight</li>
            <li>Clip does not grip very tightly&lt;</li>
            <li>These are fabulous for anyone with massive amounts of hair, and that is after it is monthly trimmed and thinned.</li>
            <li>maybe from a drugstore, that was very sturdy.</li>
            <li>No headache from too much hair in one spot, no broken hairs from rubber bands.</li>
            <li>and it is very sturdy, did not break since January</li>
            <li>Not entirely their fault, but it would be nice to be able to choose the color, or at least see what you might be getting.</li>
            <li>This clip grasps the hair nicely holding it in place firmly so the \\&quot;do\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t loosen and sag.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through two so far and am most likely going to go buy yet another one this weekend....</li>
            <li>The octopus clips have been a god-send; it stays put, my hair doesn&#x27;t slip out, it&#x27;s big enough to encapsulate all my hair and still be against my head, and so far so good with the wear-and-tear; has shown no signs of breaking.</li>
            <li>Every hair stylist I have ever been to has said I have the thickest hair they have ever encountered, so my issue won&#x27;t be the issue of many other people</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several significant differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very femine and classic looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a flatter appearance than most clips -- with a grip that is large enough to grab -- but not so big that it sticks out -- in fact they lay almost horizontal to your head instead of sticking way out.  </li>
            <li>These things are light weight and doesn&#x27;t hurt even when wearing long.</li>
            <li>It can hold a bun if I do just the top half of my hair or just the sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes me think they got someone who actually needs and uses such a thing to design it, already one up on most products.</li>
            <li>At first she thought is might be too big, but after a few days of using it, she said she really liked it.  </li>
            <li>(can&#x27;t sit up straight in the car), but this is easy enough to take out and put back.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s very easy to open, a lot of clips are super hard to put in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought a few more, some for me and for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li>They always break at the hinge, either if dropped on the floor, or just under normal use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I got a few showers out of it.</li>
            <li>I loved this clip because it held up my thick hair, but when i was changing, my tshirt barely touched it</li>
            <li>It holds my hair when other things don&#x27;t (because my hair is so fine), and yet doesn&#x27;t make wrinkles and ridges like hair bands.  </li>
            <li>Not a hard plastic so not as sturdy as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I tried every way of getting it to stay in, and it came right out within ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>Like all clips that are plastic and with the coil spring they do eventually wear and you have to get new ones.</li>
            <li>When I put my hair up in this while it&#x27;s wet, the hair drys sort of draped smoothly over it, almost completely concealing the clip itself.</li>
            <li>Great for short or thin hair</li>
            <li>I have coarse, big-ish hair, and this works pretty well...</li>
            <li>Most clips break after how heavy i use them, but this one has stood the test of time for over a year now!  </li>
            <li>To hot outside, no problem put the hair up</li>
            <li>Want to take a quick shower and not get your hair wet this time?  </li>
            <li>I love these clips, but they only have a life of about three months, sometimes less.</li>
            <li>The large ones slip after time with me when my hair is shorter, but if I use the size smaller one</li>
            <li>Wish I had longer hair to fill it, so if you&#x27;re looking for an extra large clip this might be for you.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and coarse and the clip does a great job holding it back and up.  </li>
            <li>If it came in a clear version -- I would get that too.</li>
            <li>I have learned after much use with these, if you have a clip that is too big</li>
            <li>The plastic near one  of the spring ends</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though they both look the same on the surface, these three qualities make the DCNL well worth the extra $3.</li>
            <li>and I wish that I could return it and get my money back, because it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the first clip that I have ever found that will hang on to my very thick, very fine long hair.  </li>
            <li>This clip may be fabulous for thicker hair types, but I don&#x27;t think it is meant for thin hair, no matter how much we have!</li>
            <li>Love that i can use this clip to pull my hair up to a tight bun or a loose bun.</li>
            <li>I have bought two only to have them both break within six weeks with normal use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough to hold a lot of hair in a messy top knot</li>
            <li>I would like to see it in other colors, mainly black, but this is a neutral one that works with most of my clothing.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend buying this to every women that has had a hard time finding a comfortable and STRONG,hair clip!</li>
            <li>Like I said I can&#x27;t live without these on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This product is great for long thick hair that normally breaks regular banana clips and other smaller type clips.  </li>
            <li>It held all day, from morning until night, and due to its design when I let my hair down it was virtually \\&quot;un-bent\\&quot; and it was easy to brush out and wear long without too much restyling.     </li>
            <li>So I can quickly go from having my hair down to pulled up and back - and vice versa.  </li>
            <li>Being that my hair is below mid back, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.    </li>
            <li>The cap on the end of one of the wire coils that holds it together and makes it squeeze shut broke off, and in my attempts to put it back together the wire coil became completely separated from the rest of the unit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really out all that much money.</li>
            <li>They hold my hair up really well, and they&#x27;re the only clips big enough.</li>
            <li>It was cute and held my long, thick, curly hair in place</li>
            <li>It was like a reverse tortoise color--a straight up beige/gray carpet kind of hue with cheesy, black stripes painted on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, because it does work pretty well, but I likely won&#x27;t be purchasing it from Amazon if \\&quot;varying colors\\&quot; means getting another one like what I was previously sent.</li>
            <li>it could be bigger, actually, as it barely hold all my hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that falls to a few inches below my shoulders, and wanted a newer way to gather it up tidily in the back, and this worked well.</li>
            <li>I sent it back, just because of the disappointment, because if I would have kept it, they would have been able to add me on as one of their suckers, even though I paid more in S/H.</li>
            <li>It was to large to hold my hair tightly</li>
            <li>They also are shaped in a way that looks much nicer in your hair while it&#x27;s up than the typical hair clip.</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick, and I think this lasted me about a week.  </li>
            <li>and she has super thick hair</li>
            <li>My hair is really curly and a lot of curls fall down when the clip is smaller, so this one does the trick.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This clip worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Incredible Hair Clip!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the gym or just pining hair up to get out of the way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for the perfect clip to pin my hair up, and this one is almost it</li>
            <li> If one breaks I have another or if it&#x27;s a totally awesome item I&#x27;d rather have two in case</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home to just pull hair up, even works for work.</li>
            <li> &amp; this works perfect!</li>
            <li> Very awesome price for this clip</li>
            <li> ideal size, great grip, perfect shape.  </li>
            <li> And it looks good!  </li>
            <li> Beautiful, well made.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> great transaction.  </li>
            <li> and though it was great, so I ordered one for my sister.</li>
            <li> It works great and does not break within a week of using it.</li>
            <li> It holds great with this design.</li>
            <li> I already was suspecting it wasn&#x27;t great quality before I pressed the \\&quot;place order button\\</li>
            <li> Great hair clip and price.</li>
            <li> and she said it was great.  </li>
            <li> Lol I have a this product and it doesnt hold my hair up.</li>
            <li> great hold</li>
            <li> Favorite clips in the world!!</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t hold all of my hair up, and is very easy to break!</li>
            <li> I LOVED this clip.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> I loved the design</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good clip...</li>
            <li> ... works good...</li>
            <li> It is still a good price considering</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> Within an hour, a good portion of my hair was escaping from the clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is what I need for my type of hair but  need a stronger clip with a good grip and good construction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> nice gripper... works well and feels good on the head....</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love this octopus clip!</li>
            <li> Found better ones at Jewel--cheaper there!</li>
            <li> Like I said, the first one I ordered works wonderfully, but just be warned!</li>
            <li> First the price is great!  </li>
            <li> , LOVE this item!  </li>
            <li> I love these clips!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I love the design it holds all my hair doesn&#x27;t dig into the scalp never slips!</li>
            <li> Hopefully this one lasts me more than a month!</li>
            <li> Worked out great, even for my fine hair type.</li>
            <li> I tried wearing it a number of ways and honestly it just wouldn&#x27;t stay put.  </li>
            <li> I own Scunci octopus clips and DCNL Octopus</li>
            <li> Kind of does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even with user reviews you can&#x27;t quite be sure what you&#x27;re getting because something that fits someone with a lot of hair might not be good for someone with a TON of hair.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size and I can get all my hair up and in it.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my niece in her Christmas stocking and she was really excited and happy.</li>
            <li> ok - it&#x27;ll be great cheap plastic or not</li>
            <li> thank you very much, the item was as descriped and it was in great condition.</li>
            <li> This gives it a more polished appearance -- making it suitable to use for a wider range of circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my favorite clip.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I didn&#x27;t actually need.</li>
            <li> i love this clip.</li>
            <li> I hope they make more of these and don&#x27;t discontinue them.</li>
            <li> Love this clip for my waistline hair.</li>
            <li> I love these clips, because they will hold up my hair all days without leaving any crease marks, but I&#x27;ve probably been through about 10 of them.</li>
            <li> These clips cost five dollars or more in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I love the no slip grips...</li>
            <li> I definitely love how the hair clip holds your hair in place.</li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> I would like to have another color :)</li>
            <li> I bought two just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> love the design (Octopus shape)</li>
            <li> So, I thought if I went on line, I would maybe be able to find one that is made for my hair type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing more.</li>
            <li> perfect (: Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These octopus grip clips are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s incredibly cheap!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> When this came in, I was so excited!</li>
            <li> I love this kind of clip to hold my hair when it&#x27;s long and get many compliments for it, but this one is kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li> Unless you have fine, slippery hair, you will probably have luck with this clip.  </li>
            <li> I can see where fine hair would slip out of this clip, but if you have a bunch of hair to put up, this clip is for you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and comfortable and stays in place.  </li>
            <li> This does a pretty good job of holding it all in place, although some of the shorter layers tend to slip out if I don&#x27;t put in on right.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is that unlike pony tails if I decide to take my hair down at some point it looks GOOD!</li>
            <li> I wish this one was stronger and would last longer, but it really is great while it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li> I have on occasion worn it all day and forgotten about it because it really is comfortable,</li>
            <li> She uses it often and says it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> I chose this one based on the great reviews by people that describe their hair the same way I&#x27;d describe mine.</li>
            <li> I like it, it is very useful.</li>
            <li> but it has a really great hold with the long prongs</li>
            <li> If you have very fine straight hair it may slide.</li>
            <li> absolutely wonderful for my thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt; has not snapped , and stays secure.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip and it absolutely does work fabulously for keeping hair up-- until the clip breaks.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much i bought two more to stash all over when i want to pull my hair back.</li>
            <li> Looks cool</li>
            <li> I have the big size and the smaller size in this clip and they are all wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and it broke under mild pressure.</li>
            <li> and this is the very first clip that truly lived up to it&#x27;s advertised capabilities.</li>
            <li> It holds hair pretty well!</li>
            <li> It holds it tight and it looks nice :)</li>
            <li> Years back I had an Octopus hair clip of very good quality that allowed for a little more diversity in hair styles for myself</li>
            <li> At the same time it doesn&#x27;t dig into your scalp as the teeth are nicely folded over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it holds well and is worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I only got one, instead of the two I was originally planning on getting.</li>
            <li> This clip is much more comfortable than the long ones.  </li>
            <li> I love these because I can quickly run my fingers through my hair, pull it back, twist, and clip.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> If I put my hair up with this clip, all of it stays exactly where I put it.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it out of the shipping container it snapped and broke.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using one of these.</li>
            <li> It works great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Works great with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> But I got stuck with handling/shipping charges, which made me pay more for the same clip as the ones in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought it&#x27;d be, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Or better yet, stick to standard colors.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks and feels on my head,I just wish the product lasted longer,I&#x27;ve boughten quite a few and then tend to break easily</li>
            <li> It also has effective but not too sharp tines.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t do anything with it other than a hair rake (which isn&#x27;t so cute at 31 years old) or a pony tail that looks like it belongs on a teenager (which also isn&#x27;t so cute).</li>
            <li> Look great, professional and not cheap made.</li>
            <li> Anyways, if you have hair that is to the middle of your back or shorter, it may work well for you, if it is longer, than good luck getting it to stay in place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also sort of soft and pliable and so it has been much more comfortable to wear than harder plastic clips.     </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and most of the people said they had long hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have long or heavy hair (I do), the DCNL clip will hold your hair more securely than the Scunci.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Also, the DCNL clip has tine tips that angle back in towards the clip (away from your head) making it much more comfortable against the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the first clip to really hold all my hair &amp; stay in the whole day</li>
            <li> perfect for long or thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I love it, it is big enough for all my hair, lays flat, looks nice and stays in so snug</li>
            <li> If you have a large amount of hair you want to put up, this clip will hold it.  </li>
            <li> This clip is really great for my very thick just below shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> People with HUGE hair should plan on this only holding sections...</li>
            <li> The claws are also shaped in a smooth way so that you don&#x27;t feel them poking into the back of your head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And really at this price, it&#x27;s not too much of a loss if it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The scunci clips do angle in, but not as much and still poke my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it no longer clips very well</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY THICK,Heavy and curly hair</li>
            <li> absolute no slip hold during house work,shopping,walking the dog,yard work, you name it.</li>
            <li> but i have so much hair</li>
            <li> as described, fast shipping, thank you</li>
            <li> have too much hair to put it all in a bun underneath this clip, but I can put in a ponytail elastic, pull my hair up, put the clip on, and then the rest of the hair drapes over the clip, hiding it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just threw the whole thing</li>
            <li> * Doesn&#x27;t really hold up your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s straight</li>
            <li> Clip does not grip very tightly&lt;</li>
            <li> These are fabulous for anyone with massive amounts of hair, and that is after it is monthly trimmed and thinned.</li>
            <li> maybe from a drugstore, that was very sturdy.</li>
            <li> No headache from too much hair in one spot, no broken hairs from rubber bands.</li>
            <li> and it is very sturdy, did not break since January</li>
            <li> Not entirely their fault, but it would be nice to be able to choose the color, or at least see what you might be getting.</li>
            <li> This clip grasps the hair nicely holding it in place firmly so the \\&quot;do\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t loosen and sag.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two so far and am most likely going to go buy yet another one this weekend....</li>
            <li> The octopus clips have been a god-send; it stays put, my hair doesn&#x27;t slip out, it&#x27;s big enough to encapsulate all my hair and still be against my head, and so far so good with the wear-and-tear; has shown no signs of breaking.</li>
            <li> Every hair stylist I have ever been to has said I have the thickest hair they have ever encountered, so my issue won&#x27;t be the issue of many other people</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several significant differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very femine and classic looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a flatter appearance than most clips -- with a grip that is large enough to grab -- but not so big that it sticks out -- in fact they lay almost horizontal to your head instead of sticking way out.  </li>
            <li> These things are light weight and doesn&#x27;t hurt even when wearing long.</li>
            <li> It can hold a bun if I do just the top half of my hair or just the sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes me think they got someone who actually needs and uses such a thing to design it, already one up on most products.</li>
            <li> At first she thought is might be too big, but after a few days of using it, she said she really liked it.  </li>
            <li> (can&#x27;t sit up straight in the car), but this is easy enough to take out and put back.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s very easy to open, a lot of clips are super hard to put in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought a few more, some for me and for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> They always break at the hinge, either if dropped on the floor, or just under normal use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I got a few showers out of it.</li>
            <li> I loved this clip because it held up my thick hair, but when i was changing, my tshirt barely touched it</li>
            <li> It holds my hair when other things don&#x27;t (because my hair is so fine), and yet doesn&#x27;t make wrinkles and ridges like hair bands.  </li>
            <li> Not a hard plastic so not as sturdy as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I tried every way of getting it to stay in, and it came right out within ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> Like all clips that are plastic and with the coil spring they do eventually wear and you have to get new ones.</li>
            <li> When I put my hair up in this while it&#x27;s wet, the hair drys sort of draped smoothly over it, almost completely concealing the clip itself.</li>
            <li> Great for short or thin hair</li>
            <li> I have coarse, big-ish hair, and this works pretty well...</li>
            <li> Most clips break after how heavy i use them, but this one has stood the test of time for over a year now!  </li>
            <li> To hot outside, no problem put the hair up</li>
            <li> Want to take a quick shower and not get your hair wet this time?  </li>
            <li> I love these clips, but they only have a life of about three months, sometimes less.</li>
            <li> The large ones slip after time with me when my hair is shorter, but if I use the size smaller one</li>
            <li> Wish I had longer hair to fill it, so if you&#x27;re looking for an extra large clip this might be for you.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and coarse and the clip does a great job holding it back and up.  </li>
            <li> If it came in a clear version -- I would get that too.</li>
            <li> I have learned after much use with these, if you have a clip that is too big</li>
            <li> The plastic near one  of the spring ends</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though they both look the same on the surface, these three qualities make the DCNL well worth the extra $3.</li>
            <li> and I wish that I could return it and get my money back, because it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the first clip that I have ever found that will hang on to my very thick, very fine long hair.  </li>
            <li> This clip may be fabulous for thicker hair types, but I don&#x27;t think it is meant for thin hair, no matter how much we have!</li>
            <li> Love that i can use this clip to pull my hair up to a tight bun or a loose bun.</li>
            <li> I have bought two only to have them both break within six weeks with normal use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to hold a lot of hair in a messy top knot</li>
            <li> I would like to see it in other colors, mainly black, but this is a neutral one that works with most of my clothing.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend buying this to every women that has had a hard time finding a comfortable and STRONG,hair clip!</li>
            <li> Like I said I can&#x27;t live without these on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This product is great for long thick hair that normally breaks regular banana clips and other smaller type clips.  </li>
            <li> It held all day, from morning until night, and due to its design when I let my hair down it was virtually \\&quot;un-bent\\&quot; and it was easy to brush out and wear long without too much restyling.     </li>
            <li> So I can quickly go from having my hair down to pulled up and back - and vice versa.  </li>
            <li> Being that my hair is below mid back, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.    </li>
            <li> The cap on the end of one of the wire coils that holds it together and makes it squeeze shut broke off, and in my attempts to put it back together the wire coil became completely separated from the rest of the unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really out all that much money.</li>
            <li> They hold my hair up really well, and they&#x27;re the only clips big enough.</li>
            <li> It was cute and held my long, thick, curly hair in place</li>
            <li> It was like a reverse tortoise color--a straight up beige/gray carpet kind of hue with cheesy, black stripes painted on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, because it does work pretty well, but I likely won&#x27;t be purchasing it from Amazon if \\&quot;varying colors\\&quot; means getting another one like what I was previously sent.</li>
            <li> it could be bigger, actually, as it barely hold all my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that falls to a few inches below my shoulders, and wanted a newer way to gather it up tidily in the back, and this worked well.</li>
            <li> I sent it back, just because of the disappointment, because if I would have kept it, they would have been able to add me on as one of their suckers, even though I paid more in S/H.</li>
            <li> It was to large to hold my hair tightly</li>
            <li> They also are shaped in a way that looks much nicer in your hair while it&#x27;s up than the typical hair clip.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick, and I think this lasted me about a week.  </li>
            <li> and she has super thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is really curly and a lot of curls fall down when the clip is smaller, so this one does the trick.  </li>
            <li> This might be good for people whose hair is bra-length or shorter but it is NOT good for long, thick hair as another reviewer stated.  </li>
            <li> This was touted as a good clip for long, thick hair and that it would hold heavy hair up all day long without slipping.</li>
            <li> I have super long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have super thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep mine around, it&#x27;s decent enough when I want to wear my sides back in a messy bun.</li>
            <li> The clip holds her hair, but does not last long.</li>
            <li> It is too flat to use for a bun.  </li>
            <li> Obviously their hair is not that long</li>
            <li> I can stuff all my shoulder length hair in one of these after a few tries, pop in a couple barettes near the back, maybe the odd pin for a neater look and be off and still lean back on the car seat since I don&#x27;t get poked by pins and teeth (these teeth lay flat), something one cannot do even if you manage a classic &#x27;50&#x27;s french bun, made for cars without headrests, remember?</li>
            <li> One of the \\&quot;legs\\&quot; had snapped in half just a week or two before that, so I think it was just the plastic getting old.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find, and yet the only clip that really holds thicker or longer hair with a single clip.</li>
            <li> and this is the only jaw clip that will actually hold my hair up all day without slipping or coming loose.  </li>
            <li> Really shouldn&#x27;t be this hard.</li>
            <li> Holds ALL of my thick hair as high or low as I want.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not something I could wear out of the house, unfortunately, especially since I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Please tell us how long your &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; hair is before you write a review.</li>
            <li> And it would not hold my hair for long before it starts falling out.</li>
            <li> my hair is not that long</li>
            <li> I used it sparingly and gingerly in the shower to pin my hair up after washing and it wasn&#x27;t too long before it broke.</li>
            <li> This clip does not work for really long hair.  </li>
            <li> I wrap my wet hair into a bun, shake it out every couple hours and put it back up so it drys.</li>
            <li> instead of how a longer clip goes down the entire back of your head.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for a claw-like clip that holds my hair back both wet and dry, while not giving me a headache from poking my scalp OR from pulling the bundle downward.  </li>
            <li> Also it seemed like several men bought this for their wives which seemed odd and even odder that they would go back on to write a review about a women&#x27;s hair clip.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the right clip for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have super thick semi long hair, so the typical hair clip in stores do not last long &amp; break after a few uses.</li>
            <li> - only it&#x27;s a little too big.  </li>
            <li> Long hair  takes stronger clips and this is it!  </li>
            <li> If you have thick and/or long hair, do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> The clip is really awkwardly shaped so it isn&#x27;t easy to put in either.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that in the picture it showed a black and brown</li>
            <li> I bought some similar of a different brand that have lasted for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> and it was slowly slipping off.</li>
            <li> Other clips won&#x27;t hold it all, or don&#x27;t hold it tight enough.</li>
            <li> The idea of a fashionably &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; bun has wooed me, certainly not the dance corps bun of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are also a dream for keeping lots of long thick wet hair out of your face and up off your back when you come out of a shower.</li>
            <li> These are the only hair clips that I will use for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this clip for people with thinner or short hair but not for people with long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> These are the only clips  that hold my thick long hair up all day!</li>
            <li> After testing this in several scenarios, it barely held my wet hair close to my head without having to reposition and absolutely fails to be a winner on the dry hair front (continuously fell out of the hold</li>
            <li> I have one color -- and would like the other two.  </li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the usual hair claw so that I could try to get a different look for my hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is you are not able to choose the color of the clip, you get what they ship you.  </li>
            <li> I dropped mine on the carpet the other day and the damn thing broke.</li>
            <li> hair clips are not cheap spring busted way to fast not happy ...</li>
            <li> but it just wasn&#x27;t in the cards for me as my hair is not only thick but past half way down my back.</li>
            <li> Note, for those of us who have belt-length hair, we don&#x27;t usually think of someone with mid-back length hair as having long hair.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that Amazon won&#x27;t let you choose the color --</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to hone my technique for getting it all up with the ends tucked away, but that is because I am hair challenged.  </li>
            <li> Only holds for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve broken two or three so far...</li>
            <li> Finally a hair clip that I could use for my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> but so thick it constantly breaks hair ties even.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s down below my shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll probably go down there and pick up another one.....</li>
            <li> They might hold them for a half hour, but then need to take it down, re-twist my hair and clip up again.</li>
            <li> I like making half updos with my hair</li>
            <li> I gathered my hair up and put the clip in it, and immediately, half of my hair fell out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this can only hold up about 30% of my thick, coarse, and long wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and it will hold all of it up at once, but when I tried to do a half up half down hairstyle it was too loose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A must have for those with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Buy them if you have thick or long hair, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> If you have long thick hair this will not hold it up.  </li>
            <li> I typed in hair clips for long thick &amp; it took me to this site.</li>
            <li> Holds long thick hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, and I&#x27;m always struggling to find a clip that will hold it all and hold it well.</li>
            <li> I can use it to keep a tight bun together all day.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick heavy hair that refuses to do anything but make my head sweat profusely.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife as she has a little longer than shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> For three dollars it&#x27;s not the end of the world, it&#x27;s just a little disheartening as I meant it to be a stocking-stuffer for Christmas.</li>
            <li> One of the little arms broke off which made me cry a bit.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY clip that will hold my very thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The spring is firm and a 5 second twist of my very thick, mid-back length hair</li>
            <li> Scunci also have non-slip rubber pads mounted in them that catch a few hairs (in the gaps between the rubber pads and the plastic tines) and pull them out.</li>
            <li> i lose a few hairs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> but I still have to re-adjust the clip in my hair every few minutes.</li>
            <li> Also just for everyday wear at the office too.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of this type that has broken.</li>
            <li> I think because my hair is so thin, the &amp;#34;no slip&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t actually work.  </li>
            <li> I believed the other reviews, even though I was skeptical because of how tiny the item was.  </li>
            <li> The grip of clip is just not strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the clip is very small, and the middle space where the hair will be held is also very small.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly and unruly hair that&#x27;s in long layers (midback-length).</li>
            <li> I have A LOT of long (20 inches), thin, curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, and down to my waist (I can tuck my hair into my pants).  </li>
            <li> No matter how I do it, at least half of my hair falls out within a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stupid clip!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after only 4 uses the plastic by the spring broke</li>
            <li> not sure how to use it...</li>
            <li> I have real thick hair, kinda long</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard when ordering something online to gauge for yourself the quality of said item and</li>
            <li> I have thick hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> At least it is not couple hundred bucks.</li>
            <li> so if it sucks</li>
            <li> I have wavy, below-shoulders length thick hair</li>
            <li> She has the thickest hair, seriously... sooooo thick.  </li>
            <li> The clip is too big and if your hair volume is less this is worthless.</li>
            <li> The only bad part is they&#x27;re plastic</li>
            <li> I mean for thin hair</li>
            <li> i leaned back too hard or too awkward and one of the outer arms broke.kinda disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Not recommended for very thick hair</li>
            <li> but then it is impossible to get in the other side.</li>
            <li> Those agonizing rubber band things and a hundred pins and feeling the weight of all that hair tied tightly behind, that is how.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the \\&quot;no-slip Octopus Clip\\&quot; slipped for me.  </li>
            <li> Opened it up, twisted my hair up and clipped it up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, about 2 1/2 weeks after it came in the mail, I was reaching up to clip up my twisted hair, and it broke.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very unhappy with this clip</li>
            <li> but I really hate the color I received.</li>
            <li> This is especially annoying when I&#x27;m doing the dishes or cooking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was my favorite clip. I LOVED this clip. But it broke within a month or two. I thought maybe it was a fluke, and bought another one, and the same thing again. I bought some similar of a different brand that have lasted for at least 6 months. I wish this one was stronger and would last longer, but it really is great while it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li> The spring is firm and a 5 second twist of my very thick, mid-back length hair and I&#x27;m good to go.  You may need some texture to hold it in.  If you have very fine straight hair it may slide.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, long hair. Must clips don&#x27;t even come close to holding up my tresses. They might hold them for a half hour, but then need to take it down, re-twist my hair and clip up again. My hair also has a ton of weight to it, so even when I do get a clip that holds all of my hair, they only last a month or two before the plastic around the spring breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Scunci Octopus clips not only hold all my hair up all day, they also last forever. I have been using the same one for over a year now, and only just now ordered another one of these because someone stepped on my last one breaking it in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also a dream for keeping lots of long thick wet hair out of your face and up off your back when you come out of a shower. They also are shaped in a way that looks much nicer in your hair while it&#x27;s up than the typical hair clip. When I put my hair up in this while it&#x27;s wet, the hair drys sort of draped smoothly over it, almost completely concealing the clip itself. The claws are also shaped in a smooth way so that you don&#x27;t feel them poking into the back of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for those with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> With all the glowing reviews on this product page and another, I thought I might have found my solution.  Unfortunately, this can only hold up about 30% of my thick, coarse, and long wavy hair.  It&#x27;s enough to pull the sides back in a bun, but that&#x27;s about it.  Every hair stylist I have ever been to has said I have the thickest hair they have ever encountered, so my issue won&#x27;t be the issue of many other people (my ponytails are about 2.5 inches in diameter).  Being that my hair is below mid back, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.    Unless you have fine, slippery hair, you will probably have luck with this clip.  And really at this price, it&#x27;s not too much of a loss if it doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ll keep mine around, it&#x27;s decent enough when I want to wear my sides back in a messy bun.</li>
            <li> This is the first clip that I have ever found that will hang on to my very thick, very fine long hair.  I absolutely love it.  For years I have worn my hair in a pony tail that would slide out over the course of the day.  If I put my hair up with this clip, all of it stays exactly where I put it.  It took a few tries to hone my technique for getting it all up with the ends tucked away, but that is because I am hair challenged.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the \\&quot;no-slip Octopus Clip\\&quot; slipped for me.  I tried wearing it a number of ways and honestly it just wouldn&#x27;t stay put.  My hair would escape, which I don&#x27;t necessarily hold against the product as hair will find a way to annoy one, but the dang thing would also not stay where I put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I&#x27;m going to try something with a non-Octopus design next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~&lt;br /&gt;annoyed mom</li>
            <li> I own Scunci octopus clips and DCNL Octopus clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several significant differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The DCNL Hair clip sold by Sally Beauty Supply [[ASIN:B003N8RA1S DCNL Tortoise Octopus Hair Clip]] has a firmer spring than the Scunci Hair Clips [[ASIN:B001T8W5EQ Scunci No-slip Grip Octopus Clip, 8.5 Cm, Colors may vary]].  If you have long or heavy hair (I do), the DCNL clip will hold your hair more securely than the Scunci.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Also, the DCNL clip has tine tips that angle back in towards the clip (away from your head) making it much more comfortable against the scalp. The scunci clips do angle in, but not as much and still poke my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)The Scunci also have non-slip rubber pads mounted in them that catch a few hairs (in the gaps between the rubber pads and the plastic tines) and pull them out. i lose a few hairs everytime I use the scunci clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though they both look the same on the surface, these three qualities make the DCNL well worth the extra $3. After I found the DCNL clips, I tossed my Scunci clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading. I hope this review was helpful!</li>
            <li> This no-slip clip would not stay in my hair no matter what! I loved the design but i can&#x27;t wear it if it just keeps falling out!</li>
            <li> This clip worked wonderfully. Unfortunately after only 4 uses the plastic by the spring broke so it no longer clips very well and I can not use it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that falls to a few inches below my shoulders, and wanted a newer way to gather it up tidily in the back, and this worked well. It&#x27;s also sort of soft and pliable and so it has been much more comfortable to wear than harder plastic clips.     It held all day, from morning until night, and due to its design when I let my hair down it was virtually \\&quot;un-bent\\&quot; and it was easy to brush out and wear long without too much restyling.     I would like to see it in other colors, mainly black, but this is a neutral one that works with most of my clothing.</li>
            <li> This was touted as a good clip for long, thick hair and that it would hold heavy hair up all day long without slipping. I have hair to my belt-line.  I believed the other reviews, even though I was skeptical because of how tiny the item was.  The first time I used it out of the shipping container it snapped and broke.  This might be good for people whose hair is bra-length or shorter but it is NOT good for long, thick hair as another reviewer stated.  That reviewer must have had mid-length hair.  Note, for those of us who have belt-length hair, we don&#x27;t usually think of someone with mid-back length hair as having long hair.  That would be mid-length hair.  Please tell us how long your &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; hair is before you write a review.</li>
            <li> Incredible Hair Clip! I HAVE VERY THICK,Heavy and curly hair and this is the very first clip that truly lived up to it&#x27;s advertised capabilities.I have on occasion worn it all day and forgotten about it because it really is comfortable,absolute no slip hold during house work,shopping,walking the dog,yard work, you name it. I would definitely recommend buying this to every women that has had a hard time finding a comfortable and STRONG,hair clip!</li>
            <li> I received this hair clip for my bday and I love it.  My hair is very thick and coarse and the clip does a great job holding it back and up.  Love it!</li>
            <li> thank you very much, the item was as descriped and it was in great condition. well wraped.  great transaction.  thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, big-ish hair, and this works pretty well... it could be bigger, actually, as it barely hold all my hair. This isn&#x27;t the right clip for people with thin hair. People with HUGE hair should plan on this only holding sections... but it has a really great hold with the long prongs</li>
            <li> I love it, it is big enough for all my hair, lays flat, looks nice and stays in so snug it even kept it in place at the gym.  I just bought a few more, some for me and for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good clip...it doesn&#x27;t slip.  Perfect for the gym or just pining hair up to get out of the way</li>
            <li> absolutely wonderful for my thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt; has not snapped , and stays secure.</li>
            <li> I have A LOT of long (20 inches), thin, curly/wavy hair.  I am looking for a claw-like clip that holds my hair back both wet and dry, while not giving me a headache from poking my scalp OR from pulling the bundle downward.  After testing this in several scenarios, it barely held my wet hair close to my head without having to reposition and absolutely fails to be a winner on the dry hair front (continuously fell out of the hold and I had to reposition almost every hour, fighting with the claws and ending up with tangles galore).  This clip may be fabulous for thicker hair types, but I don&#x27;t think it is meant for thin hair, no matter how much we have!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY clip that will hold my very thick, curly hair.  I can see where fine hair would slip out of this clip, but if you have a bunch of hair to put up, this clip is for you.  My unruly curls stay up, out of my face, and in place.  I have the big size and the smaller size in this clip and they are all wonderful.  If you have a large amount of hair you want to put up, this clip will hold it.  I also like that it keeps the hair in a central location, almost like a bun would be, instead of how a longer clip goes down the entire back of your head.  This clip is much more comfortable than the long ones.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have learned after much use with these, if you have a clip that is too big then it will slip. Try the smaller size. The large ones slip after time with me when my hair is shorter, but if I use the size smaller one it works wonders- and I have thick hair! So if they don&#x27;t work for you, try going smaller.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife as she has a little longer than shoulder length hair. The clip holds her hair, but does not last long. Bought it for 2 days and it snapped on the 3rd. At least it is not couple hundred bucks.</li>
            <li> I love this octopus clip! I gather my hair at the nape of my neck and slip it into the clip and it almost looks like a bun. Very femine and classic looking. I loved it so much i bought two more to stash all over when i want to pull my hair back.</li>
            <li> Only holds for thick hair.  Does not work for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> The clip is too big and if your hair volume is less this is worthless. No grip either.It doesn&#x27;t hold your hair for even 5 min</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I didn&#x27;t actually need.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair.  (Just cut it shorter than I have in a decade -- so it&#x27;s down below my shoulder blades.  Will have to see how it does as my hair grows back to my waist.)  This clip grasps the hair nicely holding it in place firmly so the \\&quot;do\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t loosen and sag.  At the same time it doesn&#x27;t dig into your scalp as the teeth are nicely folded over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a flatter appearance than most clips -- with a grip that is large enough to grab -- but not so big that it sticks out -- in fact they lay almost horizontal to your head instead of sticking way out.  This gives it a more polished appearance -- making it suitable to use for a wider range of circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that Amazon won&#x27;t let you choose the color -- so I will have to see if I can find the same product in a store.  I have one color -- and would like the other two.  If it came in a clear version -- I would get that too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s enormous!  I had no idea how big this thing would be.  Only someone with tons of hair could hope to use it.  Found better ones at Jewel--cheaper there!</li>
            <li> This hair clip broke on the third day of use. It&#x27;s a waste of money, don&#x27;t buy. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use this for rigorous activities that require me to jump or run but I still have to re-adjust the clip in my hair every few minutes. This is especially annoying when I&#x27;m doing the dishes or cooking.</li>
            <li> These things are light weight and doesn&#x27;t hurt even when wearing long. I received one in black.&lt;br /&gt;These are big ones, I have seen smaller ones in the same brand too.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick, and I think this lasted me about a week.  It wouldn&#x27;t hold all of my hair up, and is very easy to break!</li>
            <li> nice gripper... works well and feels good on the head.... esp the way the back is make laying back doesn&#x27;t cause pain... i like this a lot but i have so much hair i&#x27;ve broken two or three so far... they do last a while and you may not be as ruff as me... works good...</li>
            <li> just  as described. it holds well and is worth the money I paid. i love this clip. it holds well</li>
            <li> Love that i can use this clip to pull my hair up to a tight bun or a loose bun. It holds hair pretty well!</li>
            <li> as described, fast shipping, thank you</li>
            <li> This product is great for long thick hair that normally breaks regular banana clips and other smaller type clips.  I can use it to keep a tight bun together all day.  I hope they make more of these and don&#x27;t discontinue them. Like all clips that are plastic and with the coil spring they do eventually wear and you have to get new ones.</li>
            <li> I ordered one a while back and though it was great, so I ordered one for my sister. Delivery date is set for for six days ago and it isn&#x27;t here, and I have a sneaking suspicion it&#x27;s not coming. For three dollars it&#x27;s not the end of the world, it&#x27;s just a little disheartening as I meant it to be a stocking-stuffer for Christmas. Like I said, the first one I ordered works wonderfully, but just be warned!</li>
            <li> Love this clip for my waistline hair. I roll it up into a bun and than add the clip for a no fall out hair design. It works great and does not break within a week of using it. The only thing is that in the picture it showed a black and brown so I assumed there were two in the box. I probably did not read the quantity amount in package. So this would be my mistake. It is still a good price considering I have been to several stores and have seen them for about a $6.00 for one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for the perfect clip to pin my hair up, and this one is almost it - only it&#x27;s a little too big.  Wish I had longer hair to fill it, so if you&#x27;re looking for an extra large clip this might be for you.</li>
            <li> I love these clips, but they only have a life of about three months, sometimes less. They always break at the hinge, either if dropped on the floor, or just under normal use. Every time, the plastic surrounding the metal hinge breaks. I love these clips, because they will hold up my hair all days without leaving any crease marks, but I&#x27;ve probably been through about 10 of them. I&#x27;m now looking for something similar from another brand.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip and it absolutely does work fabulously for keeping hair up-- until the clip breaks.  I have bought two only to have them both break within six weeks with normal use (a couple of times a week).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to clip for hanging out at home. It&#x27;s big enough to hold a lot of hair in a messy top knot and it&#x27;s sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these.  First the price is great!  These clips cost five dollars or more in the stores.  Second, it holds a lot of hair.  I have very thick hair and it holds it in place without any slips or my hair falling out of it.  Buy them if you have thick or long hair, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using one of these. It works great for thick hair. It holds great with this design.</li>
            <li> This clip is really great for my very thick just below shoulder length hair.  It stays where I put it.  My hair does still slip a out a bit but not if I ponytail it and then use the clip.</li>
            <li> The clip is definitely a no- slip hair clip! My girlfriend wanted these and she has super thick hair and it holds all day! She loves them!</li>
            <li> If you have long thick hair this will not hold it up.  Wish I could find one big enough for all my hair.</li>
            <li> it broke within a week</li>
            <li> I gave this to my niece in her Christmas stocking and she was really excited and happy. She said her friend had one similar to it and she had been wanting one. She uses it often and says it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love the no slip grips...my local store stopped stocking them so now i get them here.  Hair does not slipout .</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the usual hair claw so that I could try to get a different look for my hair. I like making half updos with my hair but when I used the octopus clip it didn&#x27;t hold it too well and it was slowly slipping off. Then I thought of just making a bun and it actually worked. It holds it tight and it looks nice :)</li>
            <li> I definitely love how the hair clip holds your hair in place. Its something I would recommend anyone to buy! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> The grip of clip is just not strong. And it would not hold my hair for long before it starts falling out.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, below-shoulders length thick hair and this is the only jaw clip that will actually hold my hair up all day without slipping or coming loose.  Mine just broke after about using it several times a week for the last 2 years so it&#x27;s durable too. One of the \\&quot;legs\\&quot; had snapped in half just a week or two before that, so I think it was just the plastic getting old. The plastic near one  of the spring ends snapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have too much hair to put it all in a bun underneath this clip, but I can put in a ponytail elastic, pull my hair up, put the clip on, and then the rest of the hair drapes over the clip, hiding it.  It can hold a bun if I do just the top half of my hair or just the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time to hold my hair up in the shower, or while doing chores. Also just for everyday wear at the office too.</li>
            <li> ideal size, great grip, perfect shape.  I LOVE, LOVE this item!  Most clips break after how heavy i use them, but this one has stood the test of time for over a year now!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> perfect for long or thick hair.  It&#x27;s easy and comfortable and stays in place.  And it looks good!  Adds some bulk to the back of your head (can&#x27;t sit up straight in the car), but this is easy enough to take out and put back.</li>
            <li> I carry one of these everywhere I go.  To hot outside, no problem put the hair up, don&#x27;t want to sleep on your hair, no problem put it up in one of these.  Want to take a quick shower and not get your hair wet this time?  No problem use one of these.  Like I said I can&#x27;t live without these on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It was cute and held my long, thick, curly hair in place well but one day it broke without warning. I only had it for a month. I think I might try it again though and see what happens</li>
            <li> I like it, it is very useful. I use it all the time. I would like to have another color :)</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks and feels on my head,I just wish the product lasted longer,I&#x27;ve boughten quite a few and then tend to break easily</li>
            <li> When this came in, I was so excited! Finally a hair clip that I could use for my thick wavy hair. Opened it up, twisted my hair up and clipped it up. Within an hour, a good portion of my hair was escaping from the clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No big deal, I thought, as I would re-clip my hair every hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, about 2 1/2 weeks after it came in the mail, I was reaching up to clip up my twisted hair, and it broke. The cap on the end of one of the wire coils that holds it together and makes it squeeze shut broke off, and in my attempts to put it back together the wire coil became completely separated from the rest of the unit. I just threw the whole thing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* (relatively) cheap.&lt;br /&gt;* Kind of does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t really hold up your hair. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;* Fragile; breaks easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I only got one, instead of the two I was originally planning on getting.</li>
            <li> Works great with my thick hair. Buy several because they do break! Had one for about two weeks and the pincher thing broke.</li>
            <li> Octopus clip...not sure how to use it...my hair is not that long but I know I will probably repurpose it with one of my hair pieces.</li>
            <li> Favorite clips in the world!! I have super long and thick hair and these are the only clips that will hold it all! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are the only hair clips that I will use for my long thick hair. Other clips won&#x27;t hold it all, or don&#x27;t hold it tight enough.</li>
            <li> I have thick hard to manage hair. It&#x27;s straight but so thick it constantly breaks hair ties even. I really can&#x27;t do anything with it other than a hair rake (which isn&#x27;t so cute at 31 years old) or a pony tail that looks like it belongs on a teenager (which also isn&#x27;t so cute). Years back I had an Octopus hair clip of very good quality that allowed for a little more diversity in hair styles for myself so I knew what shape I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard when ordering something online to gauge for yourself the quality of said item and even with user reviews you can&#x27;t quite be sure what you&#x27;re getting because something that fits someone with a lot of hair might not be good for someone with a TON of hair. I read reviews and bought this item thinking o.k, lets give it a shot and it&#x27;s only 3 bucks so if it sucks I&#x27;m not really out all that much money. I bought two just to be on the safe side. If one breaks I have another or if it&#x27;s a totally awesome item I&#x27;d rather have two in case I never find it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I knew just by looking at it before taking it out of the plastic it came in that it wasn&#x27;t too sturdy. I mean for thin hair ok - it&#x27;ll be great cheap plastic or not but for my type of hair it was a joke. I used it sparingly and gingerly in the shower to pin my hair up after washing and it wasn&#x27;t too long before it broke. One of the little arms broke off which made me cry a bit. I already was suspecting it wasn&#x27;t great quality before I pressed the \\&quot;place order button\\&quot; but I was still hoping. I&#x27;m just glad I got a few showers out of it. I did try to use it to hold my hair while out but it just wasn&#x27;t in the cards for me as my hair is not only thick but past half way down my back. Worth a shot anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Looks cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Variety of colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Great for short or thin hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Won&#x27;t hold my hair for crap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- cheap/thin plastic construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not recommended for very thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Clip does not grip very tightly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the design (Octopus shape) it is what I need for my type of hair but  need a stronger clip with a good grip and good construction. I would recommend this clip for people with thinner or short hair but not for people with long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> It was to large to hold my hair tightly and it broke under mild pressure. This is the second one of this type that has broken.</li>
            <li> I have super thick semi long hair, so the typical hair clip in stores do not last long &amp; break after a few uses. So, I thought if I went on line, I would maybe be able to find one that is made for my hair type. I typed in hair clips for long thick &amp; it took me to this site. The one that I purchased the hair clip on. But when it came in, it was the same size as the ones I can buy at any local store. But I got stuck with handling/shipping charges, which made me pay more for the same clip as the ones in stores. It&#x27;s nothing more. They did give me dimensions, but when I measured it out, I swear, it seemed much bigger than what it was. So, I just basically got ripped off, whether it be mine or the delusion of the ad appearance. I sent it back, just because of the disappointment, because if I would have kept it, they would have been able to add me on as one of their suckers, even though I paid more in S/H.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, well made. Holds long thick hair in place. Look great, professional and not cheap made. Great hair clip and price.</li>
            <li> I love these clips! These are the only clips  that hold my thick long hair up all day! Buy them.</li>
            <li> I love these! They hold my hair up really well, and they&#x27;re the only clips big enough. The only bad part is they&#x27;re plastic and they break from time to time for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought it&#x27;d be, but I love it. My hair is really curly and a lot of curls fall down when the clip is smaller, so this one does the trick.  Also it&#x27;s very easy to open, a lot of clips are super hard to put in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So perfect (: Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Worked out great, even for my fine hair type. I will wear this often. Arrived promptly and was well-packaged.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  She has the thickest hair, seriously... sooooo thick.  I asked her how this clip was performing and she said it was great.  At first she thought is might be too big, but after a few days of using it, she said she really liked it.  It kept her hair in place and it stayed put well.  The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is you are not able to choose the color of the clip, you get what they ship you.  Who does that?</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, and down to my waist (I can tuck my hair into my pants).  This clip does not work for really long hair.  I tried every way of getting it to stay in, and it came right out within ten minutes.  It is too flat to use for a bun.  I will be returning it.  I read the reviews and most of the people said they had long hair.  Obviously their hair is not that long or they were paid reviews.  Also it seemed like several men bought this for their wives which seemed odd and even odder that they would go back on to write a review about a women&#x27;s hair clip.  Anyways, if you have hair that is to the middle of your back or shorter, it may work well for you, if it is longer, than good luck getting it to stay in place.</li>
            <li> hair clips are not cheap spring busted way to fast not happy ... but it did hold hair well before it busted</li>
            <li> Those agonizing rubber band things and a hundred pins and feeling the weight of all that hair tied tightly behind, that is how. These are fabulous for anyone with massive amounts of hair, and that is after it is monthly trimmed and thinned. The idea of a fashionably &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; bun has wooed me, certainly not the dance corps bun of yesteryear. I can stuff all my shoulder length hair in one of these after a few tries, pop in a couple barettes near the back, maybe the odd pin for a neater look and be off and still lean back on the car seat since I don&#x27;t get poked by pins and teeth (these teeth lay flat), something one cannot do even if you manage a classic &#x27;50&#x27;s french bun, made for cars without headrests, remember? Makes me think they got someone who actually needs and uses such a thing to design it, already one up on most products.</li>
            <li> I love this kind of clip to hold my hair when it&#x27;s long and get many compliments for it, but this one is kind of flimsy. I have one before, maybe from a drugstore, that was very sturdy. This does the job, but would prefer a sturdier one.</li>
            <li> These octopus grip clips are my favorite. They aren&#x27;t too big so they don&#x27;t overpower the hairdo, plus, there prongs don&#x27;t pinch. They hold the hair well. The only reason I gave them four stars is because one clip lost it&#x27;s &amp;#34;springiness&amp;#34; (if that&#x27;s a word?). I can still use it but I have to pry it apart.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find, and yet the only clip that really holds thicker or longer hair with a single clip. Perfect for at home to just pull hair up, even works for work. No headache from too much hair in one spot, no broken hairs from rubber bands.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size and I can get all my hair up and in it. It also has effective but not too sharp tines.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, and I&#x27;m always struggling to find a clip that will hold it all and hold it well. I chose this one based on the great reviews by people that describe their hair the same way I&#x27;d describe mine. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the clip is very small, and the middle space where the hair will be held is also very small. I gathered my hair up and put the clip in it, and immediately, half of my hair fell out. I&#x27;ve tried to put it in multiple times, gathering my hair different ways, putting it in different locations, nothing helps. The clip is really awkwardly shaped so it isn&#x27;t easy to put in either. The curved edges help to gather whatever side you start on and get the clip in there, but then it is impossible to get in the other side. Really shouldn&#x27;t be this hard. No matter how I do it, at least half of my hair falls out within a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very unhappy with this clip and I wish that I could return it and get my money back, because it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth it. If you have thick and/or long hair, do not waste your money!! This clip will not hold your hair.</li>
            <li> i leaned back too hard or too awkward and one of the outer arms broke.kinda disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this stupid clip! I&#x27;ve gone through two so far and am most likely going to go buy yet another one this weekend.... I love the design it holds all my hair doesn&#x27;t dig into the scalp never slips! I wrap my wet hair into a bun, shake it out every couple hours and put it back up so it drys. My favorite thing about it is that unlike pony tails if I decide to take my hair down at some point it looks GOOD! all curly and bouncy! UNFORTUNATELY it&#x27;s incredibly cheap! I dropped mine on the carpet the other day and the damn thing broke. Costs the same at target as it does on amazon so I&#x27;ll probably go down there and pick up another one..... Hopefully this one lasts me more than a month!</li>
            <li> I love these because I can quickly run my fingers through my hair, pull it back, twist, and clip.  It holds my hair when other things don&#x27;t (because my hair is so fine), and yet doesn&#x27;t make wrinkles and ridges like hair bands.  So I can quickly go from having my hair down to pulled up and back - and vice versa.  And because it is &amp;#34;casual&amp;#34;, the result is always acceptable, unlike trying to get every stray hair neatly combed and gathered in a pony-tail band or barrette.</li>
            <li> Lol I have a this product and it doesnt hold my hair up. I have thick heavy hair and got it cut because the top part/ scalp hair starting pulling a lot when I put it up. Though I got a hair cut to lighten the load and avoid hair pulling soreness...my hair doesnt stay in the octopus claw. Not saying it doesnt work; for me it did not.</li>
            <li> Holds ALL of my thick hair as high or low as I want. Definatly needed this.</li>
            <li> I think because my hair is so thin, the &amp;#34;no slip&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t actually work.  I wish it clasped tighter.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have real thick hair, kinda long &amp; this works perfect! This is the first clip to really hold all my hair &amp; stay in the whole day</li>
            <li> Not a hard plastic so not as sturdy as I thought it would be. Overall gets the job done though.</li>
            <li> I loved this clip because it held up my thick hair, but when i was changing, my tshirt barely touched it and it fell apart! I was stuck using hair ties to make buns in my hair until I got a different clip.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick heavy hair that refuses to do anything but make my head sweat profusely. I had given up on clips years ago because there was nothing like this for my mane of insanity. The octopus clips have been a god-send; it stays put, my hair doesn&#x27;t slip out, it&#x27;s big enough to encapsulate all my hair and still be against my head, and so far so good with the wear-and-tear; has shown no signs of breaking. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very awesome price for this clip and it is very sturdy, did not break since January I love it. I will recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly and unruly hair that&#x27;s in long layers (midback-length). This does a pretty good job of holding it all in place, although some of the shorter layers tend to slip out if I don&#x27;t put in on right. I twist my hair into a bun or french twist, and then place this on to hold it in place, which seems to work well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance and not picky about things such as colors usually, but I really hate the color I received. It was like a reverse tortoise color--a straight up beige/gray carpet kind of hue with cheesy, black stripes painted on. We&#x27;re talking the ugliest beige you could think of. I&#x27;m not saying I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, because it does work pretty well, but I likely won&#x27;t be purchasing it from Amazon if \\&quot;varying colors\\&quot; means getting another one like what I was previously sent. This is definitely not something I could wear out of the house, unfortunately, especially since I have dark brown hair. Not entirely their fault, but it would be nice to be able to choose the color, or at least see what you might be getting. Or better yet, stick to standard colors.</li>
            <li> great hold but I had pictured it as smaller than it is. I have thick wavy hair and it will hold all of it up at once, but when I tried to do a half up half down hairstyle it was too loose.</li>
            <li> Long hair  takes stronger clips and this is it!  Don&#x27;t have to worry about hair falling out of the clip.</li>
    </ol>
