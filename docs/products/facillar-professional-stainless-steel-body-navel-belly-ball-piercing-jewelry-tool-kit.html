            <li> Works, pierced my belly button, but the blue from the jewelery flakes off- not good when its a new piercing!!</li>
            <li> but it was money well spent.</li>

            <li> This processes took me two hours not because the products didnt work but just cause I have a very little to nonexistent pain threshold.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i really love it i pierced my lip with it and and i love it</li>
            <li> very useful needles are very sharp clamps could have worked a bit better but over all it was very good</li>
            <li> Perfect, professional, sterile. Cute simple starter rings. Needle went thru my skin perfectly clean. No pain. No problems what so ever.</li>
            <li> It came with all items pictured. The needle worked great. It was very sharp. My fiance pierced me. It was painful but quick. It doesn&#x27;t come with alcohol pads. So make sure you have that already. I used a cotton swab with alcohol. So far so good! I love it. It&#x27;s a great deal! I plan on piercing my nose next! For the price you&#x27;re saving so much money! You can pierce just about anything with this kit. It took about 2 weeks to get to SoCal but it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> the needles were very sharp and sterile (i restirelised them for good measure) but the jewelry is TERRIBLE cheap chinese steel not medical grade and will easily reject and get infection invest some more dollars in made in america surgical steel body jewelry ITS WORTH IT,&lt;br /&gt;that way your piercings wont reject in a week and have pus oozing out (not pretty)</li>
            <li> I pierced my friends smiley it went well until she fainted. The clamps were rough and need to be smoothed down. Other than that the kit was perfect.</li>
            <li> Figuring out what needle for the navel was confusing but the product is good I love my piercing.😊 I just love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Worked very well.  Color of the earrings were really nice.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on ordering this kit, let alone piercing my belly button on my own. It said the predicted date to receive it was in over a month, i got it in a week which was a plus. Everything came in great, sterile packaging, and my piercing looks great! i didn&#x27;t need all of the piercings, but it&#x27;s definitely a plus to have extra needles/jewelry handy. I would actually recommend it</li>
            <li> order came in when I it was supposed to! piercing needles worked great. but the jewlrey was crappy quality! be sure to buy more jewelry when buying this item other than that I loved it!(:</li>
            <li> I just turned 16 less than a month ago and decided I was going to rebel against my parents. So in order to do so part of the plan was to pierce my belly button. I have never pierced anything except for when i was younger and I got my ears done at the mall. This processes took me two hours not because the products didnt work but just cause I have a very little to nonexistent pain threshold. But I highly recommend this kit if u wanna do this on your own. Otherwise just pay the money and get done by professionals it&#x27;s probably a lot less time consuming</li>
            <li> Works, pierced my belly button, but the blue from the jewelery flakes off- not good when its a new piercing!! Use your own jewelery and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> First self piercing, and I wish it came with instructions. I tried to do my own septum but I couldn&#x27;t really use the forceps. I didn&#x27;t have internet access to read online how to do it so I just did it by hand. It didn&#x27;t work the way I wanted so I took it out. Gonna wait again until it&#x27;s healed.</li>
            <li> This is a brand new , high quality,  disposable sterile puncture kit.  Anti-allergic. Jewelry color are  randomly selected. Piercing needle are  12G*2 13G*3 14G*2 16G*1. Comes with  5 x Disposable pliers, 8 x Jewelry pieces, 8 x Piercing needles,5 x Pliers.  The needles are marked with the size on the,. Very easy to use. Perfect set for your piercing needs .</li>
            <li> The needles and clamps worked well, but the balls kept coming of the jewelry, so if you plan on doing your own piercing get your jewelry separate from the set. Other than  that great purchase, and I go it sooner than expected</li>
            <li> These came exactly as it looks, I have already used them for my belly, septum, smiley, and tounge. I&#x27;m so happy, although the plastic clamps don&#x27;t work that great but extra star for getting here early.</li>

            <li> this product worked a lot better then the metal by scripts that I owned</li>
            <li> the jewelry was kinda cheap, the balls kept falling off and the paint was a little cheap</li>
