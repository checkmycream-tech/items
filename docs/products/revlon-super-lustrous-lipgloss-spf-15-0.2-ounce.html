            <li>Ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>If you purchased this color wanting a sheerer gloss, I think you would love it.</li>

            <li>But overall it is a nice product the color is beautiful from the looks of it</li>
            <li>This is not a bad gloss per se, but I was expecting more in the way of color payoff.</li>

            <li>In the tube this looks like a very bright, opaque, creamy, hot pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you want sheer color, however.</li>
            <li>I have a deep coloring with red undertones, so it&#x27;s perfect for me..</li>

            <li>The color is so pretty on my lips!  </li>
            <li>I just noticed that someone else made the same kind of statement in a review before.</li>
            <li>I was sucked in by how pretty this looked in the store; however, the color in the tube and the color on the lips aren’t even close.</li>
            <li>You could have fun with this one, or just use it on it&#x27;s own since it is sheer enough.</li>
            <li>The pink pop is the perfect shade of pink that would flatter all different skin tones.</li>
            <li>colors are very feminine and flattering to all skin tones.</li>
            <li>Very much appreciated.</li>
            <li>the gloss was very moisturizing.  </li>

            <li> The color actually looks like what you see when you look at the tube. Long-wearing but not opaque as I had hoped. That disappointed me. It&#x27;s good if you want sheer color, however.</li>
            <li> A+  I love the texture and color of this product. The pink pop is the perfect shade of pink that would flatter all different skin tones. Love it</li>
            <li> I love the color and I got it before the expected date but when I open the package I notice that there wasn&#x27;t a tamper seal on the lip gloss and I was wondering does it suppose to come that way? I know you can go into some stores and there wouldn&#x27;t be a protective seal I just thought Revlon products had it on there. But overall it is a nice product the color is beautiful from the looks of it, I will probably just buy my lipgloss from the store from now on, to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth, light feeling lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has reasonably good staying power.&lt;br /&gt;It contains aloe vera and vitamin D and feels light and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very feminine and flattering to all skin tones.</li>
            <li> Beautiful pink lip gloss that has a lot of moisture. It also lasts for a very long time. Ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I was sucked in by how pretty this looked in the store; however, the color in the tube and the color on the lips aren’t even close. In the tube this looks like a very bright, opaque, creamy, hot pink. On the lips the shade is similar, but it goes on so sheer. It is buildable, but only to a point; even if you try to glop it on, you can’t get the color that you see in the tube. I did two coats, and I got what I would consider a “wash” of the color that you see in the package. However, my expectations played a big part in my disappointment with the product. If you purchased this color wanting a sheerer gloss, I think you would love it. It seems to wear well, and it didn’t leave my lips feeling dry, sticky, or gooey. This is not a bad gloss per se, but I was expecting more in the way of color payoff.</li>
            <li> Great lipstick creamy smooth and the color is great.  The price through Amazon is comparable or better than than brick stores.</li>
            <li> I wish it was not so sticky feeling</li>
            <li> Honestly I was afraid of this color at first...it looks very bright in the tube but can be applied as heavy or light as you want. Now I always find myself reaching for this color because it vibrant and gives me the perfect pop of color when I need it. Beautiful shade, glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> was okay it lasted for long but not too bright</li>
            <li> Fav gloss hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I love this color on my lips! Can somebody say PINK! I like how glossy this is and how smooth it feels on my lips.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice color. I have a deep coloring with red undertones, so it&#x27;s perfect for me..I hope this helps..</li>
            <li> Pretty pop of pink. Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product. Cross between a lip gloss and lipstick.</li>
            <li> So this was a great price, the color is nice I would recommend for some one with light to medium skin. This is a neat color to build with and apply over your lipstick our your lip stain. You could have fun with this one, or just use it on it&#x27;s own since it is sheer enough. The reason I am only giving it two stars is because the safety seal was clearly broken when I received it. I just noticed that someone else made the same kind of statement in a review before. I know this product comes with this seal over it, and when I received it. I noticed it looked like someone just pulled at it but when i looked further I noticed that then seal was completely broken. Oh well not sure if that is why the price is so cheap. Also would like to add that the seller contacted me and issued a refund to me since the seal was broken. Very much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Love it!  The color is so pretty on my lips!  A very pretty pink...and the gloss was very moisturizing.  I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Great price. Stays on good</li>
