            <li>This is a huge bottle at a great price.</li>

            <li>Worked great and evaporated quickly.</li>
            <li>I liked my latest purchase.</li>
            <li>Thank you for having it available at a good price.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t know any better and I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>At my house, we tend to build and take apart many electronic devices.</li>
            <li>More than twice and the pad starts to become sticky</li>
            <li>But I WILL be ordering more when needed.</li>
            <li>This is part of the items used in applying my top gel coat on my crystal nails.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love .love.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>U will love it ^_^</li>
            <li>i was able to find at the time.</li>
            <li>and if I overshoot my mark, this product removes EVERYTHING waaay better than the 91% does.</li>
            <li>Unsure how to tell if its 99% as advertised but it is an excellent cleaner with almost no residue.&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, the bottle came without an inner cap seal.</li>
            <li>This was just the thing for the job of cleaning the electronics safely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to find 99% isopropyl  alcohol any place</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>This stuff is fully 2% better than the 97% IPA I used to buy.  </li>
            <li>We need it to be safe and efficient, as well.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to degrease when you are done, better than Hornady one shot</li>
            <li>So we prefer to use the 99% isopropyl alcohol to clean these surfaces, and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t always easy to find.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my makeup brushes, and it&#x27;s better than any brush cleaner on the market.</li>
            <li>just like it says it is 99% and strong.</li>
            <li>Its a good amount of high-quality and high purity isopropyl.</li>
            <li>Received shipment quickly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li>It makes your polish so shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>&quot; nail manicures on myself, where you use the UV light.</li>
            <li>I use the lint free pad twice by &#x27;saving&#x27; it in a zip lock.</li>
            <li>I use it for sanitation purposes, but primarily for my make up brushes.</li>
            <li>6 months later my father is now cancer free! ! !</li>
            <li>Use this to clean computer parts and my face too.</li>
            <li>Im using it to clean my glass</li>
            <li>I used this to clean the inside of my Nexus 7 after soda spilled and seeped in.</li>
            <li>I clean all my makeup brushes with this.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean computer parts and works wonders</li>
            <li>i would definately recommend to anyone that needs to clean computer Hardware</li>
            <li>Used for special effects make-up removal.</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>this alcohol works great for electronic repair, i use it to take off the old thermal paste from Xboxs to fix red light, i also use it clean things up from plastic</li>
            <li>This came quickly when I needed to have it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic consistent product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather cheap when you think that you can get 70% for just as much, at Wal-Mart or something.</li>
            <li>After processing the manicure under the UV light, you are left with a &#x27;sticky&#x27; residue that is on top of the finished nail.</li>
            <li>For anyone who is doing their own nails professionally, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Shipping was super duper fast too!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel all right.</li>
            <li>I had no other option but to wait for it on the mail, it is interesting that the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post</li>
            <li>it is super fast drying</li>
            <li>Super Fast shipping, neatly wrapped in box.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, well packed, the bottle is strong and easy to pour, and the actual alcohol seems to be of high quality.  </li>
            <li>The sticky residue is gone and all that&#x27;s left is a hard brilliant smooth as silk shine!&lt;br /&gt;(Side</li>
            <li>I put this stuff plus a handful of Epsom salts in a Ziploc bag with the pipe, seal it up, leave it overnight, and in the morning, it&#x27;s sparkling clean and just like new.</li>
            <li>but I did forget to explain my first line</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This did exactly what I needed it to do - I used it for gel nail application</li>
            <li>It evaporates almost immediately touching the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The item that was bought not only behaves like 70% off the shelf IPA that can be bought in a store for a fraction of the price, but even those bottled come sealed when purchased; this bottle wasn&#x27;t even sealed which was a redflag from the satrt.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>thanks great product, hard to find...will order again when ready, would like it to have a seal on it, but thanks&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased and will be using this for a long time to come</li>
            <li>I trust the product as being as pure as they claim.</li>
            <li>In the wax-melting and wax-chasing process of our shop, we need alcohol that will burn without issue, at certain temperatures.</li>
            <li>this is very high quality 99% isopropyl alchohol.  </li>
            <li>And the bottle is huge, so I suspect it will last about a year (and I redo my nails every 7-10 days!</li>
            <li>and it is very affordable.</li>
            <li>They really take care of their products.</li>
            <li>but Amazon.com (unless one wants to drive everywhere looking for a beauty supply store).  </li>
            <li>There are numerous uses one can find for this product once it&#x27;s available in your home.</li>
            <li>It works very well as a solvent.</li>
            <li>The extra 8% in this alcohol makes a HUGE difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some round &#x27;lint free&#x27; pads at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Salon (they MUST be lint free), soak one of these much thicker pads, swipe it across the nails and boom..GLOSSY.</li>
            <li>also see by other reviews that there are many uses for this &#x27;almost pure&#x27; alcohol.</li>
            <li>B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]], one of the most difficult brushes to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Stores seem to only carry 91% now and I needed 99 or more to properly dissolve lanolin fur a spray lubricant used in reloading brass case ammunition.</li>
            <li>Had to purchase this product as I could not find any locally for removing the final film off of the top coat from the CND Shellac Nail Polish.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely manner, it was packaged appropriately eliminating any waste.</li>
            <li>Most store bought Isopropyl Alcohol is not 99% by volume and what seems like a minor difference can sometimes leave a significant amount of residue behind.  </li>
            <li>The product did take a while to get here a little more than a week actually and</li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon has this item I looked everywhere for it its hard to find the 99%</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now let me clear this, for you.</li>
            <li>I used it for removing old thermal paste on my CPU.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to clean electrical components and other similar tasks.  </li>
            <li>Because it is pure alcohol even the biggest make up brushes dry within a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than the slow shipment it was fine,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find 99% alcohol and this for the price is very economical.</li>

            <li> Stores seem to only carry 91% now and I needed 99 or more to properly dissolve lanolin fur a spray lubricant used in reloading brass case ammunition.</li>

            <li> Most store bought Isopropyl Alcohol is not 99% by volume and what seems like a minor difference can sometimes leave a significant amount of residue behind.  </li>
            <li> The product did take a while to get here a little more than a week actually and</li>
            <li> I am glad Amazon has this item I looked everywhere for it its hard to find the 99%</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now let me clear this, for you.</li>
            <li> I used it for removing old thermal paste on my CPU.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to clean electrical components and other similar tasks.  </li>
            <li> Because it is pure alcohol even the biggest make up brushes dry within a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than the slow shipment it was fine,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find 99% alcohol and this for the price is very economical.</li>
            <li> My brushes have never been cleaner or more sanitary, and this bottle costs less than expensive brush cleaners and lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> (the thickness of 3 sheets of paper) pads are about 1/2\\&quot; by 1/2\\&quot; and dry out before you can even get to the other hand.</li>
            <li> I keep a small squirt bottle near my makeup area and every day I squirt a little onto each brush as soon as I&#x27;m done using it, then swirl the brush around on a hand towel to remove makeup residue.</li>
            <li> In this process, there tends to be flux and other things we don&#x27;t want there.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is an issue or whether there is even a requirement&lt;br /&gt;for such products.</li>
            <li> Cleans my internal PC parts and case from small dust particles</li>
            <li> The quality is perfect--same as some of the other products I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For deep cleans I pour a little into a small cup and swish the brush in it for a few seconds, then swirl it around on the towel.</li>
            <li> i find it works well to remove sharpie and a few other permanent ink quite well</li>
            <li> and I know that all the germs are being killed.</li>
            <li> And these small boxes of wipes are not cheap!</li>
            <li> Shipped securely so no leakage!  </li>
            <li> The only problem is it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> All 91% does is smudge the &#x27;sticky&#x27; on the UV coating, and take some of that coating off along with some of the nail color, and makes the nail DULL!</li>
            <li> Now, you can buy little boxes of pre-made thin &#x27;pads&#x27; at, say Walgreens, to rub across your nail to remove this sticky stuff, but these VERY thin,</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find 99% alcohol at chain stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You see this bottle came without a plastic protective or seal on the cap thus making me skeptical about</li>
            <li> Sorry...</li>
            <li> It works for my intended purpose and wasn&#x27;t overly expensive.</li>

            <li> I am glad Amazon has this item I looked everywhere for it its hard to find the 99% and I need it to do Shellac nails</li>
            <li> I liked my latest purchase. It arrived in a timely manner, it was packaged appropriately eliminating any waste. Thank you..</li>
            <li> I purchased this to wipe my nails with after applying UV nail polish. It makes your polish so shiny and smooth.  I am so pleased with my purchase. Shipping was super duper fast too!</li>
            <li> I honestly have no way of testing if it is 99% Isopropyl Alcohol, but I do know it is a 32oz. Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me clear this, for you. The product did take a while to get here a little more than a week actually and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there was no \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; option I had no other option but to wait for it on the mail, it is interesting that the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post Office required me to go pick it up at their location because it had a delivery confirmation request by the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipper, I do regret that the shipper didn&#x27;t include a tracking number for me to keep an eye on this item while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was in transit instead of waiting for an uncertain amount of days in the mail for it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the slow shipment it was fine, oh but I did forget to explain my first line above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see this bottle came without a plastic protective or seal on the cap thus making me skeptical about it&#x27;s 99%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isopropyl claim, to me it smells the same as the regular 70% Isopropyl but I wouldn&#x27;t know any better and I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just trust the seller&#x27;s reputation on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is what it said it was, 99% Iso alcohol. I used it to make my own record cleaning solution and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find 99% alcohol at chain stores.  This came quickly when I needed to have it.</li>
            <li> At my house, we tend to build and take apart many electronic devices. In this process, there tends to be flux and other things we don&#x27;t want there. So we prefer to use the 99% isopropyl alcohol to clean these surfaces, and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> I used this for alcohol activated makeup to paint a Halloween prosthetic. Worked great and evaporated quickly. I used this on a gelatin piece that could not take water based paints.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner in a knotted baggie in a padded mail envelope. (No leaks thankfully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this because I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of those \\&quot;gel\\&quot; nail manicures on myself, where you use the UV light. After processing the manicure under the UV light, you are left with a &#x27;sticky&#x27; residue that is on top of the finished nail. Now, you can buy little boxes of pre-made thin &#x27;pads&#x27; at, say Walgreens, to rub across your nail to remove this sticky stuff, but these VERY thin, (the thickness of 3 sheets of paper) pads are about 1/2\\&quot; by 1/2\\&quot; and dry out before you can even get to the other hand. And these small boxes of wipes are not cheap! (Like $4-5.00) I was using 4 pads every time I&#x27;d do a manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T understand people saying they use 91% alcohol. It does NOT work for me. All 91% does is smudge the &#x27;sticky&#x27; on the UV coating, and take some of that coating off along with some of the nail color, and makes the nail DULL! Terrible. The extra 8% in this alcohol makes a HUGE difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some round &#x27;lint free&#x27; pads at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Salon (they MUST be lint free), soak one of these much thicker pads, swipe it across the nails and boom..GLOSSY. Beautiful. It takes off that stick/tacky coating without taking off any polish. The sticky residue is gone and all that&#x27;s left is a hard brilliant smooth as silk shine!&lt;br /&gt;(Side note...I use the lint free pad twice by &#x27;saving&#x27; it in a zip lock. More than twice and the pad starts to become sticky itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a HUGE bottle. (Think 1/2 a bottle of a 2 liter Coke). Will probably last me a year. But I WILL be ordering more when needed. From this company. I trust the product as being as pure as they claim. I can tell by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also see by other reviews that there are many uses for this &#x27;almost pure&#x27; alcohol. Cool.</li>
            <li> This is part of the items used in applying my top gel coat on my crystal nails.  Excellent item, east to pour in spray bottle.  Shipped securely so no leakage!  Received shipment quickly!</li>
            <li> I used this product to make Rick Simpsons oil. Works fantastic! 6 months later my father is now cancer free! ! !</li>
            <li> great service and product was just as i wanted</li>
            <li> Love .love. love. love. U will love it ^_^ I use for my make up brushes it is super fast drying</li>
            <li> its isopropyl alcohol. nothing to review here. best deal in this price range i was able to find at the time.</li>
            <li> Sorry...but everytime I think of 99% alcohol she comes to the forefront of my mind!  :●&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deal with medical adhesives in my hair replacement business and if I overshoot my mark, this product removes EVERYTHING waaay better than the 91% does.</li>
            <li> This did exactly what I needed it to do - I used it for gel nail application and it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> great price, use it for my Shellac applications and you get a lot for the $.  Def will buy again!</li>
            <li> Received on time no complaints.</li>
            <li> I use it for a lot of things including making my own case lube for reloading.  Works like a charm</li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning your lace units!!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel all right. Just kidding This is awesome. Would suggest to others for purchase. Fantastic consistent product.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and use this for my alcohol activated makeup. Thank you for having it available at a good price. It isn&#x27;t always easy to find.</li>
            <li> It is what  is , I use it for re-loading.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for research use. It works perfectly! Its a good amount of high-quality and high purity isopropyl. Extremely pleased and will be using this for a long time to come</li>
            <li> Use this to clean computer parts and my face too. :) Works great for both, way cheaper to buy in bulk than in store.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping, neatly wrapped in box. They really take care of their products. I like companys that take an extra step. This is a HUGE bottle. lot bigger than i thought. Will buy again and deff recommend company to friends. Im using it to clean my glass and it works great.</li>
            <li> Unsure how to tell if its 99% as advertised but it is an excellent cleaner with almost no residue.&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, the bottle came without an inner cap seal. Not sure if that is an issue or whether there is even a requirement&lt;br /&gt;for such products.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for cleaning printers. No complaints here. Arrived very quickly. And was a good price for the product.</li>
            <li> Product is as described, no frills, gets the job done</li>
            <li> There is no way on earth that this was 99% IPA.&lt;br /&gt;I have access to 99% IPA at work. It evaporates almost immediately touching the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The item that was bought not only behaves like 70% off the shelf IPA that can be bought in a store for a fraction of the price, but even those bottled come sealed when purchased; this bottle wasn&#x27;t even sealed which was a redflag from the satrt.&lt;br /&gt;This vendor is marketing 99%IPA, but rebottling 70% selling it 99% cost.</li>
            <li> I used this to clean the inside of my Nexus 7 after soda spilled and seeped in. This was just the thing for the job of cleaning the electronics safely.</li>
            <li> Cleans my internal PC parts and case from small dust particles</li>
            <li> this is very high quality 99% isopropyl alchohol.  has many uses and was the best price i could find for the size of the bottle. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> thanks great product, hard to find...will order again when ready, would like it to have a seal on it, but thanks&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Used for special effects make-up removal.</li>
            <li> For Pro 99% Isopropyl Alcohol 32 oz. is great for finishing Shellac nail polish manicures and is also perfect for cleaning bottles used for essential oils and removing greasy/oily solvents of all types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to find 99% isopropyl  alcohol any place but Amazon.com (unless one wants to drive everywhere looking for a beauty supply store).  This generous bottle is the best priced option I&#x27;ve found.  The quality is perfect--same as some of the other products I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend keeping a bottle of this on hand.  There are numerous uses one can find for this product once it&#x27;s available in your home.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of alcohol. I prefer this brand &amp; bottle. It works very well as a solvent. So, that is that.</li>
            <li> This stuff will take the paint off a wall and I love it lol. I use it for sanitation purposes, but primarily for my make up brushes. Because it is pure alcohol even the biggest make up brushes dry within a couple minutes. You have cleaned and dried and are ready for the next application of your makeup. Can&#x27;t beat that as a time saver. It&#x27;s hard to find 99% alcohol and this for the price is very economical. Will last you forever.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is doing their own nails professionally, I definitely recommend this product! It&#x27;s great for shellac and acrylic.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the 99% alcohol that I needed to do my shellac nail polish application.  The alcohol did its job and count me happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never without this. I clean all my makeup brushes with this. It doesn&#x27;t damage them and I know that all the germs are being killed.</li>
            <li> Stores seem to only carry 91% now and I needed 99 or more to properly dissolve lanolin fur a spray lubricant used in reloading brass case ammunition. This fit the bill and by making my own solution I am realizing a nice savings too!</li>
            <li> I bought this alchol to assist with a bed bug problem and it worked great . In between exterminator visits the 99% alchohol works great and helped to keep them at bay. Thank you</li>
            <li> This stuff is fully 2% better than the 97% IPA I used to buy.  How did they do it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, well packed, the bottle is strong and easy to pour, and the actual alcohol seems to be of high quality.  I do which the container had \\&quot;Alcohol\\&quot; printed larger than the brand name..</li>
            <li> In the wax-melting and wax-chasing process of our shop, we need alcohol that will burn without issue, at certain temperatures. We need it to be safe and efficient, as well. This meets all of our needs - surpasses them, even. Especially with the value. It&#x27;s rather cheap when you think that you can get 70% for just as much, at Wal-Mart or something.</li>
            <li> Works great for shellac nail polish.</li>
            <li> I used it for removing old thermal paste on my CPU. The only problem is it&#x27;s expensive. Great buy for me.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle at a great price. I use this for cleaning glass pipes. I put this stuff plus a handful of Epsom salts in a Ziploc bag with the pipe, seal it up, leave it overnight, and in the morning, it&#x27;s sparkling clean and just like new.</li>
            <li> just like it says it is 99% and strong. I use this to clean computer parts and works wonders i would definately recommend to anyone that needs to clean computer Hardware</li>
            <li> its great for my application, this and liquid lanolin works great for case lube and you don&#x27;t have to degrease when you are done, better than Hornady one shot</li>
            <li> Had to purchase this product as I could not find any locally for removing the final film off of the top coat from the CND Shellac Nail Polish.</li>
            <li> I payed for a bottle of alcohol and received a bottle of alcohol. It works for my intended purpose and wasn&#x27;t overly expensive.</li>
            <li> Works great on removing lace wigs</li>
            <li> I purchased this to clean electrical components and other similar tasks.  Most store bought Isopropyl Alcohol is not 99% by volume and what seems like a minor difference can sometimes leave a significant amount of residue behind.  This 99% by volume doesn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I used this with the CND gel nail system. It works perfectly. And the bottle is huge, so I suspect it will last about a year (and I redo my nails every 7-10 days! -- I don&#x27;t like the grow out look)</li>
            <li> this alcohol works great for electronic repair, i use it to take off the old thermal paste from Xboxs to fix red light, i also use it clean things up from plastic i find it works well to remove sharpie and a few other permanent ink quite well</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my makeup brushes, and it&#x27;s better than any brush cleaner on the market. I keep a small squirt bottle near my makeup area and every day I squirt a little onto each brush as soon as I&#x27;m done using it, then swirl the brush around on a hand towel to remove makeup residue. For deep cleans I pour a little into a small cup and swish the brush in it for a few seconds, then swirl it around on the towel. My brushes have never been cleaner or more sanitary, and this bottle costs less than expensive brush cleaners and lasts longer too. It even works on my [[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]], one of the most difficult brushes to keep clean. Try it--your complexion will thank you!</li>
            <li> Great size for the price!</li>
