            <li>and it makes your hair feel healthier, I do believe it is one of the best to use on your hair in regards to harshness.</li>
            <li>My hair turned out perfect</li>
            <li>But, for me, it was perfect.</li>
            <li>My end result was beautiful, shimmery, pastel peachy-pink.</li>
            <li>My end result was beautiful, shimmery, pastel peachy-pink.</li>
            <li>no.&lt;br /&gt; If you want just a touch of color this is great.</li>
            <li>Great color</li>
            <li>Great dye.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten great results with that one.</li>
            <li>This color is amazing!</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>The texture of the material is nice, like a lotion almost, and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>You do really need bleached out hair to get the best results for this brand of colors.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a very precise level of lightening.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair often and I dye it many colors.</li>
            <li>i think i will try lightening my hair more and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Amazing if your hair is light blonde and you want a perfect pastel coral-peach.</li>
            <li>color is more like a salmon.</li>
            <li>4 stars because level 10 is a lot to ask of most hair types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used manic panic colors mixed with conditioner and Ion color brights before to get pastel and muted colors, but this is the best dye</li>

            <li>is that the color takes to your hair very fast, which can be looked at as great, except not so much for me.</li>
            <li>but it was fine.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the color is looks like the picture and it smells nice, but it&#x27;s definitely very temporary.</li>
            <li>too light, didn&#x27;t show well in my hair</li>
            <li>I mixed the color with Vivids Orange and also got spectacular results!</li>
            <li>If you want a nice coral color I highly suggest going with manic panic in pretty flamingo.</li>
            <li>yet - super saturated pastel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yet - super saturated pastel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t know how to use it and therefore get less than great results.</li>
            <li>I really liked the color using only one tube.</li>
            <li>The pale lavender combined with the violet is a great in between color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super pretty, but it washes out in two shampoos.</li>
            <li>And I was right.</li>
            <li>I died the tips of my hair very light blonde (not white).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This is not the first Pravana shade I&#x27;ve used, nor the first Pravana pastel shade I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even went and a did it a second time thinking maybe twice would make it show better, but</li>
            <li>Need to bleach your hair first, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>If you have short hair though, I feel like this would be extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>And it is very easy to get anywhere from a soft pink shade to a fantastic bright pink just by varying how long you leave the dye in your hair.</li>
            <li>Soaked unwashed hair in pure, unrefined, organic coconut oil for about an hour to protect before bleaching (from the grocery store).</li>
            <li>Except since it is a lot darker, it&#x27;s not quite as problematic as using a very pastel shade since my hair will still take to the color (just not all the way).</li>
            <li>and I needed to use the whole tube</li>
            <li>my hair is light yellow</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>the color when it comes out in the tube is much much paler than the photo.</li>
            <li>The pastels wash out really fast too.</li>
            <li>Just applied it straight from tube to hair.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really take to my hair</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re paying too much, 2.</li>
            <li>I agree with M. Kammerer&#x27;s review - this product works really well if you know how to use it or have help from someone who does.</li>
            <li>guess I lied and there were really 5 steps to the process -</li>
            <li>guess I lied and there were really 5 steps to the process -</li>
            <li>I wanted a soft peachy/coral &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; on my ombre, and it did exactly that.</li>
            <li>Even ion color brights in rose, though fades very quickly, had more vivid color results than this crap</li>
            <li>Brushed too cute coral onto hair from roots to ends in 2 inch sections and saturated hair with entire tube of color.</li>
            <li>You really need to have your hair at 10 bleached, and even then it is sooo light that it is not worth the money in my eyes.</li>
            <li>color was VERY subtle, a light peachy pink, but most of it washed out after the first shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I processed the hair to a complete 9 and then used 09v to get it to a 10.</li>
            <li>obviously fades fast, which I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Soft, not harsh and &amp;#34;chemically.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Rinsed toner out completely, towel and air-dried completely again.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try out Pravana&#x27;s Too Cute Coral, but as soon as I squeezed the product into the bowl, I knew it was going to be a major disappointment.</li>
            <li>I look very closely there are still tiny hints of pink, but I think I was looking for something a little more permanent.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>I prefer using other brands that I can just dilute myself to get exactly the pastel color</li>
            <li>it really conditioned my hair but not much in the way of coloring it.</li>
            <li>This is a professional product and requires not only a state license to purchase but also a company certification to use.</li>
            <li>You really need to mix in some other deeper color to make it pop.</li>
            <li>My hair is bleached to almost a white blond and it barely showed up.  </li>
            <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t oxidize it needs to be applied to hair with an open cuticle, which also means will fade quickly, but should last at least 4 weeks with proper care.</li>

            <li> My hair is very long</li>
            <li> Very faint shade of pink but quite lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dark shades of Pravana, like blue and green, and I&#x27;ve had the same issue.</li>
            <li> Once all roots were covered, I brushed remaining bleach on the rest of my hair to lift the previous pink color out.</li>
            <li> It needs to be washed in COLD water with sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I recognize a lot of people were upset that it wasn&#x27;t as dark as they wanted, or it didn&#x27;t stay for as long as they had expected.</li>
            <li> ; I would recommend this dye to anyone trying to go pink!</li>
            <li> It is a pale pastel peachy pink.</li>
            <li> it tinted it slightly coral colored</li>
            <li> At this point, I put on a shower cap, went to bed, and let the pastel dye process overnight (which was only about 5 hours, because I&#x27;m crazy and only slept from 2-7am).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure what you could mix with the coral to deepen it.</li>
            <li> Too Cute Coral is the worst color Pravana makes.</li>
            <li> hair was already lightened and dyed a dusty pink color 4 months ago and had about 2+ inches of root regrowth.</li>
            <li> It was very pale.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the color, just user error.</li>
            <li> in the morning I rinsed out the pravana color in cold water.</li>
            <li> in the morning I rinsed out the pravana color in cold water.</li>
            <li> Too bad, since nobody makes a comparable shade.</li>
            <li> Horrible color longevity.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I dye my hair often and I dye it many colors. This is not the first Pravana shade I&#x27;ve used, nor the first Pravana pastel shade I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve noticed from this brand is that the color takes to your hair very fast, which can be looked at as great, except not so much for me. My hair is very long and I&#x27;m super sloppy when dyeing for this reason. So the second a piece of hair with dye on it touches a piece of hair that is still white, the color doesn&#x27;t spread, just the conditioning ingredients of the dye. And once any product is on your hair, the color won&#x27;t take. So basically, if you plop a bit of this onto a section of hair and try to rub it in everywhere, not all of your hair will take to the color. I obviously don&#x27;t do that, but it still makes it tricky doing it myself. I&#x27;ve used dark shades of Pravana, like blue and green, and I&#x27;ve had the same issue. Except since it is a lot darker, it&#x27;s not quite as problematic as using a very pastel shade since my hair will still take to the color (just not all the way). If you have short hair though, I feel like this would be extremely easy to use. But I&#x27;m just not a fan. I prefer using other brands that I can just dilute myself to get exactly the pastel color I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all. I processed the hair to a complete 9 and then used 09v to get it to a 10. This is how I have always used the pravana chromasilk colours. Well this time it did not work, and honestly I think the product was just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> it does not show up at all.... i tried it out several times, but NOPE!</li>
            <li> Colours was nice but very faint and I needed to use the whole tube and it only lasted 2 washes</li>
            <li> It suggests to lighten hair to a pair blonde or platinum. my hair is light yellow and i went ahead and tried it but it doesn&#x27;t really work. the color when it comes out in the tube is much much paler than the photo. it really conditioned my hair but not much in the way of coloring it. it tinted it slightly coral colored but it came out after one wash. i would return it but i dont even want to bother. i think i will try lightening my hair more and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> You really need to have your hair at 10 bleached, and even then it is sooo light that it is not worth the money in my eyes. I even went and a did it a second time thinking maybe twice would make it show better, but no.&lt;br /&gt; If you want just a touch of color this is great. Pravana Chromasilk products I have been using for years and it makes your hair feel healthier, I do believe it is one of the best to use on your hair in regards to harshness.</li>
            <li> Great color but will wash out in 2 shampoos. I wish they could do something about the longevity of the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached to almost a white blond and it barely showed up.  I&#x27;ll probably use it up, but I&#x27;ll definitely be leaving it on overnight to get some effect.</li>
            <li> I tried the lavender on bleached out highlights. It was very pale. You really need to mix in some other deeper color to make it pop. The pale lavender combined with the violet is a great in between color. Not sure what you could mix with the coral to deepen it. The pastels wash out really fast too. You do really need bleached out hair to get the best results for this brand of colors.</li>
            <li> I died the tips of my hair very light blonde (not white).&lt;br /&gt;The color was VERY subtle, a light peachy pink, but most of it washed out after the first shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;If I look very closely there are still tiny hints of pink, but I think I was looking for something a little more permanent.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will try dying my hair lighter and see if that works.</li>
            <li> Very faint shade of pink but quite lovely.</li>
            <li> Need to bleach your hair first, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work. I left it for 40 mins and it still washed off in a week or so (after shampooing 2-3 times). Otherwise, the color is looks like the picture and it smells nice, but it&#x27;s definitely very temporary.</li>
            <li> Amazing if your hair is light blonde and you want a perfect pastel coral-peach. I adore it.</li>
            <li> Great dye. My hair turned out perfect</li>
            <li> color is more like a salmon. obviously fades fast, which I was expecting.  I have white, bleached hair, and it it did not stick like the color shown, at all.. but it was fine.  I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try out Pravana&#x27;s Too Cute Coral, but as soon as I squeezed the product into the bowl, I knew it was going to be a major disappointment. And I was right. If you want a nice coral color I highly suggest going with manic panic in pretty flamingo. I&#x27;ve gotten great results with that one. Even ion color brights in rose, though fades very quickly, had more vivid color results than this crap</li>
            <li> too light, didn&#x27;t show well in my hair</li>
            <li> I really liked the color using only one tube. It is a pale pastel peachy pink. Just applied it straight from tube to hair. I&#x27;ve washed it twice &amp; color is still there. I left it on about an hour. To get the color in the picture,  I&#x27;d probably use two tubes and leave it on longer.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really take to my hair, I dye my hair often and wouldn&#x27;t  buy this again.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I recognize a lot of people were upset that it wasn&#x27;t as dark as they wanted, or it didn&#x27;t stay for as long as they had expected. But, for me, it was perfect. I wanted a soft peachy/coral &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; on my ombre, and it did exactly that.</li>
            <li> Your hair needs to be white for this to work.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing! I love it! The color has lasted a lone5time, for one. And it is very easy to get anywhere from a soft pink shade to a fantastic bright pink just by varying how long you leave the dye in your hair. The texture of the material is nice, like a lotion almost, and the smell is very nice. Soft, not harsh and &amp;#34;chemically.&amp;#34; I would recommend this dye to anyone trying to go pink! I mixed the color with Vivids Orange and also got spectacular results!</li>
            <li> Horrible color longevity. Didn&#x27;t wash hair for three days for all the color to bleed out when just wetting my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a professional product and requires not only a state license to purchase but also a company certification to use. Purchasing here means 1. You&#x27;re paying too much, 2. The product may be expired or counterfeit, 3. You don&#x27;t know how to use it and therefore get less than great results. I have this in my hair now and have had it for about 2 months. It needs to be applied on WHITE level 10, but not damaged, hair. That&#x27;s a very precise level of lightening. It needs to be washed in COLD water with sulfate free shampoo. Because it doesn&#x27;t oxidize it needs to be applied to hair with an open cuticle, which also means will fade quickly, but should last at least 4 weeks with proper care. There is nothing wrong with the color, just user error. Stick to manic panic if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. 4 stars because level 10 is a lot to ask of most hair types.</li>
            <li> Too Cute Coral is the worst color Pravana makes. It&#x27;s super pretty, but it washes out in two shampoos. Too bad, since nobody makes a comparable shade.</li>
            <li> I agree with M. Kammerer&#x27;s review - this product works really well if you know how to use it or have help from someone who does. It needs to be used on hair lightened to level 10 and on hair with an open cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was already lightened and dyed a dusty pink color 4 months ago and had about 2+ inches of root regrowth. My natural color is dark ash blonde, so I don&#x27;t have to process a lot to lighten. It&#x27;s cut in a chin-length bob, so it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of product either! I get it trimmed every 2 months or so to ditch split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a 4-step process to get this dreamy, pastel peachy-pink color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Soaked unwashed hair in pure, unrefined, organic coconut oil for about an hour to protect before bleaching (from the grocery store). Do not wash or rinse before applying bleach! The coconut oil will protect hair without affecting the bleaching process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Used manic panic flash lightening kit (30 vol. developer). Brushed onto root regrowth in sections. Once all roots were covered, I brushed remaining bleach on the rest of my hair to lift the previous pink color out. (I know this is a big no-no to re-bleach hair! I waited 4 months before re-bleaching and used the coconut oil mask to minimize damage.) The roots processed for about 30 minutes, then the ends for an additional 30, 60 minutes in total under a plastic shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Rinsed and shampooed using purple shimmer lights shampoo. Towel and air-dried until hair was totally dry, then brushed on Manic Panic Virgin Snow toner. Saturated hair with toner, processed another 60 min while wearing shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Rinsed toner out completely, towel and air-dried completely again. Finally! Brushed too cute coral onto hair from roots to ends in 2 inch sections and saturated hair with entire tube of color. At this point, I put on a shower cap, went to bed, and let the pastel dye process overnight (which was only about 5 hours, because I&#x27;m crazy and only slept from 2-7am).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I lied and there were really 5 steps to the process - in the morning I rinsed out the pravana color in cold water. AND, I&#x27;m using Bleach London Ros&amp;eacute; shampoo and conditioner (once every 3-4 days) to maintain a soft pink tint every time I wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may seem like a crazy, lengthy and involved process, but it you could always just go to the salon and let them take care of it :) My end result was beautiful, shimmery, pastel peachy-pink. I&#x27;ve used manic panic colors mixed with conditioner and Ion color brights before to get pastel and muted colors, but this is the best dye yet - super saturated pastel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Pictures look like different colors - just in different lighting, have not shampooed yet since dyeing.)rom 2-7am).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I lied and there were really 5 steps to the process - in the morning I rinsed out the pravana color in cold water.
