            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I have to use a lot more than I thought I would have to use</li>
            <li>Holy grail moisturizer, love it.</li>
            <li>my face doesnt get greasy, its lovely under makeup.</li>
            <li>It also has a lighter scent which I love.</li>
            <li>She says it works great in reducing the appearance of wrinkles and really makes her skin</li>
            <li>price is great, much cheaper than a retail store.</li>
            <li>Its not terrible, but it smells like a baby wipe.</li>
            <li>I wish it came unscented because then it would be my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love Olay.</li>
            <li>reviewers have mentioned they do not care for the fragrance, and while I&#x27;d prefer a more neutral scent, it isn&#x27;t overpowering or offsetting to the point</li>
            <li>do I think could be better?  </li>
            <li>As a moisturizer this is ok.  </li>
            <li>My skin immediately felt a bit more supple an hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Nice and and smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am able to put it on underneath my makeup with no issues at all.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy residue or cause more oil on my face.</li>
            <li>I love Olay.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I would need something more hydrating.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products and this is a must for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer...pretty pink color but works great.  </li>
            <li>A good all purpose lightweight everyday and night moisturizer,  at a great price!</li>
            <li>and this felt like it was sitting on top of the skin rather than moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Love Olay products, in lauding this one.</li>
            <li>Olay is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>The most refreshing face cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I prefer one with considerably more body.  </li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Smells great and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>LOVE THAT.&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES</li>

            <li>Love oil of Olay.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>I love Oil Of Olay products.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin relaxed and you do not feel oily any more.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;even better.</li>
            <li>The more i added the dryer my face became.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many, many years and your price beats everyone else.</li>
            <li>I like the cream much better....</li>
            <li>still use it and still love it......</li>
            <li>I order it many times...</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many types of creams and lotions so finding one I can use with no side effects is a miracle.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel lovely.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, my skin feels nice and smooth, and soothes it.</li>
            <li>latest review:  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a better moisturizer than this.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have as many wrinkles as mist women my age.</li>
            <li>i do not know much more than that.</li>
            <li>might not be something that happens to many people</li>
            <li>The scent is okay, it could be better.</li>
            <li>I am also allergic to most products causing a breakout.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li>You could spend a lot more on a moisturizer but why would you want to when this one works so well?</li>
            <li>Great item, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My makeup was spreading more evenly on my cheeks and nose, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps it smooth, glowing, and radiant!</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I always buy this cream and love Olay.</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture, I feel it moisturizing and it has a light baby powder smell.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it for both my hands and my face.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I like it, but I need more.  </li>
            <li>This cream contains the strongest, most overwhelming fragrance of any of the Olay products on the market today.  </li>
            <li>Most moisturizers leave my face feeling greasy and my skin looks shiny.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad I started using this product.</li>
            <li>very light and nice and not greasy, it absorbs nicely in the skin and feels soft and nice.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin soft and beautifully hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My very first week with this product was amazing.</li>
            <li>The price is excellent, however I find myself using a bit more than I would some of the other Olay night creams.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer for my face in our very dry weather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that perfect center</li>
            <li>Plus most importantly it isn&#x27;t greasy nor oily.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer,even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive but this product works great.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent and texture , I use it for over 5 years,</li>
            <li>I think this may be an okay light lotion for someone in their teens.</li>
            <li>Nice and fresh for the evenings after showers.</li>
            <li>I think that it is a good moisturizer, but I really don&#x27;t like the smell at all.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry sticky, it feels nice and smooth, and works great under makeup.</li>
            <li>However, Olay Active Hydrating Cream works wonderfully for me.  </li>
            <li>This Olay Active Hydrating Cream is great!  </li>
            <li>It is too strong and too chemically smelling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Olay&#x27;s a great brand that&#x27;s been around a long time, and I&#x27;m glad they offer an inexpensive moisturizer I can use without feeling like I&#x27;m wearing perfume.  </li>
            <li>It works and if you don&#x27;t have fragrance sensitivities it might be fine for you.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you want, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>Smells too strongly of powdery perfume to wear comfortably.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the product but could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li>it is Paraben free so that is a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this my face feels so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t just stay there</li>
            <li>It is light, non greasy and keeps my skin moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>like I said light cream.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my mother, who has oily skin &amp; often forgoes moisturizer &amp; even she said it was so light, it made no difference in how her skin felt.</li>
            <li>A light pleasing fragrance?</li>
            <li>and it keeps my face smooth all day.</li>
            <li>I like the light fragrance</li>
            <li>Always my favorite fresh smelling hydrating go-to cream.</li>
            <li>it also said oil free</li>
            <li>This made my skin feel great and provided enough moisture under my primer and makeup that i didn&#x27;t have any sort of drying or flaking (which can happen on my nose from time to time, no matter what I do to prevent it!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and moisture.</li>
            <li>Light and hydrating.</li>
            <li>I love the olay fresh effect dew over hydrating gel moisturizer</li>
            <li>I put that on during the day and my face feels great even after going outside.</li>
            <li>How about making it fragrance free?</li>
            <li>I use it at night time, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I dont expect this cream to fix wrinkles but for now its doing a good job and hydrating my face and leaving it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the beauty fluid, which is lighter and not as moisturizing (good for summer).</li>
            <li>Best of all, the fragrances is very light, I also have terrible Allergies and Asthma so picking products with light fragrances are always the best!</li>
            <li>Love the texture, light feel &amp; fast, easy absorption into my skin.</li>
            <li>Upon application, the smell is more distinctive, as it&#x27;s concentrated on your hands, and many people start by applying cream on and under their noses, where you&#x27;ll certainly notice the powdery fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this exact cream in stores in about a year.</li>
            <li>but I tend to put it on when I know I&#x27;m not going to be around people because it&#x27;s pretty overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Omg love this so much!</li>
            <li>I like the mild yet delightful smell of this - no strong perfume.  </li>
            <li>It is good for dry to normal skin and its good for under makeup.</li>
            <li>It hydrated my skin immediately and absorbed very quickly without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased to have it back, as great as ever, especially as sunny days are here again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s and still get carded more often than not, and I give ALL the credit for those momentary ego-boosts to Olay!</li>
            <li>It doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy like other products and the best part is it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>This was good except for the scent (only used it 3 days).</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, that I have it on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It really works and i love the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li>all good facial moisturizers, this is a non-comedogenic formula, which for those wondering what that means, won&#x27;t clog your pores.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t find a water based moisturizer that worked better</li>
            <li>but this cream is gentle and refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li>tried using 2 coats or a much thicker amount, like the size of a quarter &amp; still felt I needed a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>But good daily moisturizer</li>
            <li>Excellent item for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial hydrating cream &amp; haven&#x27;t found any until now.</li>
            <li>My routine is to use a good facial cleaner in the shower, followed by a retinol serum, then moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, or any kind of fragrance sensitivity whatsoever, stay away from this cream.</li>
            <li>and so far the results are pretty good.</li>
            <li>I  absolutely love this product and have used it for years, it absorbs quickly and moisturizes very well and is scented beauitfully.</li>
            <li>The other great part about this product is that it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I apply it after I get out of the shower, before putting on my makeup and it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t needed in my opinion but it isn&#x27;t cringe worthy as others describe.</li>
            <li>I prefer a thicker cream as I get older as my skin needs more moisture.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>Came quickly and works like a charm</li>
            <li>Sometimes best choices is not the most expensive.</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers from high end brands to CVS brands.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to someone with more normal skin.</li>
            <li>The Original moisturizer is light enough to use as a day cream, but I need a bit more for a night cream.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff for dry skin</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have very normal skin that isn&#x27;t easily irritated.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but not overwhelming to those of us who have sensitive noses and it feels amazing!  </li>
            <li>Still, I bought it again, and I&#x27;m happily using it everyday, just with some powder products to control the oil.</li>
            <li>My face was absolutely moisturized and it was smooth.</li>
            <li>Its light weight, and really works.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is indeed pretty sweet for us oily skinned gals.  </li>
            <li>trying to keep skin healthy early.</li>
            <li>I would describe the smell something like a grandmother&#x27;s perfume and a powder fresh scented pad.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Those things are available out there, but they cost much more money than this cream and the results are only temporary.  </li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the light scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell  like an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;  in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Leaves mt skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin to the point that I can&#x27;t use most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>thought this might be useful</li>
            <li>I can actually smile without my face cracking.</li>
            <li>It is economical and helps my complexion.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I think the item is a good moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved my other Olay products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I use this right after washing my face for the night and it has improved my skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs right into your skin.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant scent and it goes on somewhat thick.</li>
            <li>Generally, I put this on my face and just apply my favorite color lipstick to my lips.</li>
            <li>Generally, I put this on my face and just apply my favorite color lipstick to my lips</li>
            <li>Male perspective: looking for something light, non oily, and scent free.</li>
            <li>Smells good, and keeps my skin hydrated after cleansing with Dudu Osun Black Soap.</li>
            <li>It does have a light scent, but it&#x27;s not offensive and didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much for developing this product for combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I am oily skin, I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I do like this product and it hydrates good, but it&#x27;s a little greasy.</li>
            <li>Smells funny.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like baby rash ointment.</li>
            <li>It actually absorbs better, feels better and works better (in my opinion) r than some of the more expensive options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After spending thousands of dollars on temporary fixes, I&#x27;ve come home to my first skin cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft a light smell</li>
            <li>The price is better than all the local stores around here as well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Not expensive</li>
            <li>I use this during the winter months when my facial skin needs more moisture.</li>
            <li>Better than the fluid moisturiser.</li>
            <li>also smells funny and</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I was paying $30 a jar from Merle Norman for the exact same outcome, I like this</li>
            <li>My favorite facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use another brand.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It does have sort of a grandma-y, baby powder scent at first</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love these simple Olay hydrating products.</li>
            <li>&amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s thick and nice quality, but it still takes a good amount to get proper coverage</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin that breaks out with harsh products, but Olay has helped keep my face soft, smooth, and happy through the years.</li>
            <li>Not as creamy as other olay night creams, but effective.</li>
            <li>This Olay cream was smaller than I expected, and would be great for a travel size for a makeup bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s far too light a cream to do much of anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>It may be enough for someone who has very oily skin, but for my combination skin, I need a bit more.</li>
            <li>and it is a pretty large container</li>
            <li>The smell does wear off a few minutes after application, but while in the jar it&#x27;s very overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I am a long time user and plan to use for many years to come.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using this product for quite a long time and swears by it to be top quality.</li>
            <li>This is non greasy and sweet smelling cream for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on to make my face super soft and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel all oily.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it for all skin types (my skin is on the dry side).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t foresee the good sized tub lasting very long.</li>
            <li>Might be fine for younger skin.</li>
            <li>This is a classic!  </li>
            <li>The only thing I like about it is that it is light and readily absorbs into your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is very hydrating to your face and seems to replenish the mositure that is depleted during the day.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I find it to be non-greasy and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Works well at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt make me shine and absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li>MY MOM REALLY LIKES THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Really like the product.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>Using only a small amount per application, this cream does a nice job of keeping my face from drying out, yet it prevents my face from becoming overly oily towards the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a person at my age wants to have on them.</li>
            <li>Very comforting.  </li>
            <li>This cream works really well, by hydrating without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>I really regret wasing my money on this bull.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, however I tolerate it.</li>
            <li>Bought because of brand name and so much cheaper than any of Olay&#x27;s newer products.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>I am the person will really sentive skin.  </li>
            <li>very hydrating.</li>
            <li>It is very pungent.</li>
            <li>the smell is absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that my skin will get very oily, with breakouts, if I don&#x27;t moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why it needs so much perfume for a face lotion.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the smell of this cream other than that it probably works ok.  </li>
            <li>When I used to put on other moisturizers it would leave my face feeing sticky and just sitting on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other reviews I have seen I actually love the smell.  </li>
            <li>If you can get past that, you will love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay&#x27;s Original Facial Moisturizer for a month now.  </li>
            <li>i really, really like this cream and the classic scent.</li>
            <li>Slight old lady smell but works nicely</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also full of chemicals and carcinogens such as petrolatum.  </li>
            <li>when I opened it the cream is only 2/3 bottle full, and it looks like someone used it before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine started to break down and got a top layer of like water/oil on it.</li>
            <li>I noticed my cheeks and nose were dry and my makeup wasn&#x27;t going on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>Not only does the foundation go further, it spreads more evenly</li>
            <li>Most people think that I am 10 years younger than I actually am.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a moisturizer for older women</li>
            <li>I particularly wear this under my makeup when I&#x27;m wearing in all in one makeup that already has an SPF.  </li>
            <li>Still a classic.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea and this definitely doesn&#x27;t help it, and in fact creates a bit of a burning sensation, which probably comes from the scent additive.</li>
            <li>Very soft; very soothing..</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for Oily/Combination skin and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone with combination oily/dry skin.</li>
            <li>This one is a winner, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would prefer something a little cleaner or, even better, scentless.</li>
            <li>I keep the little pots of it stashed all over because it really is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>like I don&#x27;t it will go bad - best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li>Straight up, it smells like old ladies perfume.</li>
            <li>Makes skin baby soft and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>The smell is not so much overpowering, just irritatingly old school.</li>
            <li>I use a prescription retinoid, and when combined with the dryer winter air, I normally get a lot of flaking and peeling in the winter.</li>
            <li>and I am able to apply make up within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>so NORMALLY, I use Korean products for my skin.</li>
            <li>skin feels actually hydrated (hard to say, living in a desert), the texture is creamy, and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>it may work fine for other people but</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and lasts all day/night long.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Oil Of Olay since I was a young Lady and it is very hard to find this product stocked in stores.</li>
            <li>Light enough for summer but hard-working enough for the winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s, I stay out of the sun, I avoid harsh soaps on my face, and I have naturally oily skin, but I&#x27;m getting older and the weather takes more of a toll on my skin than a decade ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a super strong smell</li>
            <li>Considering I HATE using anything in my face except for my benzoyl peroxide cream for the sole reason it soaks in quickly, this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Makes your face very soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really have any ingredients that would provide long term benefits such as vitamins but hydrated skin is younger skin and will age better.  </li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive</li>
            <li>Sadly, I&#x27;ve had to switch to a more costly lotion that has more organic ingredients, and my eyes are back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, so I highly recommend it to people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>intend to continue using this cream, and will likely purchase more in the future, which I might have to do since my wife has essentially stolen it from me.ative to prevent me from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>intend to continue using this cream, and will likely purchase more in the future, which I might have to do since my wife has essentially stolen it from me.</li>
            <li>(I use one with spf during the day) and my skin has gotten noticeably softer and smoother, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any more oil than usual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mediocre at best, the scent is too fake, powdery, and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I believe in quality for a cream on my face, it&#x27;ll be much worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>I smell like an old person!  </li>
            <li>I just put this on for 30 mintues and its so soft and not oily at all also it&#x27;s not thick.</li>
            <li>Really keeps the face moist and  healthy but its very small in size.</li>
            <li>I still have moisturizers from other companies that cost quite a bit more than this jar does, and I honestly do not feel there&#x27;s a $15.00 benefit to the higher priced creams, other than a more musky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a pretty powerful smell of baby powder (it actually smells very similar and even looks the same as Johnson and Johnson baby lotion)</li>
            <li>I sometimes have to be careful of such products because I will have a breakout from use, but this has been fine so far after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It is soft and creamy, and does not leave a greasy feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have had this for nearly a week</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Save you money and use a natural mosturizer that&#x27;s not going to give you cancer.</li>
            <li>Always works, keeps me looking young.</li>
            <li>Though I still look my age, this keeps my face hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is definitely loud and might not be agreeable to everyone.</li>
            <li>No heavy foundation is required.  </li>
            <li>No heavy smells -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 40 and need to really care for my skin and hydration is the key.</li>
            <li>Soothing cream for sensitive skin?  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of old people..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of face lotions but none of them work nearly as well as this Olay one.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using it, even if I haven&#x27;t washed my face before hand.</li>
            <li>Not for people sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any issue with breaking out.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but I noticed after it was on my skin for a few minutes the scent sort of changed, becoming enjoyable and pretty faint</li>
            <li>Makes skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>Never leaves a &#x27;film&#x27; &amp; allows me use make up on directly after.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy feel but soft natural skin.</li>
            <li>This cream makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer for years and it makes my skin soft and youthful.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and my face is still soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>so if that&#x27;s a concern to people sensitive to scents, this one might be strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that my face feels soft</li>
            <li>They are easily absorbed and the smell is fresh and delicate.</li>
            <li>As good as the expensive creams.</li>
            <li>Got rid of the dry skin flakes after my first use.</li>
            <li>OIl of Olay&#x27;s Active Hydrating Original Facial Cream keeps your face feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I even use it only hands every once in a while if they are particularly chapped.  </li>
            <li>Years past, the original pink Active Hydrating Lotion had more of a soft and powdery scent.  </li>
            <li>The cream is hydrating, not a strong aroma and in a user friendly container.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so smooth all day without a sticky residue or a heavy feeling!</li>
            <li>This is first time I bought it online.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was on time and product came as expected.</li>
            <li>I have hard large bumps on my right  cheek</li>
            <li>I woke up with 5 new pimples the next day.  </li>
            <li>This cream really helps with the dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li>Ive noticed my laugh lines have softened and are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>unless u use it at least twice a day every day and never miss a day the results dont last more then a couple hours.</li>
            <li>This is the only hydrating cream to actually work and NOT cause me to break out or look shiny (very sensitive/dry/oily</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve developed some dry patches</li>
            <li>It is still my favorite, although I have tried all the expensive face creams, I really prefer this one.</li>
            <li>Really what gives this product such a low score is the smell.</li>
            <li>And as I mentioned above, while a little bit goes a long way, I&#x27;ve accidentally scooped more than I intended, and my face still didn&#x27;t feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Olay Original Moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve found that I still have 2 small patches of dryness, caused by the retinol.  </li>
            <li>I only use a little bit on my dry areas, so I use it more as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I absolutely will be using this product for a long time!!</li>
            <li>This has a very perfumey smell, and though some of the other Olay products I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin, this one did.</li>
            <li>Waste of money, but cheap so no major loss.</li>
            <li>This, however, smells similar to an older woman&#x27;s spoiled perfume, mixed with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 25 year old female with normal/combination skin.  </li>
            <li>but I would prefer that to looking blotchy with regular foundations (or a crackly old lady with Revlon Colorstay).  </li>
            <li>and I get rashes if I&#x27;m not careful with what I put on it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bare minimum moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not careful, I will still break out like a teenager, but with the added bonus of a bit of dryness on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I also love how lightweight it is and isn&#x27;t irritating to my skin being</li>
            <li>My significant other swears by this; he will not use any other day time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A little goes a LONG way, barely need a dab on your finger for the full face and neck.</li>
            <li>This is also very affordable compared to other products on the market.</li>
            <li>This is a thick, rich cream.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry part of the country, and it dries my skin to the point that it starts to hurt.</li>
            <li>I usually purchase only unscented body care products but the scent in Olay diminished quickly after applying it, so not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li>However I have very dry skin that lacks moisture and natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I have never broken out from using the Olay Active Hydrating Cream (and I breakout frequently from other moisturizers!)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the fact that it does not have spf ingredients that cause my eyes to tear.</li>

            <li> my face doesnt get greasy, its lovely under makeup.</li>
            <li> It also has a lighter scent which I love.</li>
            <li> She says it works great in reducing the appearance of wrinkles and really makes her skin</li>
            <li> price is great, much cheaper than a retail store.</li>
            <li> Its not terrible, but it smells like a baby wipe.</li>
            <li> I wish it came unscented because then it would be my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love Olay.</li>
            <li> reviewers have mentioned they do not care for the fragrance, and while I&#x27;d prefer a more neutral scent, it isn&#x27;t overpowering or offsetting to the point</li>
            <li> do I think could be better?  </li>
            <li> As a moisturizer this is ok.  </li>

            <li> It does not leave a greasy residue or cause more oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I love Olay.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I would need something more hydrating.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and this is a must for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer...pretty pink color but works great.  </li>
            <li> A good all purpose lightweight everyday and night moisturizer,  at a great price!</li>
            <li> and this felt like it was sitting on top of the skin rather than moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love Olay products, in lauding this one.</li>
            <li> Olay is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I Love it.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> The most refreshing face cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I prefer one with considerably more body.  </li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>

            <li> Smells great and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> LOVE THAT.&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES</li>

            <li> I love Oil Of Olay products.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin relaxed and you do not feel oily any more.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;even better.</li>
            <li> The more i added the dryer my face became.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many, many years and your price beats everyone else.</li>
            <li> I like the cream much better....</li>
            <li> still use it and still love it......</li>
            <li> I order it many times...</li>
            <li> love this</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many types of creams and lotions so finding one I can use with no side effects is a miracle.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel lovely.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, my skin feels nice and smooth, and soothes it.</li>
            <li> latest review:  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find a better moisturizer than this.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have as many wrinkles as mist women my age.</li>
            <li> i do not know much more than that.</li>
            <li> might not be something that happens to many people</li>
            <li> The scent is okay, it could be better.</li>
            <li> I am also allergic to most products causing a breakout.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li> You could spend a lot more on a moisturizer but why would you want to when this one works so well?</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My makeup was spreading more evenly on my cheeks and nose, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps it smooth, glowing, and radiant!</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I always buy this cream and love Olay.</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture, I feel it moisturizing and it has a light baby powder smell.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it for both my hands and my face.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I like it, but I need more.  </li>
            <li> This cream contains the strongest, most overwhelming fragrance of any of the Olay products on the market today.  </li>
            <li> Most moisturizers leave my face feeling greasy and my skin looks shiny.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m glad I started using this product.</li>
            <li> very light and nice and not greasy, it absorbs nicely in the skin and feels soft and nice.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin soft and beautifully hydrated.  </li>
            <li> My very first week with this product was amazing.</li>
            <li> The price is excellent, however I find myself using a bit more than I would some of the other Olay night creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer for my face in our very dry weather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that perfect center</li>
            <li> Plus most importantly it isn&#x27;t greasy nor oily.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer,even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive but this product works great.</li>
            <li> I love the light scent and texture , I use it for over 5 years,</li>
            <li> I think this may be an okay light lotion for someone in their teens.</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh for the evenings after showers.</li>
            <li> I think that it is a good moisturizer, but I really don&#x27;t like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry sticky, it feels nice and smooth, and works great under makeup.</li>
            <li> However, Olay Active Hydrating Cream works wonderfully for me.  </li>
            <li> This Olay Active Hydrating Cream is great!  </li>
            <li> It is too strong and too chemically smelling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Olay&#x27;s a great brand that&#x27;s been around a long time, and I&#x27;m glad they offer an inexpensive moisturizer I can use without feeling like I&#x27;m wearing perfume.  </li>
            <li> It works and if you don&#x27;t have fragrance sensitivities it might be fine for you.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s what you want, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> Smells too strongly of powdery perfume to wear comfortably.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the product but could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li> it is Paraben free so that is a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this my face feels so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t just stay there</li>
            <li> It is light, non greasy and keeps my skin moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> like I said light cream.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my mother, who has oily skin &amp; often forgoes moisturizer &amp; even she said it was so light, it made no difference in how her skin felt.</li>
            <li> A light pleasing fragrance?</li>
            <li> and it keeps my face smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I like the light fragrance</li>
            <li> Always my favorite fresh smelling hydrating go-to cream.</li>
            <li> it also said oil free</li>
            <li> This made my skin feel great and provided enough moisture under my primer and makeup that i didn&#x27;t have any sort of drying or flaking (which can happen on my nose from time to time, no matter what I do to prevent it!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and moisture.</li>
            <li> Light and hydrating.</li>
            <li> I love the olay fresh effect dew over hydrating gel moisturizer</li>
            <li> I put that on during the day and my face feels great even after going outside.</li>
            <li> How about making it fragrance free?</li>
            <li> I use it at night time, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I dont expect this cream to fix wrinkles but for now its doing a good job and hydrating my face and leaving it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the beauty fluid, which is lighter and not as moisturizing (good for summer).</li>
            <li> Best of all, the fragrances is very light, I also have terrible Allergies and Asthma so picking products with light fragrances are always the best!</li>
            <li> Love the texture, light feel &amp; fast, easy absorption into my skin.</li>
            <li> Upon application, the smell is more distinctive, as it&#x27;s concentrated on your hands, and many people start by applying cream on and under their noses, where you&#x27;ll certainly notice the powdery fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this exact cream in stores in about a year.</li>
            <li> but I tend to put it on when I know I&#x27;m not going to be around people because it&#x27;s pretty overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Omg love this so much!</li>
            <li> I like the mild yet delightful smell of this - no strong perfume.  </li>
            <li> It is good for dry to normal skin and its good for under makeup.</li>
            <li> It hydrated my skin immediately and absorbed very quickly without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased to have it back, as great as ever, especially as sunny days are here again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and still get carded more often than not, and I give ALL the credit for those momentary ego-boosts to Olay!</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy like other products and the best part is it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> This was good except for the scent (only used it 3 days).</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, that I have it on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It really works and i love the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> all good facial moisturizers, this is a non-comedogenic formula, which for those wondering what that means, won&#x27;t clog your pores.  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t find a water based moisturizer that worked better</li>
            <li> but this cream is gentle and refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li> tried using 2 coats or a much thicker amount, like the size of a quarter &amp; still felt I needed a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> But good daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> Excellent item for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> Love it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial hydrating cream &amp; haven&#x27;t found any until now.</li>
            <li> My routine is to use a good facial cleaner in the shower, followed by a retinol serum, then moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, or any kind of fragrance sensitivity whatsoever, stay away from this cream.</li>
            <li> and so far the results are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I  absolutely love this product and have used it for years, it absorbs quickly and moisturizes very well and is scented beauitfully.</li>
            <li> The other great part about this product is that it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I apply it after I get out of the shower, before putting on my makeup and it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t needed in my opinion but it isn&#x27;t cringe worthy as others describe.</li>
            <li> I prefer a thicker cream as I get older as my skin needs more moisture.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works like a charm</li>
            <li> Sometimes best choices is not the most expensive.</li>
            <li> and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers from high end brands to CVS brands.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to someone with more normal skin.</li>
            <li> The Original moisturizer is light enough to use as a day cream, but I need a bit more for a night cream.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff for dry skin</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have very normal skin that isn&#x27;t easily irritated.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but not overwhelming to those of us who have sensitive noses and it feels amazing!  </li>
            <li> Still, I bought it again, and I&#x27;m happily using it everyday, just with some powder products to control the oil.</li>
            <li> My face was absolutely moisturized and it was smooth.</li>
            <li> Its light weight, and really works.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is indeed pretty sweet for us oily skinned gals.  </li>
            <li> trying to keep skin healthy early.</li>
            <li> I would describe the smell something like a grandmother&#x27;s perfume and a powder fresh scented pad.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Those things are available out there, but they cost much more money than this cream and the results are only temporary.  </li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the light scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell  like an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;  in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Leaves mt skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin to the point that I can&#x27;t use most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> thought this might be useful</li>
            <li> I can actually smile without my face cracking.</li>
            <li> It is economical and helps my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I think the item is a good moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved my other Olay products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this right after washing my face for the night and it has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs right into your skin.</li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasant scent and it goes on somewhat thick.</li>
            <li> Generally, I put this on my face and just apply my favorite color lipstick to my lips.</li>
            <li> Generally, I put this on my face and just apply my favorite color lipstick to my lips</li>
            <li> Male perspective: looking for something light, non oily, and scent free.</li>
            <li> Smells good, and keeps my skin hydrated after cleansing with Dudu Osun Black Soap.</li>
            <li> It does have a light scent, but it&#x27;s not offensive and didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much for developing this product for combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I am oily skin, I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it hydrates good, but it&#x27;s a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells funny.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like baby rash ointment.</li>
            <li> It actually absorbs better, feels better and works better (in my opinion) r than some of the more expensive options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After spending thousands of dollars on temporary fixes, I&#x27;ve come home to my first skin cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft a light smell</li>
            <li> The price is better than all the local stores around here as well.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Not expensive</li>
            <li> I use this during the winter months when my facial skin needs more moisture.</li>
            <li> Better than the fluid moisturiser.</li>
            <li> also smells funny and</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I was paying $30 a jar from Merle Norman for the exact same outcome, I like this</li>
            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use another brand.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It does have sort of a grandma-y, baby powder scent at first</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love these simple Olay hydrating products.</li>
            <li> &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and nice quality, but it still takes a good amount to get proper coverage</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin that breaks out with harsh products, but Olay has helped keep my face soft, smooth, and happy through the years.</li>
            <li> Not as creamy as other olay night creams, but effective.</li>
            <li> This Olay cream was smaller than I expected, and would be great for a travel size for a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s far too light a cream to do much of anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> It may be enough for someone who has very oily skin, but for my combination skin, I need a bit more.</li>
            <li> and it is a pretty large container</li>
            <li> The smell does wear off a few minutes after application, but while in the jar it&#x27;s very overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user and plan to use for many years to come.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for quite a long time and swears by it to be top quality.</li>
            <li> This is non greasy and sweet smelling cream for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on to make my face super soft and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel all oily.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it for all skin types (my skin is on the dry side).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t foresee the good sized tub lasting very long.</li>
            <li> Might be fine for younger skin.</li>
            <li> This is a classic!  </li>
            <li> The only thing I like about it is that it is light and readily absorbs into your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is very hydrating to your face and seems to replenish the mositure that is depleted during the day.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I find it to be non-greasy and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Works well at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt make me shine and absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li> MY MOM REALLY LIKES THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Really like the product.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> Using only a small amount per application, this cream does a nice job of keeping my face from drying out, yet it prevents my face from becoming overly oily towards the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a person at my age wants to have on them.</li>
            <li> Very comforting.  </li>
            <li> This cream works really well, by hydrating without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> I really regret wasing my money on this bull.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, however I tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Bought because of brand name and so much cheaper than any of Olay&#x27;s newer products.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> I am the person will really sentive skin.  </li>
            <li> very hydrating.</li>
            <li> It is very pungent.</li>
            <li> the smell is absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that my skin will get very oily, with breakouts, if I don&#x27;t moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it needs so much perfume for a face lotion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell of this cream other than that it probably works ok.  </li>
            <li> When I used to put on other moisturizers it would leave my face feeing sticky and just sitting on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other reviews I have seen I actually love the smell.  </li>
            <li> If you can get past that, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay&#x27;s Original Facial Moisturizer for a month now.  </li>
            <li> i really, really like this cream and the classic scent.</li>
            <li> Slight old lady smell but works nicely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also full of chemicals and carcinogens such as petrolatum.  </li>
            <li> when I opened it the cream is only 2/3 bottle full, and it looks like someone used it before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine started to break down and got a top layer of like water/oil on it.</li>
            <li> I noticed my cheeks and nose were dry and my makeup wasn&#x27;t going on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Not only does the foundation go further, it spreads more evenly</li>
            <li> Most people think that I am 10 years younger than I actually am.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a moisturizer for older women</li>
            <li> I particularly wear this under my makeup when I&#x27;m wearing in all in one makeup that already has an SPF.  </li>
            <li> Still a classic.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea and this definitely doesn&#x27;t help it, and in fact creates a bit of a burning sensation, which probably comes from the scent additive.</li>
            <li> Very soft; very soothing..</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for Oily/Combination skin and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone with combination oily/dry skin.</li>
            <li> This one is a winner, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would prefer something a little cleaner or, even better, scentless.</li>
            <li> I keep the little pots of it stashed all over because it really is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> like I don&#x27;t it will go bad - best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li> Straight up, it smells like old ladies perfume.</li>
            <li> Makes skin baby soft and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> The smell is not so much overpowering, just irritatingly old school.</li>
            <li> I use a prescription retinoid, and when combined with the dryer winter air, I normally get a lot of flaking and peeling in the winter.</li>
            <li> and I am able to apply make up within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> so NORMALLY, I use Korean products for my skin.</li>
            <li> skin feels actually hydrated (hard to say, living in a desert), the texture is creamy, and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> it may work fine for other people but</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and lasts all day/night long.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Oil Of Olay since I was a young Lady and it is very hard to find this product stocked in stores.</li>
            <li> Light enough for summer but hard-working enough for the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s, I stay out of the sun, I avoid harsh soaps on my face, and I have naturally oily skin, but I&#x27;m getting older and the weather takes more of a toll on my skin than a decade ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super strong smell</li>
            <li> Considering I HATE using anything in my face except for my benzoyl peroxide cream for the sole reason it soaks in quickly, this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Makes your face very soft.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling very soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really have any ingredients that would provide long term benefits such as vitamins but hydrated skin is younger skin and will age better.  </li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ve had to switch to a more costly lotion that has more organic ingredients, and my eyes are back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , so I highly recommend it to people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> intend to continue using this cream, and will likely purchase more in the future, which I might have to do since my wife has essentially stolen it from me.ative to prevent me from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> intend to continue using this cream, and will likely purchase more in the future, which I might have to do since my wife has essentially stolen it from me.</li>
            <li> (I use one with spf during the day) and my skin has gotten noticeably softer and smoother, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any more oil than usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mediocre at best, the scent is too fake, powdery, and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I believe in quality for a cream on my face, it&#x27;ll be much worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> I smell like an old person!  </li>
            <li> I just put this on for 30 mintues and its so soft and not oily at all also it&#x27;s not thick.</li>
            <li> Really keeps the face moist and  healthy but its very small in size.</li>
            <li> I still have moisturizers from other companies that cost quite a bit more than this jar does, and I honestly do not feel there&#x27;s a $15.00 benefit to the higher priced creams, other than a more musky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a pretty powerful smell of baby powder (it actually smells very similar and even looks the same as Johnson and Johnson baby lotion)</li>
            <li> I sometimes have to be careful of such products because I will have a breakout from use, but this has been fine so far after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is soft and creamy, and does not leave a greasy feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for nearly a week</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Save you money and use a natural mosturizer that&#x27;s not going to give you cancer.</li>
            <li> Always works, keeps me looking young.</li>
            <li> Though I still look my age, this keeps my face hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely loud and might not be agreeable to everyone.</li>
            <li> No heavy foundation is required.  </li>
            <li> No heavy smells -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 40 and need to really care for my skin and hydration is the key.</li>
            <li> Soothing cream for sensitive skin?  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of old people..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of face lotions but none of them work nearly as well as this Olay one.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using it, even if I haven&#x27;t washed my face before hand.</li>
            <li> Not for people sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any issue with breaking out.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but I noticed after it was on my skin for a few minutes the scent sort of changed, becoming enjoyable and pretty faint</li>
            <li> Makes skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> Never leaves a &#x27;film&#x27; &amp; allows me use make up on directly after.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy feel but soft natural skin.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years and it makes my skin soft and youthful.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and my face is still soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> so if that&#x27;s a concern to people sensitive to scents, this one might be strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that my face feels soft</li>
            <li> They are easily absorbed and the smell is fresh and delicate.</li>
            <li> As good as the expensive creams.</li>
            <li> Got rid of the dry skin flakes after my first use.</li>
            <li> OIl of Olay&#x27;s Active Hydrating Original Facial Cream keeps your face feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I even use it only hands every once in a while if they are particularly chapped.  </li>
            <li> Years past, the original pink Active Hydrating Lotion had more of a soft and powdery scent.  </li>
            <li> The cream is hydrating, not a strong aroma and in a user friendly container.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling so smooth all day without a sticky residue or a heavy feeling!</li>
            <li> This is first time I bought it online.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was on time and product came as expected.</li>
            <li> I have hard large bumps on my right  cheek</li>
            <li> I woke up with 5 new pimples the next day.  </li>
            <li> This cream really helps with the dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed my laugh lines have softened and are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> unless u use it at least twice a day every day and never miss a day the results dont last more then a couple hours.</li>
            <li> This is the only hydrating cream to actually work and NOT cause me to break out or look shiny (very sensitive/dry/oily</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve developed some dry patches</li>
            <li> It is still my favorite, although I have tried all the expensive face creams, I really prefer this one.</li>
            <li> Really what gives this product such a low score is the smell.</li>
            <li> And as I mentioned above, while a little bit goes a long way, I&#x27;ve accidentally scooped more than I intended, and my face still didn&#x27;t feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the Olay Original Moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve found that I still have 2 small patches of dryness, caused by the retinol.  </li>
            <li> I only use a little bit on my dry areas, so I use it more as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I absolutely will be using this product for a long time!!</li>
            <li> This has a very perfumey smell, and though some of the other Olay products I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin, this one did.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, but cheap so no major loss.</li>
            <li> This, however, smells similar to an older woman&#x27;s spoiled perfume, mixed with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old female with normal/combination skin.  </li>
            <li> but I would prefer that to looking blotchy with regular foundations (or a crackly old lady with Revlon Colorstay).  </li>
            <li> and I get rashes if I&#x27;m not careful with what I put on it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bare minimum moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not careful, I will still break out like a teenager, but with the added bonus of a bit of dryness on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I also love how lightweight it is and isn&#x27;t irritating to my skin being</li>
            <li> My significant other swears by this; he will not use any other day time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way, barely need a dab on your finger for the full face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is also very affordable compared to other products on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, rich cream.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry part of the country, and it dries my skin to the point that it starts to hurt.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase only unscented body care products but the scent in Olay diminished quickly after applying it, so not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> However I have very dry skin that lacks moisture and natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I have never broken out from using the Olay Active Hydrating Cream (and I breakout frequently from other moisturizers!)</li>
            <li> I live in WV, where the wind over the mountains quickly drys the air; during the winter, it&#x27;s not uncommon to have single digit humidity.  </li>
            <li> Evident why it is so much less expensive than the newer (non-original) formulas (advanced, anti-aging, etc.)</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing, very creamy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much for this to work, a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> Works well for occasional facial dry skin, I do not use it daily.</li>
            <li> It feels less creamy and definitely does not moisturize as well as the old version.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s real Olay ????</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, so the product should last a long time.</li>
            <li> 26 y/o female with combo oily and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on and it instantly takes away the dry areas.</li>
            <li> I put it on and it instantly takes away the dry areas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will last me very long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and during the winter my facial skin just feels rough and dry.</li>
            <li> and since I only use I tiny bit it&#x27;ll last maybe half a year for me.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my face especially in the colder/drier months.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and use the Olay Active Hydrating Cream every day.</li>
            <li> Overall and average facial cream.</li>
            <li> A definite buy for sensitive skin individuals during the harsh winter months!</li>
            <li> Even has the same pink color.</li>
            <li> my grandma used this every nite before bed for as long as I can remember&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit, so I am hopeful that this batch will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> Not only did it help hydrate my skin it also provided an unmatchable quality that you don&#x27;t get in other brands.</li>
            <li> She says: &amp;#34;The lotion feels like what I would expect from using Olay&#x27;s other facial creams but</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help my dry face.</li>
            <li> my skins so dry makeup curdles on my skin and there are places on my face that feel like the bottom of your foot after uve worn flip flops for weeks.</li>
            <li> You may be wondering how skin can be both dry and oily...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and well in NY</li>
            <li> The product says hydrating, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl for my slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li> Relief from dry skin?</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry.</li>
            <li> Use the more expensive creams at home and stash this one in your bag for all year round comfort.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be a bit on the heavy side of facial moisturizers, and it kind of is so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and have always had oily skin that is somehow still dry and rough in parts.</li>
            <li> well unfortunately for my face it left it really oily and greasy looking! ..</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and decided to try it again when my face got very dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to have very very dry flaky skin and olay works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years, but in my mid 60s am finding I need something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I missed the coupon, which is occasionally offered, and if you subscribe you can save a little money.</li>
            <li> I use as little as possible and just barley cover my face and slather it on my neck.</li>
            <li> Works great but the smell is overbearing and nasty</li>
            <li> but i really do not have the funds</li>
            <li> Be careful around your eyes if  you try the SPF products.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, my skin was noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> I feel like the formula is different from a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This cream took all my dry spots away on my face!!</li>
            <li> It provides my face and hands with the moisture required to keep the skin subtle and soft.  </li>
            <li> you only apply a little bit and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so when I get down half way down to the second jar</li>
            <li> There is no oily residue like some of the other face creams that I have used.</li>
            <li> it is cheaper than the other cream (</li>
            <li> and I only have to use a small amount that lasts.</li>
            <li> During the winter months when I get particularly dry around my mouth and chin, I put a small amount (a little bigger than a pea size) on the affected areas once a day.  </li>
            <li> I like the Olay Active Hydrating Cream.</li>
            <li> As I approach my mid 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve found it has change to sensitive, troubled, combination skin.  </li>
            <li> It brightens up my face and gets rid of my &amp;#34;I will kill anyone who comes near me&amp;#34; morning face, which is a very hard thing to do.</li>
            <li> The big surprise was that after a few weeks I noticed a few wrinkles were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> but I think something not right..</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but i usually don&#x27;t have breakout problems since my skin is not sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not sure if going out in the sun and being out there too long had anything to do with it</li>
            <li> Olay has never let me down.  </li>
            <li> I bought the spf all day moisturizer to use while I am in the sun but other than that this will be what&#x27;s on my face all day!</li>
            <li> It has a slight fragrance which bothers me, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have no breakouts and there is a slight odor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very small container, so will not go far for your hard earned dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also helps to take away the smears of mascara when I mess up.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t buy this in the store because its so expensive</li>
            <li> I usually avoid any creams as I never really have breakouts on my face until I use a cream.</li>
            <li> Yay for no more dry skin!!</li>
            <li> But, since I use a small amount, it&#x27;s not enough of a negative to prevent me from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hesitate to describe it this way, but it&#x27;s a little old-fashioned.</li>
            <li> I gag a little every time I smell it, but I&#x27;ve never been a fan of rose-scented lotions or perfumes.</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy, oily, or greasy.  </li>
            <li> This cream provides moisture to my skin without heavy build up.  </li>
            <li> his cream provides moisture to my skin without heavy build up.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy day cream.  </li>
            <li> but Dried my face out instead of moisturizing .</li>
            <li> I was surprised at olay.a lousy cream</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer even after a few hours after application.</li>
            <li> then she gave me a bar of fatty soap for forty dollars.</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t like to waste, I&#x27;m using it here</li>
            <li> This cream is my fave, all year round.  </li>
            <li> My face has always been sensitive, troubled, and oily.  </li>
            <li> I put some of this cream on my hands to test it, and even after washing my hands a few times, the scent still lingered on my skin, and in my nose.  </li>
            <li> I use just a few tiny dots on a damp face and it spreads thin and soaks in.</li>
            <li> Wow, it came in all smeling  very bad, very old!&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Has a very strange and unpleasant odor to it, smells like a mix of an old lady&#x27;s perfume and urine.</li>
            <li> However, in my experience of using a small amount and rubbing the cream into my face and neck, the scent is negligible, and much less offensive than some of the after shave balms</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to the other reviews that complained about the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making me break out like crazy, which is not something that normally happens in winter.</li>
            <li> Overall nothing bad to say about it, will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> While the moisturizer itself works very well and leaves my skin feeling soft and not looking too oily, it smells absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> very bad strong .and</li>
            <li> Ran out of my usual face cream and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> Could not get past the smell and passed it on to a family member to try.</li>
            <li> Smells weird and not enough lotion for me</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would purchase it again just because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Could not get past the smell of this cream.  </li>
            <li> But I can not order it no more.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> Not sure If I would recommend this product yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s stress</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Olay was thinking when they came up with the fragrance for this item, but I have a suggestion.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it every night and in the morning after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I started applying it twice a day in very small amounts - no more than a little bit on my fingertip.</li>
            <li> I see the small lines in my face slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a weird dry skin phase and omgggggg</li>
            <li> The product is fine,  but the odor is horrible!  </li>
            <li> In fact I hardly have any at all.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes hard to find in stores because OLAY is promoting newer products.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer works so well on my very dry skin and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.  </li>
            <li> I just wait at least 15 minutes in between.</li>
            <li> Actually has a cold cream quality to it.</li>
            <li> I need to moisturize in winter, but am not thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> the winters are pretty brutal....</li>
            <li> Little disappointed especially because I bought a 2pack</li>
            <li> Very heavily perfumed scent!</li>
            <li> Even expensive designer moisturizer doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nostalgic for me as it smells like the &amp;#34;oil of olay beauty liquid&amp;#34; I remember from my childhood.</li>
            <li> I dont need expensive face products when I can get Olay</li>
            <li> Works as well as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed - the smell is not nice and it is greasy..</li>
            <li> I ended up using it as a very expensive hand cream.</li>
            <li> I feel like this clogged my skin and caused me to have a bad break outs.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t imagine why it would smell so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at the woman raving about this cream on here.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated.</li>
            <li> this one is not it :(</li>
            <li> I do not know what&#x27;s going on :(</li>
            <li> However, I hate the way it smells--like baby powder.  </li>
            <li> Very bad on all counts.  </li>
            <li> I used this product once and was very disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> Living in the North East winters can be terrible on my skin.</li>
            <li> Horrible product!!!</li>
            <li> It caused a horrible breakout in my face after I used it for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> This smells so bad!!!!</li>
            <li> The worst moisturizer I ever had purchased can&#x27;t wait to return it and get it out of my house!!</li>
            <li> I didnt like the snell it smelled horrible</li>
            <li> You know that awful caking that sometimes happens with pressed powder?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream is a great product. It is moisturizing, very creamy and a little goes a long way. This is very hydrating to your face and seems to replenish the mositure that is depleted during the day. The shipping was quick and I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Ran out of my usual face cream and decided to try this. Really glad I did. I love it. Goes on to make my face super soft and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel all oily. Smells great too. I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is the best hydrating cream I&#x27;ve used. I have really dry skin and this works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for moisturizing.  It is soft and creamy, and does not leave a greasy feeling on the skin.  I use it every morning, and it keeps my skin feeling moist thruout the day.</li>
            <li> Male perspective: looking for something light, non oily, and scent free. This was good except for the scent (only used it 3 days). It is too strong and too chemically smelling. I would not want to smell it on man or woman. Could not get past the smell and passed it on to a family member to try.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the fact that it does not have spf ingredients that cause my eyes to tear.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it makes my skin look good. I gave it 4 stars because it also makes my face turn red when I am in the heat. But I love it</li>
            <li> This is my second tub of this moisturizer. It has a very pleasant mild, cold-cream smell. Nice and fresh for the evenings after showers. A little goes a LONG way, barely need a dab on your finger for the full face and neck. Works well for occasional facial dry skin, I do not use it daily.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer,  it makes your face fill so good.  I use it every morning.  It also helps to take away the smears of mascara when I mess up.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily.  I am very pleased with the results.  It provides my face and hands with the moisture required to keep the skin subtle and soft.  I also use Olay regenerating serum daily.  I am 71 years of age with no wrinkles on my face or hands.</li>
            <li> This is a classic!  Moisturizers but does not clog pores.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help my dry face. Living in the North East winters can be terrible on my skin. I have had this for nearly a week and I can already feel and see the difference. Best of all, the fragrances is very light, I also have terrible Allergies and Asthma so picking products with light fragrances are always the best!</li>
            <li> What a great product!  I am currently using this as a night cream.  I was using a more expensive product, but decided to give this a try.  I use a prescription retinoid, and when combined with the dryer winter air, I normally get a lot of flaking and peeling in the winter. I am using this every night, and flakes and peeling are almost non-existent. I find it to be non-greasy and very moisturizing.  Really impressed, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old female with normal/combination skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers from high end brands to CVS brands.  I have to say, this is one of the moisturizers I keep coming back to after my routine moisturizer switch ups.  Works well at a reasonable price.  What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> This face cream isn&#x27;t completely what I expected.  I have to use a lot more than I thought I would have to use and I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Holy grail moisturizer, love it.</li>
            <li> Smells weird and not enough lotion for me</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it hydrates good, but it&#x27;s a little greasy. I only use a little bit on my dry areas, so I use it more as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> My go- to moisturizer, alone or under make up. It does not irritate my sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and was very disappointed with it.  I woke up with 5 new pimples the next day.  The only thing I like about it is that it is light and readily absorbs into your skin.  It does not feel heavy, oily, or greasy.  However, I hate the way it smells--like baby powder.  I don&#x27;t want my face or hands smelling like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  It&#x27;s also full of chemicals and carcinogens such as petrolatum.  Very bad on all counts.  Save you money and use a natural mosturizer that&#x27;s not going to give you cancer.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  No issues with it, as it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Nice night time cream, good hydration, non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance and the consistency. Works well and has yet to break me out. Also a really good amount of product for the price. Lasting me longer than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin and watch glinzty on youtube because of her oily skin advice.  This moisturizer is indeed pretty sweet for us oily skinned gals.  It doesnt make me shine and absorbs really well.  I use this after Milk of Magnesia on my TZone and before my primer and I havent noticed any extra oil.  I might (?) have to blot around the 4-5 hour mark with my bb creams but I would prefer that to looking blotchy with regular foundations (or a crackly old lady with Revlon Colorstay).  I like it.</li>
            <li> 26 y/o female with combo oily and dry skin. trying to keep skin healthy early. just switched over to this cream which has been a staple for women in my family for 3 generations. its great! my face doesnt get greasy, its lovely under makeup. i really, really like this cream and the classic scent.</li>
            <li> MY MOM REALLY LIKES THIS PRODUCT. SHE USES IT ALL THE TIME</li>
            <li> Really like the product.</li>
            <li> While the moisturizer itself works very well and leaves my skin feeling soft and not looking too oily, it smells absolutely awful. The smell does wear off a few minutes after application, but while in the jar it&#x27;s very overwhelming. I would describe the smell something like a grandmother&#x27;s perfume and a powder fresh scented pad.</li>
            <li> I think that it is a good moisturizer, but I really don&#x27;t like the smell at all. I should look for an unscented product.</li>
            <li> I feel like this clogged my skin and caused me to have a bad break outs.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating during the winter months.  Makes your face very soft.  Thank you so very much for developing this product for combination skin.  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> This cream really helps with the dry skin on my face. I apply it after I get out of the shower, before putting on my makeup and it absorbs quickly into the skin. There is no oily residue like some of the other face creams that I have used. It also has a lighter scent which I love. It only takes a little bit, so I am hopeful that this batch will last me awhile. I would definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> Slight old lady smell but works nicely</li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay for years and years.  It&#x27;s basically a tradition in my family now.  The smell is nice but not overwhelming to those of us who have sensitive noses and it feels amazing!  Not greasy, not like glue.  It&#x27;s that perfect center</li>
            <li> you only apply a little bit and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It was a gift. she liked it</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, that I have it on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;.  Great for the skin, and it absorbs quickly.  Great for people with any type of skin.</li>
            <li> great on skin...does the job!!</li>
            <li> Always works, keeps me looking young.</li>
            <li> Works great but the smell is overbearing and nasty</li>
            <li> I am disappointed - the smell is not nice and it is greasy.. I used to like the fragrance but I think something not right.. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells like a baby&#x27;s butt and doesn&#x27;t work!!! Horrible product!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this. She says it works great in reducing the appearance of wrinkles and really makes her skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;Happy girlfriend &#x3D; Me happy.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, much cheaper than a retail store.</li>
            <li> This cream feels nice on my face, however the smell of baby powder is very strong. I am not sure I would purchase it again just because of the smell. Its not terrible, but it smells like a baby wipe. I wish it came unscented because then it would be my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love it! It really works and i love the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy, smells great, and it&#x27;s not too oily. The problem is though, my face does get oily later in the day. Still, I bought it again, and I&#x27;m happily using it everyday, just with some powder products to control the oil.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent price!  Will order this again</li>
            <li> Good price. my mom loves this cream</li>
            <li> Great item; will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love Olay. I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily facial moisturizer since I was a teenager (waaaay back when it was called Oil of Olay!). I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin that breaks out with harsh products, but Olay has helped keep my face soft, smooth, and happy through the years. I&#x27;m in my early 30s and still get carded more often than not, and I give ALL the credit for those momentary ego-boosts to Olay!</li>
            <li> My significant other swears by this; he will not use any other day time moisturizer. Keeps his face moisturized.</li>
            <li> As good as the expensive creams.</li>
            <li> It caused a horrible breakout in my face after I used it for about two weeks. Wouldn&#x27;t buy or use it again!</li>
            <li> Smells funny. I don&#x27;t like it, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have been using it every morning along with the Oil of Olay night cream. They smell good, they keep my face moisturized and feeling clean! I absolutely will be using this product for a long time!! I bought the spf all day moisturizer to use while I am in the sun but other than that this will be what&#x27;s on my face all day!</li>
            <li> My go to. Even expensive designer moisturizer doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Present for my Mom.  She has used this for over 45 years.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this facial moisturizer. It is very light and it keeps my face moisturized all day so no need to reapply. Ive noticed my laugh lines have softened and are less noticeable. It also has a pleasant scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Great and inexpensive moisturizer ! Smells good and it&#x27;s not too oily .</li>
            <li> My very first week with this product was amazing. My face was absolutely moisturized and it was smooth. You don&#x27;t need much for this to work, a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> Very heavily perfumed scent!</li>
            <li> Great Product- with Delivery!!</li>
            <li> Though I still look my age, this keeps my face hydrated and soft. Have always used Olay facial creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> Love this product and feels so nice on your face. Goes on with ease and makes your face feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> Olay is always great , great price</li>
            <li> Hmm, I would not recommend those who have dry-normal skin!~</li>
            <li> The Hydrating cream is just that, Hydrating. It leaves your skin feeling very soft and well moisturized. I did enjoy the product but could not stand the smell. It smells exactly like baby rash ointment. Once the cream has been on your skin a while the smell does eventually go away. (or I just don&#x27;t notice it anymore) If this were an odorless creme I would have given it 5 stars, but the smell is just way to close to baby ointment for me.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and worth every penny. Not as smooth as the regenerate, but very effective. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Works good with a great price if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like an old lady</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly only a couple days after i ordered it and I&#x27;ve had it about a month now I love it!! I normally wouldn&#x27;t buy this in the store because its so expensive but then I found it on amazon for practically nothing an had to buy it! Glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream after showering and for soothing my skin after I shave.  Using only a small amount per application, this cream does a nice job of keeping my face from drying out, yet it prevents my face from becoming overly oily towards the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all good facial moisturizers, this is a non-comedogenic formula, which for those wondering what that means, won&#x27;t clog your pores.  And as I mentioned above, while a little bit goes a long way, I&#x27;ve accidentally scooped more than I intended, and my face still didn&#x27;t feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned they do not care for the fragrance, and while I&#x27;d prefer a more neutral scent, it isn&#x27;t overpowering or offsetting to the point I become self-conscious or would not want to use it.  I had my wife give me the smell test, and she didn&#x27;t notice anything overly \\&quot;flowery\\&quot;.  Upon application, the smell is more distinctive, as it&#x27;s concentrated on your hands, and many people start by applying cream on and under their noses, where you&#x27;ll certainly notice the powdery fresh scent.  However, in my experience of using a small amount and rubbing the cream into my face and neck, the scent is negligible, and much less offensive than some of the after shave balms I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay&#x27;s a great brand that&#x27;s been around a long time, and I&#x27;m glad they offer an inexpensive moisturizer I can use without feeling like I&#x27;m wearing perfume.  I still have moisturizers from other companies that cost quite a bit more than this jar does, and I honestly do not feel there&#x27;s a $15.00 benefit to the higher priced creams, other than a more musky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what do I like about it?  It works great keeping my skin moisturized, without making my skin feel too greasy.  It&#x27;s also inexpensive, and it won&#x27;t clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I think could be better?  I would like a moisturizer to serve its purpose without adding fragrance.  But, since I use a small amount, it&#x27;s not enough of a negative to prevent me from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to continue using this cream, and will likely purchase more in the future, which I might have to do since my wife has essentially stolen it from me.ative to prevent me from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to continue using this cream, and will likely purchase more in the future, which I might have to do since my wife has essentially stolen it from me.</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer this is ok.  It smells a bit like rose oil.  It&#x27;s not a super strong smell but I&#x27;m a guy and well not fond of smelling like a flower.  I really couldn&#x27;t find a water based moisturizer that worked better that was specifically for men. However I have very dry skin that lacks moisture and natural oils.  This absorbs well and is not greasy.  My skin immediately felt a bit more supple an hydrated.  This doesn&#x27;t really have any ingredients that would provide long term benefits such as vitamins but hydrated skin is younger skin and will age better.  I use this only in the morning and I use an oil based organic moisturizer at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong.  It actually absorbs better, feels better and works better (in my opinion) r than some of the more expensive options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is Paraben free so that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> I just try to use this for temporary before I buy my clinique moisture surge but I changed my mind after I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;This is amazingly suit my skin and give you great hydration and stop my acne.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and have always had oily skin that is somehow still dry and rough in parts. I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about a month every night after I wash my face (I use one with spf during the day) and my skin has gotten noticeably softer and smoother, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any more oil than usual. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I put this on before bed to have my skin feeling great in the morning! Supper pleased to have gotten this!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell of this cream other than that it probably works ok.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 20 plus of this item because I use it constantly.  What can I say.  I love the product.</li>
            <li> Nice and and smooth on my skin. I use it at night after I wash my face with Olay facial wash</li>
            <li> unless u use it at least twice a day every day and never miss a day the results dont last more then a couple hours. i also have to put coat after coat each application. it may work fine for other people but my skins so dry makeup curdles on my skin and there are places on my face that feel like the bottom of your foot after uve worn flip flops for weeks. i need to see a dermatologist but i really do not have the funds so im just trying to find a product that works on my skin. this one is not it :(</li>
            <li> This is the only hydrating cream to actually work and NOT cause me to break out or look shiny (very sensitive/dry/oily skin)...You may be wondering how skin can be both dry and oily...Well, that&#x27;s me! Hence my dilemma in finding creams that work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t needed in my opinion but it isn&#x27;t cringe worthy as others describe. I am thankful I found this and am happy it&#x27;s so cheap...I am able to put it on underneath my makeup with no issues at all. I just wait at least 15 minutes in between.</li>
            <li> very good product at a very good price</li>
            <li> This is a good, light-weight moisturizer.  I use it under my liquid foundation.  It does not leave a greasy residue or cause more oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I love Olay. I use this right after washing my face for the night and it has improved my skin. As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve developed some dry patches but I was reluctant to try this because some parts of my face are still oily. I use just a few tiny dots on a damp face and it spreads thin and soaks in. It does have a light scent, but it&#x27;s not offensive and didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin. In the morning, I wash my face again and mix a dab of Olay with my liquid foundation. Not only does the foundation go further, it spreads more evenly The big surprise was that after a few weeks I noticed a few wrinkles were less noticeable. ( Not a miracle here but for the price this was GREAT!)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lightweight daily moisturizer for my combination skin. This stuff has a nice texture, provides a nice touch of moisture without being shiny, and absorbs quickly. However, it has a heavy perfumy scent that I really don&#x27;t care for. Honestly, without the smell this would probably be hg and I would stock up on it for life. But I think I will keep looking. If you don&#x27;t mind scents though, I would recommend trying this!</li>
            <li> I like the mild yet delightful smell of this - no strong perfume.  It makes my face feel nice also.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and then could not find it locally. Very pleased to have it back, as great as ever, especially as sunny days are here again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at the woman raving about this cream on here. It&#x27;s mediocre at best, the scent is too fake, powdery, and overwhelming. Perhaps the formula has changed over time. I believe in quality for a cream on my face, it&#x27;ll be much worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> Very effective, and non-greasy.  However, I could do without the fragrance.  Please, no fragrance; I&#x27;ll have to get another product.</li>
            <li> All products were  good except the shredder it spoil  in 3 months .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second time buying this product  and I still love it. My face is very sensitive and I get rashes if I&#x27;m not careful with what I put on it but this cream is gentle and refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li> The price is excellent, however I find myself using a bit more than I would some of the other Olay night creams. Not as creamy as other olay night creams, but effective. Actually has a cold cream quality to it. The smell is definitely loud and might not be agreeable to everyone. Actually I like the smell. It&#x27;s nostalgic for me as it smells like the &amp;#34;oil of olay beauty liquid&amp;#34; I remember from my childhood. Even has the same pink color.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and use the Olay Active Hydrating Cream every day. This cream provides moisture to my skin without heavy build up.  I put it on and it instantly takes away the dry areas. Generally, I put this on my face and just apply my favorite color lipstick to my lips. No heavy foundation is required.  Most people think that I am 10 years younger than I actually am. The other great part about this product is that it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> his cream provides moisture to my skin without heavy build up. I put it on and it instantly takes away the dry areas. Generally, I put this on my face and just apply my favorite color lipstick to my lips</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. When I used to put on other moisturizers it would leave my face feeing sticky and just sitting on top of my skin. With this my face feels so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t just stay there It absorbs right into your skin. No sticky gross feeling and it is a pretty large container so lots of product. Plus it reminds me of my grandmother who used this Olay product all the time, so I get that memory of her when I use it. 5 stars all around.</li>
            <li> Olay Hydrating Cream is the absolute best buy for the money.  It is light, non greasy and keeps my skin moisturized all day.  I love this product and would recommend it for all skin types (my skin is on the dry side).</li>
            <li> I like this cream...and it&#x27;s best for warmer weather - not cakey at all. I have dry skin and well in NY the winters are pretty brutal....I would NOT use this during the winter...I would need something more hydrating. No heavy smells - like I said light cream. I would recommend to someone with more normal skin.</li>
            <li> This smells so bad!!!! The worst moisturizer I ever had purchased can&#x27;t wait to return it and get it out of my house!! I smelled like a nursing home after putting it on my face! I think it&#x27;s a moisturizer for older women couldn&#x27;t imagine why it would smell so bad. Espescially if it&#x27;s on your face you smell every thing. Trust me you don&#x27;t want to smell this!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and smells really good</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and this is a must for me. I&#x27;m almost 40 and need to really care for my skin and hydration is the key. This is also very affordable compared to other products on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It has a slight fragrance which bothers me, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It works and if you don&#x27;t have fragrance sensitivities it might be fine for you. I didn&#x27;t know Olay used fragrances in anything.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user and plan to use for many years to come.  I love this moisturizer.  Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer...pretty pink color but works great.  Nice smell too.  I dont need expensive face products when I can get Olay</li>
            <li> The product says hydrating, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl for my slightly dry skin. It smells great... that&#x27;s the only pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s far too light a cream to do much of anything for my skin. I gave it to my mother, who has oily skin &amp; often forgoes moisturizer &amp; even she said it was so light, it made no difference in how her skin felt. It&#x27;s also a very small container, so will not go far for your hard earned dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using 2 coats or a much thicker amount, like the size of a quarter &amp; still felt I needed a moisturizer on top of it. I ended up using it as a very expensive hand cream. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for quite a long time and swears by it to be top quality. I gave it a five rating because she has never said a product she uses is good when it is not.</li>
            <li> I  absolutely love this product and have used it for years, it absorbs quickly and moisturizes very well and is scented beauitfully. It doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy like other products and the best part is it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good as a moisturizer but I thought it would help reduce some of the facial wrinkles I have. I would recommend as a daily moisturizer but I think I&#x27;m going to try something else.</li>
            <li> Do you want moisture?  A light pleasing fragrance? A good value? Relief from dry skin? Soothing cream for sensitive skin?  This is the cream.  But if you want miracle creams that promise to reduce or erase wrinkles, tighten skin and erase age marks, then keep on shopping.  Those things are available out there, but they cost much more money than this cream and the results are only temporary.  After spending thousands of dollars on temporary fixes, I&#x27;ve come home to my first skin cream.  And I intend to stay with it.</li>
            <li> Love this, very light and it keeps my face smooth all day. Highly recommended for Oily/Combination skin and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> A good all purpose lightweight everyday and night moisturizer,  at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this felt like it was sitting on top of the skin rather than moisturizing. I also broke out when I started to use it. Allover, not for me.</li>
            <li> It is good moisturizing for face.  Oil of Olay products have been around forever because they do work well.  Liked</li>
            <li> Saved money on this product.</li>
            <li> Love Olay products, in lauding this one. It&#x27;s soft a light smell and it&#x27;s marvelous on the skin. Feels like silk and&lt;br /&gt;your  skin will thank you. Just a little goes a long way. I put it all over my neck, awesome. Came before it was time to.</li>
            <li> Works great! I gave 4 stars because the smell is not something a person at my age wants to have on them. Straight up, it smells like old ladies perfume.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, but cheap so no major loss.</li>
            <li> Olay is my favorite.  I have been using it since I was a teenager and am now in my forties.  This is a heavy day cream.  I prefer a thicker cream as I get older as my skin needs more moisture.  It absorbs well and I am able to apply make up within a few minutes.  I like the light fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. I Love it.</li>
            <li> Could not get past the smell of this cream.  It is not even a perfumy smell - it is actually offensive!  Returned it immediately!</li>
            <li> Okay so NORMALLY, I use Korean products for my skin. I&#x27;ve been having a weird dry skin phase and omgggggg this is a miracle in a bottle.  I just don&#x27;t care for how it smells.  I was afraid it would be a bit on the heavy side of facial moisturizers, and it kind of is so a little goes a long way.  I found to counter-act the heaviness I put it on after I get out of the shower and then wait like 15-20 minutes before putting on any concealer or foundation.  Got rid of the dry skin flakes after my first use. I just wish it smelled differently. Reminds me of old people..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay for over 20 years. It works.</li>
            <li> The most refreshing face cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This cream is very light.  If that&#x27;s what you want, it&#x27;s fine.  I prefer one with considerably more body.  I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> This cream took all my dry spots away on my face!! A miracle worker. I tried a lot of different brands to try and see if I could find something that worked, but I ended up coming back to Olay! They didn&#x27;t have this in the store, so now I buy all my Olay online.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom and she loves it. The price is better than all the local stores around here as well.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and decided to try it again when my face got very dry in the winter.  It hydrated my skin immediately and absorbed very quickly without feeling greasy.  It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  I usually purchase only unscented body care products but the scent in Olay diminished quickly after applying it, so not a problem for me.  I will continue to use Olay.</li>
            <li> I use this cream morning and night, and because it does not have SPF it does not bother my eyes so I can cover my entire face and neck.  Olay does produce a cream with SPF, but even getting it close to my eyes caused burning.  Be careful around your eyes if  you try the SPF products.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer. It smells nice and works fine. I wish they made the container/quantity a bit larger so that I didn&#x27;t have to be so usage cautious. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this lotion is it makes my face shiny and a bit greasy and being a teen that&#x27;s definitely not what I need. Overall and average facial cream.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Great face cream. It is very light on your face, and non-greasy, but still moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I use it at night time, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Smells too strongly of powdery perfume to wear comfortably.</li>
            <li> Oooh - OLAY!  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Just like my mom did.  Not expensive but it works.  Unlike some other reviews I have seen I actually love the smell.  Very comforting.  Not greasy and absorbs quickly.  No residue on the pillow!  Good to have it on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> This is a non-comedogenic moisturizer.  I have used it for years, but in my mid 60s am finding I need something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> (the name is under my husband&#x27;s name.  I use the cream)  The cream is hydrating, not a strong aroma and in a user friendly container.</li>
            <li> Best ever hydrating cream!! Can&#x27;t live without it!! Leaves face feeling soft,silky!!</li>
            <li> very light and nice and not greasy, it absorbs nicely in the skin and feels soft and nice. It is good for dry to normal skin and its good for under makeup. I would recommend it and for the price it is good.</li>
            <li> I use this during the winter months when my facial skin needs more moisture. Works great and is such a great deal here!</li>
            <li> the product is great! But I can not order it no more. I know it&#x27;s an add-on product so I ordered something else and the cream. But when I did the check out the cream just disappeared. So I tried again and the same happened. I was so frustrated. I do not know what&#x27;s going on :(</li>
            <li> It felt great on my skin, but eyes burned every time I wore it.  Sadly, I&#x27;ve had to switch to a more costly lotion that has more organic ingredients, and my eyes are back to normal.</li>
            <li> Smells good and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it. Smells great and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS PRODUCT. NOW I HAVE REGULAR SHIPMENTS. LOVE THAT.&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES MY SKIN SMELLING GOOD AND FEELING SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> This Olay cream was smaller than I expected, and would be great for a travel size for a makeup bag. I don&#x27;t think it will last me very long!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!  I particularly wear this under my makeup when I&#x27;m wearing in all in one makeup that already has an SPF.  Since I tend to take pictures I don&#x27;t want my photos to come out with the white cast.  So this moisturizer does wonders!  I also love how lightweight it is and isn&#x27;t irritating to my skin being I have sensitive/combination skin. Plus most importantly it isn&#x27;t greasy nor oily.</li>
            <li> Wow, it came in all smeling  very bad, very old!&lt;br /&gt;How can i return it?</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed how this product makes your skin feel! Not only did it help hydrate my skin it also provided an unmatchable quality that you don&#x27;t get in other brands. I will for sure place another order!</li>
            <li> Very nice product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Olay, and the price is goog.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and during the winter my facial skin just feels rough and dry. I usually avoid any creams as I never really have breakouts on my face until I use a cream. I&#x27;ve been using this now for a while and my skin feels smoother. I have no breakouts and there is a slight odor but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Some guys might find it feminine but its not even that noticeable. I dont expect this cream to fix wrinkles but for now its doing a good job and hydrating my face and leaving it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Strong perfume smell! But good daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> I missed the coupon, which is occasionally offered, and if you subscribe you can save a little money. My mom used to wear this and the scent reminds me of her. It is still my favorite, although I have tried all the expensive face creams, I really prefer this one. It arrived well packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my face especially in the colder/drier months. I&#x27;ve tried tons of face lotions but none of them work nearly as well as this Olay one. It has a light, pleasant scent and it goes on somewhat thick. However, once you rub it in the smell disappears and you can&#x27;t tell you have anything on. Yay for no more dry skin!!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery but Dried my face out instead of moisturizing .</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a moisturizer for my face.I didnt like the snell it smelled horrible I was surprised at olay.a lousy cream dont purchase ! ! .</li>
            <li> This is a great face cream and the automatic delivery option is very handy.</li>
            <li> Works ok. I ended up getting another product that works better.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite fresh smelling hydrating go-to cream. Use the more expensive creams at home and stash this one in your bag for all year round comfort. Excellent item for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> I smell like an old person!  The product is fine,  but the odor is horrible!  I will be replacing this with something else and this will go into the trash.  What a waste!</li>
            <li> Great price! Love oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. My skin feels so soft after using it, even if I haven&#x27;t washed my face before hand. It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Considering I HATE using anything in my face except for my benzoyl peroxide cream for the sole reason it soaks in quickly, this is perfect for me. It soaks in quickly and lasts all day/night long. It brightens up my face and gets rid of my &amp;#34;I will kill anyone who comes near me&amp;#34; morning face, which is a very hard thing to do. Not even coffee works for that.&lt;br /&gt;I love the baby powderish scent it has, its very light and fades after awhile. Feels nice, works like I want it to and since I only use I tiny bit it&#x27;ll last maybe half a year for me. I use as little as possible and just barley cover my face and slather it on my neck.</li>
            <li> Wanted a cream that would not burn my face and would keep it hydrated and this is the best product I have used. I love Oil Of Olay products.</li>
            <li> It gives me pimples. I do not like it. I used it twice daily and it is not hydrating at all.</li>
            <li> I am oily skin, I like this product very much. It makes my skin relaxed and you do not feel oily any more.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Makes skin baby soft and very moisturized. A lot of product for the price. Overall nothing bad to say about it, will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> This cream works really well, by hydrating without clogging my pores. My skin feels softer even after a few hours after application. I would highly recommend this to anyone with combination oily/dry skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is really great, BUT if you don&#x27;t use a lot of it like I don&#x27;t it will go bad - best way I can describe it. Mine started to break down and got a top layer of like water/oil on it. I stirred it, but I just couldn&#x27;t use it again. I didn&#x27;t trust it. So use it up! It really is good... it doesn&#x27;t dry sticky, it feels nice and smooth, and works great under makeup.</li>
            <li> Better than the fluid moisturiser. Light enough for summer but hard-working enough for the winter.</li>
            <li> Nice moisture but i dont like the smell, very bad strong .and i do like the scented Regeneristi microsculpture cream.</li>
            <li> when I opened it the cream is only 2/3 bottle full, and it looks like someone used it before.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells funny and old.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t want to use it because it looks so weird.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this product for many years now people always say I must have good genes. It&#x27;s the brand it hydrates my face. That&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;what a dermatologist told me I needed then she gave me a bar of fatty soap for forty dollars. I just use Oil Of Olay instead of going to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Still a classic. My grandmother used this stuff until she died at 98 (she was a classic Olay user), and had the most beautiful skin. I had problems finding one that worked well, and decided to see if my grandmother&#x27;s wisdom would still apply. And it did!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels actually hydrated (hard to say, living in a desert), the texture is creamy, and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Really keeps the face moist and  healthy but its very small in size. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I was paying $30 a jar from Merle Norman for the exact same outcome, I like this&lt;br /&gt;even better.</li>
            <li> The more i added the dryer my face became. I really regret wasing my money on this bull.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use another brand.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many, many years and your price beats everyone else. You have a continued customer.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer. Leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I got this product to use after I apply my Indian healing clay and it left my face greasy.  I already have oily skin but some of the reviews said it wasn&#x27;t oily and on the label it also said oil free well unfortunately for my face it left it really oily and greasy looking! .. I know everyone&#x27;s skin type is different and so try this product if you wish but I gave mine to my mother in law and she didn&#x27;t like it, so she gave it away but her friend liked it so kept it! lol  The product smells good and no tracking information was available but I ordered on Monday and I received it on Saturday.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay for 50+ years, back then it was called Oil of Olay and we could only get it in a bottle (lotion).......I like the cream much better....still use it and still love it......</li>
            <li> I order it many times...love this</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Great light weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this product!! keeps ma skin moist!</li>
            <li> This is non greasy and sweet smelling cream for sensitive skin. Love it</li>
            <li> Not for people sensitive to fragrance. Smells way too floraly for a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer,even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A bit perfumy for me but works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, however I tolerate it. I am allergic to many types of creams and lotions so finding one I can use with no side effects is a miracle. So far I haven&#x27;t had any issue with breaking out. I use it every morning and again at night after washing my face. I &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; with do you though. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Always a great product.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Love it!!! Very light scent. I have very sensitive skin and this is the one product that moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel lovely. I was pleasantly surprised. It  makes my skin feel dewy and moisturized. My skin is sensitive but this product works great. I enjoy the light scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell  like an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;  in my opinion.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, so the product should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Leaves mt skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> This made my skin feel great and provided enough moisture under my primer and makeup that i didn&#x27;t have any sort of drying or flaking (which can happen on my nose from time to time, no matter what I do to prevent it!) The moisture lasted all day, which kept my makeup in tact and looking flawless - I&#x27;m deeply impressed. It does have sort of a grandma-y, baby powder scent at first but I noticed after it was on my skin for a few minutes the scent sort of changed, becoming enjoyable and pretty faint which was great, because I hate the baby powder smell and overpowering scents on my face.</li>
            <li> I need to moisturize in winter, but am not thrilled with this product. It&#x27;s making me break out like crazy, which is not something that normally happens in winter. And the smell is cloying, too.</li>
            <li> this is a awesome product for your face</li>
            <li> I live in a dry part of the country, and it dries my skin to the point that it starts to hurt. Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, my skin feels nice and smooth, and soothes it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought because of brand name and so much cheaper than any of Olay&#x27;s newer products. It&#x27;s a bare minimum moisturizer. Might be fine for younger skin. Evident why it is so much less expensive than the newer (non-original) formulas (advanced, anti-aging, etc.)</li>
            <li> love this works great ! lasts forever!</li>
            <li> my grandma used this every nite before bed for as long as I can remember&lt;br /&gt;now that I have tried it - I am a fan</li>
            <li> latest review:  The fragrance is overpowering - cannot/will not use this again.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works like a charm</li>
            <li> Great cream that does not leave your face feeling greasy.  I sometimes have to be careful of such products because I will have a breakout from use, but this has been fine so far after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I like the Olay Active Hydrating Cream. It&#x27;s cheap and moisture. Make your skin confortable. I always use Olay products.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin to the point that I can&#x27;t use most moisturizers.  However, Olay Active Hydrating Cream works wonderfully for me.  During the winter months when I get particularly dry around my mouth and chin, I put a small amount (a little bigger than a pea size) on the affected areas once a day.  The cream immediately soothes the areas and helps to heal the chapped skin and prevent future problems.  I have never broken out from using the Olay Active Hydrating Cream (and I breakout frequently from other moisturizers!), so I highly recommend it to people with sensitive skin.  I even use it only hands every once in a while if they are particularly chapped.  A definite buy for sensitive skin individuals during the harsh winter months!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a better moisturizer than this. Makes skin baby soft. I like this better than the beauty fluid, which is lighter and not as moisturizing (good for summer).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this exact cream in stores in about a year. Thankfully I had stocked up last time I found them and now that I know Amazon sells it, I don&#x27;t have to worry! Great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 years now!</li>
            <li> Smells good, and keeps my skin hydrated after cleansing with Dudu Osun Black Soap. Use it nightly, after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer for my face in our very dry weather. It leaves my face feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Been using for over 25 years. And I don&#x27;t have as many wrinkles as mist women my age. In fact I hardly have any at all.</li>
            <li> Love the texture, light feel &amp; fast, easy absorption into my skin. Never clogs pores. Never leaves a &#x27;film&#x27; &amp; allows me use make up on directly after. The scent is subtile &amp; perfect for every day use. Olay is my &#x27;go to&#x27; daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> At 2 oz this cream is the perfect traveling companion. It leaves skin soft and beautifully hydrated.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to several others and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> it is what i bought and use... i do not know much more than that. it is cheaper than the other cream ( Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream 1.7 oz. )  and does the same thing</li>
            <li> use with some caution. i&#x27;m not sure why but this caused me to have breakouts. might not be something that happens to many people but i usually don&#x27;t have breakout problems since my skin is not sensitive. thought this might be useful</li>
            <li> the best for winter time...</li>
            <li> I have always loved Oil Of Olay since I was a young Lady and it is very hard to find this product stocked in stores. I&#x27;m glad I found it online and for a good price also.</li>
            <li> Used for 20 years and still the best!</li>
            <li> good stuff, momma&#x27;;s fav</li>
            <li> Not sure If I would recommend this product yet. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s stress or if it&#x27;s the product but my face has been breaking out severely. I have hard large bumps on my right  cheek and it hurts when I try to pop them :/</li>
            <li> From now on, I will only use Olay!! Love it so much. The scent is okay, it could be better. It&#x27;s not too oily on my skin</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love it! I am in my 60&#x27;s and it is great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin. I am also allergic to most products causing a breakout. This is the only product that combats this that I have tried. I put it on my face in the morning and before I go to bed at night. My skin feels so much softer. I can actually smile without my face cracking. I see the small lines in my face slowly diminishing. I LOVE this product. It does not leave a greasy feel but soft natural skin. I also use the Olay Pro-X microdermabrasion to wash my face daily and polish it weekly.</li>
            <li> Light and hydrating. I love the smell and use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li> Sometimes best choices is not the most expensive. This works well</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel soft.  It is economical and helps my complexion.  I believe it protects the skin on my face especially after I exfoliate with a battery powered complexion brush.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works so well on my very dry skin and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.  You could spend a lot more on a moisturizer but why would you want to when this one works so well?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial hydrating cream &amp; haven&#x27;t found any until now. &amp; for how well it works, it&#x27;s an amazing price! It leaves my face feeling so smooth all day without a sticky residue or a heavy feeling! I wish I could give it more stars!</li>
            <li> Has a very strange and unpleasant odor to it, smells like a mix of an old lady&#x27;s perfume and urine.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me... made me break out. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I am the person will really sentive skin.  I have used this for years, and have tried every thing.  This one is a winner, and I highly recommend it. I always buy 2 to have an extra on hand so when I get down half way down to the second jar it&#x27;s time to reorder.</li>
            <li> Been using this face cream for many years!!!</li>
            <li> This has a very perfumey smell, and though some of the other Olay products I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin, this one did. I have mild rosacea and this definitely doesn&#x27;t help it, and in fact creates a bit of a burning sensation, which probably comes from the scent additive. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have very normal skin that isn&#x27;t easily irritated.</li>
            <li> very hydrating. smells is nice and thought it would irritate my skin but did not. recommend!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years and it makes my skin soft and youthful. I use it on my face, neck and hands and it moisturizes so well without clogging pores. I have dry skin and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and so far the results are pretty good. Skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry. Feels hydrated!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s, I stay out of the sun, I avoid harsh soaps on my face, and I have naturally oily skin, but I&#x27;m getting older and the weather takes more of a toll on my skin than a decade ago. I noticed my cheeks and nose were dry and my makeup wasn&#x27;t going on smoothly. You know that awful caking that sometimes happens with pressed powder? That.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used any kind of face cream, but the price was right and the reviews were good for this brand. I started applying it twice a day in very small amounts - no more than a little bit on my fingertip. After only a few days, my skin was noticeably softer. My makeup was spreading more evenly on my cheeks and nose, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s virtually no greasy residue and it dries quickly. I put it on after my shower and before bed and it never rubs off on my pillowcase or clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only aspect of this cream I don&#x27;t like is the smell. It&#x27;s floral, like roses. I hesitate to describe it this way, but it&#x27;s a little old-fashioned. I would prefer something a little cleaner or, even better, scentless. I gag a little every time I smell it, but I&#x27;ve never been a fan of rose-scented lotions or perfumes. If you are, then this probably won&#x27;t bother you. It&#x27;s just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, not-so-great smell. Four stars.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s real Olay ????</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that I use on my skin. It keeps it smooth, glowing, and radiant! Keep up the good work Olay.</li>
            <li> Received today.  Same as I have used before.  An add-on and great price</li>
            <li> It is very pungent. If you can get past that, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I love the olay fresh effect dew over hydrating gel moisturizer so I figured I would give this a try as my day cream. I put it on after waking up and before I knew it my face had a mini break out and was red. Not sure if going out in the sun and being out there too long had anything to do with it but since it is for the morning I don&#x27;t think going outside should have any affect. Either way I think I will stick with the hydrating gel moisturizer as my day and night moisturizer. I put that on during the day and my face feels great even after going outside.</li>
            <li> Very soft; very soothing..Lovely fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> I would have given this item 5 stars except for the smell. One reviewer said it smelled like something that a grandmother would use, and I agree. I&#x27;m not sure what Olay was thinking when they came up with the fragrance for this item, but I have a suggestion. How about making it fragrance free? The smell is not so much overpowering, just irritatingly old school. This is a mainstream item, let&#x27;s have a mainstream smell. Other than that, I think the item is a good moisturizer for the face. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I always buy this cream and love Olay. It keeps my skin soft and smooth. This is first time I bought it online.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was on time and product came as expected.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She says: &amp;#34;The lotion feels like what I would expect from using Olay&#x27;s other facial creams but the smell is absolutely horrendous. Because I don&#x27;t like to waste, I&#x27;m using it here and there but I tend to put it on when I know I&#x27;m not going to be around people because it&#x27;s pretty overwhelming. Pretty disappointed. I&#x27;ve loved my other Olay products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I decided on this moisturizer.  Olay has never let me down.  It is the perfect size and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Love these simple Olay hydrating products. They are easily absorbed and the smell is fresh and delicate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream since it came out.  Still a good price, not greasy, scent is very nice, and it works!</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture, I feel it moisturizing and it has a light baby powder smell.  I&#x27;d recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cream is my fave, all year round.  It is sometimes hard to find in stores because OLAY is promoting newer products.  I was happy to find it online</li>
            <li> Its light weight, and really works.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for dry skin</li>
            <li> OIl of Olay&#x27;s Active Hydrating Original Facial Cream keeps your face feeling soft and hydrated. I use it after my shower every day!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere. The best moisturizer -</li>
            <li> It definitely does it&#x27;s job to hydrate. I use it at night and my face is still soft in the morning. It does have a pretty powerful smell of baby powder (it actually smells very similar and even looks the same as Johnson and Johnson baby lotion) so if that&#x27;s a concern to people sensitive to scents, this one might be strong.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and nice quality, but it still takes a good amount to get proper coverage so I don&#x27;t foresee the good sized tub lasting very long.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, rich cream. I love it for both my hands and my face. I keep the little pots of it stashed all over because it really is my favorite lotion. I have no problems with break outs while using this either.</li>
            <li> A very good product . I love the light scent and texture , I use it for over 5 years,</li>
            <li> This Olay Active Hydrating Cream is great!  Goes on smoothly, non-greasy and makes my skin feel softer!!</li>
            <li> Omg love this so much! I just put this on for 30 mintues and its so soft and not oily at all also it&#x27;s not thick. &amp; fast shipping! Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay&#x27;s Original Facial Moisturizer for a month now.  I like it, but I need more.  My face has always been sensitive, troubled, and oily.  As I approach my mid 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve found it has change to sensitive, troubled, combination skin.  If I&#x27;m not careful, I will still break out like a teenager, but with the added bonus of a bit of dryness on my cheeks.  The Original moisturizer is light enough to use as a day cream, but I need a bit more for a night cream.  My routine is to use a good facial cleaner in the shower, followed by a retinol serum, then moisturizer.  I live in WV, where the wind over the mountains quickly drys the air; during the winter, it&#x27;s not uncommon to have single digit humidity.  So, I need a good, balancing moisturizer, even with my oily skin.  I&#x27;ve found that my skin will get very oily, with breakouts, if I don&#x27;t moisturize.  It simply overproduces oil.  I like the Olay Original Moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve found that I still have 2 small patches of dryness, caused by the retinol.  It may be enough for someone who has very oily skin, but for my combination skin, I need a bit more.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my face without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li> I used to use this lotion years ago and came across it on amazon on sale. I feel like the formula is different from a few years ago. It feels less creamy and definitely does not moisturize as well as the old version. I think this may be an okay light lotion for someone in their teens.</li>
            <li> Great Product ! I tend to have very very dry flaky skin and olay works wonders. I usually apply it every night and in the morning after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> If you have a fragrance sensitivity, STAY AWAY from this one.  This cream contains the strongest, most overwhelming fragrance of any of the Olay products on the market today.  Years past, the original pink Active Hydrating Lotion had more of a soft and powdery scent.  This, however, smells similar to an older woman&#x27;s spoiled perfume, mixed with chemicals.  I put some of this cream on my hands to test it, and even after washing my hands a few times, the scent still lingered on my skin, and in my nose.  I decided to try it on my face, anyway.  It did NOT moisturize well at all.  But moreover, the scent lingered all night, triggering allergies I didn&#x27;t even know I had.  I had to wash my bed sheets the next morning, just to get rid of the repulsive smell.  So if you have sensitive skin, or any kind of fragrance sensitivity whatsoever, stay away from this cream.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers leave my face feeling greasy and my skin looks shiny. So I&#x27;m glad I started using this product. My skin is moisturized without the oily feeling or shiny look. I like that my face feels soft and I only have to use a small amount that lasts. It smells pleasant and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Really what gives this product such a low score is the smell. I don&#x27;t understand why it needs so much perfume for a face lotion. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews that complained about the smell.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just like the same named stuff that I bought in stores before they discontinued it, but I believe it broke me out some (when it never had before). Little disappointed especially because I bought a 2pack</li>
