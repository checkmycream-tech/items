            <li>I especially love a great HOT red...</li>
            <li>For sure you have to prepare your lips with some lip balm or oil before you put this on.</li>
            <li>Package is ok, lipstick turns out to be somewhat melted look.</li>
            <li>Stays on for hours :)</li>
            <li>I prefer more blue-based reds.  </li>
            <li>In addition I thought it was overpriced at $15;  Loreal makes better products for under $10.</li>
            <li>I do love this one</li>

            <li>I found it overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I do think it looks better if applied with a lipstick brush.</li>
            <li>I love that it is made without parabens.</li>
            <li>I am going to look around for some more by Vasanti Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>applying it is more like using a crayon...</li>
            <li>yeah:))</li>

            <li>because it&#x27;s Paraben Free and better for your lips.  </li>
            <li>It got here fast and in good condition</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure to purchase this item, but im soo glad I did.</li>
            <li>goregous, hawt, bold and sexy</li>
            <li>And Is The Absolute Perfect Shade Of Red!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>,this is the best shade of red so far i ever bought and fits my skin</li>
            <li>Feels great on your lips and doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out your lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a bright red lipstick for a while &amp;</li>
            <li>(I am fair, with blonde hair/blue eyes).  </li>
            <li>This Lipstick is a gorgeous Red Color without the greasy - runny look or feel.  </li>
            <li>Finally a red lipstick that looks good on me.</li>
            <li>This lipstick has true staying power....</li>
            <li>You can mix it with other lipstick colors and it comes out great everytime.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>It shows up very nice and vibrant and makes my teeth look extremely white.</li>
            <li>I am an avid lipstick wearer!  </li>
            <li>Oh so pretty!</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i wanted!</li>
            <li>It is one of the best red lipsticks ive had in a very long time</li>
            <li>Amazing matte red.</li>
            <li>, the color is smooth and goes on and stays on very well</li>
            <li>It went on smooth but might have gone on better if I had moisturized my lips properly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice red, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was a 100% matte finish.  </li>
            <li>I have golden skin</li>
            <li>the color is super hot, and chic, totally worth the price, for day and night</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s long lasting :) will be purchasing it again and the price was good</li>
            <li>it has just the right amount of moisture while still having a matte look.</li>
            <li>Beautiful red, doesnt dry at all.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick and just wish they had it in different color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not expensive at all</li>
            <li>first time trying.</li>
            <li>I wear vintage clothing (Etsy addict), and I was interested in this lipstick when I read that it was inspired by 1940&#x27;s reds.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to \\&quot;put up with that\\&quot;</li>
            <li>this sophisticated look.its become my signature,plus it last even after hours of applying.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s what I was looking for, love it, it&#x27;s the matte red color that I like!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOOVVVEEE this!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite red lipstick ever!!!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t bleed, color is bright and I&#x27;m a little shocked with the superior quality and feel, it feels very light, not</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite - a bit more than I usually pay but really worth the expense.  </li>
            <li>Lasts all day long :)</li>
            <li>I found the color of this lipstick to be more orange than classic red.  </li>
            <li>I bought this red because it said how bright and vivid it was, and I also prefer a matte finish because I don&#x27;t have to re-apply during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick was not as drying as my other matte lipsticks,which was nice; however the red is nowhere as vivid as the picture or the description stated.</li>
            <li>This lipstick really depends on how you apply it.</li>
            <li>so much i want to wear it all the time.</li>
            <li>tone.i really dont have to use a lot and the color and matte effect</li>
            <li>this Red matte is by far my favorite brand and color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always love the pale face with red lipstick look, but have never been able to achieve it.</li>
            <li>It stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge like many of the other brands do.  </li>
            <li>Other than that i love the color and still wear it.</li>
            <li>If you seek a true red that stays on, this is it.</li>
            <li>DidI say I love this, plus I received this less then a week.  </li>
            <li>but a lovely lipstick none the less.......</li>
            <li>I had hoped to find an all-natural lipstick that would last, but after trying many different brands, I knew I would have to compromise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The lipstick arrives in a cute little silver case and arrives in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really rate it on the lasting scale as far as how long it stays on or how many times I need to reapply.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s long lasting and the color is so rich!</li>
            <li>it is a rich, deep red.....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for vintage gals, and any gal who wants a long-lasting matte red.</li>
            <li>This lipstick color is ok not like the picture though, it is dark matte red.</li>
            <li>Too dry and didn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all, even when I applied a chap-stick prior to application.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that this one is paraben free, although I would still have to ingest some artificial coloring for the sake of beauty.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like the look and feel of the lipstick.</li>
            <li>Lips are lush and chap-free after application.</li>
            <li>at all.&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick is much darker, kinda grandma red, and I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I am in search of a classic red....</li>
            <li>Seems too pink for a true red.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and the color is pretty.</li>
            <li>and so I do prefer something with the blue tones to avoid that orange look, but this one really is too of a berry shade than red on me.</li>
            <li>The color lasts long and even though throughout the day it doesn&#x27;t stay fresh and red, it still has a hint of red, which is why i prefer by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I gave this to a dark haired, green eyed  friend, thinking it would look better with her coloring,</li>
            <li>color is a dark merlot or dark bing cherry more purple than red.</li>
            <li>I apply my lip gloss first and dab this to my lips since this can be slightly dry for me as I have DRY lips.</li>

            <li> The color lasts long and even though throughout the day it doesn&#x27;t stay fresh and red, it still has a hint of red, which is why i prefer by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a dark haired, green eyed  friend, thinking it would look better with her coloring,</li>
            <li> color is a dark merlot or dark bing cherry more purple than red.</li>
            <li> I apply my lip gloss first and dab this to my lips since this can be slightly dry for me as I have DRY lips.</li>
            <li> VERY long lasting, high pigment, no real bleeding or cracking in my experience, as long as you moisturize beforehand and exfoliate your lips on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> the price was a little high</li>
            <li> The ONLY downside is that it tends to dry out my lips a bit, so I double up with some chapstick.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to use it if it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> I might wear it to the ball, but sadly too loud and not quiet the right color for me.</li>
            <li> I Never d Much Luck With Red Lipstick Before Trying This One.</li>
            <li> it stays on very long.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips</li>

            <li> Its texture does dry your lips a little in order to create that matte effect.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I am sorry but the red I just received does NOT match the red on the pictures...</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but I wear lipstick every day.  </li>
            <li> tube is sturdy and the cap snaps firmly into place, so</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this lipstick and just wish they had it in different color.</li>
            <li> wonderful item, i like it it stay in your lip ! it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips i recommend this item</li>
            <li> color is awesome and its matted so it&#x27;s long lasting :) will be purchasing it again and the price was good</li>
            <li> This lipstick really depends on how you apply it. For sure you have to prepare your lips with some lip balm or oil before you put this on. Its texture does dry your lips a little in order to create that matte effect. Package is ok, lipstick turns out to be somewhat melted look. Smells like plastic, other than these. It is long lasting and the color is pretty.</li>
            <li> I am an avid lipstick wearer!  I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but I wear lipstick every day.  I especially love a great HOT red...I bought this red because it said how bright and vivid it was, and I also prefer a matte finish because I don&#x27;t have to re-apply during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick was not as drying as my other matte lipsticks,which was nice; however the red is nowhere as vivid as the picture or the description stated. So I was disappointed in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer my dose of colors and Nars dragon red matte over this for the price point.</li>
            <li> Red, red, red, can not get enough of Red Lipstick!</li>
            <li> goregous, hawt, bold and sexy&lt;br /&gt;as the name depicts &amp;#34;soft matte red&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt dry out your lips like some matte lipstick brands&lt;br /&gt;its beautiful</li>
            <li> Just the best lipstick you can buy. Period. Lasts all day long, barely have to apply. The ONLY downside is that it tends to dry out my lips a bit, so I double up with some chapstick. Problem solved. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> color is a dark merlot or dark bing cherry more purple than red. Save your money</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure to purchase this item, but im soo glad I did. Stays on for hours :)</li>
            <li> I found the color of this lipstick to be more orange than classic red.  I prefer more blue-based reds.  Also the formula was too drying and waxy feeling.  I gave this to a dark haired, green eyed  friend, thinking it would look better with her coloring, (I am fair, with blonde hair/blue eyes).  In addition I thought it was overpriced at $15;  Loreal makes better products for under $10.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is great! it&#x27;s long lasting and the color is so rich! I do love this one cause it&#x27;s not expensive at all and you get the same quality as the really expensive brands.</li>
            <li> first time trying. usually wear ruby woo by Mac. heard good things about this brand and thought I&#x27;d try. I&#x27;m a matte wearer and this works. to keep it on longer, apply, blot, apply blot (x3).</li>
            <li> This lipstick color is ok not like the picture though, it is dark matte red. And it is too dry which I don&#x27;t like that&#x27;s why I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> i love love love this lipstick! the shade is beautiful and the lipstick case is really cool. the lipstick itself stays on for awhile even after eating and drinking. i dont mind having to reapply the lipstick i love it so much i want to wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> I wear vintage clothing (Etsy addict), and I was interested in this lipstick when I read that it was inspired by 1940&#x27;s reds. I had hoped to find an all-natural lipstick that would last, but after trying many different brands, I knew I would have to compromise. I was pleased that this one is paraben free, although I would still have to ingest some artificial coloring for the sake of beauty. This lipstick stays on great, and it is not too drying. I would highly recommend this for vintage gals, and any gal who wants a long-lasting matte red.</li>
            <li> Too dry and didn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all, even when I applied a chap-stick prior to application. I understand it&#x27;s paraben-fee but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to use it if it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> I think this color is not red... I don&#x27;t know its seems like raspberry to me... its not how its looks on picture</li>
            <li> This Lipstick is a gorgeous Red Color without the greasy - runny look or feel.  It is a bit dryer than most lipsticks but I&#x27;m willing to \\&quot;put up with that\\&quot; because it&#x27;s Paraben Free and better for your lips.  It stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge like many of the other brands do.  It&#x27;s my new favorite - a bit more than I usually pay but really worth the expense.  Love It..</li>
            <li> This is one of the prettiest reds I have ever seen. I was so anxious to get it. I wanted something similar to the M.A.C red and this is it. The lipstick arrives in a cute little silver case and arrives in a decent amount of time. I tried it on in the car and was impressed. It went on smooth but might have gone on better if I had moisturized my lips properly. It shows up very nice and vibrant and makes my teeth look extremely white. Overall I really like the look and feel of the lipstick. I lack one star because I put it on and wiped it off so I can&#x27;t really rate it on the lasting scale as far as how long it stays on or how many times I need to reapply.</li>
            <li> The perfect red I have been looking for for 3years. It&#x27;s amazing. Buy it and you won&#x27;t regret</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. Nice and pigmented.</li>
            <li> I like the product. Lips are lush and chap-free after application.Does not leave lips dry. This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Loved this color. Perfect red.</li>
            <li> the color is super hot, and chic, totally worth the price, for day and night looks fab! I love it</li>
            <li> I Never d Much Luck With Red Lipstick Before Trying This One. It Lasts Forever And Is The Absolute Perfect Shade Of Red! I Wore It Out Fo Dinner And Drinks, And Never Had To Reapply. Awesome Product!</li>
            <li> love .love,this is the best shade of red so far i ever bought and fits my skin tone.i really dont have to use a lot and the color and matte effect isnt too overbearing.its sort of gives u this sophisticated look.its become my signature,plus it last even after hours of applying.</li>
            <li> I love love love this lipstick.  I can not express howwww much I love this!  DidI say I love this, plus I received this less then a week.  Great seller!</li>
            <li> It does become dry after a while. You must reapply or gloss it for moisture. Other than that i love the color and still wear it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice red, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was a 100% matte finish.  And unfortunately it isn&#x27;t colorstay.</li>
            <li> If you seek a true red that stays on, this is it. I have forsaken all other lipsticks for this one. Please oh please keep making it.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the fact it stays on without drying the lips. You can mix it with other lipstick colors and it comes out great everytime.</li>
            <li> I like that it stays on very long. But, I found the color to be closer to a raspberry than red. (I saw that another reviewer said it was orangey for her). I have golden skin and so I do prefer something with the blue tones to avoid that orange look, but this one really is too of a berry shade than red on me. I am in search of a classic red....anyone know of one that may work for me?</li>
            <li> I work in a coffee shop and I am constantly drinking something -- tea, coffee, water, smoothies -- so I need a lipstick that can stand up to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick is matte, and definitely not something you can just \\&quot;swipe on.\\&quot; Application is best with a lipstick brush and some time, but the results are fantastic. VERY long lasting, high pigment, no real bleeding or cracking in my experience, as long as you moisturize beforehand and exfoliate your lips on a regular basis. I generally only need to apply it once in the morning, with a touch up after work. I also think it makes my teeth look whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is sturdy and the cap snaps firmly into place, so I don&#x27;t worry about it coming open in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seems too pink for a true red. I found it overwhelming. I might wear it to the ball, but sadly too loud and not quiet the right color for me. Also quite dry.</li>
            <li> Oh so pretty! Finally a red lipstick that looks good on me. I have very pale skin and blonde hair. I&#x27;ve always love the pale face with red lipstick look, but have never been able to achieve it. Until now. I do think it looks better if applied with a lipstick brush. I love that it is made without parabens. If you buy this I don&#x27;t think you will regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this lipstick for all that fancy dinners I&#x27;ll be going to in London this year!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  This is truly a matte lipstick.  It stays on all day, even if you eat food.  I am going to look around for some more by Vasanti Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Beautiful red, doesnt dry at all. It is one of the best red lipsticks ive had in a very long time</li>
            <li> Very good lipstick.  Lasts all day long :)</li>
            <li> Returned it. The picture of the lipstick is much different then the color of the lipstick. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> Amazing color doesn&#x27;t feather or smudge.  Feels great on your lips and doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out your lips.</li>
            <li> This lipstick has true staying power....it is a rich, deep red.....but I must say...applying it is more like using a crayon...it is not creamy...which helps it not to feather.....but a lovely lipstick none the less.......</li>
            <li> I am sorry but the red I just received does NOT match the red on the pictures...at all.&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick is much darker, kinda grandma red, and I don&#x27;t like it. So unhappy with this purchase, such a waist of money!!!&lt;br /&gt;The red on their pictures either is Photoshop or that&#x27;s not the red they are selling and the red lipstick I just received.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s what I was looking for, love it, it&#x27;s the matte red color that I like!!&lt;br /&gt;I like vasanti red lipstick color yeah:))</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOOVVVEEE this! I&#x27;ve been looking for a bright red lipstick for a while &amp; this is exactly what i wanted! the price was a little high but it is definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth. Amazing matte red. :) What more can I say? This is officially my favorite lipstick. :)</li>
            <li> Perfectly matte! Stays on all day too!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite red lipstick ever!!! It got here fast and in good condition, the color is smooth and goes on and stays on very well</li>
            <li> Very nice lipstick! Highly recommend. I think it goes with every skin tone</li>
            <li> This is a matt finish and i love it. I apply my lip gloss first and dab this to my lips since this can be slightly dry for me as I have DRY lips. The color lasts long and even though throughout the day it doesn&#x27;t stay fresh and red, it still has a hint of red, which is why i prefer by the end of the day. I don&#x27;t reapply, but maybe dab a little again before my lip gloss. Love it.</li>
            <li> this Red matte is by far my favorite brand and color. it has just the right amount of moisture while still having a matte look. this is my second purchase and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t bleed, color is bright and I&#x27;m a little shocked with the superior quality and feel, it feels very light, not like I&#x27;ve smeared paste all over my lips. It&#x27;s for sure something I&#x27;ll buy again when needed</li>
