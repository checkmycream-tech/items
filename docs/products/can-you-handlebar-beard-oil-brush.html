            <li>This is easily one of the best products I have ever used for hair care.  </li>
            <li>was very good at distributing the beard oil more evenly over my beard.  </li>
            <li>well, it isn&#x27;t THAT good, but it is a kinder, gentler way to apply their beard oil to my beard.  </li>
            <li>I will just keep brushing my beard because it feels so good.  </li>
            <li>BUT in the end, it&#x27;s a really nice brush that feels GREAT on the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>br /&gt;very good ship</li>

            <li>Good quality brush.</li>
            <li>Its a good size</li>
            <li>Plus,using this brush is ridiulously addicting because it just feels so damned good.  </li>
            <li>and then I am good to go.</li>
            <li>But, it feels damn good.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s how good it feels.</li>

            <li>(well my husband) love it!</li>
            <li>Love the brush however the description read as follows &amp;#34;3 Day Sale!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found this gem!</li>
            <li>This brush is very nice to use and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing</li>
            <li>This is simply an amazing brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as good as my lovely wife running her fingers through my beard...</li>
            <li>It really does a great job!</li>
            <li>The brush conditions and leaves a nice shine to the beard.</li>
            <li>Got a nice email from the company as well with tips on usage.</li>
            <li>It also came in a nice tin, which matches his CanYouHandlebar beard oil well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was nice.  </li>
            <li>My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I use it to apply oil to my beard and it provides a nice even coat.</li>
            <li>brother used to use a pocket comb to make sure his beard would stay in good order, and to spread beard oil throughout his beard.</li>
            <li>So, I had to get my own.</li>
            <li>Both the size of the brush and the protective tin make it handy for travel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an extremely effective combination for me.</li>
            <li>It works really nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice beard brush.</li>
            <li>It helps to distribute the oils and conditioners better than the comb and feels good while using on the face.  </li>
            <li>I used a comb alone before, but this brush it completes the grooming process really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice quality brush</li>
            <li>Storage tin is a nice addition.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s what a nice wood comb is for.  </li>
            <li>The handmade aspect is nice, I can tell this was not made by a machine/assembly line.</li>
            <li>I received  this  product  for  an  honest  review.</li>
            <li>I have beard with a nice V shape that looks well groomed and shinny.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it along with Cowboy Concoctions Beard Balm, and it fits nicely into the tin.</li>
            <li>Nice way to groom beard</li>
            <li>It comes with a metal storage container which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hands from getting all greasy which is nice.</li>
            <li>It is a nice brush</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Nice quality brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality brush and perfect size.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush, perfect for applying oil to your beard!</li>
            <li>The brush works and it&#x27;s awesome and soft to the face!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves it and the company even sent me a nice email about beard grooming, very thoughtful</li>
            <li>so it fits comfortably in your hand and gets a good amount of hair in each</li>
            <li>The bristles are the perfect combo of soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>He liked the design and love the metal tin case it came it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soft and feels wonderful against my beard and face!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and compact/tight and has a good contour.</li>
            <li>It came early and worked great!</li>
            <li>Great brush, fits right into hand, I got this as a gift to put together with the oil and wax for my dad and he loves it.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not allowed to have a grizzly adams beard at work - so this brush works perfectly to keep it clean looking ;)</li>
            <li>This brush is wonderful for giving my beard a nice finished look, I always use the brush to touch up the shape, a comb just goes to deep for shaping.  </li>
            <li>After applying my wet beard oil with my fingers, this brush does do a good job of making my beard look awesome!</li>
            <li>It also feels great on the beard hair and it is very gentle on it.</li>
            <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t even know this was a thing, but it is, a very cool thing in fact.</li>
            <li>but I can say that the quality looks great and was exactly as it was pictured.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this great beard brush ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I, myself, like a good wash and balm, and nothing helps smooth it all out and shape it than a nice comb, followed by the friendly neighborhood Beard Oil Brush.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and makes my beard look really nice and well groomed.</li>
            <li>The brush does a wonderful job of blending the dry oil, which I warm in the palms of my hands, and works the oil throughout my beard.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use this on your face like with most beard brushes.  </li>
            <li>You cannot have this without the Wisdom beard oil :)</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that he loves it.</li>

            <li>Great brush, soft yet effective at dispersing beard oil.</li>
            <li>Ended up ordering a boar&#x27;s head brush which works much better.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>

            <li>He was able to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; when I gifted this to him.</li>
            <li>I use the balm mostly for the skin under the beard, and because it does a better job in helping the beard hold its shape.</li>
            <li>Works efficiently and I would gladly purchase again.</li>
            <li>Although it does reach the roots somewhat, it pushes around my beard more than combs through it.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>I love the</li>

            <li>Love the control I have over my lengthy beard with this brush.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it if that is what u were looking for</li>
            <li>the brush has a wooden handle, fits perfectly in the palm of your hand..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it more if the bristles were a bit shorter/stiffer.</li>
            <li>Comes in a metal container to keep it clean and looking nice.</li>
            <li>Works pretty nice, the hair bristles hold conditioner/oil so that when I brush it helps spread the oils around nicely.  </li>
            <li>Product works great and constructed of high quality materials.</li>
            <li>It helps him comb his hair quickly so that it looks well groomed and perfectly in place, and feels soft from the beard oil.</li>
            <li>This brush works perfectly with the CanYouHandlebar dry beard oil conditioner.</li>
            <li>I got this to assist in the application of the dry oil and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Super nice brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is very, very soft and feels great on my skin and beard.  </li>
            <li>Very soft bristles and a great handcrafted design.  </li>
            <li>If you have a beard and want to be proud of that sucker then you&#x27;d best be using some special tings to help it along.</li>
            <li>This brush is awesome and makes applying dry beard oil a breeze!</li>
            <li>The most fantastic beard brush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recall (since I&#x27;m using the Amazon app to write the review) if the description of this brush mentions is kind of small, but still works perfect for my beard.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;ve never tried soft bristles and want to give it a shot, this is a great brush</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and good looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size for any beard and works great whether it&#x27;s paired with their dry beard oil or just used as a grooming tool.</li>
            <li>Nice brush and just the right size.</li>
            <li>The brush works great to calm down that itchiness felt in the first months of growing your beard and is a perfect complement to any of the oils.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is it the perfect size for travel, its the perfect shape for everyday use!  </li>
            <li>He said it turned easily in the oils and was easy to apply to his beard.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Says that it gets all of the longer hairs up and pointed out so they are easily trimmed away.  </li>
            <li>Hairs fall out too easy</li>
            <li>That makes it easy for him to carry while he is traveling.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The item arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a glossy finish and is easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>He also said it was easy for him to travel with when he has to travel for work.</li>
            <li>Not an issue though, as this makes applying beard oil much easier, and also puts a nice, neat, static-free finish on my more unruly hairs.</li>
            <li>you want something to dig into your beard to scratch underneath - I would get something firmer, but this brush is well constructed, came in it&#x27;s own tin, and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The brush is fine.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and his beard is now finally groomed and looks pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is ideal for anyone with facial hair, whether you have scruff or a full blown beard.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush that easily gets through my beard.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to hold onto and helps smooth my beard after applying beard oil.</li>
            <li>and he says this makes it completely easy for him to apply the beard oil as well as smooth out his beard.</li>
            <li>but it works fine for oiling.</li>
            <li>It makes his beard very soft and a bit bushy, but in the good way.</li>
            <li>Really awesome little brush.  </li>
            <li>Give your best friend a little TLC.  </li>
            <li>it comes in a little metal can (perfect for traveling)</li>
            <li>I use this to apply beard oil and I am a huge fan.</li>
            <li>This will definitely be a great present for the bearded man in your life.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a great brush.</li>
            <li>Great overall brush to use for beard care.</li>
            <li>This  beard oil brush is made of wood and genuine horse hair.</li>
            <li>I had an issue over a free add on item and they resolved almost in the blink of an eye.</li>
            <li>This size of this brush is great for the short to medium length beard.  </li>
            <li>It takes real willpower to stop using it, because it feels so damn good as it brushes my facial hairs into place...just a nice smooth sensation!  </li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in the hand and can get under the nose for brushing out a mustache as well.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free for the intent of review but that has not changed my opinion or altered my thoughts on it at all.</li>
            <li>Leaves your beard nice and straight.</li>
            <li>i really do enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly firm, excellently-sized excellent, decently-priced beard brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it folks :)</li>
            <li>I was purchasing this brush to replace my trusty old pocket comb (after an untimely death) to maintain my now fairly wel grown beard.</li>
            <li>Cleaned it up with some good old fashion soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Its effective on its own, but in conjunction with their solid beard oil</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>It brushes well and oils up the fur quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>The bristles  are strong enough to do a good job on my goatee.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brush and this company, their customer service is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this thing and use it first thing in the morning and every evening.</li>
            <li>bristles barely get under my beard but it does a good job of keeping the beard at bay</li>
            <li>it comes in is beneficial as it keeps the brush clean and protected.</li>
            <li>but this is by far my most favorite.</li>
            <li>Bristles are perfect texture not to soft, or to coarse .</li>
            <li>This brush works great to get the dry beard oil worked into my beard.</li>
            <li>Very soft and nice to use.</li>
            <li>This brush is nicely made and fits well in the palm of your hand, but because it is very soft horse hair</li>
            <li>It is just the right size and fits easily into the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>CanYouHandlebar has a whole line of other products for yourself or gifts for others that are all just as good at this one!!  </li>
            <li>it comes in so you don&#x27;t even have to gift wrap if you give it to someone for a special occasion.  </li>
            <li>This is just the right size for the care and feeding of my beard!</li>
            <li>brush has natural hair bristles and the wood has a nice finish.</li>
            <li>Overall, a fairly underwhelming experience.</li>
            <li>He said it feels good in his hands and allows him to apply beard oil without getting his hands all greasy and gross.</li>
            <li>you leave it in the tin (which is really cool, and makes you want to leave it in there) and use and kinda beard balm or oil</li>
            <li>and it really does help his beard oil absorb better into his beard</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>It also does a good enough job shaping the beard if you use some product.</li>
            <li>It even comes in a cool tin case.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy construction and comes in a stylish protective tin.</li>
            <li>Cool brush.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It also works really good to shape up the external beard layer.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, soft brush.</li>
            <li>This comes in a nice tin that holds the brush so that it stays clean when not in use and makes it easy to travel with if necessary.</li>
            <li>, it seems to be absorbing the oil more than is going on my beard</li>
            <li>Best way to tame my beard and the bristles a perfect combo of soft and firm.</li>
            <li>For the person who is serious about growing a beard and looking good along the way, this is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li>but once it is seasoned I think it will be just fine.  </li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly and arrived as described.</li>
            <li>Luckily with a quick wash and a dab of beard oil this brush defines and molds my beard into perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came in a really cute little tin can, it is very cute and the bristles are nice and soft .My</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been told he&#x27;s very satisfied with the product, and that he will never go back to using a comb.</li>
            <li>He uses it with his favorite beard balm and says it really gets the balm deep into his beard and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This is one of those things that most men don&#x27;t even realize they need until they have it; and then they realize they can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It is compact, easy to use, and gentle on the beard.</li>
            <li>Very nice a friend of mine uses it along with a few of there other products and thinks they are great.</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like wet dog (boar bristle brushes tend to, this one just spells like glue when it first arrives) and it feels nice going through my beard.  </li>
            <li>I was sceptical at first, but this brush compared to a standard plastic comb on my beard is so much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Soft, no hard plastic edges, excellent for grooming facial hair.</li>
            <li>If I were still sporting a full beard I would have liked to see the bristles to be a bit more stiff.</li>

            <li>This product does not look cheap and instead has a very committed look that matches your beard ideals.</li>
            <li>After using this brush for a few days I can recommend it for anyone looking for a quality brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>It feels absolutely amazing and the results, when combined with proper wax/oil/balm, will astound you.</li>
            <li>A great soft brush to get solid beard oil distributed into your beard, and getting it in style</li>
            <li>well worth buying .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li>The brush does apply the beard oil quite well and the tin container is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>More soft than a boar brush.  </li>
            <li>I also love the can that keeps the brush soft with the oil that remains on it.</li>
            <li>- I would liked it twice or three times of its current size.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, but true</li>
            <li>Liked the horsehair bristles - just the right amount - firm, yet soft - can&#x27;t imagine boar bristles feeling good.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job at keeping those beard hairs tame and manageable.</li>
            <li>The high quality horse hair this is built with move finely and swiftly through his beard, and un-knots his beard while evenly spreading the oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had a couple bristles come out, but that&#x27;s normal, most brushes shed allot more than this one.  </li>
            <li>Use it with some beard card gloss/wax tub that the brush fits right in.</li>
            <li>Right as I was about to buy another, I saw it was on sale and got it.</li>
            <li>Seems like the right thing to do.</li>
            <li>Retains just the right amount of oil or wax if used after applying those products.</li>
            <li>Gets right into my beard with beard oil and sculpts well too.</li>
            <li>Brush fits right in your hand.</li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>The material is not irritating to my skin and it has helped my beard looking clean and neat.</li>
            <li>It keeps our beards soft, managable, and clean!</li>
            <li>works excellent with dry or wet oils</li>
            <li>This brush is the perfect combination of smooth and firm to help ease itchy and rough beards.  </li>
            <li>Works great to tame the Mane!</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my beard, and holds the scent of the oil on the brush.</li>
            <li>But I realized it is very much needed for care and storage.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but seems like good quality.</li>
            <li>It’s also really high quality, with a nice wooden handle and quality bristles.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love this brush, it works well with the Liberty balm I recently purchased.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>I use it to brush the hair on my chest ;)</li>
            <li>First time using a brush like this</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it made me giggle.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more as gifts for my breaded friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some bristles fell out when it first arrived (a day before the intitial delivery estimate began.</li>
            <li>Has definitely helped get my beard from scraggly to more tamed</li>
            <li>but this is better for when the beard is short.  </li>
            <li>It move the whiskers in the right direction easier for training the beard to lay in a certain direction.  </li>
            <li>: The soft bristles do feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my Fiance for Valentine&#x27;s Day and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly to apply the oil and comb that puffy, difficult to manage beard.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a beard brush connoisseur, but this seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Bristles are super soft!!</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li>I use this brush to help settle in the balm closer to the skin after application and it does a marvelous job penetrating through my thick, coarse face forest.</li>
            <li>It’s just scratchy enough to feel good and get into his facial hair well, but not so scratchy that it hurts his skin.</li>
            <li>My husband positively loves this beard brush .This</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>Soft enough to feel great on the skin, but sturdy enough to shape well.</li>
            <li>He says it creates a better overall shave and makes it easier to get clean lines when it has all been brushed the correct direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits into the palm of your hand and the bristles are super soft.  </li>
            <li>For most of the beards that are over a month long, oil alone will not do the trick, you need a brush to really help work it in and make it look presentable</li>
            <li>I can easily grip the brush and some of the bristles to properly brush through my beard.</li>
            <li>Bristles are strong enough to move through beard without pulling.</li>
            <li>Along with its pleasant smell, the bristles are strong enough to get down to the roots of each follicle yet soft enough to lightly massage the skin underneath</li>
            <li>Must-have for beards of a certain length.</li>
            <li>It is a beard oil brush, used for working in and spreading beard oil or certain beard balms.</li>
            <li>I have had shaving brushes that have smelled like wet dog and this brush smells fresh and clean right out of the tin.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t too rough and feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>(it’s a nice little massage for him).</li>
            <li>Brush comes in handy little container.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush for wet or dry use.</li>
            <li>I have a short beard that isn&#x27;t very thick on the cheeks, and I also trimmed it, which in hindsight wasn&#x27;t the best idea.  </li>
            <li>, that said, I would not send it back, instead I will continue to use it since it is very well done and comfortable to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i really didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>It seems very well produced</li>
            <li>Really wanted this brush but couldn&#x27;t justify the cost.</li>
            <li>He uses this brush to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; his beard when he&#x27;s getting ready to trim it.  </li>
            <li>I need something with much stiffer bristles for that,</li>
            <li>Never had a beard brush before, but after much research  </li>
            <li>This brush does really well at getting the oil spread evenly.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks his beard is looking much healthier and the difference in touch is very noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it would work very well if you didn&#x27;t use an oil or a balm with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I ever really looked forward to brushing my beard until I got this thing</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t try anything cheaper, so I can&#x27;t really compare.</li>
            <li>So much easier</li>
            <li>Thanks CYH</li>
            <li>He cleans it once a week with gentle soap and water.</li>
            <li>It really shapes my scruffy beard.</li>
            <li>was very efficient.</li>
            <li>I also found it much easier to apply beard oil with this brush rather than my fingers.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really loves this beard and mustache brush.</li>
            <li>I used it with my beard oil and it worked very well and helped to evenly distribute the oil.</li>
            <li>Which it really does work very well for.</li>
            <li>no matter what you choose this gentle brush will apply evenly to all fo locals of your majestic beard</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really bought it</li>
            <li>The brush comes in a very neat canister.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my beard shine, in the right light, and it makes it soft even to the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li>I think that this brush would be perfect for shorter beard lengths, say less than 1&amp;#34;, but for me it doesn&#x27;t really seem to get past the surface of my beard or allow me to shape my beard in the way that i&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>For All Beard Balms and Oils | Natural, Soft Horse Hair &amp;#34; when I purchased it and I did not receive the free classic beard balm.  </li>
            <li>The hair on the brush is very soft but still strong enough to brush through my bread.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;d change about it, other than I would like a handle on the top of the brush</li>
            <li>Makes it real soft and gives it a nice little shine too.</li>
            <li>Top quality and softer than the average hair brush.</li>
            <li>You might want to air it out for a couple of days when you first get it, like any natural brush it needs to air out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality, but if I&#x27;m judging the product on its overall value, I have to say it seems a little overpriced.</li>
            <li>product is a beard oil brush made of natural soft horse hair , it is great for dry or wet beards.</li>
            <li>As many of you know beards become subject to knots, tangling, and even sometimes they can become painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use less oil and apply it more evenly with this brush.</li>
            <li>It felt like I had to use a much greater amount to get the brush wet than if I directly applied the oil to my beard with</li>
            <li>He said the brush bristles were very soft and was easy to use to apply the dry oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all their products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It appears to be high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to all you guys that have beards.</li>
            <li>He naturally uses it with the other beard products in this line and his beard has never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product for the men with beards!!</li>
            <li>The little container that it comes in is a plus :)</li>
            <li>and I wish the brush would be a little bit more disciplinary against my whiskers</li>
            <li>I do wish the bristles would dig a little deeper and give me the satisfaction of scrubbing the skin below my beard, but still, I can&#x27;t complain about the way my beard looks and feels afterwards, so if that&#x27;s what matters most to you</li>
            <li>Arrived, straight out of the can, with one complete bunch of bristles detached.</li>
            <li>It is soft and gently caresses your beard into shape.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft because they are made out of real horse hair.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, my husband likes it just fine.</li>
            <li>Have used the brush for just a few days, but so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Spreads around beard oil ok but only on the surface, not much use at all for beard grooming.</li>
            <li>You will love these little brushes!</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are *very* soft compared to the one I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and I like the tin can to store the brush.  </li>
            <li>Very soft.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself seems high quality as far as the wood and horsehair.</li>
            <li>The brush is not to hard and soft enough to feel good.</li>
            <li>I spent a long time lookin for a natural brush that was neither too soft nor too hard; the CanYouHandlebar beard oil brush is the perfect balance.</li>
            <li>It really helps him get into the scruff, and I think he just enjoys using the brush in general</li>
            <li>I really like the general usefulness of this brush.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised it came in a can!</li>
            <li>The brush is nice I have used it every other day for roughly 3 weeks and have not witnessed any shedding of sorts...</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Worth it with the dry oil.</li>
            <li>No more scratchy bristles, no more pulling at snags, just a soft, gentle, but very effective way to manage my beard.  </li>
            <li>So my older brother is very keen on growing long beards, and sometimes the beards are even longer than his hair.</li>
            <li>has really noticed the difference in how soft and groomed his facial hair is.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one comment he made was - the bristles are soft??</li>
            <li>Bought this around a month ago and wanted to give it the old college try before writing anything.  </li>
            <li>my beard is about 5 moonths old now and was getting scraggly as hell</li>
            <li>These brushes shed a bit, but you have to expect that with a natural brush.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>the soft bristle brush is what I was looking for but could not find.</li>
            <li>and I do not feel the soft bristles penetrate all the way through.</li>
            <li>I would say that the CanYouHandlebar team offers it this way because if it was stiffer, we would damage our face scalp.</li>
            <li>He either pours it directly on the brush and works it in or he will put oil on his hands to work it in his beard and then goes over it with this brush.</li>
            <li>So far, my husband has used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li>I believe the bristles are natural and not synthetic, and it helps to distribute his beard oils throughout his beard.</li>
            <li>He only complains about the bristles falling out at a fast pace.</li>
            <li>So far we have not seen any issues with the brush shedding any of the hairs.</li>
            <li>this canyouhandlebar brush is soft on your face and it make want to keep brushing for hours..</li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles itself are so soft and makes my husband&#x27;s beard really soft to the the touch.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the beard oil and it maintains the softness of my beard and keeps it from extending to far out from my face.  </li>
            <li>it seems to be too soft for my lengthy beard.  </li>
            <li>Yeah its a little pricey compared to some of the other brushes but honestly, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>As it is not that stiff, it is most likely used to get the oils to the skin and massage it rather than targeted to untangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since he&#x27;s been using it his facial hair is much more tame and softer looking.</li>
            <li>Can be first used to brush out the beard while it is dry, then like my husband does, it can be also used to lather up in preparation to shave.</li>
            <li>Stellar tool for adding the can you handle bar dry beard oil to an unruly bearded fellow.</li>
            <li>The brush is also a little on the soft side for my beard, making it less effective than I would like.</li>
            <li>At first I was not sure on the shape but the first time I used it</li>
            <li>While men sporting lengthy beards could certainly use the brush and enjoy the beard oil-spreading benefits touted in the description, the horse-hair bristles may not be quite firm enough to penetrate massive beards all the way to the skin.</li>
            <li>I received this Brush for my Husband the other day and he tried it right out.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft while still being strong and stiff enough to get through the beard hair.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly enough, packaged in a cute little tin similar to what you might get beard balm in.</li>
            <li>Combs can be harsh on your whiskers, this oil brush feels so sweet and soothing on my beard and moustache.  </li>
            <li>and he really likes that the bristles are not hard and sharp feeling against his skin.</li>
            <li>Hey, those concerned about the smell of the new brush, I left the container</li>
            <li>The only thing I will mention for feedback is that it had a lacquer smell from being newly coated but that went away with exposure to air out.</li>
            <li>And knowing it was recently branded/coated means it is new...</li>
            <li>Fathers Day is just around the corner!!!&lt;br /&gt;Gents, if you wanna impress the ladies, get a beard oil brush to tame that mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a full promotional discount to purchase, test and review this beard brush.</li>
            <li>have found a lot of products like this are starting to appear on the market more now then in the past, this one is definitely a keeper and</li>
            <li>It glides right through the beard to smooth the oil onto my face underneath which has been difficult to accomplish until now.  </li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>I actually twist the brush directly on the balm and brush it in from there.</li>
            <li>It might be a bit more expensive than other beard brushes but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>pros: soft, reaches deep into your beard and feels good on your skin cons: you might be late to work, because is hard to stop brushing..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any other brushes to compare it to</li>
            <li>Does a decent enough job as a dry oil applicator but it does not &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my beard</li>
            <li>It keeps his beard soft and not old looking</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t quite dig in to a long beard.</li>
            <li>Yes it smells at first, just let it air out for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Horse hair bristles penetrate your beard providing a gentle massage that is softer than your typical boar bristle beard brushes.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but hey, it&#x27;s real horse hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is light but still tough enough to brush through my husbands beard.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

            <li> Love it, best brush ever....</li>
            <li> This is easily one of the best products I have ever used for hair care.  </li>
            <li> was very good at distributing the beard oil more evenly over my beard.  </li>
            <li> well, it isn&#x27;t THAT good, but it is a kinder, gentler way to apply their beard oil to my beard.  </li>
            <li> I will just keep brushing my beard because it feels so good.  </li>
            <li> BUT in the end, it&#x27;s a really nice brush that feels GREAT on the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;very good ship</li>
            <li> but like I said it&#x27;s a good oil applicator.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush.</li>
            <li> Its a good size</li>
            <li> Plus,using this brush is ridiulously addicting because it just feels so damned good.  </li>
            <li> and then I am good to go.</li>
            <li> But, it feels damn good.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how good it feels.</li>
            <li> Brushing some balm thorough my beard feels good, with this brush</li>
            <li> He said  that  this  is  the  best  beard brush available  on the market .</li>
            <li> This is a great gift product, as it comes in its own tin container</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> The package is very nice that I can gift it because it is nicely package; sitting in a nice tin can.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>

            <li> Love this brush!</li>
            <li> LOVE this beard brush!  </li>
            <li> (well my husband) love it!</li>
            <li> Love the brush however the description read as follows &amp;#34;3 Day Sale!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I found this gem!</li>
            <li> This brush is very nice to use and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing</li>
            <li> This is simply an amazing brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as good as my lovely wife running her fingers through my beard...</li>
            <li> It really does a great job!</li>
            <li> The brush conditions and leaves a nice shine to the beard.</li>
            <li> Got a nice email from the company as well with tips on usage.</li>
            <li> It also came in a nice tin, which matches his CanYouHandlebar beard oil well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was nice.  </li>
            <li> My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply oil to my beard and it provides a nice even coat.</li>
            <li> brother used to use a pocket comb to make sure his beard would stay in good order, and to spread beard oil throughout his beard.</li>
            <li> So, I had to get my own.</li>
            <li> Both the size of the brush and the protective tin make it handy for travel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an extremely effective combination for me.</li>
            <li> It works really nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice beard brush.</li>
            <li> It helps to distribute the oils and conditioners better than the comb and feels good while using on the face.  </li>
            <li> I used a comb alone before, but this brush it completes the grooming process really nice.</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush</li>
            <li> Storage tin is a nice addition.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s what a nice wood comb is for.  </li>
            <li> The handmade aspect is nice, I can tell this was not made by a machine/assembly line.</li>
            <li> I received  this  product  for  an  honest  review.</li>
            <li> I have beard with a nice V shape that looks well groomed and shinny.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it along with Cowboy Concoctions Beard Balm, and it fits nicely into the tin.</li>
            <li> Nice way to groom beard</li>
            <li> It comes with a metal storage container which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hands from getting all greasy which is nice.</li>
            <li> It is a nice brush</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality brush and perfect size.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush, perfect for applying oil to your beard!</li>
            <li> The brush works and it&#x27;s awesome and soft to the face!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it and the company even sent me a nice email about beard grooming, very thoughtful</li>
            <li> so it fits comfortably in your hand and gets a good amount of hair in each</li>
            <li> The bristles are the perfect combo of soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> He liked the design and love the metal tin case it came it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also soft and feels wonderful against my beard and face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and compact/tight and has a good contour.</li>
            <li> It came early and worked great!</li>
            <li> Great brush, fits right into hand, I got this as a gift to put together with the oil and wax for my dad and he loves it.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not allowed to have a grizzly adams beard at work - so this brush works perfectly to keep it clean looking ;)</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful for giving my beard a nice finished look, I always use the brush to touch up the shape, a comb just goes to deep for shaping.  </li>
            <li> After applying my wet beard oil with my fingers, this brush does do a good job of making my beard look awesome!</li>
            <li> It also feels great on the beard hair and it is very gentle on it.</li>
            <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t even know this was a thing, but it is, a very cool thing in fact.</li>
            <li> but I can say that the quality looks great and was exactly as it was pictured.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this great beard brush ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I, myself, like a good wash and balm, and nothing helps smooth it all out and shape it than a nice comb, followed by the friendly neighborhood Beard Oil Brush.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and makes my beard look really nice and well groomed.</li>
            <li> The brush does a wonderful job of blending the dry oil, which I warm in the palms of my hands, and works the oil throughout my beard.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use this on your face like with most beard brushes.  </li>
            <li> You cannot have this without the Wisdom beard oil :)</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that he loves it.</li>
            <li> I recommended this brush for beginningers as we as the advanced beard guy!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Can be done better.  </li>
            <li> Brush has lost more groups of bristles.</li>
            <li> Great brush, soft yet effective at dispersing beard oil.</li>
            <li> Ended up ordering a boar&#x27;s head brush which works much better.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Way better then boars hair brush doesn&#x27;t ripp you&#x27;re beard hair out</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is outstanding.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the customer service from the people at canyouhandlebar.com is top notch.</li>
            <li> He was able to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; when I gifted this to him.</li>
            <li> I use the balm mostly for the skin under the beard, and because it does a better job in helping the beard hold its shape.</li>
            <li> Works efficiently and I would gladly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Although it does reach the roots somewhat, it pushes around my beard more than combs through it.</li>
            <li> love.</li>
            <li> I love the</li>
            <li> You can tell it was made with love.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on getting a beard brush and am somewhat pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it feels as I groom my goatee.  </li>
            <li> I can see this being perfect for a very short beard though.</li>
            <li> I love touching his beard now.</li>
            <li> As soon as the brush was out of its tin, I knew I was going to love it.</li>

            <li> I received this beard oil brush free for my husband to try and review; regardless this is his 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Love the control I have over my lengthy beard with this brush.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it if that is what u were looking for</li>
            <li> the brush has a wooden handle, fits perfectly in the palm of your hand..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it more if the bristles were a bit shorter/stiffer.</li>
            <li> Comes in a metal container to keep it clean and looking nice.</li>
            <li> Works pretty nice, the hair bristles hold conditioner/oil so that when I brush it helps spread the oils around nicely.  </li>
            <li> Product works great and constructed of high quality materials.</li>
            <li> It helps him comb his hair quickly so that it looks well groomed and perfectly in place, and feels soft from the beard oil.</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly with the CanYouHandlebar dry beard oil conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got this to assist in the application of the dry oil and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Super nice brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is very, very soft and feels great on my skin and beard.  </li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and a great handcrafted design.  </li>
            <li> If you have a beard and want to be proud of that sucker then you&#x27;d best be using some special tings to help it along.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome and makes applying dry beard oil a breeze!</li>
            <li> The most fantastic beard brush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recall (since I&#x27;m using the Amazon app to write the review) if the description of this brush mentions is kind of small, but still works perfect for my beard.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;ve never tried soft bristles and want to give it a shot, this is a great brush</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and good looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size for any beard and works great whether it&#x27;s paired with their dry beard oil or just used as a grooming tool.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and just the right size.</li>
            <li> The brush works great to calm down that itchiness felt in the first months of growing your beard and is a perfect complement to any of the oils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is it the perfect size for travel, its the perfect shape for everyday use!  </li>
            <li> He said it turned easily in the oils and was easy to apply to his beard.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Says that it gets all of the longer hairs up and pointed out so they are easily trimmed away.  </li>
            <li> Hairs fall out too easy</li>
            <li> That makes it easy for him to carry while he is traveling.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The item arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a glossy finish and is easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> He also said it was easy for him to travel with when he has to travel for work.</li>
            <li> Not an issue though, as this makes applying beard oil much easier, and also puts a nice, neat, static-free finish on my more unruly hairs.</li>
            <li> you want something to dig into your beard to scratch underneath - I would get something firmer, but this brush is well constructed, came in it&#x27;s own tin, and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine.  </li>
            <li> He loves it and his beard is now finally groomed and looks pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is ideal for anyone with facial hair, whether you have scruff or a full blown beard.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush that easily gets through my beard.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to hold onto and helps smooth my beard after applying beard oil.</li>
            <li> and he says this makes it completely easy for him to apply the beard oil as well as smooth out his beard.</li>
            <li> but it works fine for oiling.</li>
            <li> It makes his beard very soft and a bit bushy, but in the good way.</li>
            <li> Really awesome little brush.  </li>
            <li> Give your best friend a little TLC.  </li>
            <li> it comes in a little metal can (perfect for traveling)</li>
            <li> I use this to apply beard oil and I am a huge fan.</li>
            <li> This will definitely be a great present for the bearded man in your life.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a great brush.</li>
            <li> Great overall brush to use for beard care.</li>
            <li> This  beard oil brush is made of wood and genuine horse hair.</li>
            <li> I had an issue over a free add on item and they resolved almost in the blink of an eye.</li>
            <li> This size of this brush is great for the short to medium length beard.  </li>
            <li> It takes real willpower to stop using it, because it feels so damn good as it brushes my facial hairs into place...just a nice smooth sensation!  </li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in the hand and can get under the nose for brushing out a mustache as well.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for free for the intent of review but that has not changed my opinion or altered my thoughts on it at all.</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard nice and straight.</li>
            <li> i really do enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly firm, excellently-sized excellent, decently-priced beard brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it folks :)</li>
            <li> I was purchasing this brush to replace my trusty old pocket comb (after an untimely death) to maintain my now fairly wel grown beard.</li>
            <li> Cleaned it up with some good old fashion soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Its effective on its own, but in conjunction with their solid beard oil</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> It brushes well and oils up the fur quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> The bristles  are strong enough to do a good job on my goatee.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush and this company, their customer service is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this thing and use it first thing in the morning and every evening.</li>
            <li> bristles barely get under my beard but it does a good job of keeping the beard at bay</li>
            <li> it comes in is beneficial as it keeps the brush clean and protected.</li>
            <li> but this is by far my most favorite.</li>
            <li> Bristles are perfect texture not to soft, or to coarse .</li>
            <li> This brush works great to get the dry beard oil worked into my beard.</li>
            <li> Very soft and nice to use.</li>
            <li> This brush is nicely made and fits well in the palm of your hand, but because it is very soft horse hair</li>
            <li> It is just the right size and fits easily into the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> CanYouHandlebar has a whole line of other products for yourself or gifts for others that are all just as good at this one!!  </li>
            <li> it comes in so you don&#x27;t even have to gift wrap if you give it to someone for a special occasion.  </li>
            <li> This is just the right size for the care and feeding of my beard!</li>
            <li> brush has natural hair bristles and the wood has a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Overall, a fairly underwhelming experience.</li>
            <li> He said it feels good in his hands and allows him to apply beard oil without getting his hands all greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> you leave it in the tin (which is really cool, and makes you want to leave it in there) and use and kinda beard balm or oil</li>
            <li> and it really does help his beard oil absorb better into his beard</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> It also does a good enough job shaping the beard if you use some product.</li>
            <li> It even comes in a cool tin case.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy construction and comes in a stylish protective tin.</li>
            <li> Cool brush.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It also works really good to shape up the external beard layer.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, soft brush.</li>
            <li> This comes in a nice tin that holds the brush so that it stays clean when not in use and makes it easy to travel with if necessary.</li>
            <li> , it seems to be absorbing the oil more than is going on my beard</li>
            <li> Best way to tame my beard and the bristles a perfect combo of soft and firm.</li>
            <li> For the person who is serious about growing a beard and looking good along the way, this is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> but once it is seasoned I think it will be just fine.  </li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Luckily with a quick wash and a dab of beard oil this brush defines and molds my beard into perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came in a really cute little tin can, it is very cute and the bristles are nice and soft .My</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been told he&#x27;s very satisfied with the product, and that he will never go back to using a comb.</li>
            <li> He uses it with his favorite beard balm and says it really gets the balm deep into his beard and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that most men don&#x27;t even realize they need until they have it; and then they realize they can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It is compact, easy to use, and gentle on the beard.</li>
            <li> Very nice a friend of mine uses it along with a few of there other products and thinks they are great.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like wet dog (boar bristle brushes tend to, this one just spells like glue when it first arrives) and it feels nice going through my beard.  </li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first, but this brush compared to a standard plastic comb on my beard is so much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Soft, no hard plastic edges, excellent for grooming facial hair.</li>
            <li> If I were still sporting a full beard I would have liked to see the bristles to be a bit more stiff.</li>

            <li> This product does not look cheap and instead has a very committed look that matches your beard ideals.</li>
            <li> After using this brush for a few days I can recommend it for anyone looking for a quality brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> It feels absolutely amazing and the results, when combined with proper wax/oil/balm, will astound you.</li>
            <li> A great soft brush to get solid beard oil distributed into your beard, and getting it in style</li>
            <li> well worth buying .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li> The brush does apply the beard oil quite well and the tin container is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> More soft than a boar brush.  </li>
            <li> I also love the can that keeps the brush soft with the oil that remains on it.</li>
            <li> - I would liked it twice or three times of its current size.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, but true</li>
            <li> Liked the horsehair bristles - just the right amount - firm, yet soft - can&#x27;t imagine boar bristles feeling good.  </li>
            <li> and it does a great job at keeping those beard hairs tame and manageable.</li>
            <li> The high quality horse hair this is built with move finely and swiftly through his beard, and un-knots his beard while evenly spreading the oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a couple bristles come out, but that&#x27;s normal, most brushes shed allot more than this one.  </li>
            <li> Use it with some beard card gloss/wax tub that the brush fits right in.</li>
            <li> Right as I was about to buy another, I saw it was on sale and got it.</li>
            <li> Seems like the right thing to do.</li>
            <li> Retains just the right amount of oil or wax if used after applying those products.</li>
            <li> Gets right into my beard with beard oil and sculpts well too.</li>
            <li> Brush fits right in your hand.</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> The material is not irritating to my skin and it has helped my beard looking clean and neat.</li>
            <li> It keeps our beards soft, managable, and clean!</li>
            <li> works excellent with dry or wet oils</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect combination of smooth and firm to help ease itchy and rough beards.  </li>
            <li> Works great to tame the Mane!</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my beard, and holds the scent of the oil on the brush.</li>
            <li> But I realized it is very much needed for care and storage.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but seems like good quality.</li>
            <li> It’s also really high quality, with a nice wooden handle and quality bristles.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it works well with the Liberty balm I recently purchased.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> I use it to brush the hair on my chest ;)</li>
            <li> First time using a brush like this</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it made me giggle.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy more as gifts for my breaded friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some bristles fell out when it first arrived (a day before the intitial delivery estimate began.</li>
            <li> Has definitely helped get my beard from scraggly to more tamed</li>
            <li> but this is better for when the beard is short.  </li>
            <li> It move the whiskers in the right direction easier for training the beard to lay in a certain direction.  </li>
            <li> : The soft bristles do feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Fiance for Valentine&#x27;s Day and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly to apply the oil and comb that puffy, difficult to manage beard.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a beard brush connoisseur, but this seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Bristles are super soft!!</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush to help settle in the balm closer to the skin after application and it does a marvelous job penetrating through my thick, coarse face forest.</li>
            <li> It’s just scratchy enough to feel good and get into his facial hair well, but not so scratchy that it hurts his skin.</li>
            <li> My husband positively loves this beard brush .This</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> Soft enough to feel great on the skin, but sturdy enough to shape well.</li>
            <li> He says it creates a better overall shave and makes it easier to get clean lines when it has all been brushed the correct direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits into the palm of your hand and the bristles are super soft.  </li>
            <li> For most of the beards that are over a month long, oil alone will not do the trick, you need a brush to really help work it in and make it look presentable</li>
            <li> I can easily grip the brush and some of the bristles to properly brush through my beard.</li>
            <li> Bristles are strong enough to move through beard without pulling.</li>
            <li> Along with its pleasant smell, the bristles are strong enough to get down to the roots of each follicle yet soft enough to lightly massage the skin underneath</li>
            <li> Must-have for beards of a certain length.</li>
            <li> It is a beard oil brush, used for working in and spreading beard oil or certain beard balms.</li>
            <li> I have had shaving brushes that have smelled like wet dog and this brush smells fresh and clean right out of the tin.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too rough and feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> (it’s a nice little massage for him).</li>
            <li> Brush comes in handy little container.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for wet or dry use.</li>
            <li> I have a short beard that isn&#x27;t very thick on the cheeks, and I also trimmed it, which in hindsight wasn&#x27;t the best idea.  </li>
            <li> , that said, I would not send it back, instead I will continue to use it since it is very well done and comfortable to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i really didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> It seems very well produced</li>
            <li> Really wanted this brush but couldn&#x27;t justify the cost.</li>
            <li> He uses this brush to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; his beard when he&#x27;s getting ready to trim it.  </li>
            <li> I need something with much stiffer bristles for that,</li>
            <li> Never had a beard brush before, but after much research  </li>
            <li> This brush does really well at getting the oil spread evenly.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks his beard is looking much healthier and the difference in touch is very noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it would work very well if you didn&#x27;t use an oil or a balm with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I ever really looked forward to brushing my beard until I got this thing</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t try anything cheaper, so I can&#x27;t really compare.</li>
            <li> So much easier</li>
            <li> Thanks CYH</li>
            <li> He cleans it once a week with gentle soap and water.</li>
            <li> It really shapes my scruffy beard.</li>
            <li> was very efficient.</li>
            <li> I also found it much easier to apply beard oil with this brush rather than my fingers.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really loves this beard and mustache brush.</li>
            <li> I used it with my beard oil and it worked very well and helped to evenly distribute the oil.</li>
            <li> Which it really does work very well for.</li>
            <li> no matter what you choose this gentle brush will apply evenly to all fo locals of your majestic beard</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really bought it</li>
            <li> The brush comes in a very neat canister.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my beard shine, in the right light, and it makes it soft even to the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> I think that this brush would be perfect for shorter beard lengths, say less than 1&amp;#34;, but for me it doesn&#x27;t really seem to get past the surface of my beard or allow me to shape my beard in the way that i&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> For All Beard Balms and Oils | Natural, Soft Horse Hair &amp;#34; when I purchased it and I did not receive the free classic beard balm.  </li>
            <li> The hair on the brush is very soft but still strong enough to brush through my bread.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;d change about it, other than I would like a handle on the top of the brush</li>
            <li> Makes it real soft and gives it a nice little shine too.</li>
            <li> Top quality and softer than the average hair brush.</li>
            <li> You might want to air it out for a couple of days when you first get it, like any natural brush it needs to air out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality, but if I&#x27;m judging the product on its overall value, I have to say it seems a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> product is a beard oil brush made of natural soft horse hair , it is great for dry or wet beards.</li>
            <li> As many of you know beards become subject to knots, tangling, and even sometimes they can become painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use less oil and apply it more evenly with this brush.</li>
            <li> It felt like I had to use a much greater amount to get the brush wet than if I directly applied the oil to my beard with</li>
            <li> He said the brush bristles were very soft and was easy to use to apply the dry oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all their products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It appears to be high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to all you guys that have beards.</li>
            <li> He naturally uses it with the other beard products in this line and his beard has never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product for the men with beards!!</li>
            <li> The little container that it comes in is a plus :)</li>
            <li> and I wish the brush would be a little bit more disciplinary against my whiskers</li>
            <li> I do wish the bristles would dig a little deeper and give me the satisfaction of scrubbing the skin below my beard, but still, I can&#x27;t complain about the way my beard looks and feels afterwards, so if that&#x27;s what matters most to you</li>
            <li> Arrived, straight out of the can, with one complete bunch of bristles detached.</li>
            <li> It is soft and gently caresses your beard into shape.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft because they are made out of real horse hair.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, my husband likes it just fine.</li>
            <li> Have used the brush for just a few days, but so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Spreads around beard oil ok but only on the surface, not much use at all for beard grooming.</li>
            <li> You will love these little brushes!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are *very* soft compared to the one I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and I like the tin can to store the brush.  </li>
            <li> Very soft.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself seems high quality as far as the wood and horsehair.</li>
            <li> The brush is not to hard and soft enough to feel good.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time lookin for a natural brush that was neither too soft nor too hard; the CanYouHandlebar beard oil brush is the perfect balance.</li>
            <li> It really helps him get into the scruff, and I think he just enjoys using the brush in general</li>
            <li> I really like the general usefulness of this brush.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised it came in a can!</li>
            <li> The brush is nice I have used it every other day for roughly 3 weeks and have not witnessed any shedding of sorts...</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Worth it with the dry oil.</li>
            <li> No more scratchy bristles, no more pulling at snags, just a soft, gentle, but very effective way to manage my beard.  </li>
            <li> So my older brother is very keen on growing long beards, and sometimes the beards are even longer than his hair.</li>
            <li> has really noticed the difference in how soft and groomed his facial hair is.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one comment he made was - the bristles are soft??</li>
            <li> Bought this around a month ago and wanted to give it the old college try before writing anything.  </li>
            <li> my beard is about 5 moonths old now and was getting scraggly as hell</li>
            <li> These brushes shed a bit, but you have to expect that with a natural brush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li> the soft bristle brush is what I was looking for but could not find.</li>
            <li> and I do not feel the soft bristles penetrate all the way through.</li>
            <li> I would say that the CanYouHandlebar team offers it this way because if it was stiffer, we would damage our face scalp.</li>
            <li> He either pours it directly on the brush and works it in or he will put oil on his hands to work it in his beard and then goes over it with this brush.</li>
            <li> So far, my husband has used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I believe the bristles are natural and not synthetic, and it helps to distribute his beard oils throughout his beard.</li>
            <li> He only complains about the bristles falling out at a fast pace.</li>
            <li> So far we have not seen any issues with the brush shedding any of the hairs.</li>
            <li> this canyouhandlebar brush is soft on your face and it make want to keep brushing for hours..</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles itself are so soft and makes my husband&#x27;s beard really soft to the the touch.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the beard oil and it maintains the softness of my beard and keeps it from extending to far out from my face.  </li>
            <li> it seems to be too soft for my lengthy beard.  </li>
            <li> Yeah its a little pricey compared to some of the other brushes but honestly, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> As it is not that stiff, it is most likely used to get the oils to the skin and massage it rather than targeted to untangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since he&#x27;s been using it his facial hair is much more tame and softer looking.</li>
            <li> Can be first used to brush out the beard while it is dry, then like my husband does, it can be also used to lather up in preparation to shave.</li>
            <li> Stellar tool for adding the can you handle bar dry beard oil to an unruly bearded fellow.</li>
            <li> The brush is also a little on the soft side for my beard, making it less effective than I would like.</li>
            <li> At first I was not sure on the shape but the first time I used it</li>
            <li> While men sporting lengthy beards could certainly use the brush and enjoy the beard oil-spreading benefits touted in the description, the horse-hair bristles may not be quite firm enough to penetrate massive beards all the way to the skin.</li>
            <li> I received this Brush for my Husband the other day and he tried it right out.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft while still being strong and stiff enough to get through the beard hair.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly enough, packaged in a cute little tin similar to what you might get beard balm in.</li>
            <li> Combs can be harsh on your whiskers, this oil brush feels so sweet and soothing on my beard and moustache.  </li>
            <li> and he really likes that the bristles are not hard and sharp feeling against his skin.</li>
            <li> Hey, those concerned about the smell of the new brush, I left the container</li>
            <li> The only thing I will mention for feedback is that it had a lacquer smell from being newly coated but that went away with exposure to air out.</li>
            <li> And knowing it was recently branded/coated means it is new...</li>
            <li> Fathers Day is just around the corner!!!&lt;br /&gt;Gents, if you wanna impress the ladies, get a beard oil brush to tame that mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a full promotional discount to purchase, test and review this beard brush.</li>
            <li> have found a lot of products like this are starting to appear on the market more now then in the past, this one is definitely a keeper and</li>
            <li> It glides right through the beard to smooth the oil onto my face underneath which has been difficult to accomplish until now.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> I actually twist the brush directly on the balm and brush it in from there.</li>
            <li> It might be a bit more expensive than other beard brushes but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> pros: soft, reaches deep into your beard and feels good on your skin cons: you might be late to work, because is hard to stop brushing..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any other brushes to compare it to</li>
            <li> Does a decent enough job as a dry oil applicator but it does not &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my beard</li>
            <li> It keeps his beard soft and not old looking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t quite dig in to a long beard.</li>
            <li> Yes it smells at first, just let it air out for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Horse hair bristles penetrate your beard providing a gentle massage that is softer than your typical boar bristle beard brushes.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but hey, it&#x27;s real horse hair.</li>
            <li> The brush is light but still tough enough to brush through my husbands beard.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something stiff that will pull your beard straight, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> My beard is maybe 1.5 inches long and it feels like this product only brushes a little deeper than the surface, doesn&#x27;t really penetrate to the roots like some reviews claimed.</li>
            <li> A little beard oil goes a long way and this really helps you apply it where you need to.</li>
            <li> The hairs are a little rough at first.</li>
            <li> Not only did the soap turn from white to yellow upon lathering, but the smell only worsened, to what now I can only describe as wet dog vomit.</li>
            <li> Will likely last a long time if taken care of and stored in tin.</li>
            <li> Becoming effectively useless</li>
            <li> and I can tell it will last him a long time.</li>
            <li> just won&#x27;t untangle your beard if a lot or long enough.</li>
            <li> I advise you to comb the beard first if the hair is thick and stubborn on the beard.</li>
            <li> The beard brush works with dry beard oil in tins, as well as traditional bottled beard oils.  </li>
            <li> Let it air dry and then repeated this about 4 times to finally get it all out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but still firm enough to get to your skin for oil application.</li>
            <li> The boar brush is is firm yet very soft on the the beard and face.  </li>
            <li> really loves this little brush , it is a new addition that he did not own yet .We</li>
            <li> ln fact, the other day he ran back home before work to grab this brush as he&#x27;d forgotten to use it before he left the house.</li>
            <li> Cons: I agree with the reviews about this brush being a little too soft.</li>
            <li> if you have a beard and you like to keep it soft and and well groomed, then this little brush is what you need..</li>
            <li> So I rinsed it up to get anymore loose hairs out and left it to dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months, and learned that lesson early on.  </li>
            <li> I have a comb that I like to use for when my beard is long</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a long beard though.</li>
            <li> In the future I may try this with dry beard oil to see if that makes a difference vs wet oil</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft but has enough rigidity to take the thick hairs on my chinny chin chin.</li>
            <li> It is soft, yet stiff.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how it fairs with other products, my guess is it really doesn&#x27;t make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s original price is just too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews saying to leave it to air dry for a day before use.</li>
            <li> the only negative may be that the brush is almost too soft.  </li>
            <li> Not too coarse to use on your face--but stiff enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s NOT normal.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush as an accessory to be used with the liquid and dry beard oils from CanYouHandlebar, and have to rave about it!  </li>
            <li> Use this beard brush, it helps spread the oil deep into your beard to help with occasional itchiness without making your beard an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of cutting it down to a more manageable size until I got this brush.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for serious beard groomers.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job, although probably no better than any other natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Not too hard like some boar brushes but not too soft that it doesn&#x27;t reach the roots.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the brush to anyone with a beard that wants to get rid of the scraggly random facial hair growth and replace it with a well manicured look.</li>
            <li> His beard felt softer and it wasn&#x27;t so rough looking.</li>
            <li> One or two bristles have come out, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft and don&#x27;t properly brush beard, they merely skim the surface and don&#x27;t brush properly, nor do they apply oil or product evenly, just on the surface and not inside.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complains about it.</li>
            <li> The brush is round with a wooden handle which has the CanYouHandleBar brand question mark on it.</li>
            <li> so not really a problem at all.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to brush without feeling like I&#x27;m raking my face.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put it away wet.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this brush because the last brush I was using was too stiff.</li>
            <li> A little shedding over the first week so far, nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard and not super soft so that they can comb through that unruly man hair.  </li>
            <li> Other companies should take note</li>
            <li> but I guess they do for every other brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality made and horse hair not boar hair like other brushes.</li>
            <li> it comes in open over night - No more smell.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does work as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other then that no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> If you have a long beard it may take some time to tame it with this lil guy.  </li>
            <li> You NEED TO let it air out a couple of days because it smells bad when you first open it</li>
            <li> The bristles are WAY to soft, they don&#x27;t begin to penetrate my relatively thin beard.</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice when opening it isn&#x27;t the so much a sight as it is a smell, a very bad one.</li>
            <li> May trim them down myself just to try it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the logo and just a question mark which seems odd.</li>
            <li> A few are to be expected, but a few fall out with every use.</li>
            <li> was hoping it would be a little softer but its still not as firm as some other brushes.</li>
            <li> How to apply beard oil without ending up with an oily glistening mess?</li>
            <li> Pour a little oil inside of the container, submerge the brush and brush through the beard.</li>
            <li> I use both a beard balm and a little bit of oil to groom my beard.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this little brush, I find him rushing his beard</li>
            <li> It did need a little trimming when I got it</li>
            <li> It takes a little breaking in.</li>
            <li> Used this brush for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> He takes a few drops and places them around on his beard then uses this brush in a circular motion around on the area of his face that has the beard and mustache.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It brushes completely through his thick beard from roots to ends with ease, without irritating his skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal but need to deliver what you promise.</li>
            <li> I had been using my one of my girlfriend&#x27;s stiff hairbrushes to straighten it out, until she caught me.</li>
            <li> Not too soft and not too hard to be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> and I usually cannot get the product evenly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the wood brush handle cracked on the second use (morning after it was received) - see attached pictures.  </li>
            <li> but I find it too small for my hands</li>
            <li> There are very few bristles that feel out too.</li>
            <li> Helping me tame my beard and reducing the itch!</li>
            <li> I never own a beard brush, I usually just use my hand, and it gets greasy</li>
            <li> Hairs hardly fall out, over all I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a brush.</li>
            <li> Mine is just slightly longer and the bristles are not quite stiff enough to reach the base of my beard or my face when brushing</li>
            <li> Too much automated email&#x3D;an automated crap review.</li>
            <li> The bristles are softer than I would like &amp;#62; my beard is really thick</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t go threw a thick beard to the skin, but it isn&#x27;t meant to</li>
            <li> Seriously, guys.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase -</li>
            <li> and they would not be wrong but for me after using the brush</li>
            <li> A bit expensive tho</li>
            <li> Some have commented on it having an unpleasant smell, but I have not encountered that.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27; be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed! .</li>
            <li> Morning beard hair is the worst for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this Brush for my Husband the other day and he tried it right out. He said the brush bristles were very soft and was easy to use to apply the dry oil. He said it turned easily in the oils and was easy to apply to his beard. His beard felt softer and it wasn&#x27;t so rough looking. It keeps his beard soft and not old looking</li>
            <li> This brush feels great when brushing the beard.  It is soft, yet stiff.  I have noticed that some of the bristles have come off while using, but nothing alarming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal container it comes in is beneficial as it keeps the brush clean and protected.</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my hubby along with their oil.  My hubby loves it!! The beard brush works with dry beard oil in tins, as well as traditional bottled beard oils.  The bristles in this beard brush are horse hair, which is softer than boar hair. It brushes completely through his thick beard from roots to ends with ease, without irritating his skin underneath.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use this on your face like with most beard brushes.  He says its a perfect match with his oil!  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  I completely recommend this product for the men with beards!!</li>
            <li> The brush is fine.  I don&#x27;t really have any other brushes to compare it to but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it and his beard is now finally groomed and looks pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> IF you have a beard, you owe it to yourself to get this brush!  I used to just use my hair brush on my beard, after all, it IS hair!  However, since getting this beard brush I look forward to grooming my beard every morning.  No more scratchy bristles, no more pulling at snags, just a soft, gentle, but very effective way to manage my beard.  It&#x27;s almost as good as my lovely wife running her fingers through my beard...well, it isn&#x27;t THAT good, but it is a kinder, gentler way to apply their beard oil to my beard.  And yes, get their beard oil, too.  It really does a great job!</li>
            <li> This brush is very, very soft and feels great on my skin and beard.  I will just keep brushing my beard because it feels so good.  I have a short beard that isn&#x27;t very thick on the cheeks, and I also trimmed it, which in hindsight wasn&#x27;t the best idea.  This brush helps keep my beard hairs in place.  I was using a comb and i really didn&#x27;t help.  This brush is dense and helps guide the beard hairs into place.  Small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality brush and perfect size. My husband loved it and uses it on his beard every day!</li>
            <li> These are the best gifts that I could have thought of for a man with a beard. You cannot have this without the Wisdom beard oil :)/ I received this at  a discounted price and I love the fact that he loves it. The brush is light but still tough enough to brush through my husbands beard. The little container that it comes in is a plus :) The brush conditions and leaves a nice shine to the beard. I advise you to comb the beard first if the hair is thick and stubborn on the beard. Pour a little oil inside of the container, submerge the brush and brush through the beard. This will definitely be a great present for the bearded man in your life.</li>
            <li> great Quality! My boyfriend loves it and the company even sent me a nice email about beard grooming, very thoughtful</li>
            <li> Really impressed with the product. Got a nice email from the company as well with tips on usage. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The brush does a wonderful job of blending the dry oil, which I warm in the palms of my hands, and works the oil throughout my beard. It actually makes my beard shine, in the right light, and it makes it soft even to the ends of the hair. It seems very well produced and it is easy to handle. Thank you for making such a great brush.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush, so I bought him a backup to take to work! :P</li>
            <li> worked great when I had a beard!  was very good at distributing the beard oil more evenly over my beard.  the only negative may be that the brush is almost too soft.  but it did the job I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> The brush works and it&#x27;s awesome and soft to the face! It keeps our beards soft, managable, and clean! I recommended this brush for beginningers as we as the advanced beard guy!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Love it!  Use it with some beard card gloss/wax tub that the brush fits right in. Best way to tame my beard and the bristles a perfect combo of soft and firm.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it works well with the Liberty balm I recently purchased. My beard is a bit course and rebellious and I wish the brush would be a little bit more disciplinary against my whiskers, that said, I would not send it back, instead I will continue to use it since it is very well done and comfortable to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The brush has natural hair bristles and the wood has a nice finish. This product does not look cheap and instead has a very committed look that matches your beard ideals.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the initial smell deter you. You NEED TO let it air out a couple of days because it smells bad when you first open it BUT in the end, it&#x27;s a really nice brush that feels GREAT on the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**RECEIVED PRODUCT FOR A PROMOTIONAL DISCOUNT**</li>
            <li> Really wanted this brush but couldn&#x27;t justify the cost. Right as I was about to buy another, I saw it was on sale and got it. I love it. Use it on my beard and helps straighten hairs and keep everything inline. I use it along with beard oil and balm. was hoping it would be a little softer but its still not as firm as some other brushes. will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> A very good brush for working the beard.  Holds up well.  Bristles are strong enough to move through beard without pulling.</li>
            <li> Geat brush i have noticed a bit difference with this rather than a comb. Fantastic!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This company is WONDERFUL! I love this brush. I highly recommend all their products.</li>
            <li> very good product&lt;br /&gt;very good ship</li>
            <li> Arrived, straight out of the can, with one complete bunch of bristles detached. Brush also seems to shed a great deal.  Build quality is low, materials quality is low. Can be done better.  EDIT:  Brush has lost more groups of bristles. Becoming effectively useless</li>
            <li> This item is great. I now have several brushes I use for my beard but this is by far my most favorite. The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend when he asked if I would pick him out some beard balm as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one comment he made was - the bristles are soft?? Then he tried it.  He loves it.  He uses this brush to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; his beard when he&#x27;s getting ready to trim it.  Says that it gets all of the longer hairs up and pointed out so they are easily trimmed away.  He&#x27;s not allowed to have a grizzly adams beard at work - so this brush works perfectly to keep it clean looking ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something to dig into your beard to scratch underneath - I would get something firmer, but this brush is well constructed, came in it&#x27;s own tin, and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing this brush to replace my trusty old pocket comb (after an untimely death) to maintain my now fairly wel grown beard. I received it quickly enough, packaged in a cute little tin similar to what you might get beard balm in. The first thing you notice when opening it isn&#x27;t the so much a sight as it is a smell, a very bad one. Closest thing I can come up with is vomit. Thinking maybe it was just some shipping or packaging issue, I proceeded to wash the brush. Not only did the soap turn from white to yellow upon lathering, but the smell only worsened, to what now I can only describe as wet dog vomit. The brush is also a little on the soft side for my beard, making it less effective than I would like. One or two bristles have come out, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Overall, a fairly underwhelming experience.</li>
            <li> Does a decent enough job as a dry oil applicator but it does not &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my beard well. I need something with much stiffer bristles for that, so I am a bit bummed this isn&#x27;t an all purpose brush, but like I said it&#x27;s a good oil applicator.</li>
            <li> Great brush, soft yet effective at dispersing beard oil. Good quality brush. No complaints. Buy one!</li>
            <li> Used this brush for a few weeks now. Bristles are too soft and don&#x27;t properly brush beard, they merely skim the surface and don&#x27;t brush properly, nor do they apply oil or product evenly, just on the surface and not inside. Ended up ordering a boar&#x27;s head brush which works much better. The build quality of the brush is great though.</li>
            <li> Came on time and I was very happy. Product works great and constructed of high quality materials. After using this brush for a few days I can recommend it for anyone looking for a quality brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> Never had a beard brush before, but after much research  I settled on this and I am extremely pleased with the results. I use this brush to help settle in the balm closer to the skin after application and it does a marvelous job penetrating through my thick, coarse face forest.</li>
            <li> Way better then boars hair brush doesn&#x27;t ripp you&#x27;re beard hair out</li>
            <li> A great soft brush to get solid beard oil distributed into your beard, and getting it in style</li>
            <li> The most fantastic beard brush I&#x27;ve ever had. In fact I just purchased another one to use on the road packed in my shoulder bag. It is soft and gently caresses your beard into shape. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great overall brush to use for beard care. Can be first used to brush out the beard while it is dry, then like my husband does, it can be also used to lather up in preparation to shave. He says it creates a better overall shave and makes it easier to get clean lines when it has all been brushed the correct direction.&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Well made and a great grooming aid.</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly with the CanYouHandlebar dry beard oil conditioner. My husband loves this brush for applying beard oil. It really helps him get into the scruff, and I think he just enjoys using the brush in general (it’s a nice little massage for him). It’s also really high quality, with a nice wooden handle and quality bristles. It also came in a nice tin, which matches his CanYouHandlebar beard oil well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ideal for anyone with facial hair, whether you have scruff or a full blown beard. It’s just scratchy enough to feel good and get into his facial hair well, but not so scratchy that it hurts his skin. He said it feels good in his hands and allows him to apply beard oil without getting his hands all greasy and gross. It helps him comb his hair quickly so that it looks well groomed and perfectly in place, and feels soft from the beard oil. And obviously, I like it because I like when his whiskers are softy (which the brush and beard oil helps with). A little beard oil goes a long way and this really helps you apply it where you need to. Matt uses it every time he shaves now and has really noticed the difference in how soft and groomed his facial hair is.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this, but it has some issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you leave it in the tin (which is really cool, and makes you want to leave it in there) and use and kinda beard balm or oil it starts to stink from mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months, and learned that lesson early on.  Cleaned it up with some good old fashion soap and water.  Let it air dry and then repeated this about 4 times to finally get it all out.</li>
            <li> Very soft and nice to use. Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Bought this around a month ago and wanted to give it the old college try before writing anything.  I use this on my beard only. Before I was using a regular comb and since I got this I no longer use the comb. I use it to brush in my beard balm and it does the job to perfection. I actually twist the brush directly on the balm and brush it in from there. Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. My only brush from here on out. Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> Just buy it. I use it to brush the hair on my chest ;)</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Very gentle on my beard, and holds the scent of the oil on the brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard and not super soft so that they can comb through that unruly man hair.  This brush comes in the tin pictured, when I removed mt husbands from the tin, it had this manly oil scent to it. Not sure what the smell was exactly but it was nice.  Its a good size so it fits comfortably in your hand and gets a good amount of hair in each stroke.&lt;br /&gt;My hubby already uses the Can You Handlebar line of products so he used this brush with them. I am not sure how it fairs with other products, my guess is it really doesn&#x27;t make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, this is the perfect gift for the beard man in your life. Fathers Day is just around the corner!!!&lt;br /&gt;Gents, if you wanna impress the ladies, get a beard oil brush to tame that mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a full promotional discount to purchase, test and review this beard brush. My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> this is one of those products that when you get it and start using it, you wonder how you ever got by without it. my beard is about 5 moonths old now and was getting scraggly as hell no matter what balm, oil, or wax I used.  I was thinking of cutting it down to a more manageable size until I got this brush.  Holy heck, it tamed all the unruly whiskers aticking out of the side of my face almost instantly.  Plus,using this brush is ridiulously addicting because it just feels so damned good.  I wish i would have bought it months sooner.</li>
            <li> I really like the general usefulness of this brush.  I like to add in beard oil a couple times a week and this.  This brush does really well at getting the oil spread evenly.  After I use this I use a comb or stiffer brush and then I am good to go.</li>
            <li> My husband positively loves this beard brush .This product is a beard oil brush made of natural soft horse hair , it is great for dry or wet beards.This  beard oil brush is made of wood and genuine horse hair. Horse hair bristles penetrate your beard providing a gentle massage that is softer than your typical boar bristle beard brushes.This brush helps to fully disperse beard oil throughout your entire beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another wonderful item my husband can now add to his grooming kit.It came in a really cute little tin can, it is very cute and the bristles are nice and soft .My husband found it worked great and it really does help his beard oil absorb better into his beard .He really loves this little brush , it is a new addition that he did not own yet .We have found a lot of products like this are starting to appear on the market more now then in the past, this one is definitely a keeper and well worth buying .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this great beard brush ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I got this to assist in the application of the dry oil and it works perfectly.  It glides right through the beard to smooth the oil onto my face underneath which has been difficult to accomplish until now.  Great brush, I&#x27;ll buy again if this one ever wears out.</li>
            <li> First time using a brush like this and I&#x27;m loving it so far. I can&#x27;t recall (since I&#x27;m using the Amazon app to write the review) if the description of this brush mentions is kind of small, but still works perfect for my beard. Absolutely no complains about it.</li>
            <li> Great Brush. But it isn&#x27;t designed to be used as a brush. It&#x27;s an applicator for a beard balm. It&#x27;s a great applicator brush though.</li>
            <li> Stellar tool for adding the can you handle bar dry beard oil to an unruly bearded fellow. Very nice a friend of mine uses it along with a few of there other products and thinks they are great. After two weeks his beard is looking much healthier and the difference in touch is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review - its just my opinion</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is outstanding. The material is not irritating to my skin and it has helped my beard looking clean and neat. Words cannot express how happy I am with this purchase. On top of that, the customer service from the people at canyouhandlebar.com is top notch. I had an issue over a free add on item and they resolved almost in the blink of an eye. These people have my business for the rest of my life. Other companies should take note</li>
            <li> You need this brush if you have beard. It gets oil where you need it.</li>
            <li> My brush doesn&#x27;t look like the one pictured but it works well. It doesn&#x27;t have the logo and just a question mark which seems odd. Regardsless it works well and does its job.</li>
            <li> Works great. Makes you feel like you might actually need to mash the hairs on your face with luxurious horse hair and beard oil. Seems like the right thing to do. Combined with beard oil, definitely helps avoid scratchy beard syndrome.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this brush because the last brush I was using was too stiff. This brush is very nice to use and easy to hold. I use it to apply oil to my beard and it provides a nice even coat.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Got this beard oil brush for my father, sort or as a gift. Hes always complaining his beard is out of control. HE LOVES IT! Honestly I didn&#x27;t even know this was a thing, but it is, a very cool thing in fact.</li>
            <li> Good quality product! Works great to tame the Mane!</li>
            <li> Hairs fall out too easy</li>
            <li> So my older brother is very keen on growing long beards, and sometimes the beards are even longer than his hair. As many of you know beards become subject to knots, tangling, and even sometimes they can become painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother used to use a pocket comb to make sure his beard would stay in good order, and to spread beard oil throughout his beard. He was able to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; when I gifted this to him. The high quality horse hair this is built with move finely and swiftly through his beard, and un-knots his beard while evenly spreading the oil throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been told he&#x27;s very satisfied with the product, and that he will never go back to using a comb.</li>
            <li> My beard is wiry. I had been using my one of my girlfriend&#x27;s stiff hairbrushes to straighten it out, until she caught me. So, I had to get my own. The bristles on this brush are *very* soft compared to the one I&#x27;d been using. In fact, it pampers your face. The first time I used it, it made me giggle. This won&#x27;t grab your beard and straighten it out. But, it feels damn good. It also does a good enough job shaping the beard if you use some product. I use both a beard balm and a little bit of oil to groom my beard. This brush comes in a tin. I put a tiny bit of oil in the tin so it gets on the bristles, and use that to brush my beard after using the balm. I use the balm mostly for the skin under the beard, and because it does a better job in helping the beard hold its shape. With that combination, this brush works to keep my beard in order. I really don&#x27;t think it would work very well if you didn&#x27;t use an oil or a balm with it. If you&#x27;re looking for something stiff that will pull your beard straight, this isn&#x27;t it. But if you&#x27;ve never tried soft bristles and want to give it a shot, this is a great brush and I&#x27;m very satisfied. I can&#x27;t say I ever really looked forward to brushing my beard until I got this thing, that&#x27;s how good it feels. Is it worth the money? To me, yes, I&#x27;m happy I bought it. But I didn&#x27;t try anything cheaper, so I can&#x27;t really compare. I can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;d change about it, other than I would like a handle on the top of the brush so it&#x27;d be easier to remove from the tin, and easier to hold on to while brushing.</li>
            <li> You will love these little brushes! They keep every hair in place.</li>
            <li> nice brush perfect size for beard grooming and storage tin is a plus.Bristles are perfect texture not to soft, or to coarse .</li>
            <li> Great quality brush! Doesn&#x27;t lose bristles or clump product</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and arrived as described. Brush comes in handy little container. Works efficiently and I would gladly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Have used the brush for just a few days, but so far I am pleased with it. It seems to do the job, although probably no better than any other natural bristle brush. Both the size of the brush and the protective tin make it handy for travel.</li>
            <li> I never own a beard brush, I usually just use my hand, and it gets greasy and I usually cannot get the product evenly. However, this brush is perfect. The package is very nice that I can gift it because it is nicely package; sitting in a nice tin can. The hair on the brush is very soft but still strong enough to brush through my bread. I would definitely buy more as gifts for my breaded friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This product was received either at no or low cost for review purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. **</li>
            <li> This beard brush is the perfect tools for keeping my beard tamed. It even comes in a cool tin case.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for wet or dry use. Retains just the right amount of oil or wax if used after applying those products. Comes in a metal container to keep it clean and looking nice. Very sturdy and good looking. Great gift idea. These brushes shed a bit, but you have to expect that with a natural brush.Will likely last a long time if taken care of and stored in tin.</li>
            <li> LOVE this beard brush!  I&#x27;ve been using finger brushes that scratch underneath the beard.  This brush does a great job in volumizing the beard and applying beard oil evenly across the beard.</li>
            <li> Some bristles fell out when it first arrived (a day before the intitial delivery estimate began. Bravo). I read some reviews saying to leave it to air dry for a day before use. So I rinsed it up to get anymore loose hairs out and left it to dry. Love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like wet dog (boar bristle brushes tend to, this one just spells like glue when it first arrives) and it feels nice going through my beard.  Not too hard like some boar brushes but not too soft that it doesn&#x27;t reach the roots. Only wish the bristles weren&#x27;t as dense. Although it does reach the roots somewhat, it pushes around my beard more than combs through it. A little pricey, but hey, it&#x27;s real horse hair.</li>
            <li> love. This. Brush. Its effective on its own, but in conjunction with their solid beard oil it&#x27;s an extremely effective combination for me. It&#x27;s also very pleasant to use. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This size of this brush is great for the short to medium length beard.  If you have a long beard it may take some time to tame it with this lil guy.  It fits into the palm of your hand and the bristles are super soft.  The bristles are soft because they are made out of real horse hair.  I love the can it comes in so you don&#x27;t even have to gift wrap if you give it to someone for a special occasion.  CanYouHandlebar has a whole line of other products for yourself or gifts for others that are all just as good at this one!!  You won&#x27; be disappointed!  *received for testing and review.</li>
            <li> I received this to review along with the beard oil products and I  (well my husband) love it! We&#x27;d never used a beard oil brush before but it makes all the difference in the world regarding application. So much easier and it does a great job at keeping those beard hairs tame and manageable.</li>
            <li> Nice brush!  Not too coarse to use on your face--but stiff enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great item works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Bristles come off in your beard...That&#x27;s NOT normal.</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect applicator for any beard balm or oil. It is compact, easy to use, and gentle on the beard. What more could you ask?!! For the person who is serious about growing a beard and looking good along the way, this is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> How to apply beard oil without ending up with an oily glistening mess? Use this beard brush, it helps spread the oil deep into your beard to help with occasional itchiness without making your beard an oil slick.</li>
            <li> tMy dog ate some and it died.  Too much automated email&#x3D;an automated crap review.</li>
            <li> This brush arrives in a tin that is great for storage. The bristles are the perfect combo of soft and sturdy. You can tell it was made with love. My husband loves this combined with CanYouHandleBar products for his beard. It is great quality and I can tell it will last him a long time. I received this package on time and in tact. A discount was given for my review.</li>
            <li> Morning beard hair is the worst for me. Luckily with a quick wash and a dab of beard oil this brush defines and molds my beard into perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked it up for an awesome deal the day after the Prime sale. Wished I ordered two. It&#x27;s original price is just too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to train the beard hairs......</li>
            <li> Brushing some balm thorough my beard feels good, with this brush it feels real good. I think I&#x27;ll go do it again.</li>
            <li> feels like i should just use my regular comb lol</li>
            <li> Must-have for beards of a certain length. Soft enough to feel great on the skin, but sturdy enough to shape well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great brush. It works really nice. Bristles are super soft!!</li>
            <li> This is the only way to put product in your face manliness. Get it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! .</li>
            <li> Really awesome little brush.  I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out at all and it&#x27;s soft so it won&#x27;t pull hairs out.  Keeps my beard flowing in one direction and is excellent for use with beard oil/balms.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I have with this brush is that i did not buy one earlier. At first I was not sure on the shape but the first time I used it I realized that for me it was perfect the soft bristle brush is what I was looking for but could not find. Some might say it is overpriced and they would not be wrong but for me after using the brush I have not one regret. Thanks CYH</li>
            <li> Has definitely helped get my beard from scraggly to more tamed and I use it after applying beard oil to help spread it to all the hair.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on getting a beard brush and am somewhat pleased with this one. The bristles are softer than I would like &amp;#62; my beard is really thick and I do not feel the soft bristles penetrate all the way through. The brush does apply the beard oil quite well and the tin container is pretty cool. Andy at CanYouHandlebar is great to work with! I want to give this 3.5 stars since I am torn between being just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; with the brush and &amp;#34;liking&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush, perfect for applying oil to your beard! Very sturdy construction and comes in a stylish protective tin.</li>
            <li> Love the brush however the description read as follows &amp;#34;3 Day Sale! Buy One, Get A Free Classic Beard Balm! | Beard Oil Brush | Perfect For All Beard Balms and Oils | Natural, Soft Horse Hair &amp;#34; when I purchased it and I did not receive the free classic beard balm.  Not a huge deal but need to deliver what you promise.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with this brush. He liked the design and love the metal tin case it came it. That makes it easy for him to carry while he is traveling.  He uses it almost every day.  This brush does not need to be cleaned every day. He cleans it once a week with gentle soap and water. The bristles do fall off after use but I guess they do for every other brush he uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received.</li>
            <li> Cool brush. Does the job well. Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this handy brush!</li>
            <li> Nice and soft. A bit expensive tho</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase - Every time I try to use it,  I have bristles fall out and into my beard.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and a great handcrafted design.  My beard is a happy beard.</li>
            <li> Worth it with the dry oil.</li>
            <li> Great brush, fits right into hand, I got this as a gift to put together with the oil and wax for my dad and he loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice beard brush. Seriously, guys. Seriously. If you have a beard and want to be proud of that sucker then you&#x27;d best be using some special tings to help it along. I, myself, like a good wash and balm, and nothing helps smooth it all out and shape it than a nice comb, followed by the friendly neighborhood Beard Oil Brush. My beard is happy, and so will yours be.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush as an accessory to be used with the liquid and dry beard oils from CanYouHandlebar, and have to rave about it!  This brush is amazing and I love the way it feels as I groom my goatee.  It takes real willpower to stop using it, because it feels so damn good as it brushes my facial hairs into place...just a nice smooth sensation!  What a buy and I&#x27;m glad I found this gem!</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush that easily gets through my beard.  Some have commented on it having an unpleasant smell, but I have not encountered that.  Mine has more bristles spread out around the side than the pic implies, but it&#x27;s still a wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> I have a comb that I like to use for when my beard is long but this is better for when the beard is short.  It move the whiskers in the right direction easier for training the beard to lay in a certain direction.  It helps to distribute the oils and conditioners better than the comb and feels good while using on the face.  Not too soft and not too hard to be uncomfortable.  It fits comfortably in the hand and can get under the nose for brushing out a mustache as well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a long beard though. It&#x27;s extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t quite dig in to a long beard. I can see this being perfect for a very short beard though.</li>
            <li> It really shapes my scruffy beard. It is easy to use and makes my beard look really nice and well groomed. I used a comb alone before, but this brush it completes the grooming process really nice. It also feels great on the beard hair and it is very gentle on it. This is a great piece to have on your beard arsenal.</li>
            <li> Great beard brush. I like the horsehair . It is very soft and I like the tin can to store the brush.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I do not understand what it is</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect combination of smooth and firm to help ease itchy and rough beards.  I use it with some oil every morning and it has been holding up like a champ.</li>
            <li> As with all Canyouhandlebar products this is a great product. It might be a bit more expensive than other beard brushes but it is worth it. It&#x27;s quality made and horse hair not boar hair like other brushes. There are very few bristles that feel out too.</li>
            <li> The item arrived very quickly. It appears to be high quality. As this is a gift for my husband for our anniversary, I cannot attest to how well it works but I can say that the quality looks great and was exactly as it was pictured.  I would but from them again.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Gets right into my beard with beard oil and sculpts well too.</li>
            <li> This is a low to medium stiffness horse bristle brush. It will just work great to massage the face scalp and make the oils reach the skin. It also works really good to shape up the external beard layer. The brush works great to calm down that itchiness felt in the first months of growing your beard and is a perfect complement to any of the oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just won&#x27;t untangle your beard if a lot or long enough. For that purpose I would recommend a comb. I would say that the CanYouHandlebar team offers it this way because if it was stiffer, we would damage our face scalp. As it is not that stiff, it is most likely used to get the oils to the skin and massage it rather than targeted to untangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice piece from CanYouHandleBar, recommendable.</li>
            <li> If you are wondering why to get that man in your life with all that facial hair, get him some beard oil and this beard oil brush. This is one of those things that most men don&#x27;t even realize they need until they have it; and then they realize they can&#x27;t live without it. For most of the beards that are over a month long, oil alone will not do the trick, you need a brush to really help work it in and make it look presentable and ..well..brushed...&lt;br /&gt;And believe me it helps! I did receive this product for free for the intent of review but that has not changed my opinion or altered my thoughts on it at all.</li>
            <li> The brush works great it comes with a tin that you can keep the brush in when your not using it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it came in a can! But I realized it is very much needed for care and storage. This is just the right size for the care and feeding of my beard!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush with the Wisdom beard oil for my husband and he loves it!  He applies beard oil after he gets out of the shower.  He either pours it directly on the brush and works it in or he will put oil on his hands to work it in his beard and then goes over it with this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush rocks. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush and it&#x27;s the same diameter as the beard balm tins.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very soft.  More soft than a boar brush.  Only reason i gave this 4 stars is bc of the smell.</li>
            <li> It brushes well and oils up the fur quickly and easily. Comes in a tin so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting smashed or rubbing off.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband - he loves it! It makes his beard very soft and a bit bushy, but in the good way. I love touching his beard now.</li>
            <li> Liked the horsehair bristles - just the right amount - firm, yet soft - can&#x27;t imagine boar bristles feeling good.  Storage tin is a nice addition.  Unfortunately, the wood brush handle cracked on the second use (morning after it was received) - see attached pictures.  Wasn&#x27;t dropped or abused in any way.  Noticed it when I went to put it back in tin.  Will be requesting refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It&#x27;s actually 100% boars hair. You NEED this brush!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome and makes applying dry beard oil a breeze! It&#x27;s also soft and feels wonderful against my beard and face!</li>
            <li> Works pretty nice, the hair bristles hold conditioner/oil so that when I brush it helps spread the oils around nicely.  The bristles don&#x27;t go threw a thick beard to the skin, but it isn&#x27;t meant to, that&#x27;s what a nice wood comb is for.  This brush is wonderful for giving my beard a nice finished look, I always use the brush to touch up the shape, a comb just goes to deep for shaping.  I&#x27;ve only had a couple bristles come out, but that&#x27;s normal, most brushes shed allot more than this one.  Durable construction!  And it comes with a tin for storage/travel, that&#x27;s just the icing on the cake.  I would definitely by this brush again.</li>
            <li> Cons: I agree with the reviews about this brush being a little too soft. My beard is maybe 1.5 inches long and it feels like this product only brushes a little deeper than the surface, doesn&#x27;t really penetrate to the roots like some reviews claimed. I have been applying wet oil (different brand than this brush) to my beard and didn&#x27;t feel like putting the oil directly onto the brush was very efficient. It felt like I had to use a much greater amount to get the brush wet than if I directly applied the oil to my beard with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The soft bristles do feel comfortable. The handmade aspect is nice, I can tell this was not made by a machine/assembly line. After applying my wet beard oil with my fingers, this brush does do a good job of making my beard look awesome! It&#x27;s smooth and compact/tight and has a good contour. I do wish the bristles would dig a little deeper and give me the satisfaction of scrubbing the skin below my beard, but still, I can&#x27;t complain about the way my beard looks and feels afterwards, so if that&#x27;s what matters most to you then I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall opinion: I would purchase again. In the future I may try this with dry beard oil to see if that makes a difference vs wet oil I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> This is simply an amazing brush.  I now have two, since it comes in a protective case, I purchased a second one for my travel kit.  Soft, no hard plastic edges, excellent for grooming facial hair.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and just the right size. Top quality and softer than the average hair brush. For me, it&#x27;s perfect for beard grooming.  Hey, those concerned about the smell of the new brush, I left the container it comes in open over night - No more smell. I plan to buy another soon to carry in my truck. This would be the perfect GIFT too.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this little brush, I find him rushing his beard lol.</li>
            <li> As soon as the brush was out of its tin, I knew I was going to love it. Along with its pleasant smell, the bristles are strong enough to get down to the roots of each follicle yet soft enough to lightly massage the skin underneath</li>
            <li> got hear really fast and its a great brush</li>
            <li> The brush is nice I have used it every other day for roughly 3 weeks and have not witnessed any shedding of sorts... I would recommend this to anyone with a beard shorter than three quarters of an inch... Mine is just slightly longer and the bristles are not quite stiff enough to reach the base of my beard or my face when brushing</li>
            <li> Great bristle texture for keeping your beard in style and brushing through beard oil.</li>
            <li> So far, my husband has used it for two weeks. He loves the feel of it, it has made his beard softer and straighter. But I have to ask, how do you get the horse hair?</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he loves it. He uses it with his favorite beard balm and says it really gets the balm deep into his beard and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I received  this  product  for  an  honest  review. I purchased  this  for  my husband  and  he  loves  it . He said  that  this  is  the  best  beard brush available  on the market .</li>
            <li> I use this to apply beard oil and I am a huge fan. The brush allows me to exfoliate my skin under my beard which has eliminated my beard dandruff. The brush also helps shape my beard in the morning while I apply beard oil. I have beard with a nice V shape that looks well groomed and shinny. I would recommend the brush to anyone with a beard that wants to get rid of the scraggly random facial hair growth and replace it with a well manicured look. The brush came with a protective tin that works great for storing it in my bathroom cabinet. I have had shaving brushes that have smelled like wet dog and this brush smells fresh and clean right out of the tin. I also found it much easier to apply beard oil with this brush rather than my fingers. I use less oil and apply it more evenly with this brush.</li>
            <li> Yep, works great to keep my unruly beard in check. I sometimes use it along with Cowboy Concoctions Beard Balm, and it fits nicely into the tin. The brush is very soft but has enough rigidity to take the thick hairs on my chinny chin chin.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> Combs can be harsh on your whiskers, this oil brush feels so sweet and soothing on my beard and moustache.  Give your best friend a little TLC.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush works great to get the dry beard oil worked into my beard. Has held up a lot better than I thought I would to start with, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all. Great product and great company.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really loves this beard and mustache brush. Since he&#x27;s been using it his facial hair is much more tame and softer looking. He naturally uses it with the other beard products in this line and his beard has never felt or looked better. I believe the bristles are natural and not synthetic, and it helps to distribute his beard oils throughout his beard. ln fact, the other day he ran back home before work to grab this brush as he&#x27;d forgotten to use it before he left the house. This is a great gift product, as it comes in its own tin container and you can couple it with one of the many beard products from the Can You Handlebar line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard nice and straight. Makes it real soft and gives it a nice little shine too. i really do enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product from an excellent company! I spent a long time lookin for a natural brush that was neither too soft nor too hard; the CanYouHandlebar beard oil brush is the perfect balance. It&#x27;s a nice size for any beard and works great whether it&#x27;s paired with their dry beard oil or just used as a grooming tool. The finish is handsom and impressive and the brush is great for making me look handsom and impressive too! I would definitely recommend this brush and this company, their customer service is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this application brush fits real good in your hands really soft horsehair bristles perfect for my beard</li>
            <li> The bristles are WAY to soft, they don&#x27;t begin to penetrate my relatively thin beard. Spreads around beard oil ok but only on the surface, not much use at all for beard grooming.</li>
            <li> A really great product . The perfect grooming aid for your beard.</li>
            <li> I have bought of ton of the beard oils and waxes from this company and numerous others for my grandfather. He likes the majority of the products. This ends up being one of his favorites. He only complains about the bristles falling out at a fast pace. A few are to be expected, but a few fall out with every use. Other than that, it does work as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Well made. Nice way to groom beard</li>
            <li> This is a nice, soft brush. It is easy to hold onto and helps smooth my beard after applying beard oil. It comes with a metal storage container which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Helping me tame my beard and reducing the itch!</li>
            <li> Pleasantly firm, excellently-sized excellent, decently-priced beard brush. I would recommend to men with moderately-sized and shorter beards. While men sporting lengthy beards could certainly use the brush and enjoy the beard oil-spreading benefits touted in the description, the horse-hair bristles may not be quite firm enough to penetrate massive beards all the way to the skin.</li>
            <li> It sheds a bit but it works great for smoothing my unruly beard.</li>
            <li> I received this beard oil brush free for my husband to try and review; regardless this is his 100% honest opinion. The brush is round with a wooden handle which has the CanYouHandleBar brand question mark on it. It has a glossy finish and is easy to hold on to. The bristles are soft while still being strong and stiff enough to get through the beard hair. My husband really likes using this to work a few drops of beard oil into his beard. He takes a few drops and places them around on his beard then uses this brush in a circular motion around on the area of his face that has the beard and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It massages the skin while working the oil around and he really likes that the bristles are not hard and sharp feeling against his skin. So far we have not seen any issues with the brush shedding any of the hairs. This comes in a nice tin that holds the brush so that it stays clean when not in use and makes it easy to travel with if necessary.</li>
            <li> Wow! The perfect brush for my beard. I love this thing and use it first thing in the morning and every evening. The brush is not to hard and soft enough to feel good. I also love the can that keeps the brush soft with the oil that remains on it. I highly recommend this brush to all you guys that have beards.</li>
            <li> works excellent with dry or wet oils</li>
            <li> Super nice brush. Yeah its a little pricey compared to some of the other brushes but honestly, I&#x27;d buy it again. It&#x27;s soft but still firm enough to get to your skin for oil application.</li>
            <li> bristles barely get under my beard but it does a good job of keeping the beard at bay</li>
            <li> It came early and worked great! I used it with my beard oil and it worked very well and helped to evenly distribute the oil.</li>
            <li> So far so good... A little shedding over the first week so far, nothing crazy. It brushes your beard. A little pricey, but seems like good quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Easy to use. I highly recommend for serious beard groomers.</li>
            <li> Not only is it the perfect size for travel, its the perfect shape for everyday use!  Love the control I have over my lengthy beard with this brush.  I keep one in the truck, bathroom and office!  Don&#x27;t leave home without it my bearded brotherhood!</li>
            <li> Well, this is not a beard brush. It is a beard oil brush, used for working in and spreading beard oil or certain beard balms. Which it really does work very well for. Keeps your hands from getting all greasy which is nice. I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it if that is what u were looking for</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Fiance for Valentine&#x27;s Day and he absolutely loves it! He was using beard oil without a brush before and he says this makes it completely easy for him to apply the beard oil as well as smooth out his beard. He also said it was easy for him to travel with when he has to travel for work. He loves the texture of the bristles and how they feel against his skin.They aren&#x27;t too rough and feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> This beard brush is wonderful. I can easily grip the brush and some of the bristles to properly brush through my beard. The brush itself seems high quality as far as the wood and horsehair. It came in a container to protect it (especially helpful if you store it in a bathroom). The only thing I will mention for feedback is that it had a lacquer smell from being newly coated but that went away with exposure to air out. And knowing it was recently branded/coated means it is new... so not really a problem at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly to apply the oil and comb that puffy, difficult to manage beard. I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> if you have a beard and you like to keep it soft and and well groomed, then this little brush is what you need..this canyouhandlebar brush is soft on your face and it make want to keep brushing for hours..it comes in a little metal can (perfect for traveling)..the brush has a wooden handle, fits perfectly in the palm of your hand.. pros: soft, reaches deep into your beard and feels good on your skin cons: you might be late to work, because is hard to stop brushing..</li>
            <li> The question mark has to be there because you can never decide which scent of beard oil to use on any given day.&lt;br /&gt;But no matter what you choose this gentle brush will apply evenly to all fo locals of your majestic beard</li>
            <li> Just as described great brush...it tames the beast</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the brush in my hand and it works well to spread the oil or balm throughout the beard and mustache</li>
            <li> Very nice quality materials. I figured the bristles on this brush would be a bit firmer, so I still have to use a comb to untangle the beard. Not an issue though, as this makes applying beard oil much easier, and also puts a nice, neat, static-free finish on my more unruly hairs.</li>
            <li> It is a nice brush but I find it too small for my hands - I would liked it twice or three times of its current size.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. The bristles are firm enough to brush without feeling like I&#x27;m raking my face. It did need a little trimming when I got it but it works fine for oiling. Also the tin it came in is great for taking it with you in an overnight bag.</li>
            <li> Love it, best brush ever....</li>
            <li> You might want to air it out for a couple of days when you first get it, like any natural brush it needs to air out.  I like it, it seems to be absorbing the oil more than is going on my beard but once it is seasoned I think it will be just fine.  I really bought it so I could apply my beard oil and go and not have to wash my hands after applying it.  Save me time in the morning.  Nice.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Yes it smells at first, just let it air out for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is the glue they use.&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t put it away wet. That is the reason I am buying a second one.</li>
            <li> Seller delivered the brush in the designated time period. The brush comes in a very neat canister. Brush fits right in your hand. The bristles  are strong enough to do a good job on my goatee. If I were still sporting a full beard I would have liked to see the bristles to be a bit more stiff. Other then that no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a beard brush connoisseur, but this seems to work pretty well. It&#x27;s good quality, but if I&#x27;m judging the product on its overall value, I have to say it seems a little overpriced. Hopefully this one lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this a four star is because upon opening the package I found bristles all over the wooden part of the brush, they were stuck to it. Other than that, my husband likes it just fine. The bristles itself are so soft and makes my husband&#x27;s beard really soft to the the touch. He really likes it.</li>
            <li> My only regret is not having purchased a brush like this earlier.  I&#x27;ve used plastic or metal combs my entire life and I tried this horsehair brush on a whim by a suggestion from a co-worker.  This is easily one of the best products I have ever used for hair care.  It feels absolutely amazing and the results, when combined with proper wax/oil/balm, will astound you.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush that I have yet used on my unruly beard.</li>
            <li> The boar brush is is firm yet very soft on the the beard and face.  It is just the right size and fits easily into the palm of your hand. I also ordered the beard oil and it maintains the softness of my beard and keeps it from extending to far out from my face.  Both are really great products and I will continue to use them!</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first, but this brush compared to a standard plastic comb on my beard is so much more enjoyable. It&#x27;s funny, but true and I&#x27;m very happy to have it. It&#x27;s worth it folks :)</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush.  I&#x27;d like it more if the bristles were a bit shorter/stiffer. May trim them down myself just to try it.</li>
            <li> This brush is nicely made and fits well in the palm of your hand, but because it is very soft horse hair it seems to be too soft for my lengthy beard.  I think that this brush would be perfect for shorter beard lengths, say less than 1&amp;#34;, but for me it doesn&#x27;t really seem to get past the surface of my beard or allow me to shape my beard in the way that i&#x27;d like.  I would not hesitate to buy this brush if you have a shorter beard, but I will be looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> This brush is not to brush your beard out.  This brush is to apply bear oil and balm. It does that awesomely.  I use it every time now to apply the balm I use, then I comb or use a stiffer bristle brush to do the actual taming of the beard.  Unless you&#x27;ve got the worlds softest beard, (or are using it under your belt) this brush can&#x27;t comb out your tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job applying the balm to base of the hairs.</li>
            <li> great product. The hairs are a little rough at first. It takes a little breaking in. Hairs hardly fall out, over all I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a brush.</li>
