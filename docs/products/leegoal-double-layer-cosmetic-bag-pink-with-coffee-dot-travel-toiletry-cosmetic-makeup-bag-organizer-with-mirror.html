            <li>plus it&#x27;s really cute</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Just make sure you take time zippering it.</li>
            <li>So instead I just put them in the top section at an angle.</li>
            <li>Adorable and my daughter in law loves it.</li>

            <li>It looks cute and fits all of my day to day makeup.</li>
            <li>Love this bag.</li>
            <li>It is a cute design and color.</li>
            <li>was hoping it had more sturdiness for makeup and accessories but will be using it for travel</li>
            <li>Love it, got two of them.</li>
            <li>And the colors are super cute!</li>
            <li>This case is super cute!</li>
            <li>Perfect size, very fashionable, all of my things fit just right, came in many colors ,couldn&#x27;t decide</li>
            <li>Fit lots if things just wish the material was more durable and better made</li>
            <li>but I got what I payed for and it does fit all the things I want it too :)</li>
            <li>Fit brushes on top on lots of space in the bottom for all ur makeup.</li>
            <li>it is more of a light coffee color with brown polka-dots.</li>
            <li>but i can fit more than i thought in there.</li>
            <li>Holds all of her makeup and is easy to keep clean!</li>
            <li>is a nice size-again at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I got a great bag.  </li>
            <li>The fabric that surrounds the outer covering is smooth and I love it very much!</li>
            <li>but it was fine, fit all of my makeup in it.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>so everything fit in it</li>
            <li>Cheap material.</li>
            <li>Love it worth the money.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a band which I use to hold makeup brushes in place since they don&#x27;t fit in the slots.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need right away, it is cute.</li>
            <li>Travels very Well!!!</li>
            <li>The upside to the size is that it can easily fit into a travel bag without taking up too much room! :-)</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product for the price, and easy for travel.</li>
            <li>She loved that there were multiple levels for separating her brushes and makeup for easy access.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted not to big, not to small, and also a beautiful design that looks exactly like the picture, I have found the perfect makeup bag that I can carry around to my classes.</li>
            <li>the only thing good</li>
            <li>When it isnt full it doesnt stand up like the picture shows but kinda falls over</li>
            <li>It is so cool.</li>
            <li>No unpleasant surprises.</li>
            <li>The zip holder teared off the first night! :|</li>
            <li>smaller than expected, I don&#x27;t have a lot of make up, so its perfect for someone like me.</li>
            <li>took forever to get it, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Okay, so this bag IS NOT PINK.</li>
            <li>The price is VERY reasonable.</li>
            <li>So in overall, it is okay.</li>
            <li>it fell apart after first use</li>
            <li>I just ordered my 2nd back - perfect for travel ... not big on makeup</li>
            <li>However, when I first pulled it out of the box, my first thought was \\&quot;Geez is it</li>
            <li>I bought a bunch of nail products for her and was going to give to her in this cute  bag last Christmas.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it appears to ship from China and took about a month to arrive (which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because I ordered it way ahead of when I needed it).</li>
            <li>Still pretty tho</li>
            <li>I love the double zippers.</li>
            <li>The only thing I was really bummed about is the top section has places to put your brushes but my brushes are too tall, so I can&#x27;t use that area.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loved organizing her small group of cosmetics into this travel case.</li>
            <li>I plan to ignore these &#x27;great deals&#x27; in the future and pay a little more for American made products.</li>
            <li>It was probably written somewhere when I placed the order and missed it, but overall the bag works fine.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit my foundation, powder, eye palettes (biggest being the new UD Naked Basics palette), primers, mascara, blush, eyeliners, etc in the bottom section alone and all my brushes (about 10 of them) in the upper section.</li>
            <li>I just got this bag today and it was absolutely to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>There are no reinforcements on the sides to keep it straight and hold the weight..</li>
            <li>Very displeased</li>
            <li>So, although it is not what the seller says it is, i still really like it.</li>
            <li>Too small buy very cute</li>
            <li>But to have it handy at the car, office or your everyday makeup essentials, will do.</li>
            <li>I love the pink and brown polka dot design!</li>
            <li>Cute make up bag but a bit on the small size but all in all still worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rather small compared to what is shown on the picture, though it is nice</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>and the bags have bright pink zippers (not the brown pictured), which clash with the pink of the dotted fabric.</li>
            <li>I gave this bag 5 stars because it is really cute, and seems more expensive than what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Nice size, although smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>The bag does not hold its shape and collapses in use and items fall out from the top compartment if left open while using the bottom compartment.</li>
            <li>I really liked the bag and it was made well, just smaller than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>I can now easily find my make-up when with other bags</li>
            <li>This little bag works great for my makeup that I use on a daily basis and I can just grab it and go since I am constantly transitioning from one location to another</li>
            <li>I have no negative comments towards this makeup bag.</li>
            <li>brown poka dots and pink background and its compartments are very useful -</li>
            <li>Thought it was going to be bigger, but when I got it, it&#x27;s actually smaller than what i thought which is fine</li>
            <li>But it is really cheap on the other way.</li>
            <li>The bag was smaller than I expected but it fits a lot products on the bottom compartment, the top comes with 5 slots to</li>
            <li>I am really not sure if I will be able to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really pink more of a mocha color had a little smell</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected but great small make up bag</li>
            <li>Holds all my essential makeup and it&#x27;s a cute little bag.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item over the holidays, even though the shipping took a little while, once the product was received, it was well worth the wait!  </li>
            <li>Cute but very small, doesn&#x27;t hold a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just okay and will serve the purpose in spite of the color being wrong.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be a little larger, but nonetheless it is a good everyday makeup bag!  </li>
            <li>I like it a lot, but it is not pink.</li>
            <li>Very cheap looking something you can purchase at the dollar store not happy!  </li>

            <li> I was able to fit my foundation, powder, eye palettes (biggest being the new UD Naked Basics palette), primers, mascara, blush, eyeliners, etc in the bottom section alone and all my brushes (about 10 of them) in the upper section.</li>
            <li> I just got this bag today and it was absolutely to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> There are no reinforcements on the sides to keep it straight and hold the weight..</li>
            <li> Very displeased</li>
            <li> So, although it is not what the seller says it is, i still really like it.</li>
            <li> Too small buy very cute</li>
            <li> But to have it handy at the car, office or your everyday makeup essentials, will do.</li>
            <li> I love the pink and brown polka dot design!</li>
            <li> Cute make up bag but a bit on the small size but all in all still worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rather small compared to what is shown on the picture, though it is nice</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> and the bags have bright pink zippers (not the brown pictured), which clash with the pink of the dotted fabric.</li>
            <li> I gave this bag 5 stars because it is really cute, and seems more expensive than what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Nice size, although smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> The bag does not hold its shape and collapses in use and items fall out from the top compartment if left open while using the bottom compartment.</li>
            <li> I really liked the bag and it was made well, just smaller than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I can now easily find my make-up when with other bags</li>
            <li> This little bag works great for my makeup that I use on a daily basis and I can just grab it and go since I am constantly transitioning from one location to another</li>
            <li> I have no negative comments towards this makeup bag.</li>
            <li> brown poka dots and pink background and its compartments are very useful -</li>
            <li> Thought it was going to be bigger, but when I got it, it&#x27;s actually smaller than what i thought which is fine</li>
            <li> But it is really cheap on the other way.</li>
            <li> The bag was smaller than I expected but it fits a lot products on the bottom compartment, the top comes with 5 slots to</li>
            <li> I am really not sure if I will be able to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really pink more of a mocha color had a little smell</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but great small make up bag</li>
            <li> Holds all my essential makeup and it&#x27;s a cute little bag.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item over the holidays, even though the shipping took a little while, once the product was received, it was well worth the wait!  </li>
            <li> Cute but very small, doesn&#x27;t hold a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just okay and will serve the purpose in spite of the color being wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a little larger, but nonetheless it is a good everyday makeup bag!  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot, but it is not pink.</li>
            <li> Very cheap looking something you can purchase at the dollar store not happy!  </li>
            <li> Even my box of false lashes fit in.</li>
            <li> When I got this as a Christmas present I thought it would be very big and would not fit into anything, but actually its very small and convenient, you can fit this into a luggage bag, a medium or big purse, and even a book bag.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said the same, so I was expecting it to be on the smaller side but for some reason, not as small as it really is.</li>
            <li> Just took a long time to get here.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller then expected.</li>
            <li> My brushes were too long.</li>
            <li> I thought it would come out a little big</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> it was a little smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> I ordered pink and coffee and got beige and brown (I guess coffee and cream).  </li>
            <li> The bag is not as big as I expected it to be but fits all of the make-up that I usually travel with (and</li>
            <li> I take this every time I travel, have a sleep over, or even if I just need it for every day duties, It is extremely compatible with all my luggage and fits every thing I need to carry in it.</li>
            <li> The mirror inside is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> The actual design and quality are top notch for the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late to send them back, so I&#x27;m hoping they air out.</li>
            <li> For $5.00, it is not worth the postage to return to wherever it came from.</li>
            <li> - it did had a slight smell</li>
            <li> A little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Faded and ugly - it wasn&#x27;t worth the money to return</li>
            <li> but the bag itself is not cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Way too much trouble to exchange</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy the bag due to some of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> it usually takes me some shuffling around to do so.</li>
            <li> Bags are not nearly as cute as pictured.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it was small when I use</li>
            <li> however they&#x27;re small.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time just unzipping it as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> It is not much nice than what I expect because it&#x27;s quality and color.</li>
            <li> i ordered the pink and brown polk a dot, i got a weird yellowish beigey color with brown polk a dots.  </li>
            <li> I hate this cheap ugly not worth</li>
            <li> Too small not happy with it.</li>
            <li> This case is very small, like a travel case.</li>
            <li> Overall, it really isn&#x27;t bad if you don&#x27;t have TONS of makeup.</li>
            <li> I do not want to put anything inside of it because it has such a bad chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> Not happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> My main issues with this is that is smells horrible.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that I specifically ordered the pink one but got the brown/tan one instead.</li>
            <li> so it just collapses on itself, so it&#x27;s difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> The material is bad and its diferent inside</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is not much nice than what I expect because it&#x27;s quality and color. But it is really cheap on the other way. So in overall, it is okay.</li>
            <li> I Just love it ! Every Thing is in The Right  place!!! Travels very Well!!!</li>
            <li> I just got this bag today and it was absolutely to my satisfaction. According to my opinion, it is a wonderful travel-sized bag to put my supplies in. The bag looked perfectly like the picture and there were no fringes or rips on it. The fabric that surrounds the outer covering is smooth and I love it very much! All in all, I give this product 5 stars and I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I hate this cheap ugly not worth it fell apart after first use</li>

            <li> Cute but very small, doesn&#x27;t hold a lot.</li>
            <li> This bag is absolutely adorable!  I bought it because it was so cheap but the bag itself is not cheaply made.  I almost didn&#x27;t buy the bag due to some of the negative reviews.  Apparently, I got a great bag.  I would order it again!</li>
            <li> Good,it makes me happy. All of my friends think it beautiful. I am so honor about that, I hope you can offer more stuff.</li>
            <li> If i could give this a no star i would!!!</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 2nd back - perfect for travel ... not big on makeup so everything fit in it - it did had a slight smell but then it went away in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Good. No unpleasant surprises. Just took a long time to get here.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a little larger, but nonetheless it is a good everyday makeup bag!  And the colors are super cute!</li>
            <li> When I got this as a Christmas present I thought it would be very big and would not fit into anything, but actually its very small and convenient, you can fit this into a luggage bag, a medium or big purse, and even a book bag. I am very, very  happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Cute.  Did not get here in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, very fashionable, all of my things fit just right, came in many colors ,couldn&#x27;t decide so I bought the all!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter she likes it.</li>
            <li> Cute bag, has no stiffness though so it just collapses on itself, so it&#x27;s difficult to use.  Wish the sides were sturdy enough to stay upright</li>
            <li> I love it and everything fits in it</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, I ordered this for a Christmas gift back on Nov. 13, it is now December and still have not got it. All they say is it is coming. Many reviews gave it a five star rating product maybe good but delivery time is terrible. I could of went to Walmart.</li>
            <li> Perfect ! I thought it would come out a little big but that&#x27;s not the problem  ! This bag fit all my makeup and it came out the exact color and looks perfect for my makeup products ! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this bag and I would recommend you guys should buy it if you haven&#x27;t :D</li>
            <li> The material is bad and its diferent inside</li>
            <li> A lot smaller then expected.</li>
            <li> The bag is not as big as I expected it to be but fits all of the make-up that I usually travel with (and that&#x27;s A LOT of make-up we&#x27;re talking about). It is adorable with it&#x27;s brown poka dots and pink background and its compartments are very useful - I can now easily find my make-up when with other bags it usually takes me some shuffling around to do so.</li>
            <li> This is adorable and perfect for a fashion-conscious tween. I purchased this for my niece and she absolutely loved organizing her small group of cosmetics into this travel case.</li>
            <li> Holds all my essential makeup and it&#x27;s a cute little bag. Easy to organize too, it&#x27;ll be perfect for my vacation coming up</li>
            <li> When I received this makeup bag I was more than pleased. It is exactly what I wanted not to big, not to small, and also a beautiful design that looks exactly like the picture, I have found the perfect makeup bag that I can carry around to my classes. Also comes with a mirror which is a bonus. I have no negative comments towards this makeup bag. Overall great price for this beautiful makeup bag:).</li>
            <li> they are very low quality and the color is nothing like the picture. beside the material is awful. the only thing good i have to say is that the shipping came on time.</li>
            <li> This is a durable bag with lots of room for storing make up. Makes it  very easy to transport also.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be a little bigger but I got what I payed for and it does fit all the things I want it too :) plus it&#x27;s really cute I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering another one for my family members soon</li>
            <li> This is a very handy makeup case.. Gave it four stars since its not sturdy, cant open both compartments at the same time without the stuff falling out.. There are no reinforcements on the sides to keep it straight and hold the weight.. But to have it handy at the car, office or your everyday makeup essentials, will do.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It is a good size.  Zippers work well.  Quality material.  A little flimsy.  When it isnt full it doesnt stand up like the picture shows but kinda falls over</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Ordered two of these as gifts for girls ages 7 and 10. Bags are not nearly as cute as pictured. The brown dots are kind of washed out and the bags have bright pink zippers (not the brown pictured), which clash with the pink of the dotted fabric. Plus, they have some sort of chemical smell. It&#x27;s too late to send them back, so I&#x27;m hoping they air out. Nothing to do about the appearance, though, just hope the girls don&#x27;t mind. I plan to ignore these &#x27;great deals&#x27; in the future and pay a little more for American made products.</li>
            <li> I take this every time I travel, have a sleep over, or even if I just need it for every day duties, It is extremely compatible with all my luggage and fits every thing I need to carry in it. Just perfect</li>
            <li> The quality is very cheap and flimsy and does not sit up as it looks in the picture, be hey, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the product is exactly as described - very good quality. Zippers and fabric are made of durable material! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed that I needed this for traveling. It is perfect. It holds all needs and like the fact that it folds. Just make sure you take time zippering it.</li>
            <li> Cheap material. Handle fell apart as soon as I touched it. Fit lots if things just wish the material was more durable and better made</li>
            <li> This case is super cute! I love the pink and brown polka dot design! However, when I first pulled it out of the box, my first thought was \\&quot;Geez is it small\\&quot;. I was expecting it to be bigger. I read other reviews that said the same, so I was expecting it to be on the smaller side but for some reason, not as small as it really is. That being said, surprisingly all my makeup can fit inside! The only thing I was really bummed about is the top section has places to put your brushes but my brushes are too tall, so I can&#x27;t use that area. It isn&#x27;t like I have gigantic brushes or anything either. I use Sephora and Shany brand brushes and they were ALL to tall! So instead I just put them in the top section at an angle. Overall, it really isn&#x27;t bad if you don&#x27;t have TONS of makeup. I was able to fit my foundation, powder, eye palettes (biggest being the new UD Naked Basics palette), primers, mascara, blush, eyeliners, etc in the bottom section alone and all my brushes (about 10 of them) in the upper section. The upside to the size is that it can easily fit into a travel bag without taking up too much room! :-) Overall, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected, I don&#x27;t have a lot of make up, so its perfect for someone like me.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect make up bag. Fit brushes on top on lots of space in the bottom for all ur makeup. and its perfect to grab and go if you need to,.</li>
            <li> i ordered the pink and brown polk a dot, i got a weird yellowish beigey color with brown polk a dots.  Not happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Adorable and my daughter in law loves it. I bought a bunch of nail products for her and was going to give to her in this cute  bag last Christmas. Took over a month to arrive. If you don&#x27;t need right away, it is cute. If in a hurry, order something else. It was probably written somewhere when I placed the order and missed it, but overall the bag works fine.</li>
            <li> This make up bag arrived well before the estimated delivery date and I was so happy with the shipping! The price is VERY reasonable. The coloring is not as nice as pictured but it was pink/tan with brown dots. The bag it&#x27;s self is a nice size-again at a very reasonable price. The zippers are not so great. I had a hard time just unzipping it as soon as I opened the package. The zipper handles are kinda cheapy plastic and the stitching was definitely not of any quality. The &amp;#34;new plastic&amp;#34; smell is overwhelming-actually very unpleasant chemical/plastic odor. Over all...I got what I paid for: a cheap, nice size make up bag. I would say if that is what you are looking for than this product is probably &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; for the price.</li>
            <li> Got today fell in love! It&#x27;s not really pink more of a mocha color had a little smell but it was fine, fit all of my makeup in it. Even my box of false lashes fit in. Love it worth the money. 😊</li>
            <li> Cute make up bag but a bit on the small size but all in all still worth the money. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I gave this bag 5 stars because it is really cute, and seems more expensive than what I paid for it.  I was very happy with it.  Just be aware that it appears to ship from China and took about a month to arrive (which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because I ordered it way ahead of when I needed it).</li>
            <li> Very cute! Serves its purpose well. Holds lots of makeup and has a fair amount of slots for makeup brushes. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but great small make up bag</li>
            <li> Very cheap looking something you can purchase at the dollar store not happy!  That is why for years I never made purchases on line.  I just started and now I have learned</li>
            <li> Too small not happy with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling with makeup!!</li>
            <li> Nice size, although smaller than expected. The bag does not hold its shape and collapses in use and items fall out from the top compartment if left open while using the bottom compartment. Logistically, not convenient.</li>
            <li> I will be sending this product back when I get it in.  This was for a Christmas gift and receiving it after January is not gonna get it.  Very displeased</li>
            <li> Okay, so this bag IS NOT PINK. it is more of a light coffee color with brown polka-dots. I like it a lot, but it is not pink. So, although it is not what the seller says it is, i still really like it. it was a little smaller than i expected but i can fit more than i thought in there. so, overall, i like the product and i definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I found this case to be smaller than I anticipated. It is also collapsible and comes completed folded. The mirror inside is pretty useless. It looks cute and fits all of my day to day makeup. For the price I am happy.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it was small when I use</li>
            <li> Thought it was going to be bigger, but when I got it, it&#x27;s actually smaller than what i thought which is fine cause I can use it for travel. Still pretty tho</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition! My granddaughter really loved it! Holds all of her makeup and is easy to keep clean!</li>
            <li> Received this and plan to use on our next trip</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while, but I understood since it was overseas but I was disappointed that I specifically ordered the pink one but got the brown/tan one instead. Way too much trouble to exchange so I kept it. Other than that, it serves its purpose. I like how it has 2 sections.</li>
            <li> A resident at the nursing home wanted a cosmetic bag. This one was a great price, and it has two compartments. She loved the bag at first glance!</li>
            <li> This little bag works great for my makeup that I use on a daily basis and I can just grab it and go since I am constantly transitioning from one location to another</li>
            <li> Love this bag. Use it to hold nail polish and accessories. Larger than it looks. Great value.</li>
            <li> This case is very small, like a travel case. It is a cute design and color. My main issues with this is that is smells horrible. I am really not sure if I will be able to get rid of the smell. I do not want to put anything inside of it because it has such a bad chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> Cutest make-up bag eva! It is so cool. I love the double zippers. Perfect price for this quality. It came in just a couple days, which was perfect timing. Great purchase, great make-up bag, love the shipping time!</li>
            <li> nice bag for my many things</li>
            <li> took forever to get it, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> was hoping it had more sturdiness for makeup and accessories but will be using it for travel</li>
            <li> I ordered pink and coffee and got beige and brown (I guess coffee and cream).  It&#x27;s really just okay and will serve the purpose in spite of the color being wrong.  It&#x27;s just not what I ordered.  For $5.00, it is not worth the postage to return to wherever it came from.</li>
            <li> As they say- you get what you pay for... item is rather flimsy. Item broke on the 2nd day of use. Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It was ok.did not receive the one that was advertised. wound up sending it back for an exchange</li>
            <li> Faded and ugly - it wasn&#x27;t worth the money to return so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Too small buy very cute</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. Also the color is a bit different and shiny (which I do NOT like). The zip holder teared off the first night! :|</li>
            <li> I really liked the bag and it was made well, just smaller than I had expected.  My brushes were too long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rather small compared to what is shown on the picture, though it is nice</li>
            <li> The bag was smaller than I expected but it fits a lot products on the bottom compartment, the top comes with 5 slots to however they&#x27;re small. It also comes with a band which I use to hold makeup brushes in place since they don&#x27;t fit in the slots. Overall it&#x27;s a good product for the price, and easy for travel.</li>
            <li> Love it, got two of them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item over the holidays, even though the shipping took a little while, once the product was received, it was well worth the wait!  I ordered this for my teenage daughter and she went nuts over it, and immediately began organizing her makeup and brushes in it.  She loved that there were multiple levels for separating her brushes and makeup for easy access.  She is still using this product months later.  The actual design and quality are top notch for the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
