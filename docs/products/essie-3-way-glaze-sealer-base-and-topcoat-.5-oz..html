            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of top coats and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>an a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>Also, a top coat touch up</li>
            <li>love the color</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Bought this in an effort to make a better gel type nail with an activator by Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never paid more than $3 for nail polish until I bought this.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, and  I got my nail polish nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>This product is great as far as the top coat is concerned.</li>
            <li>very good 2nd time</li>
            <li>Dries pretty fast and is very strong with great shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love essie nail polish because it&#x27;s free of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>This product is the best all-around clear polish.  </li>
            <li>It also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Leaves nails shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>a little length grew beautifully!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>The nail polish arrived on time and was securely wrapped.</li>
            <li>I clean under the edges with toothbrush &amp; toothpaste (Arm &amp; Hammer peroxide and baking soda brand), and that keeps the tips from staining.</li>
            <li>I always do my own manicures and like to have a professional look after.</li>
            <li>Definitely not anti chip but still a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;very good 2nd order.</li>
            <li>However, I think that its a good product overall</li>
            <li>this stuff works really well better than i had thought it would.</li>
            <li>I really hoped this would solve my nails from chipping the same day as I polish them, it helps but isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>3-Way lasts twice as long and remains bright and glossy.</li>
            <li>The product was new and safely shipped!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Personally think Revlon colorstay products work much better!</li>
            <li>but much better than the other top coats out there.</li>
            <li>Formula is nice, but doesnt dry as quickly as my poshe.</li>
            <li>It gives a great shine and hard finish to my nails.</li>
            <li>Same price better product.</li>
            <li>Nothing especially different than most polish.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much stronger with this polish!</li>
            <li>I like it, though not as much as Seche Vyte for a topcoat.</li>
            <li>photo looks yellowish, but it&#x27;s really bluish, to prevent yellowing</li>
            <li>I think people put too much polish on.</li>
            <li>Gave me only 3 days chip free wear.  </li>
            <li>plan to buy more in the near future</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly at all.</li>
            <li>great for both base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>It has high shine and</li>
            <li>Using plain clear nail polish would&#x27;ve given me better results.</li>
            <li>I applied three coats to clean nails, and it&#x27;s lasting a week so far, with just minor chipping.</li>
            <li>this clear coat works as well as any others.</li>
            <li>I put this on &amp; my usually soft nails that split and break as soon as I almost get</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t break until I got busy in life &amp; neglected my nail care.</li>
            <li>No trouble with this product at all.</li>
            <li>my nails look like I got them professionally done.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen has a good base and top coat with a blue cap.</li>
            <li>The BEST glaze sealer, base and topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in Walgreens for $10, followed the directions on the bottle (1 coat base, 2 coats color, 1 coat top coat) and then followed up with a China Glaze quick dry top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After applying it on to my nails last night, and having a worked a difficult shift I have to say that I&#x27;m really impressed in how little chipping has occurred.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have a problem with it taking forever to dry; it was mostly dry when I put on the other top coat.</li>
            <li>start with a base coat, then two coats of your favorite nail polish, and then one last top coat.</li>
            <li>I have natural nails that are normally dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite base coat and top coat, hands down.  </li>

            <li> The chipping is not really noticeable since there is no color under it.</li>
            <li> Usually all my nail polish would have chipped away, but its really minimal and not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of base coats, top coats and combos</li>
            <li> Used as top and base coat.</li>
            <li> The price was also less then in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nail polish on for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> My first Essie product and its quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> Easily applied and sturdy as base &amp; topcoat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy to use a seperate top and base coat.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth, shiny base for any color.</li>
            <li> Not too thick so it can be added to other polishes that may have thickened.</li>
            <li> Usually by the end of my work day, 75% of my polish is missing.</li>
            <li> Over the past 2 days...all my polish is still on.</li>
            <li> Makes my polish stay on without chips for at least a week.</li>
            <li> And I really like that just one product can serve as a base and topcoat.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t send the wrong one!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Somehow this topcoat is impossible to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Essie polishes before because of the price, however, I am completely sick of my nail polish peeling off.</li>
            <li> I use it for a base coat.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to base coat.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is the closest thing I could get to a gel manicure at home. It&#x27;s great! It does start to chip in about 4 days or so but much better than the other top coats out there.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product an a fantastic price! I put this on &amp; my usually soft nails that split and break as soon as I almost get a little length grew beautifully! They didn&#x27;t break until I got busy in life &amp; neglected my nail care. I am now a lifetime Essie 3-way glaze consumer!</li>
            <li> Somehow this topcoat is impossible to find in the stores. It gives a great shine and hard finish to my nails. I always do my own manicures and like to have a professional look after. This gives it to me. The price was also less then in the stores. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this item. It also arrived well packaged in 2 days. How can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected it to be. Works great. No trouble with this product at all. Leaves nails shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> i love essie nail polish because it&#x27;s free of harmful chemicals. this clear coat works as well as any others.</li>
            <li> great for both base and top coat.  Made my mani last for over a week without issues.  start with a base coat, then two coats of your favorite nail polish, and then one last top coat.</li>
            <li> This product is the best all-around clear polish.  Easily applied and sturdy as base &amp; topcoat.  Not too thick so it can be added to other polishes that may have thickened.</li>
            <li> This product is great as far as the top coat is concerned. It has high shine and my nails look like I got them professionally done. Definitely not anti chip but still a good product.</li>
            <li> My first Essie product and its quite disappointing. Using plain clear nail polish would&#x27;ve given me better results. Sally Hansen has a good base and top coat with a blue cap. Same price better product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of base coats, top coats and combos but this is my favorite!  I will be buying this again and again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base coat and top coat, hands down.  Any manicure or pedicure in which I&#x27;ve used 3-Way lasts twice as long and remains bright and glossy.</li>
            <li> I like it, though not as much as Seche Vyte for a topcoat. It doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly at all. I use it for a base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of top coats and this is by far the best. I&#x27;ve had my nail polish on for about a week and a half and it still hasn&#x27;t chipped.</li>
            <li> This is the only base/top coat I use. Makes my polish stay on without chips for at least a week. Of course, I am mindful of every day things such as cleaning or washing dishes with gloves, drying/cleaning my hands while preparing food, etc. Also, a top coat touch up mid-week seems to do the trick. I cannot recommend this enough!</li>
            <li> very good 2nd time ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very good 2nd order.</li>
            <li> The nail polish arrived on time and was securely wrapped. The product was new and safely shipped!&lt;br /&gt;I love the color and they didn&#x27;t send the wrong one!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and serves its purpose. Used as top and base coat. Nothing especially different than most polish.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, and  I got my nail polish nicely packaged. Formula is nice, but doesnt dry as quickly as my poshe. However, I think that its a good product overall cos I&#x27;m too lazy to use a seperate top and base coat.</li>
            <li> The BEST glaze sealer, base and topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.  What a great find.  My nails look healthier and polish last&#x27;s longer.</li>
            <li> I really hoped this would solve my nails from chipping the same day as I polish them, it helps but isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> I applied three coats to clean nails, and it&#x27;s lasting a week so far, with just minor chipping. The chipping is not really noticeable since there is no color under it. After 7 days, I&#x27;ve just trimmed and filed my nails, and it still looks alright. Dries pretty fast and is very strong with great shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo looks yellowish, but it&#x27;s really bluish, to prevent yellowing I suppose. It does not yellow. I have natural nails that are normally dry and brittle. They&#x27;re much stronger with this polish! I clean under the edges with toothbrush &amp; toothpaste (Arm &amp; Hammer peroxide and baking soda brand), and that keeps the tips from staining.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Essie polishes before because of the price, however, I am completely sick of my nail polish peeling off. Literally, the entire manicure would peel up like that play Barbie polish...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. I bought this in Walgreens for $10, followed the directions on the bottle (1 coat base, 2 coats color, 1 coat top coat) and then followed up with a China Glaze quick dry top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it taking forever to dry; it was mostly dry when I put on the other top coat. I think people put too much polish on. As for staying power, it is definitely working. Usually by the end of my work day, 75% of my polish is missing. Over the past 2 days...all my polish is still on. YAY!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Works great!</li>
            <li> After applying it on to my nails last night, and having a worked a difficult shift I have to say that I&#x27;m really impressed in how little chipping has occurred. Usually all my nail polish would have chipped away, but its really minimal and not really noticeable. Very happy with this product! :)</li>
            <li> this stuff works really well better than i had thought it would. plan to buy more in the near future</li>
            <li> This works really nicely. It helps my nail polish look nice for a longer time than just nail polish alone. And I really like that just one product can serve as a base and topcoat.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to base coat. It gives a smooth, shiny base for any color. It also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this in an effort to make a better gel type nail with an activator by Sally Hansen. Used OPI for color, got the idea from Pinterest we&#x27;ll see if it works! Heard this glaze was good anyway by itself.</li>
            <li> Read reviews that its supposed to help nail polish last longer and not chip.  Gave me only 3 days chip free wear.  Personally think Revlon colorstay products work much better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never paid more than $3 for nail polish until I bought this. I have since learned from the error of my ways. This product is great! My nails are stronger, no longer staining from polish, and healthy! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
