            <li>Neutrogena is amazing, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great facial bar soap or even just a soap to remove makeup.</li>
            <li>Good soap, cleans well, leaves a soft nice aroma afterward.  </li>
            <li>I have developed a rash to a lot of soaps and this one works great without causing issues.</li>
            <li>I have since switched to Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, which seems to work better.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>Good soap and the price is reasonable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on sensitive skin and it is beautiful and see through  ,nice to look at while you use it.</li>
            <li>Especially good for anyone allergic to some of the additives in other soaps.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love the clean smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave any soap residue on the shower doors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild</li>
            <li>Purchasing from Amazon made it so easy.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>This is the basic Neutrogena transparent bar with that great original scent!</li>
            <li>Best soap hands down.</li>
            <li>I bought it from a site on Amazon and frankly, I like the Black soap the best.  </li>
            <li>It is effective, gentle, hypoallergenic, and unscented.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of an inexpensive cleanser that was gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering how people are having such great luck with this soap?</li>
            <li>the price was right for this product given the cost at most places</li>
            <li>The original formula was not scentless.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing it for the original scent.</li>
            <li>My face is oily and after using this soap, my face is fresh and oily-free for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li>This is a very fine soap --- no scents, just pure and clean.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and not overly feminine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a film and leaves you feeling clean like a soap is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I am a nut when it comes to soaps as I buy soaps from all over the world mainly France and North Africa but this soap right here in the USA is just about the best in a pure, truly pure cleaning and fresh experience-</li>
            <li>I do love this soap as it leaves my skin feeling soft and very clean.  </li>
            <li>it was recommended by my Dermatologist, and he was right!  </li>
            <li>I have used the fragrance free Neutrogena facial bar and have been very pleased with it, but this time I decided to give the original a try.</li>
            <li>very good for my face, not as harsh as body soapsl</li>
            <li>Neutrogena \\&quot;Facial Bars\\&quot; are great for the whole body, including use as a shampoo/conditioner!</li>
            <li>All only good words I can say about this product.</li>
            <li>So clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Please remember that this soap will melt (disolve) quickly if you leave it floating in the tub, or leave it in a watery soap dish.</li>
            <li>price and worthy Of purchasing.</li>
            <li>Keeps me and my skin almost totally &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; free and it has a nice but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Dissolves and need replacement quickly</li>
            <li>Neutrogena transparent facial bar soap is such a wonderful soap, and it lasts a looooong time.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clear, but irritates my sinuses, as do most soaps.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, and the glycerine leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Neutrogena facial soap.</li>
            <li>As it has been discontinued, I&#x27;m back to this original formula and still love it.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure genetics played a major role,  but this has been her soap for most of her adult lifetime.  </li>
            <li>I really like the soap and its fragrance, and it leaves my face feeing clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>but I think the &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34; refers to how fast the original soaps wear out as you use them.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it right after this</li>
            <li>Just right.  </li>
            <li>My lovely wife is sensitive to perfumes and different soaps and for 50 years or more has used this product.  </li>
            <li>I rub my Clarisonic on it a few times, and the lather is amazing!</li>
            <li>Good stuff for typical forehead acne.  </li>
            <li>it seems to shrink very fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle to my skin too.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap very much</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial soap, and has been since the 1970s.</li>
            <li>but if you are very oily you might need that!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery; as promised!</li>
            <li>It is gentle to my skin, is non-drying and it has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>and it goes so fast!</li>
            <li>Not expensive.</li>
            <li>Always a good product to use for everyday cleansing.</li>
            <li>I like the Neutogena Deep Clean liquid soap better, even though the Deep Clean soap smells like beer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a clean, natural, non-irritating, non-drying (and not greasy) soap!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s cheap, cleans my face, last a long time, and it&#x27;s a good brand name.</li>
            <li>It feels clean and comfy so far, like it</li>
            <li>rinses off clean, skin is soft.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s no doubt because I&#x27;m using it for far, far more than my face.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and skin is baby soft!!</li>
            <li>When it was first produced I was using the dry-skin formula for my dry skin for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have an allergy to the metallic ingredients in most soaps, and I get pretty dry and itchy if I use them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using DHC&#x27;s Mild Soap for many years and loving it, but I recently decided that $17 a bar was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap and will be using it until the bank runs dry.  </li>
            <li>: Dissolves rather quickly as the soap is of a soft nature.</li>
            <li>so I have to moisturize with pure almond oil afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because of my need for a gentle soap on psoriatic skin patches...</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin and never leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>Turns out this soap is gentle on dirt, too.</li>
            <li>It does not remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the way this soap smells.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but cleans well.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on face without drying out skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>B0000AN9L9 Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar Bonus Pack, Original Formula - 6 each</li>
            <li>Target used to carry the original, now they only have the unscented - but that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;fine</li>
            <li>the soap with the original formula, (Not fragrance free) can be difficult, but Amazon always has it available.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to every person who cares about what they put on their skin.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The only negative I go through it so quick, but well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>He never misses using this soap and it really did clear up his acne.  </li>
            <li>Once I started using these bars of soap, my hands and fingers look normal and I haven&#x27;t had to bother with any of those medicines or dealt with any outbreaks.</li>
            <li>It might dry it out a little bit but does a good job of cleaning and helps prevent breakouts for me.</li>
            <li>But every other day works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products but the soap doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Funny that it is the same thing I used in high school.  </li>
            <li>I love these clear bars, just wish they were a little larger because I use them in my shower for my whole body.  </li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for this product locally and could not find it, and this is a very large city.</li>
            <li>I hoped it would help clear my skin...</li>
            <li>My face started to clear up after just a couple of days after using it.</li>
            <li>For people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is scented, so sensitive skins may react.</li>
            <li>Not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>So my skin is sensitive to shampoo ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then this product is for you.</li>
            <li>After reading glowing reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I decided to try this hoping it would help my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the Neutrogena Facial bars.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and no longer itches.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to scented things, I end up sneezing</li>
            <li>My son uses this twice/day and is acne is completely under control.  </li>
            <li>They last 1/2 as long or just as I remember they used to last many years ago when these were the only ones you could buy.  </li>
            <li>Had trouble finding scented original formula in stores.</li>
            <li>Washes off quickly and leaves only your smooth skin behind.  </li>
            <li>is what I wanted and this has the original formula AND the original scent which seems difficult to find just anywhere.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a film, like other soaps and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry or cause acne.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY facial bar that really works.</li>
            <li>When he gets black heads, we add a bit of baking soda to the suds and the blackheads come right off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use this product as long as the quality remains high.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this product is that being a soft bar makes them dissolve faster than many other products; however, that is a minor problem considering harder soaps almost always cause a reaction to my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have passed the acne prone version on to my teenage son and it keeps him clear.</li>
            <li>And, it does not dry like this soap does.  </li>
            <li>I buy this for my brother and it helps him since he has very sensitive skin and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I rinse my face with hot water, grab this bar, rub it between my hands a few times, then rub the lather on my face and massage it all around.</li>
            <li>I use it because most soaps are irritating to my eyes and leave me with dry itchy skin in the winter months.  </li>
            <li>The medical labs recommend that you use a glycerin soap like this or Black soap to clean the toxic waste off your skin that sweat brings to the surface.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Original Neutrogena soap bars for many years, this package of 6 bars is a great value.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more than 80 years of happy allegiance to an excellent product plus the lifelong attachment.</li>
            <li> These are the only face wash that keep me from breaking out - I LOVE THEM! :D</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d like to post a picture of her youthful face, but I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;d kill me for posting without permission.</li>
            <li> Many men like this soap for their face.</li>
            <li> Now I will never run out of my favorite hand soap.</li>
            <li> I have reordered this many times.</li>
            <li> Have used this soap for many years[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Interesting that by weight, this 6-pack of 3.5 oz.</li>
            <li> Love all the Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> Nice and and smooth on my skin, no complaints.</li>

            <li> with me as I get a better deal with Amizon</li>
            <li> Fresh smell, Lathers well, Non drying, Excellent for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is amazing, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great facial bar soap or even just a soap to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> Good soap, cleans well, leaves a soft nice aroma afterward.  </li>
            <li> I have developed a rash to a lot of soaps and this one works great without causing issues.</li>
            <li> I have since switched to Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, which seems to work better.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> Good soap and the price is reasonable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on sensitive skin and it is beautiful and see through  ,nice to look at while you use it.</li>
            <li> Especially good for anyone allergic to some of the additives in other soaps.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love the clean smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave any soap residue on the shower doors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild</li>
            <li> Purchasing from Amazon made it so easy.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.  </li>
            <li> This is the basic Neutrogena transparent bar with that great original scent!</li>
            <li> Best soap hands down.</li>
            <li> I bought it from a site on Amazon and frankly, I like the Black soap the best.  </li>
            <li> It is effective, gentle, hypoallergenic, and unscented.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of an inexpensive cleanser that was gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering how people are having such great luck with this soap?</li>
            <li> the price was right for this product given the cost at most places</li>
            <li> The original formula was not scentless.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing it for the original scent.</li>
            <li> My face is oily and after using this soap, my face is fresh and oily-free for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> This is a very fine soap --- no scents, just pure and clean.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and not overly feminine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a film and leaves you feeling clean like a soap is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I am a nut when it comes to soaps as I buy soaps from all over the world mainly France and North Africa but this soap right here in the USA is just about the best in a pure, truly pure cleaning and fresh experience-</li>
            <li> I do love this soap as it leaves my skin feeling soft and very clean.  </li>
            <li> it was recommended by my Dermatologist, and he was right!  </li>
            <li> I have used the fragrance free Neutrogena facial bar and have been very pleased with it, but this time I decided to give the original a try.</li>
            <li> very good for my face, not as harsh as body soapsl</li>
            <li> Neutrogena \\&quot;Facial Bars\\&quot; are great for the whole body, including use as a shampoo/conditioner!</li>
            <li> All only good words I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> So clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Please remember that this soap will melt (disolve) quickly if you leave it floating in the tub, or leave it in a watery soap dish.</li>
            <li> price and worthy Of purchasing.</li>
            <li> Keeps me and my skin almost totally &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; free and it has a nice but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> Dissolves and need replacement quickly</li>
            <li> Neutrogena transparent facial bar soap is such a wonderful soap, and it lasts a looooong time.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clear, but irritates my sinuses, as do most soaps.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and the glycerine leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Neutrogena facial soap.</li>
            <li> As it has been discontinued, I&#x27;m back to this original formula and still love it.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure genetics played a major role,  but this has been her soap for most of her adult lifetime.  </li>
            <li> I really like the soap and its fragrance, and it leaves my face feeing clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> but I think the &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34; refers to how fast the original soaps wear out as you use them.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it right after this</li>
            <li> Just right.  </li>
            <li> My lovely wife is sensitive to perfumes and different soaps and for 50 years or more has used this product.  </li>
            <li> I rub my Clarisonic on it a few times, and the lather is amazing!</li>
            <li> Good stuff for typical forehead acne.  </li>
            <li> it seems to shrink very fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle to my skin too.  </li>
            <li> I like this soap very much</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial soap, and has been since the 1970s.</li>
            <li> but if you are very oily you might need that!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery; as promised!</li>
            <li> It is gentle to my skin, is non-drying and it has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> and it goes so fast!</li>
            <li> Not expensive.</li>
            <li> Always a good product to use for everyday cleansing.</li>
            <li> I like the Neutogena Deep Clean liquid soap better, even though the Deep Clean soap smells like beer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a clean, natural, non-irritating, non-drying (and not greasy) soap!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s cheap, cleans my face, last a long time, and it&#x27;s a good brand name.</li>
            <li> It feels clean and comfy so far, like it</li>
            <li> rinses off clean, skin is soft.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s no doubt because I&#x27;m using it for far, far more than my face.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and skin is baby soft!!</li>
            <li> When it was first produced I was using the dry-skin formula for my dry skin for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have an allergy to the metallic ingredients in most soaps, and I get pretty dry and itchy if I use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHC&#x27;s Mild Soap for many years and loving it, but I recently decided that $17 a bar was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap and will be using it until the bank runs dry.  </li>
            <li> : Dissolves rather quickly as the soap is of a soft nature.</li>
            <li> so I have to moisturize with pure almond oil afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because of my need for a gentle soap on psoriatic skin patches...</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin and never leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> Turns out this soap is gentle on dirt, too.</li>
            <li> It does not remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the way this soap smells.  </li>
            <li> Gentle but cleans well.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on face without drying out skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> B0000AN9L9 Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar Bonus Pack, Original Formula - 6 each</li>
            <li> Target used to carry the original, now they only have the unscented - but that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;fine</li>
            <li> the soap with the original formula, (Not fragrance free) can be difficult, but Amazon always has it available.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to every person who cares about what they put on their skin.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The only negative I go through it so quick, but well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> He never misses using this soap and it really did clear up his acne.  </li>
            <li> Once I started using these bars of soap, my hands and fingers look normal and I haven&#x27;t had to bother with any of those medicines or dealt with any outbreaks.</li>
            <li> It might dry it out a little bit but does a good job of cleaning and helps prevent breakouts for me.</li>
            <li> But every other day works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products but the soap doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Funny that it is the same thing I used in high school.  </li>
            <li> I love these clear bars, just wish they were a little larger because I use them in my shower for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for this product locally and could not find it, and this is a very large city.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would help clear my skin...</li>
            <li> My face started to clear up after just a couple of days after using it.</li>
            <li> For people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is scented, so sensitive skins may react.</li>
            <li> Not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> So my skin is sensitive to shampoo ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> After reading glowing reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I decided to try this hoping it would help my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the Neutrogena Facial bars.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and no longer itches.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to scented things, I end up sneezing</li>
            <li> My son uses this twice/day and is acne is completely under control.  </li>
            <li> They last 1/2 as long or just as I remember they used to last many years ago when these were the only ones you could buy.  </li>
            <li> Had trouble finding scented original formula in stores.</li>
            <li> Washes off quickly and leaves only your smooth skin behind.  </li>
            <li> is what I wanted and this has the original formula AND the original scent which seems difficult to find just anywhere.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a film, like other soaps and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry or cause acne.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY facial bar that really works.</li>
            <li> When he gets black heads, we add a bit of baking soda to the suds and the blackheads come right off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use this product as long as the quality remains high.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that being a soft bar makes them dissolve faster than many other products; however, that is a minor problem considering harder soaps almost always cause a reaction to my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have passed the acne prone version on to my teenage son and it keeps him clear.</li>
            <li> And, it does not dry like this soap does.  </li>
            <li> I buy this for my brother and it helps him since he has very sensitive skin and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I rinse my face with hot water, grab this bar, rub it between my hands a few times, then rub the lather on my face and massage it all around.</li>
            <li> I use it because most soaps are irritating to my eyes and leave me with dry itchy skin in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> The medical labs recommend that you use a glycerin soap like this or Black soap to clean the toxic waste off your skin that sweat brings to the surface.  </li>
            <li> exactly right and hard to find retail anymore</li>
            <li> With other soaps I have to lather and rinse nearly 5 times before all of my makeup will come off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only soap that truly cleans my face, doesn&#x27;t leave it dry or oily, and prevents acne.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is the only soap that keeps my face from drying out in the dry, winter weather.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is no longer available for subscription order.</li>
            <li> Not too soft, not too harsh.</li>
            <li> After trying multiple cleansers, scrubs, matte cleansers, and other fancy products,  I tried this soap.  </li>
            <li> It works well on the face without leaving your face dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever felt so dry after using it for two days.</li>
            <li> and my skins does not feel dry any longer, so</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bars don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> When you buy it in bulk here on Amazon it brings the price way down to those other so-called name brand facial soaps.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry and itching from other soaps before I started using Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> With other soaps my face would dry out, but this soap leaves the moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li> These bars are truly unscented, and with my sensitive skin I have never had a negative reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> Not a huge discount from the local Walgreen&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> A little bit will go a long way with this soap since it lathers so well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend any other soap but this one.</li>
            <li> I did find raw Black African soap from Ghana that I like better--no petrol or chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> I try not to use it everyday because it starts to dry up my skin.</li>
            <li> These average over $3.00 a bar Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will buy them again though because they are a little too drying.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and then had trouble finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> Much less harsh than common soap</li>
            <li> Individual bars in a store are expensive in comparison.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this at  the usual place where I shop and</li>
            <li> My friend who is in derm gave me some small sample soaps (liquid version) and my son takes those with him to his friends house for sleepovers.  </li>
            <li> At least my scalp is no longer itchy, flaky, and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am unable to use harsh cleansers with a lot of chemicals, since they make me break out.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena soap is difficult to find in pharmacies and elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this soap.</li>
            <li> They were generally painful and terrible to look at up close.</li>
            <li> I tried it and within days my face is breaking out worst than it did when I was a teenager!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best soap hands down. It cleans, washes off cleanly and is good for your skin. I&#x27;ve heard complaints that it doesn&#x27;t lather, psssh, you know what they put int soap to make it lather? Whatever it is your skin doesn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! love it :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend any other soap but this one. Smells fresh and skin is baby soft!! The only negative I go through it so quick, but well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial soap, and has been since the 1970s.</li>
            <li> On time and as described.</li>
            <li> Really good and clean rinsing.</li>
            <li> Everything good. I had no problems.</li>
            <li> I am a nut when it comes to soaps as I buy soaps from all over the world mainly France and North Africa but this soap right here in the USA is just about the best in a pure, truly pure cleaning and fresh experience- it is almost a ritual!. Doesn&#x27;t get any better!</li>
            <li> Speedy shipment. Just as promised. Had trouble finding scented original formula in stores. Happy to get this.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, wish it would last longer, but still great stuff.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 40 years.</li>
            <li> I used to have these skin problems on my hands and fingers that would come in the form of boils, sometimes they would be itchy or skin would just flake off. the medicine my doctor got me which would just help treat it for the moment and then I would have to reapply it. They were generally painful and terrible to look at up close. Once I started using these bars of soap, my hands and fingers look normal and I haven&#x27;t had to bother with any of those medicines or dealt with any outbreaks. It has been 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Nice to know some things don&#x27;t change - I can count on this soap being what I used and liked decades ago.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clear, but irritates my sinuses, as do most soaps. I only use it on my face or spot treatment of body pimples. I wash my face every day with it and then wash again with a hypoallergenic soap to wash away the residue which, like I stated, causes me sinuses problems. I don&#x27;t take away any stars for that because it is a personal issue and I know how to counter it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Original Neutrogena soap bars for many years, this package of 6 bars is a great value.</li>
            <li> is what I wanted and this has the original formula AND the original scent which seems difficult to find just anywhere. I like it and I&#x27;ve missed it.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products but the soap doesn&#x27;t last very long.  it seems to shrink very fast.</li>
            <li> This is the basic Neutrogena transparent bar with that great original scent! What a deal! This is a great cleanser for the face! This was an item my dad turned me on to when I was a teenager and had some pimples. It&#x27;s just a clean, natural, non-irritating, non-drying (and not greasy) soap! Please remember that this soap will melt (disolve) quickly if you leave it floating in the tub, or leave it in a watery soap dish.</li>
            <li> I dont get the raves about the smell - which is OK - but the bar itself works great at keeping your face clearer than it was before.  I have/had persistent blackheads and pimples, and it is currently only here and there with this bar.  Not too soft, not too harsh. Just a good bar of soap.</li>
            <li> These are for a family member who loves them.</li>
            <li> Good product but pricy</li>
            <li> Not regret . I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena soap is difficult to find in pharmacies and elsewhere.  For people with sensitive skin it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
            <li> Good soap, cleans well, leaves a soft nice aroma afterward.  I purchased this because of my need for a gentle soap on psoriatic skin patches...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price and worthy Of purchasing.</li>
            <li> Very good soap for your body. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use harsh cleansers with a lot of chemicals, since they make me break out. These bars are basic cleansers that do the job and I don&#x27;t break out with them. I don&#x27;t think I will buy them again though because they are a little too drying.</li>
            <li> My lovely wife is sensitive to perfumes and different soaps and for 50 years or more has used this product.  I&#x27;d like to post a picture of her youthful face, but I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;d kill me for posting without permission. Just trust me, she looks ten or fifteen years younger than her age!  Now I am not saying that Nutrogena soap did that, I&#x27;m sure genetics played a major role,  but this has been her soap for most of her adult lifetime.  It is effective, gentle, hypoallergenic, and unscented.</li>
            <li> This is scented, so sensitive skins may react. I love the scent, and the glycerine leaves skin soft. Many men like this soap for their face. The scent is clean and not overly feminine. The bar will &amp;quot;sweat&amp;quot; in summer, so keep it in a dish that drains well.</li>
            <li> I bought all this soap when I bought an infrared sauna.  The medical labs recommend that you use a glycerin soap like this or Black soap to clean the toxic waste off your skin that sweat brings to the surface.  I used this soap when I was a teen and remembered its scent--which I like.  The soap is a bit drying so I have to moisturize with pure almond oil afterwards.  I did find raw Black African soap from Ghana that I like better--no petrol or chemicals in it.  And, it does not dry like this soap does.  I bought it from a site on Amazon and frankly, I like the Black soap the best.  Four stars because it dries the skin--but if you are very oily you might need that!</li>
            <li> exactly right and hard to find retail anymore</li>
            <li> I have always liked Neutrogena facial soap. It is clean and refreshing. I have not problem with the price either.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!  This is the ONLY facial bar that really works. Keeps me and my skin almost totally &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; free and it has a nice but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> I can get them for $1.97 a bar at Walmart and chain pharmacies. These average over $3.00 a bar Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this soap. It&#x27;s the only soap that truly cleans my face, doesn&#x27;t leave it dry or oily, and prevents acne. When my local supermarket stopped carrying it, I was dismayed. Amazon to the rescue!</li>
            <li> Have used this soap for years. Very easy on the face. Not harsh at all. Would recommend. The cost for a six pack is great. Individual bars in a store are expensive in comparison.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this soap. It&#x27;s gentle on sensitive skin and it is beautiful and see through  ,nice to look at while you use it.</li>
            <li> I was having no luck finding this product in the supermarkets or in a variety of drug stores, where I had been in the habit of buying them.  So...Amazon again was the answer.  Buy in bulk, save money, and have the convenience of home delivery.  Now I will never run out of my favorite hand soap.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s cheap, cleans my face, last a long time, and it&#x27;s a good brand name.</li>
            <li> Like buying this soap in the bonus pack.  Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years.  I&#x27;m always happy with the results.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film, like other soaps and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> So I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp. So my skin is sensitive to shampoo ingredients. It took me years of trial and error to find that this product solved that problem. I admit, I use a bar of soap to wash my hair. At least my scalp is no longer itchy, flaky, and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;This works great for me. I have reordered this many times.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then this product is for you. It works well on the face without leaving your face dry. I have developed a rash to a lot of soaps and this one works great without causing issues.</li>
            <li> The product was not as advertised. The original formula was not scentless. I plan to return it. I was purchasing it for the original scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for over 30 years. It is gentle on my skin and never leaves a residue. I believe it is the purest soap out there and would never use anything else. They also have one for people with acne which I used as a teen. I highly recommend this product to every person who cares about what they put on their skin.</li>
            <li> Been using Nuetrogena as a recommendation from my dermatologists 25 years ago. This is a great product. Doesn&#x27;t leave a film and leaves you feeling clean like a soap is supposed to. I have passed the acne prone version on to my teenage son and it keeps him clear. Great line of products.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells good&lt;br /&gt;Bar Dissolves and need replacement quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these 3 stars because, while they work well, I found the scent nauseating. The smell stayed in my nose days after I stopped using them and make me want to puke. I like the Neutogena Deep Clean liquid soap better, even though the Deep Clean soap smells like beer.</li>
            <li> Have used this soap for many years[[ASIN:B0000AN9L9 Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar Bonus Pack, Original Formula - 6 each and always find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After reading glowing reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I decided to try this hoping it would help my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I liked the idea of an inexpensive cleanser that was gentle on skin. Turns out this soap is gentle on dirt, too. It does not remove makeup very well. After use, makeup still comes off on my cleansing cloth! I have since switched to Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, which seems to work better.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this for years.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Have used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Interesting that by weight, this 6-pack of 3.5 oz. bars is cheaper than the 4 oz. bar 6-pack: 80¢/oz. vs 84¢/oz at today&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Much less harsh than common soap and it does a great job as an all-over body soap.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery; as promised!</li>
            <li> Shipping good, give me some more love with the price.  Not a huge discount from the local Walgreen&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering how people are having such great luck with this soap? I tried it and within days my face is breaking out worst than it did when I was a teenager! My face is oily and gross now! I hoped it would help clear my skin... I stopped using it and will go back to dove soap. I guess I just didn&#x27;t have good luck with it...</li>
            <li> Good soap and the price is reasonable</li>
            <li> I do love this soap as it leaves my skin feeling soft and very clean.  I can not use regular soap as&lt;br /&gt;it leaves a film on my skin, that seems to irritate it.</li>
            <li> My preference for face soap.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have used it for years. Best face washing soap.Period.</li>
            <li> I love these clear bars, just wish they were a little larger because I use them in my shower for my whole body.  I love the clean smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave any soap residue on the shower doors.  Love all the Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> it was recommended by my Dermatologist, and he was right!  My wife and I use it daily as part of our facial routine.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena bars have been in my household for over 13 years... I can&#x27;t use regular soap on my face/neck.  Always a good product to use for everyday cleansing.</li>
            <li> It feels clean and comfy so far, like it</li>
            <li> Nice and and smooth on my skin, no complaints. I would suggest it to anyone having skin break-out who want to get the ackne under control.</li>
            <li> I have used the fragrance free Neutrogena facial bar and have been very pleased with it, but this time I decided to give the original a try. I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever felt so dry after using it for two days. I stopped using it right after this and my skins does not feel dry any longer, so it must have been the soap, which caused this dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena soap for my face for the last 30 years. It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry or cause acne. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap.&lt;br /&gt;You feel like you are in a spa shower when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;No residue.  Just so fresh-smelling.</li>
            <li> I have used and relied on Neutragena for 30 years and I&#x27;ll use until I die.  Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Good price.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It has the gratest fragrence.  Not too strong.  Just right.  My wife likes to cuddle after I&#x27;ve taken my shower.</li>
            <li> These are the only face wash that keep me from breaking out - I LOVE THEM! :D</li>
            <li> Great soap for the face.  My face is oily and after using this soap, my face is fresh and oily-free for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> Yes! Yes! Yes!  I love this soap and will be using it until the bank runs dry.  Great for your skin.  Washes off quickly and leaves only your smooth skin behind.  Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It is gentle to my skin, is non-drying and it has a fresh smell. I used this years ago and then had trouble finding it in stores. I&#x27;m glad I can get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena facial soap since 2002 and it&#x27;s great for the skin. It might dry it out a little bit but does a good job of cleaning and helps prevent breakouts for me.</li>
            <li> When it was first produced I was using the dry-skin formula for my dry skin for many years.  As it has been discontinued, I&#x27;m back to this original formula and still love it.  It is the absolutely only thing I use for washing my face...rinses off clean, skin is soft.  All only good words I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this soap smells.  It&#x27;s very gentle to my skin too.  The only thing is that it can&#x27;t be left standing in water.  It melts rapidly.</li>
            <li> It is the best soap product that I have ever used even if it gets used up fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena glycerine soap since I was a teenager in the 1970s.  I really like the soap and its fragrance, and it leaves my face feeing clean and fresh.  Unfortunately, this product is no longer available for subscription order.</li>
            <li> Gentle but cleans well.  Have used this soap for decades because it&#x27;s great for hypersensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These bar soaps last way longer than the liquid soaps. I do notice that I need to put face lotion on quicker than if I just used my liquid Neutrogena, but haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin. Good soap for a good price!</li>
            <li> Best deal. Exp at stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHC&#x27;s Mild Soap for many years and loving it, but I recently decided that $17 a bar was ridiculous.  I remembered Neutrogena from my youth and ordered six bars.  It&#x27;s very mild and I&#x27;m very happy!!</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to the metallic ingredients in most soaps, and I get pretty dry and itchy if I use them. I use these bars for my whole body, and they are great.</li>
            <li> After trying multiple cleansers, scrubs, matte cleansers, and other fancy products,  I tried this soap.  It cleans my face and smells great.  This is now my go to facial soap.</li>
            <li> This is really a great bar for bath, even for face, if you use soap on your face; I do, then follow with my good Acure Day Cream.  I recommend this soap bar.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena products since my European childhood...that&#x27;s more than 80 years of happy allegiance to an excellent product plus the lifelong attachment.</li>
            <li> Gentle on face without drying out skin. Love these.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my brother and it helps him since he has very sensitive skin and dry skin.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this at  the usual place where I shop and the price was right for this product given the cost at most places I checked.  I use it because most soaps are irritating to my eyes and leave me with dry itchy skin in the winter months.  Last, this soap is devoid of all fragrance as far as my geriatric nose can determine.</li>
            <li> This soap used to be good but it doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore and it goes so fast! One bar might last you 1 day.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena \\&quot;Facial Bars\\&quot; are great for the whole body, including use as a shampoo/conditioner! I had no idea I&#x27;d be so pleased with the product. My only complaint is that the bars don&#x27;t last long. But that&#x27;s no doubt because I&#x27;m using it for far, far more than my face. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like the Neutrogena Facial bars. My skin was dry and itching from other soaps before I started using Neutrogena. My skin feels soft and no longer itches. Purchasing from Amazon made it so easy.</li>
            <li> This soap has been around for years. Pros: Fresh smell, Lathers well, Non drying, Excellent for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Dissolves rather quickly as the soap is of a soft nature. That being said, keeping this soap around can get costly,&lt;br /&gt;but  buying on Amazon is great as good prices are available for buying in volume with the luxury of delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Finding the soap with the original formula, (Not fragrance free) can be difficult, but Amazon always has it available.</li>
            <li> I like the soap but hadn&#x27;t realized it was scented. I am sensitive to scented things, I end up sneezing</li>
            <li> I like this soap very much but I think the &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34; refers to how fast the original soaps wear out as you use them.  They last 1/2 as long or just as I remember they used to last many years ago when these were the only ones you could buy.  I could be mistaken and it could be all in my head but . . . . . that is my impression.</li>
            <li> Great for a pre shave because of the glycerine. Not expensive.</li>
            <li> As advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena bars, perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. So clean and fresh. Neutrogena is the only soap that keeps my face from drying out in the dry, winter weather.</li>
            <li> very good for my face, not as harsh as body soapsl</li>
            <li> My son uses this twice/day and is acne is completely under control.  Funny that it is the same thing I used in high school.  My friend who is in derm gave me some small sample soaps (liquid version) and my son takes those with him to his friends house for sleepovers.  He never misses using this soap and it really did clear up his acne.  When he gets black heads, we add a bit of baking soda to the suds and the blackheads come right off.  Good stuff for typical forehead acne.  Knocked it out</li>
            <li> This is the soap that my Dr. of Aesthetics recommended (she is an M.D.) I like the way my skin feels after I use it and it does not seem to clog up my pours at all. When you buy it in bulk here on Amazon it brings the price way down to those other so-called name brand facial soaps.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, exactly what I expected. Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I have used these facial bars for years. They are great. These bars are truly unscented, and with my sensitive skin I have never had a negative reaction to this product. The only downside to this product is that being a soft bar makes them dissolve faster than many other products; however, that is a minor problem considering harder soaps almost always cause a reaction to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product as long as the quality remains high.</li>
            <li> LOVE this soap, I have been using it for years.  Target used to carry the original, now they only have the unscented - but that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;fine with me as I get a better deal with Amizon</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for this product locally and could not find it, and this is a very large city. Thankfully we have Amazon. This is a very fine soap --- no scents, just pure and clean. Especially good for anyone allergic to some of the additives in other soaps.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena transparent facial bar soap is such a wonderful soap, and it lasts a looooong time. I use this with my Clarisonic and it works wonders! With other soaps my face would dry out, but this soap leaves the moisture in your skin. A little bit will go a long way with this soap since it lathers so well. I rub my Clarisonic on it a few times, and the lather is amazing! It is also great for removing makeup. I rinse my face with hot water, grab this bar, rub it between my hands a few times, then rub the lather on my face and massage it all around. I only have to do that once to get all of my make up off. With other soaps I have to lather and rinse nearly 5 times before all of my makeup will come off. Neutrogena is amazing, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great facial bar soap or even just a soap to remove makeup. Oh! and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> My face started to clear up after just a couple of days after using it. I try not to use it everyday because it starts to dry up my skin. But every other day works just fine for me.</li>
