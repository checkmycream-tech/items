            <li>good job</li>
            <li>worked as good as the store brands for i have bought</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you have oily hair.</li>
            <li>Salon products are superior.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and the results.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good too.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but I do love almost all Redken products.</li>
            <li>This is great price as you pay a lot more in the salon.</li>
            <li>I have used these products for about a year now and am very satisfied</li>
            <li>I would recommend to another for very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that she was so pleased with her gift.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo &amp; conditioner!</li>
            <li>An amazing shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this is good shampoo, you just may need a better formula from Redkin for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s nice and I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair as often.</li>
            <li>If i had to guess, I would say it smells kind of  like almond oil?</li>
            <li>From the first use, I noticed an incredible difference.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fine but conditioner not so good.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best redken shampoo/conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>In by far the best</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that REDKEN ALL SOFT is the best Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and Conditioner, and for the price it was even better.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner from Redken.</li>
            <li>but this is much better for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great price and the real deal.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be great heard so much about it from my beautician.  </li>
            <li>But, it gets better after repeated use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I do like the tube cream conditioner better than the bottled version /</li>
            <li>my hair responds better to it.</li>
            <li>however the conditioner isn&#x27;t outstanding.</li>
            <li>Way better products out there for the money.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report this stuff is  the real deal.</li>
            <li>I love the product and would purchse it again</li>
            <li>I like it better than the heavier purple bottle</li>
            <li>but now I found them at an even better price.</li>
            <li>This is such a great hair care product!</li>
            <li>as for this buyer i&#x27;m pleased as well no conplaints here. :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and continue to reorder over and over.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner is phenomenal -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to purchase them.</li>
            <li>Man do I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly, if I had to guess it would be a vanilla infused light floral, it&#x27;s an exotic, warm smell.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many kinds of shampoos ranging in price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever bleached your hair many shades  </li>
            <li>which makes it so easy to use</li>
            <li>The products make myt hair easy to style when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner and think that you need to get both to have the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I color my hair a lot, I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Great and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>But with this shampoo, it keeps my hair nice and dry (in a good way).</li>
            <li>a little and get great results!!</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner will give you a smooth, shine to your hair.</li>
            <li>I did not worry to much about it and thought it is my own imagination.  </li>
            <li>SO it&#x27;s worth it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Redken&#x27;s All Soft line is BY FAR the best thing on the market.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much more healthy and I noticed that after switching to this shampoo, my hair is growing super fast!</li>
            <li>, none the less and the service was great :)</li>
            <li>I would buy this product no matter what the cost because my hair is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Worth the $!</li>
            <li>I have used several kinds and I must say All Soft is one of the best.</li>
            <li>Got it for my 8 year old, i love it!</li>
            <li>I love these large bottles for my shower</li>
            <li>She was so right!  </li>
            <li>great for my hair and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li>All soft is so thick, smells great and leaves your hair smelling great.</li>
            <li>This is better than your Pantenes and Garnier Fructis, but really isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many shampoos and conditioners trying to find one that I really like.  </li>
            <li>(for lack of a better word, haha.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a BAD smell..</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft, smooth and tangle free!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and no mess. :]</li>
            <li>It leaves hair silky smooth, and smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love Redken all soft.</li>
            <li>I have used Redken All Soft Shampoo for many years.  </li>
            <li>So soft, shiny, silky, and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Redkin is one of my favorite shampoo/conditioner, leaves hair so silky soft.</li>
            <li>I got this on recommendation of a friend of mine that has ridiculously long, shiny, soft beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>All soft and a really good flat iron makes me the envy of every wimpy haired girl!</li>
            <li>I have coarse Mexican hair and this seems to be the only shampoo/conditioner that I feel works best for me.  </li>
            <li>really fast!</li>
            <li>This is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time at my mothers house and wondered why I have never seen it in stored before.</li>
            <li>Firstly it feels like the products does not rise out</li>
            <li>Was on time and exactly as described</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of any of the Redken conditioners (mostly) but</li>
            <li>The shampoo works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li>Very high quality shampoo and conditioner at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This does a great job keeping my hair soft without making it limp.</li>
            <li>So soft really does make your hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Love how it doesnt dry out my hair, but adds moisture.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild to me...almost like a vanilla cream or something, but not necessarily vanilla.</li>
            <li>But I only experienced a slight improvement, and with just the shampoo.</li>
            <li>This are a wonderful combination for my thick dry hair.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really recomend that.</li>
            <li>i really like the product.</li>
            <li>Very picky about what I use on my hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner, however, doesn&#x27;t seem to make much a difference where softness is concerned, and I feel that I have to use a lot of it to get anywhere.</li>
            <li>It really does waht it says it does, make your hair &amp;#34;all soft&amp;#34; that is.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend doing that!</li>
            <li>I really thought for awhile shampoo brands don&#x27;t matter too much</li>
            <li>Since using it my hair looks and feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li>We have thick curly hair and this keeps our hair nice and soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>others have left my hair healthy and eases my frizz considerably.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft, shiny, and helps with tangles!!!  </li>
            <li>With only the first wash I noticed a difference in my hair texture (curly course hair)!!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered from this supplier \\&quot;Beauty Choice New York\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Good for those aged above 50 with normal hair.  </li>
            <li>This particular gift was requested and very well received.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought some redken extreme too but its not as good as all soft.</li>
            <li>All Soft by Redken keeps my hair so soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>It was a favorite item of a granddaughter who said she had trouble finding the product and really wanted it for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>My hairdresser has been using it since high school</li>
            <li>I keep a little foil on top of the bottle in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  used them 3 times, and they made the texture pf y hair feel so soft, look vibrant and shiny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo before and can assure you that it is the real All Soft shampoo and Conditioner from Redkin, in case you had any doubts.</li>
            <li>As far as salon products go this one is really on the lowest tier in my book.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner as it makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>This product really does make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>my hair is somewhat soft despite being very damaged.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the size will last a long time.</li>
            <li>overall, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner, makes hair soft but not weighed Down, Redkin</li>
            <li>in my shower right now, but I used each one once or twice and went back to my All-Soft.  </li>
            <li>will continue to purchase since it really helped my hair go from semi-processed and thick to a nice soft silky feel without losing a natural thickness you want to keep.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Beauty Choice New York\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Next time I will be more careful when I order.</li>
            <li>My hair is super dry and damaged and everytime I use this, my hair changes 180 degrees.</li>
            <li>I have very course dry hair and from the first use I saw a change in the texture .</li>
            <li>Every time I try something else, I always return to All Soft!</li>
            <li>This was actually the first time i&#x27;ve used redken (on myself) and i was pleasnently surprised.</li>
            <li>The conditioner does make your hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and silk</li>
            <li>And even when I was in need a perm it still made my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>All Soft</li>
            <li>and secondly it does not moisture my hair, instead it just does not do anything apart from an intense perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lighter product and did make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Shiny and soft hair</li>
            <li>I am unsure the product is the real redken; it feels somewhat different in my hair which gives me some concern.</li>
            <li>DID NOT MAKE MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINNY</li>
            <li>My only issue with these in particular is that I don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I have a full head of thick, full, wavy hair that refuses to hold any type of style and is dry, poofy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and live in Houston (read gross and humid) and this conditioner takes all the tangles out, relaxes my hair, and makes it insanely soft.</li>
            <li>These products were exactly what I had expected, and they arrived in the estimated time given by the supplier.</li>
            <li>suppose that because of the high cost, I expected a greater improvement in the way my hair feels, especially after giving these a few months to work.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, rinses well, and leaves my hair soft and tangle-free enough to brush it wet right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that delivers enough moisture to actually soften my hair and make straightening possible.</li>
            <li>and it was clear the content of the product does not deliver the same results as the Redken</li>
            <li>but I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to last long and paying that much over and over again</li>
            <li>I like to try lots of different brands of shampoo and conditioner, and this redken all soft set doesn&#x27;t stand out to me at all.</li>
            <li>All soft is the only shampoo and conditioner that actually leaves my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still think these are a bit expensive but every time I shower, it feels like I just sat in the shampoo chair at a nice salon</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products for dry or dyed hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get as much buildup as I do with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so soft whether I blow dry it or not.</li>
            <li>but i haven&#x27;t noticed too much of an improvement from my last shampoo/conditioner (i previously used Bed Head).</li>

            <li> Great price and the real deal.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be great heard so much about it from my beautician.  </li>
            <li> But, it gets better after repeated use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I do like the tube cream conditioner better than the bottled version /</li>
            <li> my hair responds better to it.</li>
            <li> however the conditioner isn&#x27;t outstanding.</li>
            <li> Way better products out there for the money.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report this stuff is  the real deal.</li>
            <li> I love the product and would purchse it again</li>
            <li> I like it better than the heavier purple bottle</li>
            <li> but now I found them at an even better price.</li>
            <li> This is such a great hair care product!</li>
            <li> as for this buyer i&#x27;m pleased as well no conplaints here. :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and continue to reorder over and over.  </li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is phenomenal -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to purchase them.</li>
            <li> Man do I love this product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly, if I had to guess it would be a vanilla infused light floral, it&#x27;s an exotic, warm smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many kinds of shampoos ranging in price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever bleached your hair many shades  </li>
            <li> which makes it so easy to use</li>
            <li> The products make myt hair easy to style when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner and think that you need to get both to have the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I color my hair a lot, I have fine hair</li>
            <li> Great and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> But with this shampoo, it keeps my hair nice and dry (in a good way).</li>
            <li> a little and get great results!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner will give you a smooth, shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> I did not worry to much about it and thought it is my own imagination.  </li>
            <li> SO it&#x27;s worth it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Redken&#x27;s All Soft line is BY FAR the best thing on the market.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much more healthy and I noticed that after switching to this shampoo, my hair is growing super fast!</li>
            <li> , none the less and the service was great :)</li>
            <li> I would buy this product no matter what the cost because my hair is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Worth the $!</li>
            <li> I have used several kinds and I must say All Soft is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Got it for my 8 year old, i love it!</li>
            <li> I love these large bottles for my shower</li>
            <li> She was so right!  </li>
            <li> great for my hair and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> All soft is so thick, smells great and leaves your hair smelling great.</li>
            <li> This is better than your Pantenes and Garnier Fructis, but really isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many shampoos and conditioners trying to find one that I really like.  </li>
            <li> (for lack of a better word, haha.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a BAD smell..</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft, smooth and tangle free!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and no mess. :]</li>
            <li> It leaves hair silky smooth, and smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love Redken all soft.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken All Soft Shampoo for many years.  </li>
            <li> So soft, shiny, silky, and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love it on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Redkin is one of my favorite shampoo/conditioner, leaves hair so silky soft.</li>
            <li> I got this on recommendation of a friend of mine that has ridiculously long, shiny, soft beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li> the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> All soft and a really good flat iron makes me the envy of every wimpy haired girl!</li>
            <li> I have coarse Mexican hair and this seems to be the only shampoo/conditioner that I feel works best for me.  </li>
            <li> really fast!</li>
            <li> This is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time at my mothers house and wondered why I have never seen it in stored before.</li>
            <li> Firstly it feels like the products does not rise out</li>
            <li> Was on time and exactly as described</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of any of the Redken conditioners (mostly) but</li>
            <li> The shampoo works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li> Very high quality shampoo and conditioner at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This does a great job keeping my hair soft without making it limp.</li>
            <li> So soft really does make your hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Love how it doesnt dry out my hair, but adds moisture.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild to me...almost like a vanilla cream or something, but not necessarily vanilla.</li>
            <li> But I only experienced a slight improvement, and with just the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This are a wonderful combination for my thick dry hair.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really recomend that.</li>
            <li> i really like the product.</li>
            <li> Very picky about what I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner, however, doesn&#x27;t seem to make much a difference where softness is concerned, and I feel that I have to use a lot of it to get anywhere.</li>
            <li> It really does waht it says it does, make your hair &amp;#34;all soft&amp;#34; that is.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend doing that!</li>
            <li> I really thought for awhile shampoo brands don&#x27;t matter too much</li>
            <li> Since using it my hair looks and feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li> We have thick curly hair and this keeps our hair nice and soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> others have left my hair healthy and eases my frizz considerably.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft, shiny, and helps with tangles!!!  </li>
            <li> With only the first wash I noticed a difference in my hair texture (curly course hair)!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered from this supplier \\&quot;Beauty Choice New York\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Good for those aged above 50 with normal hair.  </li>
            <li> This particular gift was requested and very well received.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought some redken extreme too but its not as good as all soft.</li>
            <li> All Soft by Redken keeps my hair so soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> It was a favorite item of a granddaughter who said she had trouble finding the product and really wanted it for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has been using it since high school</li>
            <li> I keep a little foil on top of the bottle in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used them 3 times, and they made the texture pf y hair feel so soft, look vibrant and shiny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo before and can assure you that it is the real All Soft shampoo and Conditioner from Redkin, in case you had any doubts.</li>
            <li> As far as salon products go this one is really on the lowest tier in my book.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner as it makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> This product really does make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> my hair is somewhat soft despite being very damaged.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the size will last a long time.</li>
            <li> overall, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner, makes hair soft but not weighed Down, Redkin</li>
            <li> in my shower right now, but I used each one once or twice and went back to my All-Soft.  </li>
            <li> will continue to purchase since it really helped my hair go from semi-processed and thick to a nice soft silky feel without losing a natural thickness you want to keep.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Beauty Choice New York\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Next time I will be more careful when I order.</li>
            <li> My hair is super dry and damaged and everytime I use this, my hair changes 180 degrees.</li>
            <li> I have very course dry hair and from the first use I saw a change in the texture .</li>
            <li> Every time I try something else, I always return to All Soft!</li>
            <li> This was actually the first time i&#x27;ve used redken (on myself) and i was pleasnently surprised.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does make your hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft and silk</li>
            <li> And even when I was in need a perm it still made my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> All Soft</li>
            <li> and secondly it does not moisture my hair, instead it just does not do anything apart from an intense perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter product and did make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Shiny and soft hair</li>
            <li> I am unsure the product is the real redken; it feels somewhat different in my hair which gives me some concern.</li>
            <li> DID NOT MAKE MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINNY</li>
            <li> My only issue with these in particular is that I don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I have a full head of thick, full, wavy hair that refuses to hold any type of style and is dry, poofy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and live in Houston (read gross and humid) and this conditioner takes all the tangles out, relaxes my hair, and makes it insanely soft.</li>
            <li> These products were exactly what I had expected, and they arrived in the estimated time given by the supplier.</li>
            <li> suppose that because of the high cost, I expected a greater improvement in the way my hair feels, especially after giving these a few months to work.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, rinses well, and leaves my hair soft and tangle-free enough to brush it wet right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that delivers enough moisture to actually soften my hair and make straightening possible.</li>
            <li> and it was clear the content of the product does not deliver the same results as the Redken</li>
            <li> but I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to last long and paying that much over and over again</li>
            <li> I like to try lots of different brands of shampoo and conditioner, and this redken all soft set doesn&#x27;t stand out to me at all.</li>
            <li> All soft is the only shampoo and conditioner that actually leaves my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still think these are a bit expensive but every time I shower, it feels like I just sat in the shampoo chair at a nice salon</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products for dry or dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get as much buildup as I do with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so soft whether I blow dry it or not.</li>
            <li> but i haven&#x27;t noticed too much of an improvement from my last shampoo/conditioner (i previously used Bed Head).</li>
            <li> The conditioner, when compared with what I had left in my current bottle (same size) is clearly not the same product.  </li>
            <li> All Soft and Extreme are my faves.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair sleek, less breakage and so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I color and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Left my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> Also I have color treated hair - and this DOES NOT strip the color out  (as some other shampoos in general can do).  </li>
            <li> I shampoo my hair every other day and condition only on the opposite days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other pricey shampoos, this is the only one I don&#x27;t regret buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and haven&#x27;t felt the need to switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> , I have long somewhat curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I prefer fruity or perfumey smells, not natural oil types of scents..</li>
            <li> Not the same all-soft product I expected.</li>
            <li> It is very meek and runny, and I&#x27;d prefer a conditioner that is thick and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I prefer the Blonde Glam and those have gone up tremendously in price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any change compared to my other brands, don&#x27;t really love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> I have dry course hair that is long.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t become too dry and brittle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - IT WAS FRIZZY AND DRY</li>
            <li> tried the Blonde one previously</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference, even when it was wet.</li>
            <li> When your bleached hair is wet, it feels damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent literally the past 10 years changing shampoos and conditioners on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I bought it after several hairdressers suggested it to me, due to having some frustrating hair issues--oily roots and dry, thick hair, as though the natural oils don&#x27;t travel down the hair shaft properly.</li>
            <li> I have fine/coarse wavy hair and live in an area with very hard water.</li>
            <li> Once that extreme runs out</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but nothing ever works as well.</li>
            <li> the only reason I gave this a 4 star is that you can usually find it cheaper at the hair cuttery and other discount hair cut places</li>
            <li> I do not see any difference than fromany other shampoo other than hair seems smoother</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean-feeling and a bit softer, and I have to use less than I have for other shampoos.</li>
            <li> not worth the hassle which is probably what this storefront counts on.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t make my hair worse at least.  </li>
            <li> received this product in a timely manner from distributor but the product was less than what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> and they were alot less money out of my pocket.</li>
            <li> have long hair and this set usually lasts me around three months!</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure what some of this other posts were about.</li>
            <li> What I received is thin and runny comparatively and even the color is noticeably different.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner helps tame the Mane.</li>
            <li> I wondered if the shampoo and conditioner is way past its expire date</li>
            <li> Hair is all silky and no more tangles.</li>
            <li> I keep a couple of small bottle to refill when I travel.  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way to never use store products.</li>
            <li> the packaging was a little faulty - when I received the package, the cap had broken off the conditioner bottle.</li>
            <li> I find myself using gobs of conditioner to get the softness I want and its just not effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Impossible not to waste part of it.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my frizz under control and does wonders for me especially during brutal MN winters.</li>
            <li> Wrong</li>
            <li> Try this, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I should have read the 1-3 star reviews before purchasing.  The conditioner, when compared with what I had left in my current bottle (same size) is clearly not the same product.  What I received is thin and runny comparatively and even the color is noticeably different. Even so, I tried the product and it was not conditioning - rather than silky, my hair looked like it had not been washed for 3 days.  I would not use this on my hair again.  Whether expired or a different formulation, this product did not match the expectation of what was ordered. Note that there is a restocking fee of 15% plus you pay to ship back so not worth the hassle which is probably what this storefront counts on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and Conditioner, and for the price it was even better. The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner from Redken. I bleach my hair every 6-8 weeks and this is perfect to manager my hair so it doesn&#x27;t become too dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Blonde one previously but this is much better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get as much buildup as I do with other shampoos.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and haven&#x27;t felt the need to switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> Redken&#x27;s All Soft line is BY FAR the best thing on the market. I have a full head of thick, full, wavy hair that refuses to hold any type of style and is dry, poofy and unmanageable. I&#x27;ve spent literally the past 10 years changing shampoos and conditioners on a regular basis. This is the first product that delivers enough moisture to actually soften my hair and make straightening possible. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great price and the real deal. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo before and can assure you that it is the real All Soft shampoo and Conditioner from Redkin, in case you had any doubts. Unfortunately, I prefer the Blonde Glam and those have gone up tremendously in price. Not sure why exactly, perhaps they&#x27;ve been discontinued. Anyhow, this is good shampoo, you just may need a better formula from Redkin for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> great for my hair and arrived as expected.Taped up so no leakage and no dents in the bottles. good job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I have coarse Mexican hair and this seems to be the only shampoo/conditioner that I feel works best for me.  I shampoo my hair every other day and condition only on the opposite days.  Works for me.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be great heard so much about it from my beautician.  Wrong it is NOT this product, this flakes up after washing and drying.</li>
            <li> I love this product! So great and the I got it soon after purchase...really fast! I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> This is exactly as shown. 2 bottles. 1 shampoo, 1 conditioner. Not sure what some of this other posts were about. I recently bought some redken extreme too but its not as good as all soft. This is by far the best redken shampoo/conditioner I have ever used. Once that extreme runs out I will be back to this. All soft is so thick, smells great and leaves your hair smelling great. You won&#x27;t regret buying this.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day. Love how it doesnt dry out my hair, but adds moisture. I could tell the difference after just one use. But, it gets better after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other pricey shampoos, this is the only one I don&#x27;t regret buying.</li>
            <li> These products were exactly what I had expected, and they arrived in the estimated time given by the supplier.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft, shiny, and helps with tangles!!!  It also helps keep the moisture balance in my hair, I don&#x27;t have to shampoo daily!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery</li>
            <li> Very high quality shampoo and conditioner at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love Redken all soft. For a softening shampoo it does not give you build up. The conditioner does make your hair incredibly soft. I have curly hair and live in Houston (read gross and humid) and this conditioner takes all the tangles out, relaxes my hair, and makes it insanely soft.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase! Received both items. As advertised and packaged. Love the smell and the size will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but I do love almost all Redken products. This shampoo/conditioner will give you a smooth, shine to your hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love these large bottles for my shower plus I don&#x27;t have to buy them so often.  Received the products very fast and they came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner, makes hair soft but not weighed Down, Redkin In by far the best</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time at my mothers house and wondered why I have never seen it in stored before. It made my hair so soft and silk and I have African American hair. And even when I was in need a perm it still made my hair soft and managable. I would buy this product no matter what the cost because my hair is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this for my hair - it&#x27;s been great!  I have fine/coarse wavy hair and live in an area with very hard water. This does a great job keeping my hair soft without making it limp. Also I have color treated hair - and this DOES NOT strip the color out  (as some other shampoos in general can do).  I do like the tube cream conditioner better than the bottled version / my hair responds better to it.</li>
            <li> This is better than your Pantenes and Garnier Fructis, but really isn&#x27;t for me. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip your hair (noticably anyways) however the conditioner isn&#x27;t outstanding. I find myself using gobs of conditioner to get the softness I want and its just not effective. I&#x27;m following this product up with leave-in conditioners because for me it doesn&#x27;t cut it. As far as salon products go this one is really on the lowest tier in my book. Way better products out there for the money.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair. It tends to get frizzy and big. This shampoo and conditioner helps tame the Mane. I have tried other products but nothing ever works as well. I would like the design of the conditioner bottle to be different though. It gets all concaved and stuck. Impossible not to waste part of it.</li>
            <li> Great and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken All Soft Shampoo for many years.  When my order arrived (on time) I opened the product and realised it smells different than the one I am using (almost finish and therefore I ordered the Shampoo and Conditioner Duo).  I did not worry to much about it and thought it is my own imagination.  This is the first time I ordered from this supplier \\&quot;Beauty Choice New York\\&quot;.  I started using the conditioner about 3 weeks ago and it was clear the content of the product does not deliver the same results as the Redken All Soft I am used to.  Firstly it feels like the products does not rise out and secondly it does not moisture my hair, instead it just does not do anything apart from an intense perfume smell.  I wondered if the shampoo and conditioner is way past its expire date therefore I checked the barcode of the product on a website I have used before, [...] The website specify when the product was manufactured and when it expired.  Both the Shampoo and Conditioner were manufactured in January and February 2011.  Given that these products only have a 36 month shelf life these products were sent to me by the supplier \\&quot;Beauty Choice New York\\&quot; after it expired.  I have no doubt that REDKEN ALL SOFT is the best Shampoo and Conditioner however I wish all the suppliers were trustworthy and sell products that is still within their shelf life.</li>
            <li> Great value, thank you!</li>
            <li> received this product in a timely manner from distributor but the product was less than what I thought it would be. worked as good as the store brands for i have bought and they were alot less money out of my pocket.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report this stuff is  the real deal. I love the product and would purchse it again</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner as it makes my hair soft.  This is great price as you pay a lot more in the salon.</li>
            <li> Great product! Hair is all silky and no more tangles. Got it for my 8 year old, i love it!</li>
            <li> Product is awesome and so is the price!!&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser suggested this one. Works for me&lt;br /&gt;Use a little and get great results!!</li>
            <li> ThatÂ´s the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever tested since now.  I really recomend that.</li>
            <li> the shipping was super fast! i really like the product. it makes my hair smell great but i haven&#x27;t noticed too much of an improvement from my last shampoo/conditioner (i previously used Bed Head). overall, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I only use redkin. It&#x27;s a lighter product and did make my hair soft. It&#x27;s good if you have oily hair. I like it better than the heavier purple bottle</li>
            <li> Was on time and exactly as described</li>
            <li> Me and my son use this. We have thick curly hair and this keeps our hair nice and soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fine but conditioner not so good. Left my hair dry and tangled. Maybe just my hair but would not buy again</li>
            <li> Been using this for years! Every time I try something else, I always return to All Soft! I have really thick, coarse hair. All soft and a really good flat iron makes me the envy of every wimpy haired girl!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t get enough of any of the Redken conditioners (mostly) but All Soft and Extreme are my faves. Invest in good shampoo and conditioner, folks!</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo + conditioner! Definitely worth the purchase! My hair is so much more healthy and I noticed that after switching to this shampoo, my hair is growing super fast! And what&#x27;s nice and I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair as often. When I used regular shampoo like Pantene, my hair would get oily after 2 days. But with this shampoo, it keeps my hair nice and dry (in a good way). LOVEEE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I am a hair product snob. Very picky about what I use on my hair. I learned the hard way to never use store products. Salon products are superior. I have used several kinds and I must say All Soft is one of the best. I have thick, dry hair. I color and flat iron. You would never know it though since I have been using this. From the first use, I noticed an incredible difference. So soft, shiny, silky, and healthy. My stylist was so impressed with the condition of my hair. Try this, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have very course dry hair and from the first use I saw a change in the texture . This product really does make my hair soft. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for about a year now and am very satisfied but now I found them at an even better price. Quick delivery. I highly recommend these products for dry or dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after borrowing some from a friend on a trip for a week.  I loved the smell and the results.  What I received may have been in the correct bottles but was definitely not the same stuff I tried.  I will not be ordering this product from here again.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Shiny and soft hair</li>
            <li> This is the best deal out there for both 33.8 oz out there. I love the shampoo and conditioner and think that you need to get both to have the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase since it really helped my hair go from semi-processed and thick to a nice soft silky feel without losing a natural thickness you want to keep. I still think these are a bit expensive but every time I shower, it feels like I just sat in the shampoo chair at a nice salon SO it&#x27;s worth it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is such a great hair care product! It keeps my hair soft, smooth and tangle free! Worth the $!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner combo for about 7 months. I bought it after several hairdressers suggested it to me, due to having some frustrating hair issues--oily roots and dry, thick hair, as though the natural oils don&#x27;t travel down the hair shaft properly. The shampoo works pretty well for me. It leaves my hair clean-feeling and a bit softer, and I have to use less than I have for other shampoos. The conditioner, however, doesn&#x27;t seem to make much a difference where softness is concerned, and I feel that I have to use a lot of it to get anywhere. It is very meek and runny, and I&#x27;d prefer a conditioner that is thick and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that because of the high cost, I expected a greater improvement in the way my hair feels, especially after giving these a few months to work. But I only experienced a slight improvement, and with just the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was actually the first time i&#x27;ve used redken (on myself) and i was pleasnently surprised. It really does waht it says it does, make your hair &amp;#34;all soft&amp;#34; that is. as for this buyer i&#x27;m pleased as well no conplaints here. :)</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly. It was packaged neatly. I am unsure the product is the real redken; it feels somewhat different in my hair which gives me some concern. I like the product, none the less and the service was great :)</li>
            <li> I have dry course hair that is long. Thank goodness this product came along. Helps keep my frizz under control and does wonders for me especially during brutal MN winters.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and continue to reorder over and over.  I love it on my naturally curly hair.  I read about it in a magazine and have used for several years.</li>
            <li> Redkin is one of my favorite shampoo/conditioner, leaves hair so silky soft. I would recommend to another for very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> All Soft by Redken keeps my hair so soft and fresh. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;BUT the packaging was a little faulty - when I received the package, the cap had broken off the conditioner bottle. I lost some product to the interior of the cardboard box. I keep a little foil on top of the bottle in the shower.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is phenomenal - the only reason I gave this a 4 star is that you can usually find it cheaper at the hair cuttery and other discount hair cut places</li>
            <li> I got this on recommendation of a friend of mine that has ridiculously long, shiny, soft beautiful hair.  She was so right!  It&#x27;s the best!  It&#x27;s thick and creamy.  It lathers well, rinses well, and leaves my hair soft and tangle-free enough to brush it wet right out of the shower.  The smell is very mild to me...almost like a vanilla cream or something, but not necessarily vanilla. I don&#x27;t find it perfumey at all.  As a product junkie, I have like 4 different types of shampoo/cond. in my shower right now, but I used each one once or twice and went back to my All-Soft.  I wait til I see liters on sale and buy them...and just got pumps for them too which makes it so easy to use, I highly recommend doing that!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so soft whether I blow dry it or not. It smells really good too.</li>
            <li> These producs are an excellent choice! I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to purchase them. I&#x27;ve  used them 3 times, and they made the texture pf y hair feel so soft, look vibrant and shiny! It looked as if I had a cellophane. I will definitely reorder this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy</li>
            <li> DID NOT MAKE MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINNY - IT WAS FRIZZY AND DRY LIKE A BAIL OF HAY!!</li>
            <li> I got this at a beauty store. Smells like Apricots. Great lather. I do not see any difference than fromany other shampoo other than hair seems smoother</li>
            <li> This is awesome shampoo and conditioner. My hair ahs thrived with it. So soft really does make your hair soft and healthy looking. i would reccomend this to anyone especially people with curly course hair. Works for me.</li>
            <li> This are a wonderful combination for my thick dry hair.  This is the best product I have found for my situation.  My hair dresser uses it too.</li>
            <li> Good for those aged above 50 with normal hair.  It keeps your hair sleek, less breakage and so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> Man do I love this product.  I have gone through so many shampoos and conditioners trying to find one that I really like.  I color my hair a lot, I have fine hair, I have long somewhat curly hair.  I got my hair done a couple weeks ago and this is what she used on my hair.  Afterwards I bought the bottles they sold in stores (tiny!) for $15-16 each.  Granted that&#x27;s not expensive but I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to last long and paying that much over and over again just wasn&#x27;t going to cut it.  So to amazon I went.  Arrived quickly and no mess. :]</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and smelling good. It does not do miracle as some of the reviews say, but it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> Great product. My wife loves it</li>
            <li> I keep a couple of small bottle to refill when I travel.  The products make myt hair easy to style when I get out of the shower.  Reduces tangles.</li>
            <li> This particular gift was requested and very well received.  It was a favorite item of a granddaughter who said she had trouble finding the product and really wanted it for Christmas.  I&#x27;m so happy that she was so pleased with her gift.</li>
            <li> I like to try lots of different brands of shampoo and conditioner, and this redken all soft set doesn&#x27;t stand out to me at all. It works.. my hair is somewhat soft despite being very damaged. It certainly doesn&#x27;t make my hair worse at least.  I don&#x27;t really notice any change compared to my other brands, don&#x27;t really love it or hate it. My only issue with these in particular is that I don&#x27;t like the smell.  It&#x27;s not a BAD smell..I&#x27;m probably the minority.. but it&#x27;s just not to my tastes. If i had to guess, I would say it smells kind of  like almond oil? I prefer fruity or perfumey smells, not natural oil types of scents.. (for lack of a better word, haha.)  For that reason I will not buy this again.  Not that I often buy the same thing twice anyway.</li>
            <li> Not the same all-soft product I expected. Contained different ingredients and was a different texture. Next time I will be more careful when I order.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo &amp; conditioner! With only the first wash I noticed a difference in my hair texture (curly course hair)!! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> My wife loves redken products, and we always look for it when in usa. To avoid waisting time, we bought it online. Great.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts forever, reduces friz.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner set is AWESOME! It leaves hair silky smooth, and smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and this set usually lasts me around three months!</li>
            <li> All soft is the only shampoo and conditioner that actually leaves my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;No others have left my hair healthy and eases my frizz considerably. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this when I went blonde. I had been using what I thought was the best (Biosilk silk therapy) but it doesn&#x27;t come close to this. The smell is heavenly, if I had to guess it would be a vanilla infused light floral, it&#x27;s an exotic, warm smell. I have tried so many kinds of shampoos ranging in price. I really thought for awhile shampoo brands don&#x27;t matter too much and it was all hype. But TRUST ME, they are different. As soon as I washed my hair with the Allsoft I could tell a difference, even when it was wet. If you&#x27;ve ever bleached your hair many shades  lighter you will know what I&#x27;m talking about. When your bleached hair is wet, it feels damaged. Allsoft didn&#x27;t totally erase this feeling of course, nothing can. But it did greatly improve the feel of my hair. Since using it my hair looks and feels so much healthier. My hairdresser has been using it since high school and her mom recommended it to her (she was a hairdresser too.) very wonderful product here, I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch.</li>
            <li> Great deal on great product.</li>
            <li> My hair is super dry and damaged and everytime I use this, my hair changes 180 degrees. An amazing shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
