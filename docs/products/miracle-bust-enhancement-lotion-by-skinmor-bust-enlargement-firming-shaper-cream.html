            <li>Returning this one  this week for sure.</li>
            <li>This stuff came and i was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>just help with mothers natures way of being funny!  </li>
            <li>This is the first one that has done anything!</li>
            <li>The only thing positive I can say is that it smelled nice.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>If by some miracle this lotion starts working as advertised, I&#x27;ll update my review, but I have a feeling all the positive reviews on here were people who work for the company.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much for this , didn&#x27;t see or feel any differents after using this .</li>
            <li>thank you for the fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>As much as I&#x27;d have loved for this to increase the size of my bust, realistically, I was only really looking for it to firm up the girls.  </li>
            <li>this is the first product i tried really no noticable difference , 50 yrs old really would like some of these products to do as they say not asking to be huge</li>
            <li>After having lost 70lbs over the past few years, my breast had all but shriveled up, so I got this product because of the many good reviews it had, but the bottle is now nearly empty</li>
            <li>My boobs aren&#x27;t even really saggy to begin with, so even if this only would&#x27;ve worked a little bit, I would&#x27;ve been pleased.  </li>
            <li>First of all it comes out fast and hard for the skin to absorb.</li>
            <li>I only used this for 2 days so far</li>

            <li> waste of money ,no difference ,finished the whole bottel and used twice ady but no result ,don&#x60;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using it until the tube is empty, but I will not be buying again.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is almost empty and havent seen or felt a change at all.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the rest of the bottle, but this was not worth the $30 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I see absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> I started working out a few months ago and am losing weight, and I have a fear of getting pancake boobs.  </li>
            <li> But it only got worse, so I stopped taking these pills, and I was relieved of my chest pain.</li>
            <li> Other then that, they did work just not good for my health.</li>
            <li> I still have small, unshapely, sagging boobs.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do diddly squat.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just a chest cold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken another supplement, called &amp;#34;natural curves&amp;#34; that I didn&#x27;t have any bad experiences (chest pain) with and it lifted, rounded and increased my bust size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff really works! I was a 36 DDD before and now I&#x27;m a G. I hope they keep making this product. I just don&#x27;t know if you have to keep using it to maintain results.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would work and did not notice any change what so ever. The only thing positive I can say is that it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much for this , didn&#x27;t see or feel any differents after using this . I can&#x27;t recommend this . It may work for some but use your own judgment.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Went on smooth and smells nice but haven&#x27;t seen any improvement I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews and I think they are paying these girls to talk about it. I had bought two of them and started since April 19  and nothing at all. I will never buy again...</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo12FA2F3E8LU3F]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. After having lost 70lbs over the past few years, my breast had all but shriveled up, so I got this product because of the many good reviews it had, but the bottle is now nearly empty and I have seen no results whatsoever. I&#x27;ll use the rest of the bottle, but this was not worth the $30 I paid for it.</li>

My boobs aren&#x27;t even really saggy to begin with, so even if this only would&#x27;ve worked a little bit, I would&#x27;ve been pleased.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do diddly squat.  I use it twice a day.  I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I do like the scent.  I&#x27;ll continue using it until the tube is empty, but I will not be buying again.  If by some miracle this lotion starts working as advertised, I&#x27;ll update my review, but I have a feeling all the positive reviews on here were people who work for the company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 1 month but I don&#x27;t see any improvements. I just hope that may be in the second month of use smth. will change. I&#x27;ll defininitely write about it.</li>
            <li> this is the first product i tried really no noticable difference , 50 yrs old really would like some of these products to do as they say not asking to be huge just help with mothers natures way of being funny!  gonea keep tring only been since feb since i&#x27;v tried everything says 3 to 6 mths are longer so will keep you up dated</li>
            <li> im honestly in awe of this lotion....i saw results within 5 days and even my husband noticed lol he definately gives this lotion a huge thumbs up as i give it what it deserves which is 5 stars...thank you for the fast delivery too. Priscilla from Texas</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it religiously, twice a day for almost a month. I still have small, unshapely, sagging boobs. The lotion feels good to my skin though. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I only used this for 2 days so far and it is giving me great swelling already! I&#x27;m highly impressed! This is the first one that has done anything!</li>
            <li> Over time these pills caused me to have chest pains. I thought maybe it was just a chest cold and I&#x27;d get over it.  But it only got worse, so I stopped taking these pills, and I was relieved of my chest pain. Other then that, they did work just not good for my health. I&#x27;ve taken another supplement, called &amp;#34;natural curves&amp;#34; that I didn&#x27;t have any bad experiences (chest pain) with and it lifted, rounded and increased my bust size. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else experience this, but I will not be using these pills anymore, I&#x27;ve discarded them.</li>
            <li> I did not find any improvement after using this lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff came and i was excited to try it. First of all it comes out fast and hard for the skin to absorb. Did nothing to my breast. No firming,No size change nothing. I just had a baby and wanted to try something. i was not expecting a miracle just wanted to see a difference. So would not reccomend to nobody...The girl with the video probably works for them or gets paid to review their stuff because all her reviews is about skinmor. i watched it and got fooled</li>
            <li> I just started using this product last week &amp; I automatically saw results. This products works for me &amp; I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smells good not greasy , feel so good in the skin&lt;br /&gt;need more time to use and see if work , come on time</li>
            <li> The bottle is almost empty and havent seen or felt a change at all. Returning this one  this week for sure.</li>
