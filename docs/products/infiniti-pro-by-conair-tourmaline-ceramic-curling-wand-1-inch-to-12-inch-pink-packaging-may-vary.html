            <li>A really great value compared to the rest of the tools out there.</li>
            <li>This is a great curling iron.</li>
            <li>Great for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>but the glove doesn&#x27;t work great either</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievably amazing!</li>
            <li>This curler is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through so many sucky curling irons ,and this is the best!</li>

            <li>Heats up quickly and creates beautiful curls and also has automatic shut-off (great for someone like me who always forgets).  </li>
            <li>so I can be very creative with my hair.</li>
            <li>The Conair You Curl is a great and much more affordable alternative to the pricy t3 Singlepass Whirl.</li>
            <li>But again, curling iron was great. :)</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron!</li>

            <li>I am beyond pleased!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>this is my first curling wand and my hair was flawless.</li>
            <li>I love this wand!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>My daughter love it!  </li>
            <li>love this thing!</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand!  </li>
            <li>It is really amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of gal who was NOT blessed with amazing hair or the patience to deal with unruly curls, which is my curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gives you amazing curls.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, I have AMAZING curls now.</li>
            <li>It came fast and works great!</li>
            <li>This iron creates nice curls that stay.</li>
            <li>but this seems like a nice one.</li>
            <li>This is why I never fix my hair up nice.</li>
            <li>Also, if you forget to turn it off, it turns off on its own automatically, and it even comes with a feature that makes it prop up.</li>
            <li>I find I don&#x27;t use this at all and find it cumbersome, but I curl my hair at my own risk.</li>
            <li>and I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>it also comes with a glove (although i never use it) it is nice and helps prevent against burns</li>
            <li>This is a popular inexpensive one that does the job.  </li>
            <li>This handy device has transformed my hair appearance.</li>
            <li>I would love it if it would control more freeze but for the price this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think that&#x27;s why it works so well</li>
            <li>I had tried a friends and really liked it.</li>
            <li>My first time I didn&#x27;t do a very good job</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love it works amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best part about the wand is that it heats up super fast!</li>
            <li>This wand works great and heats fast!  </li>
            <li>; if I use a lower heat setting and tighter curls if I use a higher setting, so this is a great product</li>
            <li>Love it and so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Its easy to do your own hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Glove is very useful (as it does get very hot).&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to all you curl lovers out there; works great and brings you many hair compliments!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many comments.</li>
            <li>I love this wand.</li>
            <li>and i love the wand</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the size</li>
            <li>Many irons that I have tried have made my hair frizzy and my hair would uncurl within a couple hours.</li>
            <li>The xlarge also creates more of a beachy look.</li>
            <li>This wand is a magic wand.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you how much I love this curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One reviewer says the wand produces a “spiral effect” which gives “more of a lift at the scalp” which I agree with 100 %.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Shipping was awesome, I ordered it the 2nd of February and received it the 6th</li>
            <li>Way more affordable.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more $12 more than Amazon.</li>
            <li>They both love them.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this</li>
            <li>Had better results with curlers at a fraction of the time and effort.</li>
            <li>It surely curls my hair.</li>
            <li>This curling iron was perfect for giving me instant curls!</li>
            <li>However many curls you see on those heads</li>
            <li>is however many times you have to repeat the process to achieve the look.  </li>
            <li>Toss it before it becomes one more piece of junk in your bathroom drawers.</li>
            <li>I love to curl my hair have both of the conair you curl wands.</li>
            <li>The curling wand creates the perfect curls and they last all day.</li>
            <li>However, I recommend that everyone else uses the glove just to be safe.</li>
            <li>That’s probably why I had so many problems with curling wands before.</li>
            <li>and I was just about to throw in the towel on ever having wavy/curly hair that I was satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part is that these waves give my hair lots of volume that doesn&#x27;t look too over the top.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this wand.</li>
            <li>THIS IS LOVE</li>
            <li>They both love them.</li>
            <li>The amputee glove needs to be shelved and some more thought put into how to hold the tip of iron without burning or getting close to burning skin.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the light would change color letting me know when it&#x27;s heated up all the way.  </li>
            <li>My curls look perfect and LAST DAYS!</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>I also love that they are the perfect wavy curls, not ringlets or tiny kinky curls.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since using this.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how easy it was to learn curling with the wand, especially since I have never curled my hair before!</li>
            <li>After watching many toturials for this on youtube I pretty much got the perfect style down, and the perfect product mixture :)</li>
            <li>It did heat up quickly which is nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this more than anything because of how easy it is to use and the look it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>Gave me beautiful, shiny... just gorgeous curls, not too big or too small... just perfect.</li>
            <li>good price fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li>I got the product on time, great quality and its super fast to curl my hair now.</li>
            <li>Love this i use it whenever i curl my hair and am never disappointed with the turn out.</li>
            <li>It does take some practice if you&#x27;re not used to these type of curling instruments, but other than that, curls come out great!</li>
            <li>I also take issue with the placement of the on/off button: It&#x27;s too easy to press it inadvertently when using the wand.</li>
            <li>Not as easy as it seems.  </li>
            <li>I have had this happen to me a couple of times, but since the wand heats up in thirty seconds, it’s an easy fix.</li>
            <li>Curls well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use on any type of hair.</li>
            <li>but I found it EXTREMELY easy to use.</li>
            <li>but my second time turned out beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I find that the best way to use it is to grab the curling wand and hold it sideways while i wrap my hair, then hold it upside down (if that makes any sense to anyone).</li>
            <li>I had big, beautiful curls the very first time I tried it!  </li>
            <li>hair is really fine</li>
            <li>but for my fine hair, it&#x27;s a disaster.</li>
            <li>but she did fine.</li>
            <li>it is easy and fast and the heat levels are amazing.</li>
            <li>I already owned the smaller version of this curling iron before purchasing this one, and the quality of both are great.</li>
            <li>In addition to this, the wand is also made up of tourmaline ceramic creates smooth and shiny curls.</li>
            <li>The advanced technology reduces damage and frizz.</li>
            <li>My daughter is finally into doing her hair and she loves this wand and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great quality, especially for the price point.</li>
            <li>I just wear regular driving gloves when styling my hair, which work great and save me time, as I don&#x27;t have to switch the glove from hand to hand depending on which side of my hair</li>
            <li>It has a tempeture setting and is cheap and work well  </li>
            <li>so i rarely use it as to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>definitely don&#x27;t get the great curls that it shows.</li>
            <li>I liked the curling iron very much; heated quickly, variety of settings.</li>
            <li>It gets hot very quickly, just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>i bought the original size one which i also loved but who doesn&#x27;t want bigger curls. : )</li>
            <li>I do think the t3 is better in terms of heat-up time and overall temperature consistency, but the You Curl is pretty great as well.</li>
            <li>Curls come out beautiful and you really have more flexibility on the desired outcome than with a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love the large waves!</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it very much, easy to use, simple instructions and good design.</li>
            <li>so it can be time consuming because you get the best results by curling small pieces of hair at  time but its worth it!</li>
            <li>I use the lower heats for more wavy looking hair and the higher heats for tighter curls.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every cent!</li>
            <li>Love this so much!</li>
            <li>and I love that you can set how hot you want it to be.</li>
            <li>It gives me perfect waves, is easy to use, gets hot super fast, and my curls last all day.</li>
            <li>Make great curls and stays long!</li>
            <li>If you know how to use it, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and makes beautiful curls, it also has a decent sized cord and it&#x27;s swivel which makes everything so much easier.</li>
            <li>I love this wand, makes amazing curls that last for days!</li>
            <li>It is super easy, fast, and makes my extra straight hair stay perfectly curled all day.</li>
            <li>It’s also very suitable for everyone because it has four different heat settings for every hair type.</li>
            <li>if you have time n lots of practice this is ok and gives wavy curls which i like large curls</li>
            <li>I swiped the exposed part of my hand a couple of times and switched to my full hand glove after that.</li>
            <li>If you look at the pictures or web videos, you&#x27;ll see heads full of curls.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about the curling wand.</li>
            <li>I do wish they gave a full glove protector instead of the 3 finger.</li>
            <li>I frequently joke that I am missing the girly factor or gene that most girls are born with that allows them to do their hair and make up flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>also i don&#x27;t use the glove, just make sure to hold the very tip of the barrel to keep from burning.</li>
            <li>I even slept in my curls and they still look good the next day!</li>
            <li>the glove that comes with it is akward, should be full size glove.</li>
            <li>I have very straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that thisproduct is great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and is perfect for long hair to create full natural waves!</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best curling wond!!</li>
            <li>I love the larger size so much more.</li>
            <li>it cam quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SUPER EASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It does get very hot</li>
            <li>I also have to do what I call a bum straight to my hair before doing really curling it for a nicer finish, a bum straighten is just run it threw 2 times per strand, and get it smooth :)</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast even in five minutes it is almost fully heated!</li>
            <li>, still gets very hot to touch.</li>
            <li>And since I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on one at first.</li>
            <li>So not sure if there is another curling iron as good but for better price including the glove, so you don&#x27;t have to make the purchase separate.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s so hot!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone, but especially someone who thought they&#x27;d never be able to curl their hair like every one else!</li>
            <li>I reallyyy enjoyed this product, fun if you like messing with your hair and creating new do&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use any product in my hair and now I have gorgeous, loose curls.</li>
            <li>This curling wand is a lot better than some of the previous ones I&#x27;ve had and it makes my hair look amazing.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time I get pretty curls easily.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but got to be careful when handling as it will 1 in 5 times burn you.</li>
            <li>But overall it works nicely, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite hair appliance, by far.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a curling iron without the clamp to get more natural looking beach curls.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite curling tool.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The curls are also super bouncy and shiny and don&#x27;t leave my hair looking like it&#x27;s burnt to a crisp.  </li>
            <li>hair slides right off.</li>
            <li>The iron seems to have a nice consistent heat and heats up in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>easy to hold it, and the different setting are good for different types of hair.</li>
            <li>I prefer the xl over the smaller size because I can get beach waves very easy.</li>
            <li>I live in Australia, i had to buy and extension to make the plug fit</li>
            <li>As I pull the wand out of the curl, I clip it to my head to let it cool in place for awhile which gives the curl more staying power against the weight of long hair.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to any girl, especially if you have a hard time curling your hair because this wand will guarantee you long-lasting beautiful healthy curls.</li>
            <li>Still learning but like product very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, heats up quickly, and has multiple temperature settings to suit your hair type.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The curls loosen throughout the day, but they are still really pretty.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 6 months on an almost daily basis and love the results.</li>
            <li>However, within the last month I have noticed my hair on the top layer has started breaking off severly.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this iron!! :)</li>
            <li>I like this wand better than the smaller one.</li>
            <li>This is my first curling wand</li>
            <li>I love the different temperature settings as well!</li>
            <li>; - there are so many different techiniques for this tool.</li>
            <li>so you don’t have any damaging hot spots.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my hair look and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it describes.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried she wouldn&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
            <li>I am a first time buyer of a curling wand</li>
            <li>This tool definitely creates more of the Taylor-Swift-you-either-have-curly-hair-to-begin-with-or-you-spent-tons-of-time-to-create-type curls.  </li>
            <li>I believe a person is more likely to burn themselves using it than without.</li>
            <li>I fell in love instantly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a three-finger protector which actually gets in the way for me, so I end up not using it.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to achieve the same look with more traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of helpful videos on YouTube if you find yourself challenged on the first use.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift, but it was exactly the size she was looking for</li>
            <li>it does exactly hat the discription says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used curling irons before and this is my first curling wand.  </li>
            <li>so I guess I don&#x27;t have first hand experience with it.</li>
            <li>So be aware of it when you make your decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the curling iron itself, it works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>First of all, let me tell you about my expertise with hair tools; it&#x27;s practically zero.</li>
            <li>I am EXTREMELY satisfied with this wand and will be ordering different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands, but I like this one better!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of curling irons and even straighteners to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>some people have burned their hair right off using too much heat.</li>
            <li>I do use it on it&#x27;s highest heat setting and use it in tandem with my GHD flat iron for smoothness but always make sure to use my heat protectant serum.</li>
            <li>never had done curls so nice with any other curling iron.</li>
            <li>beachy waves, a whole-head of spiral waves, or any other kind</li>
            <li>Today was the first day I used it, and it will definitely take a little more practice, but I still liked the result.  </li>
            <li>My hair takes curls pretty easily, so I got the XL instead of the smaller size.</li>
            <li>So far I am pretty sure it only works on your right hand...</li>
            <li>They tell that after many many tries and countless youtube videos they still can&#x27;t get the hang of using this curling iron with the gloves.</li>
            <li>It really delivers exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of holding the wand with one hand and wrapping with the other, it&#x27;s super easy and fast!</li>
            <li>Most of the curls fell out, and when it said XL, I didn&#x27;t even think to check out how long this really was.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, curly hair and it holds perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have thick long hair and this works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work with my super soft and straight hair.</li>
            <li>I received this product in the mail within just a few days, and I really enjoy how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>Hair looks very shiny, like other costumers have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty happy with my purchase so far, although I bought it only two days ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and comfortable and incredibly light weight so it won&#x27;t weigh you down when you&#x27;re in a rush!</li>
            <li>But This made my curls stayed for the whole</li>
            <li>fast</li>
            <li>Very beachy.</li>
            <li>The delivery time was satisfyingly fast.</li>
            <li>Works well with my extremely straight hair.</li>
            <li>but it works really well.</li>
            <li>Using a light application of mousse before curling, I still have some curl 4 days later.</li>
            <li>My hair is very naturally straight</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like purchasing from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Creates fantastic curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, no issues.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>the curls come out smooth and shiny and they last without Hair spray!</li>
            <li>The wand itself works very well, however, and I would have given 5 stars</li>
            <li>You need to put it behind your head (as most videos show) and do the opposite side for good results.</li>
            <li>satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Heats very quickly and to a high enough temperature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, stick-straight, medium-length hair, and this curler gives me great beachy waves that last all day long and look fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is just as good, if not better than the T3!  </li>
            <li>Seriously gives you a great natural wave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bummed because I already have a wand about the same size as the original</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the other style curling iron, with the clamp.  </li>
            <li>My flat iron was almost $100 and the results are not as smooth as this curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put my long hair in a pony tail and just curl this part to give my hair more body and soft curl in or out of the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and have spent years trying to find a way to curl my hair that won&#x27;t leave it straight in an hour.</li>
            <li>I only have to set it to the 2nd temperature level to get good waves that will last a couple days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem with this particular want, but wands in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the curls last for days!</li>
            <li>It’s really quick and simple to use.</li>
            <li>I would definitely use this with heat protector as it gets pretty hot and can damage your hair.</li>
            <li>Can create very natural looking curls!</li>
            <li>Whenever the curls did start to fall, it left a wavy look which looked very pretty as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m a mom, I rarely have the luxury of curling my hair b/c I would have to DRY it first before I curl.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to miss strands here and there, and it&#x27;s super obvious when you miss because the other strands are so curly.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair -fine, not straight but irregular</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of times to get used to holding your hair on it, but it&#x27;s easy to do (I find it easier to do without the included glove) and doesn&#x27;t leave the kink in my hair that I used to get from other curling</li>
            <li>Even though it took me forever to do my hair the first time, approximately an hour, the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a fun, wavy style I would definitely suggest looking into this curling wand.  </li>
            <li>After 4 curling irons that promised to get hot enough to curl my nieces straight hair, this one did it.</li>
            <li>which is only helpful for well.. not burning your right hand</li>
            <li>Use your left hand to hold the iron as you do the right side of your head and use the right hand to do the left.</li>
            <li>(I live in California).</li>
            <li>It would be fine if it had a traditional cllip to start and keep hair in place because it definitely gets hot enough</li>
            <li>Adjusting the direction of the cone-like shaped barrel also makes the waves look a little more natural rather than all being the exact same sized ringlets.  </li>
            <li>excited because i have the smaller version, but my hair is much too long , so i got this one.</li>
            <li>I have used larger barrel curling irons that only put a flip in my hair, and this one doesn&#x27;t do that; it gives nice loose waves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Heats up quick and gets very hot, I typically turn mine down a bit since I have such fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I did start off with the smaller barrel and decided to try the bigger barrel for larger and more relaxed curls.</li>
            <li>Warning, it is extremely hot and I accidentally burnt my forehead my first attempt, but now that I&#x27;ve used it a few times, i can go from straight to wavy hair in under 10 mins.  </li>
            <li>: take a section of your dry hair (mine is usually freshly washed, but not always), and spray it with hairspray.</li>
            <li>In the picture I placed my phone in there just in case anyone wants size comparison (nexus 5, roughly 5 1/2&amp;#34; by 2 1/2&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>Most days, I&#x27;m lucky to get time to blow dry with a big round brush.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t long that this became my favorite hairstyling tool because it works with casual looks and elegant looks.</li>
            <li>I got the XL and they still come out a little tight so if you want loose curls the XL is your best bet just grab bigger chunks of hair and start curling the lower part.</li>
            <li>I was unsure of buying this one compared to the smaller one but its just as easy to use the larger end as it is the smaller.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, has multiple heat settings for various types of hair, and the ceramic barrel leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>If you want bigger, relaxed curls, buy the x large size.</li>
            <li>The glove provided gets the job done but can also get hot if used too long on the barrel.</li>
            <li>The wand comes with a half-glove to protect your thumb, forefinger and middle finger, but it takes a bit getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After curling each section, gently dust the curl with hair spray, from the bottom to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer, big, round, bouncy curls that look more natural.  </li>
            <li>I always wanted naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and the curls last.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this curling wand that wants that flowing, spiral curl look.</li>
            <li>and my hair has been turning gray since I was 9 years old.</li>
            <li>And it only fits left hand, need to protect my right too when I switch sides.</li>
            <li>au naturel is not bad, but with this wand, I can now have larger, frizz-free, shiny loose curls.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that if you order the &amp;#34;XL&amp;#34; you may not actually receive the larger wand.</li>
            <li>Curls come out as indicated, bouncy and larger than normal.</li>
            <li>Curls last longer than with normal curling irons.</li>
            <li>Had to watch videos on how to use it since it&#x27;s very different from a normal curling iron</li>
            <li>The stick is made of very bad material hair slips off the wand and someone needs to keep hair on the wand at great difficulty because the 3 finger glove gets very hot after about 2-3 seconds.</li>
            <li>, it gets very hot and didn&#x27;t have the little bonus finger glove it said if came with</li>
            <li>loose waves, a look that could easily be dressed up or down.  </li>
            <li>Now I know to keep an eye on the buttons, but it is a major nuisance</li>
            <li>It heats up and cools down quickly and has various heat settings.</li>
            <li>small one gives me tight shirley temple curls, but after doing a small finger threw and applying dry shampoo they loosen to really nice waves :) With my hair I have to have it on the highest heat setting</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had long hair past my shoulders in 15 or more years, and got this curling wand to get the new loose curl look.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re careful you don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>But really, if you&#x27;re careful, you won&#x27;t even need a glove when you use a wand.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need the glove if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li>Since my daughter has pretty thick hair I decided to go with the XL curling wand and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>but since it heats up so quickly i just turn it back on and have to wait a few seconds to use it again.</li>
            <li>It took a few sessions to learn how to use it right</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and usually have trouble getting that soft beach wave look with a traditional curling iron, let alone having it stay that way throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend, especially for medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>Although it was a little difficult to get used to positioning the curling wand at first, by the second use, I was totally comfortable with the tool and getting the exact look</li>
            <li>The only downside to this product is that it is a little tricky to use at first.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, just be careful of the heat!</li>
            <li>Even if I flat iron first and then use this, it seems to look too tight and makes my hair frizzy because when you wrap it around the barrel, you&#x27;re leaving a portion of your hair unironed.</li>
            <li>It works very well for longer hair because the curls aren&#x27;t too tight.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the cold spots or uneven heating.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m the type of gal who was NOT blessed with amazing hair or the patience to deal with unruly curls, which is my curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gives you amazing curls.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I have AMAZING curls now.</li>
            <li> It came fast and works great!</li>
            <li> This iron creates nice curls that stay.</li>
            <li> but this seems like a nice one.</li>
            <li> This is why I never fix my hair up nice.</li>
            <li> Also, if you forget to turn it off, it turns off on its own automatically, and it even comes with a feature that makes it prop up.</li>
            <li> I find I don&#x27;t use this at all and find it cumbersome, but I curl my hair at my own risk.</li>
            <li> and I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> it also comes with a glove (although i never use it) it is nice and helps prevent against burns</li>
            <li> This is a popular inexpensive one that does the job.  </li>
            <li> This handy device has transformed my hair appearance.</li>
            <li> I would love it if it would control more freeze but for the price this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think that&#x27;s why it works so well</li>
            <li> I had tried a friends and really liked it.</li>
            <li> My first time I didn&#x27;t do a very good job</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it works amazing</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best part about the wand is that it heats up super fast!</li>
            <li> This wand works great and heats fast!  </li>
            <li> ; if I use a lower heat setting and tighter curls if I use a higher setting, so this is a great product</li>
            <li> Love it and so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Its easy to do your own hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glove is very useful (as it does get very hot).&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to all you curl lovers out there; works great and brings you many hair compliments!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many comments.</li>
            <li> I love this wand.</li>
            <li> and i love the wand</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the size</li>
            <li> Many irons that I have tried have made my hair frizzy and my hair would uncurl within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> The xlarge also creates more of a beachy look.</li>
            <li> This wand is a magic wand.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you how much I love this curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One reviewer says the wand produces a “spiral effect” which gives “more of a lift at the scalp” which I agree with 100 %.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Shipping was awesome, I ordered it the 2nd of February and received it the 6th</li>
            <li> Way more affordable.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more $12 more than Amazon.</li>
            <li> They both love them.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this</li>
            <li> Had better results with curlers at a fraction of the time and effort.</li>
            <li> It surely curls my hair.</li>
            <li> This curling iron was perfect for giving me instant curls!</li>
            <li> However many curls you see on those heads</li>
            <li> is however many times you have to repeat the process to achieve the look.  </li>
            <li> Toss it before it becomes one more piece of junk in your bathroom drawers.</li>
            <li> I love to curl my hair have both of the conair you curl wands.</li>
            <li> The curling wand creates the perfect curls and they last all day.</li>
            <li> However, I recommend that everyone else uses the glove just to be safe.</li>
            <li> That’s probably why I had so many problems with curling wands before.</li>
            <li> and I was just about to throw in the towel on ever having wavy/curly hair that I was satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part is that these waves give my hair lots of volume that doesn&#x27;t look too over the top.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this wand.</li>
            <li> THIS IS LOVE</li>
            <li> They both love them.</li>
            <li> The amputee glove needs to be shelved and some more thought put into how to hold the tip of iron without burning or getting close to burning skin.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the light would change color letting me know when it&#x27;s heated up all the way.  </li>
            <li> My curls look perfect and LAST DAYS!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> I also love that they are the perfect wavy curls, not ringlets or tiny kinky curls.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since using this.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how easy it was to learn curling with the wand, especially since I have never curled my hair before!</li>
            <li> After watching many toturials for this on youtube I pretty much got the perfect style down, and the perfect product mixture :)</li>
            <li> It did heat up quickly which is nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this more than anything because of how easy it is to use and the look it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> Gave me beautiful, shiny... just gorgeous curls, not too big or too small... just perfect.</li>
            <li> good price fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> I got the product on time, great quality and its super fast to curl my hair now.</li>
            <li> Love this i use it whenever i curl my hair and am never disappointed with the turn out.</li>
            <li> It does take some practice if you&#x27;re not used to these type of curling instruments, but other than that, curls come out great!</li>
            <li> I also take issue with the placement of the on/off button: It&#x27;s too easy to press it inadvertently when using the wand.</li>
            <li> Not as easy as it seems.  </li>
            <li> I have had this happen to me a couple of times, but since the wand heats up in thirty seconds, it’s an easy fix.</li>
            <li> Curls well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use on any type of hair.</li>
            <li> but I found it EXTREMELY easy to use.</li>
            <li> but my second time turned out beautiful.</li>
            <li> and I find that the best way to use it is to grab the curling wand and hold it sideways while i wrap my hair, then hold it upside down (if that makes any sense to anyone).</li>
            <li> I had big, beautiful curls the very first time I tried it!  </li>
            <li> hair is really fine</li>
            <li> but for my fine hair, it&#x27;s a disaster.</li>
            <li> but she did fine.</li>
            <li> it is easy and fast and the heat levels are amazing.</li>
            <li> I already owned the smaller version of this curling iron before purchasing this one, and the quality of both are great.</li>
            <li> In addition to this, the wand is also made up of tourmaline ceramic creates smooth and shiny curls.</li>
            <li> The advanced technology reduces damage and frizz.</li>
            <li> My daughter is finally into doing her hair and she loves this wand and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great quality, especially for the price point.</li>
            <li> I just wear regular driving gloves when styling my hair, which work great and save me time, as I don&#x27;t have to switch the glove from hand to hand depending on which side of my hair</li>
            <li> It has a tempeture setting and is cheap and work well  </li>
            <li> so i rarely use it as to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> definitely don&#x27;t get the great curls that it shows.</li>
            <li> I liked the curling iron very much; heated quickly, variety of settings.</li>
            <li> It gets hot very quickly, just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> i bought the original size one which i also loved but who doesn&#x27;t want bigger curls. : )</li>
            <li> I do think the t3 is better in terms of heat-up time and overall temperature consistency, but the You Curl is pretty great as well.</li>
            <li> Curls come out beautiful and you really have more flexibility on the desired outcome than with a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love the large waves!</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it very much, easy to use, simple instructions and good design.</li>
            <li> so it can be time consuming because you get the best results by curling small pieces of hair at  time but its worth it!</li>
            <li> I use the lower heats for more wavy looking hair and the higher heats for tighter curls.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every cent!</li>
            <li> Love this so much!</li>
            <li> and I love that you can set how hot you want it to be.</li>
            <li> It gives me perfect waves, is easy to use, gets hot super fast, and my curls last all day.</li>
            <li> Make great curls and stays long!</li>
            <li> If you know how to use it, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and makes beautiful curls, it also has a decent sized cord and it&#x27;s swivel which makes everything so much easier.</li>
            <li> I love this wand, makes amazing curls that last for days!</li>
            <li> It is super easy, fast, and makes my extra straight hair stay perfectly curled all day.</li>
            <li> It’s also very suitable for everyone because it has four different heat settings for every hair type.</li>
            <li> if you have time n lots of practice this is ok and gives wavy curls which i like large curls</li>
            <li> I swiped the exposed part of my hand a couple of times and switched to my full hand glove after that.</li>
            <li> If you look at the pictures or web videos, you&#x27;ll see heads full of curls.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about the curling wand.</li>
            <li> I do wish they gave a full glove protector instead of the 3 finger.</li>
            <li> I frequently joke that I am missing the girly factor or gene that most girls are born with that allows them to do their hair and make up flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> also i don&#x27;t use the glove, just make sure to hold the very tip of the barrel to keep from burning.</li>
            <li> I even slept in my curls and they still look good the next day!</li>
            <li> the glove that comes with it is akward, should be full size glove.</li>
            <li> I have very straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that thisproduct is great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and is perfect for long hair to create full natural waves!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best curling wond!!</li>
            <li> I love the larger size so much more.</li>
            <li> it cam quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SUPER EASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It does get very hot</li>
            <li> I also have to do what I call a bum straight to my hair before doing really curling it for a nicer finish, a bum straighten is just run it threw 2 times per strand, and get it smooth :)</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast even in five minutes it is almost fully heated!</li>
            <li> , still gets very hot to touch.</li>
            <li> And since I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on one at first.</li>
            <li> So not sure if there is another curling iron as good but for better price including the glove, so you don&#x27;t have to make the purchase separate.</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s so hot!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone, but especially someone who thought they&#x27;d never be able to curl their hair like every one else!</li>
            <li> I reallyyy enjoyed this product, fun if you like messing with your hair and creating new do&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use any product in my hair and now I have gorgeous, loose curls.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is a lot better than some of the previous ones I&#x27;ve had and it makes my hair look amazing.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time I get pretty curls easily.  </li>
            <li> Good product, but got to be careful when handling as it will 1 in 5 times burn you.</li>
            <li> But overall it works nicely, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my favorite hair appliance, by far.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a curling iron without the clamp to get more natural looking beach curls.  </li>
            <li> By far my favorite curling tool.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The curls are also super bouncy and shiny and don&#x27;t leave my hair looking like it&#x27;s burnt to a crisp.  </li>
            <li> hair slides right off.</li>
            <li> The iron seems to have a nice consistent heat and heats up in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> easy to hold it, and the different setting are good for different types of hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer the xl over the smaller size because I can get beach waves very easy.</li>
            <li> I live in Australia, i had to buy and extension to make the plug fit</li>
            <li> As I pull the wand out of the curl, I clip it to my head to let it cool in place for awhile which gives the curl more staying power against the weight of long hair.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to any girl, especially if you have a hard time curling your hair because this wand will guarantee you long-lasting beautiful healthy curls.</li>
            <li> Still learning but like product very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, heats up quickly, and has multiple temperature settings to suit your hair type.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls loosen throughout the day, but they are still really pretty.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 6 months on an almost daily basis and love the results.</li>
            <li> However, within the last month I have noticed my hair on the top layer has started breaking off severly.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this iron!! :)</li>
            <li> I like this wand better than the smaller one.</li>
            <li> This is my first curling wand</li>
            <li> I love the different temperature settings as well!</li>
            <li> ; - there are so many different techiniques for this tool.</li>
            <li> so you don’t have any damaging hot spots.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair look and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it describes.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried she wouldn&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
            <li> I am a first time buyer of a curling wand</li>
            <li> This tool definitely creates more of the Taylor-Swift-you-either-have-curly-hair-to-begin-with-or-you-spent-tons-of-time-to-create-type curls.  </li>
            <li> I believe a person is more likely to burn themselves using it than without.</li>
            <li> I fell in love instantly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a three-finger protector which actually gets in the way for me, so I end up not using it.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to achieve the same look with more traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of helpful videos on YouTube if you find yourself challenged on the first use.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift, but it was exactly the size she was looking for</li>
            <li> it does exactly hat the discription says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used curling irons before and this is my first curling wand.  </li>
            <li> so I guess I don&#x27;t have first hand experience with it.</li>
            <li> So be aware of it when you make your decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the curling iron itself, it works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you about my expertise with hair tools; it&#x27;s practically zero.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY satisfied with this wand and will be ordering different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but I like this one better!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of curling irons and even straighteners to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> some people have burned their hair right off using too much heat.</li>
            <li> I do use it on it&#x27;s highest heat setting and use it in tandem with my GHD flat iron for smoothness but always make sure to use my heat protectant serum.</li>
            <li> never had done curls so nice with any other curling iron.</li>
            <li> beachy waves, a whole-head of spiral waves, or any other kind</li>
            <li> Today was the first day I used it, and it will definitely take a little more practice, but I still liked the result.  </li>
            <li> My hair takes curls pretty easily, so I got the XL instead of the smaller size.</li>
            <li> So far I am pretty sure it only works on your right hand...</li>
            <li> They tell that after many many tries and countless youtube videos they still can&#x27;t get the hang of using this curling iron with the gloves.</li>
            <li> It really delivers exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of holding the wand with one hand and wrapping with the other, it&#x27;s super easy and fast!</li>
            <li> Most of the curls fell out, and when it said XL, I didn&#x27;t even think to check out how long this really was.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and it holds perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and this works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work with my super soft and straight hair.</li>
            <li> I received this product in the mail within just a few days, and I really enjoy how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Hair looks very shiny, like other costumers have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty happy with my purchase so far, although I bought it only two days ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and comfortable and incredibly light weight so it won&#x27;t weigh you down when you&#x27;re in a rush!</li>
            <li> But This made my curls stayed for the whole</li>
            <li> fast</li>
            <li> Very beachy.</li>
            <li> The delivery time was satisfyingly fast.</li>
            <li> Works well with my extremely straight hair.</li>
            <li> but it works really well.</li>
            <li> Using a light application of mousse before curling, I still have some curl 4 days later.</li>
            <li> My hair is very naturally straight</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like purchasing from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Creates fantastic curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, no issues.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> the curls come out smooth and shiny and they last without Hair spray!</li>
            <li> The wand itself works very well, however, and I would have given 5 stars</li>
            <li> You need to put it behind your head (as most videos show) and do the opposite side for good results.</li>
            <li> satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Heats very quickly and to a high enough temperature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, stick-straight, medium-length hair, and this curler gives me great beachy waves that last all day long and look fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is just as good, if not better than the T3!  </li>
            <li> Seriously gives you a great natural wave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed because I already have a wand about the same size as the original</li>
            <li> I like it much better than the other style curling iron, with the clamp.  </li>
            <li> My flat iron was almost $100 and the results are not as smooth as this curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put my long hair in a pony tail and just curl this part to give my hair more body and soft curl in or out of the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and have spent years trying to find a way to curl my hair that won&#x27;t leave it straight in an hour.</li>
            <li> I only have to set it to the 2nd temperature level to get good waves that will last a couple days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem with this particular want, but wands in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and the curls last for days!</li>
            <li> It’s really quick and simple to use.</li>
            <li> I would definitely use this with heat protector as it gets pretty hot and can damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Can create very natural looking curls!</li>
            <li> Whenever the curls did start to fall, it left a wavy look which looked very pretty as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m a mom, I rarely have the luxury of curling my hair b/c I would have to DRY it first before I curl.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to miss strands here and there, and it&#x27;s super obvious when you miss because the other strands are so curly.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair -fine, not straight but irregular</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of times to get used to holding your hair on it, but it&#x27;s easy to do (I find it easier to do without the included glove) and doesn&#x27;t leave the kink in my hair that I used to get from other curling</li>
            <li> Even though it took me forever to do my hair the first time, approximately an hour, the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a fun, wavy style I would definitely suggest looking into this curling wand.  </li>
            <li> After 4 curling irons that promised to get hot enough to curl my nieces straight hair, this one did it.</li>
            <li> which is only helpful for well.. not burning your right hand</li>
            <li> Use your left hand to hold the iron as you do the right side of your head and use the right hand to do the left.</li>
            <li> (I live in California).</li>
            <li> It would be fine if it had a traditional cllip to start and keep hair in place because it definitely gets hot enough</li>
            <li> Adjusting the direction of the cone-like shaped barrel also makes the waves look a little more natural rather than all being the exact same sized ringlets.  </li>
            <li> excited because i have the smaller version, but my hair is much too long , so i got this one.</li>
            <li> I have used larger barrel curling irons that only put a flip in my hair, and this one doesn&#x27;t do that; it gives nice loose waves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Heats up quick and gets very hot, I typically turn mine down a bit since I have such fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I did start off with the smaller barrel and decided to try the bigger barrel for larger and more relaxed curls.</li>
            <li> Warning, it is extremely hot and I accidentally burnt my forehead my first attempt, but now that I&#x27;ve used it a few times, i can go from straight to wavy hair in under 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> : take a section of your dry hair (mine is usually freshly washed, but not always), and spray it with hairspray.</li>
            <li> In the picture I placed my phone in there just in case anyone wants size comparison (nexus 5, roughly 5 1/2&amp;#34; by 2 1/2&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Most days, I&#x27;m lucky to get time to blow dry with a big round brush.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t long that this became my favorite hairstyling tool because it works with casual looks and elegant looks.</li>
            <li> I got the XL and they still come out a little tight so if you want loose curls the XL is your best bet just grab bigger chunks of hair and start curling the lower part.</li>
            <li> I was unsure of buying this one compared to the smaller one but its just as easy to use the larger end as it is the smaller.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, has multiple heat settings for various types of hair, and the ceramic barrel leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> If you want bigger, relaxed curls, buy the x large size.</li>
            <li> The glove provided gets the job done but can also get hot if used too long on the barrel.</li>
            <li> The wand comes with a half-glove to protect your thumb, forefinger and middle finger, but it takes a bit getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After curling each section, gently dust the curl with hair spray, from the bottom to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer, big, round, bouncy curls that look more natural.  </li>
            <li> I always wanted naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and the curls last.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this curling wand that wants that flowing, spiral curl look.</li>
            <li> and my hair has been turning gray since I was 9 years old.</li>
            <li> And it only fits left hand, need to protect my right too when I switch sides.</li>
            <li> au naturel is not bad, but with this wand, I can now have larger, frizz-free, shiny loose curls.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that if you order the &amp;#34;XL&amp;#34; you may not actually receive the larger wand.</li>
            <li> Curls come out as indicated, bouncy and larger than normal.</li>
            <li> Curls last longer than with normal curling irons.</li>
            <li> Had to watch videos on how to use it since it&#x27;s very different from a normal curling iron</li>
            <li> The stick is made of very bad material hair slips off the wand and someone needs to keep hair on the wand at great difficulty because the 3 finger glove gets very hot after about 2-3 seconds.</li>
            <li> , it gets very hot and didn&#x27;t have the little bonus finger glove it said if came with</li>
            <li> loose waves, a look that could easily be dressed up or down.  </li>
            <li> Now I know to keep an eye on the buttons, but it is a major nuisance</li>
            <li> It heats up and cools down quickly and has various heat settings.</li>
            <li> small one gives me tight shirley temple curls, but after doing a small finger threw and applying dry shampoo they loosen to really nice waves :) With my hair I have to have it on the highest heat setting</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had long hair past my shoulders in 15 or more years, and got this curling wand to get the new loose curl look.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re careful you don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> But really, if you&#x27;re careful, you won&#x27;t even need a glove when you use a wand.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need the glove if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li> Since my daughter has pretty thick hair I decided to go with the XL curling wand and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> but since it heats up so quickly i just turn it back on and have to wait a few seconds to use it again.</li>
            <li> It took a few sessions to learn how to use it right</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and usually have trouble getting that soft beach wave look with a traditional curling iron, let alone having it stay that way throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend, especially for medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> Although it was a little difficult to get used to positioning the curling wand at first, by the second use, I was totally comfortable with the tool and getting the exact look</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that it is a little tricky to use at first.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, just be careful of the heat!</li>
            <li> Even if I flat iron first and then use this, it seems to look too tight and makes my hair frizzy because when you wrap it around the barrel, you&#x27;re leaving a portion of your hair unironed.</li>
            <li> It works very well for longer hair because the curls aren&#x27;t too tight.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the cold spots or uneven heating.</li>
            <li> I have pin straight hair and have used a regular curling iron to try and make spiral curls, only to have the curls fall flat within a few hours.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot and creates a very nice natural looking and soft curl but go ahead and throw away the strange three finger fake leather glove they give you, it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> I actually have slightly wavy hair to begin with, hair that holds curls well, so I&#x27;m not hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I think it&#x27;s still too tight of a curl for my long thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> The curling irons only helped tear the hair out of my head &amp; the flat iron was the only thing that worked for me...</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that the heat protection &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34; is pretty much useless and it is very easy to burn yourself with the first few uses before you get used to holding the wand and positioning your hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes fast curls and long lasting and it&#x27;s not to heavy</li>
            <li> It heats it hot enough to curl my thick hair and the curls last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Take it from me, I only use a flat iron because that&#x27;s all I could do before this beauty!</li>
            <li> I began to research and saw that there was a small and a large curling wand.  </li>
            <li> , my hair is long and it only takes me 12 minutes to curl it all.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t damage my long hair with the extra time it takes to wind it, and I haven&#x27;t burned myself yet (felt the heat though).  </li>
            <li> Personally, I found that my is way too long to try and wrap around the iron.</li>
            <li> either the barrel didn&#x27;t heat up evenly or something, but the curls came out very uneven (some parts curled, some parts straight).</li>
            <li> Hope they last this long throughout the day!</li>
            <li> and I mean hot.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it a few times..</li>
            <li> You should feel the heat radiating from the wand before you get close enough to actually be burnt, but I can imagine people being distracted when they’re busy with the repetitive motion of winding hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curls were always too tight to look natural and the ends of my hair would come out looking like straw.</li>
            <li> bought the small version at walmart, just a mere 6 days ago, and can&#x27;t stop curling my hair with this amazing beauty tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, very disappointed, as I am a huge fan of the original You Curl by Conair.</li>
            <li> if your careful the glove isn&#x27;t really necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to this curler, but it is working well for my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just extra careful and don&#x27;t use a glove (for now, still no burn yet)</li>
            <li> I stopped using this after a few times and went back to wrapping  my hair the same way around a basic $10 curling iron (just not using the clip).  </li>
            <li> but I cannot use this iron with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have to use it on the highest setting, and although it is XL I have long hair and am still learning how not to run out of room on the barrel.</li>
            <li> For me I have very oily roots which just slick down on my head, but getting some extra volume in my roots makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> , I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase and look forward to using the wand frequently to create an everyday casual wavy look!</li>
            <li> It ranges from 300 degrees for people with fine hair to 400 degrees for people who have thick and hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li> , it is hot (yo, duh!), but I use it on medium</li>
            <li> The 3-fingered glove works well on one hand, but I wish the heat barrier were on both sides of the fingers so that the glove could be switched between both hands to do my other side, or they offered a left handed glove too (this would also help lefties).</li>
            <li> so i dident have to wait very long at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my two different sizes of traditional round curling irons.</li>
            <li> My hair slips down the barrel so easily that it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to get a curl.</li>
            <li> and I get some fairly loose, &amp;#34;beach curls&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I found this same brand wand at Target and other stores... buy it here!  </li>
            <li> Then neatly wrap it around this curling iron, starting with the hair closest to the root at the big end and the tips of your hair at the small end.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t use the glove because besides being an odd glove I already know how to use these types of wands and I can manage without burning myself.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, very curly, and a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well for my long hair!</li>
            <li> The curling iron works great, but I hate the 3-fingered glove!</li>
            <li> only twenty five dollars, I have now had this product for four years and the only complaint I have about</li>
            <li> Just be careful</li>
            <li> I have another curler from a different brand and my curls are limp after 4 hours or so.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful that you don&#x27;t burn your fingers, but it includes a three finger glove for protection.</li>
            <li> The packaging was damage and was not what I expected...</li>
            <li> I like how this product has a few different temperature options.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a really good styling aid, even for those who are awful at styling their hair, like me!</li>
            <li> no volume type, curls would usually stays only for 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> have hard-to-curl hair that does not hold curls made with other processes, even with mousse, gel, hair spray, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A couple of things that could be improved: first of all, the three-fingered glove that comes with this styler is a joke: completely useless.</li>
            <li> ANY OTHER PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other ladies were doing</li>
            <li> and I kept betting burned even though, a partial glove is provided in the package for 3 fingers!  </li>
            <li> If you are VERY careful you WILL NOT burn yourself.</li>
            <li> no more odd crimps in the middle of curls, and</li>
            <li> I usually curl my hair using the other common hair curler and since my hair is extreme soft-</li>
            <li> It also only has the heat protection on one side, so you can&#x27;t switch hands with it, which made it hard to do one side of my hair.</li>
            <li> My big complaint is that I accidentally kept pushing the 2 buttons during use, either shutting the wand off or unintentionally changing the temperature.  </li>
            <li> For those who always worry if they turned it off or not, have no fear because the wand will automatically shut off in sixty minutes, so you don’t have to worry about coming to a burned down house.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to curl the back of my hair with this wand, and I sometimes have to use a clamp curling iron for that, but I have the same issue with the t3.</li>
            <li> They were never strong enough to handle thick hair.</li>
            <li> tight curls keep the hair on the wand longer and for waves keep it on the wand for less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair and thick no curling iron ever works for me</li>
            <li> Its a little tricky to keep my hair on the wand.</li>
            <li> I would like if the cord was a little longer though.</li>
            <li> It does come with a little 2 fingered glove to protect your fingers.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and tried it on some extensions I had at home to test it out, and the curls lasted for 3 days without going limp.</li>
            <li> The Conair you curl was at first very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> start with Tressemme Heat protector spray on dried hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a joke, at least for inexperienced hands like mine.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really dried out using it</li>
            <li> not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it keeps you from burning your fingers on the wand, but it is difficult to handle hair with the glove on and it tends to fall off since its not a full glove (only covers 3 fingers as shown in picture).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had luck holding curl in the past, but I can now.</li>
            <li> The curling surface is so slick that my hair won&#x27;t wrap around it.</li>
            <li> waste of money!</li>
            <li> It’s put in a weird spot which allows you to turn off the wand in mid curl.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was not blessed with such beauty.</li>
            <li> I had no luck with curling wands in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit past my shoulders</li>
            <li> no more burning you finger while attempting to hold it in place</li>
            <li> But my hair is so hard to tame with heat.</li>
            <li> The way the end is tapered causes my hair to slide down the barrel which is incredibly frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and while this does curl my hair, it is very frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li> So hard to use, there is no clamp.</li>
            <li> Because it heats up in 30 seconds, anyone who is running late can just turn it on and start on their hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big and ended up being too awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my daughter, she has poker strait thick hair.</li>
            <li> and then I slowly remove the iron.</li>
            <li> , I have thick curly course hair.</li>
            <li> think the 3 finger glove is sort of useless and hard to keep switching hands when you do the other side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad because I was really looking forward to using this curling iron, but now i&#x27;ve just got a useless thing..</li>
            <li> I then use a very small amount of alcohol-free mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say that grays are difficult to control, imagine my pain dealing with grays as a teen.</li>
            <li> I hold it there for at least 10 seconds and voila!</li>
            <li> I am also not happy that 3 days after ordering mine, the price dropped over $6.00.</li>
            <li> have thick hair, so I have to separate my hair into very thin strands.</li>
            <li> I usually have to end up washing my hair because its dirty, not because my curls have died.</li>
            <li> The glove is difficult to use because you can&#x27;t feel the hair through the glove.</li>
            <li> The glove thing is a bit weird though..</li>
            <li> The 3 finger glove is not helpful and difficult to hold on to hair.</li>
            <li> The 1/4 of the glove that is given to you, is useless.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34; is difficult to use though.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to worry about a clamp leaving weird kinks at the end or having that</li>
            <li> The glove was useless, but I find it easier working without it anyway.</li>
            <li> Plus the effort it takes to curl without trying to burn your fingers is not worth it with the crap curls you get as a result :[</li>
            <li> and I find it difficult to find a curling iron that holds my hair!</li>
            <li> This is impossible for me to use.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the curls tended to clump up together, but it didn’t look bad.</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> The glove is stupid</li>
            <li> This is so stupid because I do not have anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed of this product!</li>
            <li> I burned myself on the neck and got a nasty blister.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m awful at using it</li>
            <li> This item is awful.</li>
            <li> The curling wands with the clips were the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This wand is easy to use and gives awesome curls that lasts for days!! It heats up and cools down quickly and has various heat settings. It comes with a 3 finger glove to use to protect your hands from getting burned which I recommend using until you get the hang of it! I burned myself a couple times!  I have long thick hair so it can be time consuming because you get the best results by curling small pieces of hair at  time but its worth it! I&#x27;ve received many comments.</li>
            <li> Love it! I ordered this and tried it on some extensions I had at home to test it out, and the curls lasted for 3 days without going limp. I was amazed... Hope they last this long throughout the day!</li>
            <li> It works very well for longer hair because the curls aren&#x27;t too tight.  The glove is difficult to use because you can&#x27;t feel the hair through the glove.</li>
            <li> So I am not used to write reviews about products but I used ithis one twice and the third time it didn&#x27;t work at all! I&#x27;m so disappointed of this product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  The glove only has 3 fingers (well 2 fingers and a thumb) and I kept burning myself.  You need to hold the hair against the cylinder to get it to curl.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ll stick with my two different sizes of traditional round curling irons.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a gift for my sister. She has used it about 3 times already. She tells me all the time she loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my daughter, she has poker strait thick hair. She wanted some body and curly waves. This was perfect. Would recommend</li>
            <li> My hair slips down the barrel so easily that it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to get a curl. I also take issue with the placement of the on/off button: It&#x27;s too easy to press it inadvertently when using the wand. But when it works, it works.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now, and I&#x27;m used to the slipperiness of the barrel. It gives good waves. I still sometimes accidentally shut it off without meaning to.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron! I always get compliments on my hair when I use this. I love the large waves!</li>
            <li> I love this wand. It gives me perfect waves, is easy to use, gets hot super fast, and my curls last all day.</li>
            <li> Could not be happier with my wand!</li>
            <li> excited because i have the smaller version, but my hair is much too long , so i got this one. very good, and the plastic sparkles lol</li>
            <li> works great. i bought the original size one which i also loved but who doesn&#x27;t want bigger curls. : )</li>
            <li> This wand works great and heats fast!  The curls come out looking perfect!!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! It&#x27;s easy to use, heats up quickly, and has multiple temperature settings to suit your hair type. It takes a couple of times to get used to holding your hair on it, but it&#x27;s easy to do (I find it easier to do without the included glove) and doesn&#x27;t leave the kink in my hair that I used to get from other curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really fine and I&#x27;ve never had luck holding curl in the past, but I can now. Here is the trick that my hairdresser taught me: take a section of your dry hair (mine is usually freshly washed, but not always), and spray it with hairspray. Then neatly wrap it around this curling iron, starting with the hair closest to the root at the big end and the tips of your hair at the small end. I only have to leave it for 20 seconds and then I slowly remove the iron. Then, I spray it again and do another section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls loosen throughout the day, but they are still really pretty.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair curler I&#x27;ve ever bought!!! Heats up in no seconds, and creates awesome curls in literally 10-15 seconds. I usually curl my hair using the other common hair curler and since my hair is extreme soft- no volume type, curls would usually stays only for 1-2 hours. But This made my curls stayed for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievably amazing!</li>
            <li> It came fast and works great!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!  Can create very natural looking curls! Great price too!</li>
            <li> fast and i love the wand</li>
            <li> Very  nice  loving it</li>
            <li> I purchase for my granddaughter. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the size so I purchased 2 different sizes. She loves them both</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 6 months on an almost daily basis and love the results. I have long, thick, curly hair and it holds perfectly. However, within the last month I have noticed my hair on the top layer has started breaking off severly. Does anybody else have this problem? I do use it on it&#x27;s highest heat setting and use it in tandem with my GHD flat iron for smoothness but always make sure to use my heat protectant serum. I&#x27;m wondering if I should invest in a high-end curling wand that&#x27;s more expensive, or if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing causing it to break off. Anyone have any ideas?</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and this works wonderfully! I use the lower heats for more wavy looking hair and the higher heats for tighter curls. It does get very hot and I did burn myself once in the beginning learning how to use a wand.</li>
            <li> Very great iron. Many irons that I have tried have made my hair frizzy and my hair would uncurl within a couple hours. This iron creates nice curls that stay. I have both the medium size and the xlarge size. If you want tighter curls, then buy the medium size. If you want bigger, relaxed curls, buy the x large size. The xlarge also creates more of a beachy look. Both irons make your hair look great! I would definitely recommend this iron!! :)</li>
            <li> Good product, but got to be careful when handling as it will 1 in 5 times burn you. The glove provided gets the job done but can also get hot if used too long on the barrel. Curls come out as indicated, bouncy and larger than normal. I like this wand better than the smaller one.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and it has a great price! Just be careful I burned myself on the neck and got a nasty blister.</li>
            <li> This wand is a magic wand. it is easy and fast and the heat levels are amazing. The best curler I ever used. Its easy to do your own hair, my hair is long and it only takes me 12 minutes to curl it all.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and thick no curling iron ever works for me I bought this one and omg works miracles !!! I love it works amazing never had done curls so nice with any other curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is my first curling wand so I&#x27;m not a pro but this seems like a nice one. Its a little tricky to keep my hair on the wand. So personally i might consider a reversed one next time (wand gets bigger instead of smaller at the end). But overall it works nicely, gets the job done. The glove thing is a bit weird though.. So far I am pretty sure it only works on your right hand... which is only helpful for well.. not burning your right hand lol but with that being said I have yet to burn myself without a glove on so if your careful the glove isn&#x27;t really necessary.</li>
            <li> This is impossible for me to use. The curling surface is so slick that my hair won&#x27;t wrap around it. Even with the included glove, I burned my hand twice. Maybe it would work for someone with thicker, coarser hair... but for my fine hair, it&#x27;s a disaster.</li>
            <li> I had bought the regular size, but it didn&#x27;t work the way I was waiting for. But this one is just perfect! I recomend</li>
            <li> Let me tell you how much I love this curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the small version at walmart, just a mere 6 days ago, and can&#x27;t stop curling my hair with this amazing beauty tool.&lt;br /&gt;The small one gives me tight shirley temple curls, but after doing a small finger threw and applying dry shampoo they loosen to really nice waves :) With my hair I have to have it on the highest heat setting, I have thick curly course hair. I also have to do what I call a bum straight to my hair before doing really curling it for a nicer finish, a bum straighten is just run it threw 2 times per strand, and get it smooth :) After watching many toturials for this on youtube I pretty much got the perfect style down, and the perfect product mixture :)</li>
            <li> This wand is so easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> This iron worked perfectly. Gave me beautiful, shiny... just gorgeous curls, not too big or too small... just perfect. Definitely worth every cent!</li>
            <li> DONT BUY IF YOU DONT HAVE A US OUTLET. I live in Australia, i had to buy and extension to make the plug fit and after one use it blew up! waste of money!</li>
            <li> Curls my hair perfectly. Nothing else I&#x27;ve used has held my curls in place like this. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works extremely well for my long hair! Perfect curls! I love the different temperature settings as well! Definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I already owned the smaller version of this curling iron before purchasing this one, and the quality of both are great. It heats up in under 30 seconds and I mean hot. I have used larger barrel curling irons that only put a flip in my hair, and this one doesn&#x27;t do that; it gives nice loose waves. Very beachy. Would highly recommend, especially for medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> Not as easy as it seems.  Searched youtube for videos on &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; - there are so many different techiniques for this tool.</li>
            <li> The Conair you curl was at first very difficult to use. The packaging didn’t come with any instructions on how to wand your hair so I just had to do trial and error. Even though it took me forever to do my hair the first time, approximately an hour, the results were amazing. That day I had a family photoshoot outside and it was July. To my surprise the curls lasted through the heat and humidity. I did notice that the curls tended to clump up together, but it didn’t look bad. Whenever the curls did start to fall, it left a wavy look which looked very pretty as well.&lt;br /&gt;The wand is perfect for everyone! Because it heats up in 30 seconds, anyone who is running late can just turn it on and start on their hair. For those who always worry if they turned it off or not, have no fear because the wand will automatically shut off in sixty minutes, so you don’t have to worry about coming to a burned down house. It’s also very suitable for everyone because it has four different heat settings for every hair type. It ranges from 300 degrees for people with fine hair to 400 degrees for people who have thick and hard to curl hair. One reviewer says the wand produces a “spiral effect” which gives “more of a lift at the scalp” which I agree with 100 %. For me I have very oily roots which just slick down on my head, but getting some extra volume in my roots makes all the difference. In addition to this, the wand is also made up of tourmaline ceramic creates smooth and shiny curls. The advanced technology reduces damage and frizz. In addition to this the barrel maintains an even temperature during use so you don’t have any damaging hot spots.&lt;br /&gt;At only twenty five dollars, I have now had this product for four years and the only complaint I have about it is the on/off button. It’s put in a weird spot which allows you to turn off the wand in mid curl. I have had this happen to me a couple of times, but since the wand heats up in thirty seconds, it’s an easy fix. Other than that thisproduct is great and I would recommend it to any girl, especially if you have a hard time curling your hair because this wand will guarantee you long-lasting beautiful healthy curls.</li>
            <li> Love this so much! Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I am still mastering the skills that go into a perfect wand job, but the product is great!</li>
            <li> The delivery time was satisfyingly fast. The product hasn&#x27;t given me any issues of yet. I&#x27;m completely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good curling iron. Works well with my extremely straight hair. Curls last longer than with normal curling irons.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how easy it was to learn curling with the wand, especially since I have never curled my hair before! Highly recommend, just be careful of the heat! The 3 finger glove is not helpful and difficult to hold on to hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter is finally into doing her hair and she loves this wand and it works great. She is happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot and creates a very nice natural looking and soft curl but go ahead and throw away the strange three finger fake leather glove they give you, it&#x27;s worthless. You will need to buy a thermal glove yourself, so calculate that into the price when comparing products and making your decision.</li>
            <li> Throw away curling &amp;#34;irons&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;brushes&amp;#34;, rollers, rags, or whatever you use to make curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hard-to-curl hair that does not hold curls made with other processes, even with mousse, gel, hair spray, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start with Tressemme Heat protector spray on dried hair. I then use a very small amount of alcohol-free mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the style of curls I want, I use either a 1/2 inch or a 1 inch section of hair. I wrap it around the wand, hold it there for 10 seconds. BE CAREFUL!! There is no clamp, so you have to hold the edge of the hair close to the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: test this on an inconspicuous section in the very back - some people have burned their hair right off using too much heat. The wand comes with a half-glove to protect your thumb, forefinger and middle finger, but it takes a bit getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After curling each section, gently dust the curl with hair spray, from the bottom to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creates beachy waves, a whole-head of spiral waves, or any other kind of curled look you want. This curling wand (and its thicker cousin), creates curls that lasts days. If I waited 3 days to wash my hair, it would still be curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite hair appliance, by far.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I own, and I own a lot of them. I love the way this makes my hair look and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> I prefer the xl over the smaller size because I can get beach waves very easy. It works so well!</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and is perfect for long hair to create full natural waves! It&#x27;s sleek and comfortable and incredibly light weight so it won&#x27;t weigh you down when you&#x27;re in a rush!</li>
            <li> This curling wand is excellent. Heats up quickly and creates beautiful curls and also has automatic shut-off (great for someone like me who always forgets).  Great quality, especially for the price point.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful wand if you know how to use it. I have used these types of wands before and yes if you are starting and learning it seems slippery and you may burn your fingers and you may want to give up. If you know how to use it, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and makes beautiful curls, it also has a decent sized cord and it&#x27;s swivel which makes everything so much easier. I&#x27;m very happy with the XL curling wand and I find that the best way to use it is to grab the curling wand and hold it sideways while i wrap my hair, then hold it upside down (if that makes any sense to anyone). I personally don&#x27;t use the glove because besides being an odd glove I already know how to use these types of wands and I can manage without burning myself. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the cold spots or uneven heating. Shipping was awesome, I ordered it the 2nd of February and received it the 6th (I live in California). In the picture I placed my phone in there just in case anyone wants size comparison (nexus 5, roughly 5 1/2&amp;#34; by 2 1/2&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I found this same brand wand at Target and other stores... buy it here!  Way more affordable. It does exactly what it describes.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this curling wond, I had only owned the smaller one. I love the larger size so much more. This is seriously the best curling wond!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed because I already have a wand about the same size as the original so I thought I&#x27;d try the XL to see if I could NOT look like Shirly Temple. It&#x27;s ok, but I think it&#x27;s still too tight of a curl for my long thick curly hair. Even if I flat iron first and then use this, it seems to look too tight and makes my hair frizzy because when you wrap it around the barrel, you&#x27;re leaving a portion of your hair unironed. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem with this particular want, but wands in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the 3 finger glove is sort of useless and hard to keep switching hands when you do the other side. I swiped the exposed part of my hand a couple of times and switched to my full hand glove after that. Lastly, I&#x27;m bummed because my friend bought this same one at Target for $14. That&#x27;s more $12 more than Amazon. I need a break from Amazon. Sigh...</li>
            <li> Purchased two for Christmas gifts....one for daughter age 33 and one for granddaughter age 14.  They both love them.  Just a great choice for us !!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my step daughter for Christmas.  At first I was worried she wouldn&#x27;t know how to use it but she did fine.</li>
            <li> Stopped turning on after one use. Could not return. Overall, very disappointed, as I am a huge fan of the original You Curl by Conair.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying to get the beach wave look for years! I dont know where this has been all my life! It heats up quickly and the curls last for days! I usually have to end up washing my hair because its dirty, not because my curls have died. I would like if the cord was a little longer though.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it a few times..I&#x27;m awful at using it but it works really well.</li>
            <li> Gives the perfect curls every time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to this curler, but it is working well for my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is hot (yo, duh!), but I use it on medium so I don&#x27;t damage my long hair with the extra time it takes to wind it, and I haven&#x27;t burned myself yet (felt the heat though).  The 3-fingered glove works well on one hand, but I wish the heat barrier were on both sides of the fingers so that the glove could be switched between both hands to do my other side, or they offered a left handed glove too (this would also help lefties). I will search for glove alternatives that will help with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wand is easier to pull out of the curl.  I put my long hair in a pony tail and just curl this part to give my hair more body and soft curl in or out of the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34;.  As I pull the wand out of the curl, I clip it to my head to let it cool in place for awhile which gives the curl more staying power against the weight of long hair. Using a light application of mousse before curling, I still have some curl 4 days later.</li>
            <li> It would be fine if it had a traditional cllip to start and keep hair in place because it definitely gets hot enough but I can&#x27;t get used to using the glove and holding the hair in place with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this you curl xl  curl my hair with it all the time.</li>
            <li> This item is awful. Definitely a 2 person job. The stick is made of very bad material hair slips off the wand and someone needs to keep hair on the wand at great difficulty because the 3 finger glove gets very hot after about 2-3 seconds. Had better results with curlers at a fraction of the time and effort. I am returning this item asap DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> It surely curls my hair. But my hair is so hard to tame with heat. Most of the curls fell out, and when it said XL, I didn&#x27;t even think to check out how long this really was. My hair took FOREVER to curl with this. This is why I never fix my hair up nice. Otherwise the product will work if your hair is short and don&#x27;t have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Love this i use it whenever i curl my hair and am never disappointed with the turn out. Definite 5 stars!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t curl my hair and just chopped off my luscious mane but I bought this as a present for someone. They tell that after many many tries and countless youtube videos they still can&#x27;t get the hang of using this curling iron with the gloves. Oh well I&#x27;m not using it! Hopefully it&#x27;s just operator error.</li>
            <li> Best Conair Curling Wand! Make great curls and stays long!</li>
            <li> My hair is very naturally straight and I find it difficult to find a curling iron that holds my hair! I bought a pricey one at a mall a while ago but opted for this one when a roommate of mine let me try hers. I am forever grateful, definitely recommend this curler!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron was perfect for giving me instant curls! I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work with my super soft and straight hair. But I tested it and the curls can last up to 3 days! It is really amazing and it took like 10 seconds for it to heat up to 400 degrees. Also, if you forget to turn it off, it turns off on its own automatically, and it even comes with a feature that makes it prop up. I love it!</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use. I am a first time buyer of a curling wand and I had no problems. The only thing that I did not care for was the glove that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I love this wand, makes amazing curls that last for days!</li>
            <li> It does take some practice if you&#x27;re not used to these type of curling instruments, but other than that, curls come out great! Definitely a good purchase!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had long hair past my shoulders in 15 or more years, and got this curling wand to get the new loose curl look.  What was I thinking?  Now that I&#x27;m a mom, I rarely have the luxury of curling my hair b/c I would have to DRY it first before I curl.  Most days, I&#x27;m lucky to get time to blow dry with a big round brush. If you look at the pictures or web videos, you&#x27;ll see heads full of curls.  However many curls you see on those heads is however many times you have to repeat the process to achieve the look.  There are no shortcuts.  I&#x27;ve tried taking larger sections of hair to speed the process, and the curls end up looking like waves. I actually have slightly wavy hair to begin with, hair that holds curls well, so I&#x27;m not hard to work with.  I just don&#x27;t have time to cover my head with curls like this tool is designed to be used. It&#x27;s also easy to miss strands here and there, and it&#x27;s super obvious when you miss because the other strands are so curly.  Even taking my time one night for before a formal affair, I didn&#x27;t care for the spiraly-ness of the curls.  I prefer, big, round, bouncy curls that look more natural.  This tool definitely creates more of the Taylor-Swift-you-either-have-curly-hair-to-begin-with-or-you-spent-tons-of-time-to-create-type curls.  Definitely not for me, and it will now jut take up space in my bathroom.  The three-fingered heat glove is a total joke.  Toss it before it becomes one more piece of junk in your bathroom drawers.</li>
            <li> I love to curl my hair have both of the conair you curl wands.They do absolutely great things to my hair.People always compliment my hair after I use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a curling wand. And since I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on one at first. I read the reviews about this one and watched some YOUTUBE videos and choose this one. It works great and does the trick. It does come with a little 2 fingered glove to protect your fingers. I find I don&#x27;t use this at all and find it cumbersome, but I curl my hair at my own risk.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have pin straight hair and have used a regular curling iron to try and make spiral curls, only to have the curls fall flat within a few hours. The curling wand creates the perfect curls and they last all day. I can even sleep on them and still have some manageable curl left the next morning. I have never regretted this purchase. I did start off with the smaller barrel and decided to try the bigger barrel for larger and more relaxed curls. Now I wish I had just bough this bigger barrel to begin with cause I don&#x27;t even use the smaller one anymore. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about the curling wand. It really delivers exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend says the curling iron works great.  She was apprehensive that it was too big being XL, but no longer thinks so.</li>
            <li> Best wand I&#x27;ve ever used and it takes me a lot to curl my hair, it gets very hot and didn&#x27;t have the little bonus finger glove it said if came with but if you&#x27;re careful you don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. The glove is stupid so I didn&#x27;t use. I believe a person is more likely to burn themselves using it than without. It did heat up quickly which is nice but the barrel should be longer to accommodate longer haired people. I continually ran out of surface and would get my hair tangled around the standing post.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and she loved it! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I only have to set it to the 2nd temperature level to get good waves that will last a couple days. I do wish they gave a full glove protector instead of the 3 finger. And it only fits left hand, need to protect my right too when I switch sides. But does what I want and I&#x27;m just extra careful and don&#x27;t use a glove (for now, still no burn yet)</li>
            <li> I always wanted naturally curly hair. Unfortunately, I was not blessed with such beauty. I had no luck with curling wands in the past. The curls were always too tight to look natural and the ends of my hair would come out looking like straw. The curling wands with the clips were the worst. They would always leave a dent in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought the Infiniti YOU CURL Curling Wand. I fell in love instantly! It’s really quick and simple to use. It comes with a heat glove, but I didn’t need to use it. I never needed to put my fingers that close to the wand to ever get burnt. However, I recommend that everyone else uses the glove just to be safe. You should feel the heat radiating from the wand before you get close enough to actually be burnt, but I can imagine people being distracted when they’re busy with the repetitive motion of winding hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about the wand is that it heats up super fast! I like not having to wait. I can immediately dive into styling my hair. I hold the wand facing downward and wrap my hair around the barrel. I hold it there for at least 10 seconds and voila! Beautiful curls! I continue to do that for the rest of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair, so I have to separate my hair into very thin strands. That’s probably why I had so many problems with curling wands before. They were never strong enough to handle thick hair. The Infiniti wand presented zero difficulties. I had big, beautiful curls the very first time I tried it!  Now I use it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the XL wand. It gives my hair great bounce.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is a lot better than some of the previous ones I&#x27;ve had and it makes my hair look amazing. My hair is a bit past my shoulders and I get some fairly loose, &amp;#34;beach curls&amp;#34; if I use a lower heat setting and tighter curls if I use a higher setting, so this is a great product so I can be very creative with my hair. The only downside is the &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34; that comes with it. It&#x27;s more of a three-finger protector which actually gets in the way for me, so I end up not using it. But really, if you&#x27;re careful, you won&#x27;t even need a glove when you use a wand.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It makes fast curls and long lasting and it&#x27;s not to heavy</li>
            <li> Great product good price fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> The Conair You Curl is a great and much more affordable alternative to the pricy t3 Singlepass Whirl. I have fine, thin, stick-straight, medium-length hair, and this curler gives me great beachy waves that last all day long and look fabulous. I have never been able to achieve the same look with more traditional curling irons. A couple of things that could be improved: first of all, the three-fingered glove that comes with this styler is a joke: completely useless. I just wear regular driving gloves when styling my hair, which work great and save me time, as I don&#x27;t have to switch the glove from hand to hand depending on which side of my hair I&#x27;m curling. I do think the t3 is better in terms of heat-up time and overall temperature consistency, but the You Curl is pretty great as well. I do wish it came with some sort of heat-proof sleeve for storage purposes. It is difficult to curl the back of my hair with this wand, and I sometimes have to use a clamp curling iron for that, but I have the same issue with the t3. Overall, this is a really good styling aid, even for those who are awful at styling their hair, like me!</li>
            <li> A W E S O M E!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S THE BEST PRODUCT FOR CURLING EVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND IT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;WITHOUT ANY OTHER PRODUCT YOU CUOLD HAVE CURLY HAIR!</li>
            <li> Enjoy it very much, easy to use, simple instructions and good design. Would definetly purchase products like this in the future.</li>
            <li> if you have time n lots of practice this is ok and gives wavy curls which i like large curls so didnt work for me</li>
            <li> I frequently joke that I am missing the girly factor or gene that most girls are born with that allows them to do their hair and make up flawlessly.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every method to curl my hair and I was just about to throw in the towel on ever having wavy/curly hair that I was satisfied with.  I bought this curling wand at Walmart after reading the reviews on amazon and I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I chose the XL barrel because I was looking to create &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; loose waves, a look that could easily be dressed up or down.  Although it was a little difficult to get used to positioning the curling wand at first, by the second use, I was totally comfortable with the tool and getting the exact look I have been trying to get for years. There are a lot of helpful videos on YouTube if you find yourself challenged on the first use.  My favorite part is that these waves give my hair lots of volume that doesn&#x27;t look too over the top.  The curls are also super bouncy and shiny and don&#x27;t leave my hair looking like it&#x27;s burnt to a crisp.  I like the size of the XL barrel because you can create tighter curls by using smaller sections of hair, or you can create larger bouncier waves or curls by using larger sections of hair.  Adjusting the direction of the cone-like shaped barrel also makes the waves look a little more natural rather than all being the exact same sized ringlets.  I have medium thickness medium length hair.  If you&#x27;re looking for a fun, wavy style I would definitely suggest looking into this curling wand.  It only took about 20 minutes to create waves through all of my hair.  My only real complaint is that the heat protection &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34; is pretty much useless and it is very easy to burn yourself with the first few uses before you get used to holding the wand and positioning your hair.  Other than that, I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase and look forward to using the wand frequently to create an everyday casual wavy look!</li>
            <li> I was unsure of buying this one compared to the smaller one but its just as easy to use the larger end as it is the smaller. I love it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, but it was exactly the size she was looking for and she loves it! She has used conical curling wands before so no problems with operation. I really like purchasing from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my niece and she is so inlove with it!! She uses it on a daily basis!! She loves how the curls turn out!! She recommends it to all you ladies!!</li>
            <li> I got the product on time, great quality and its super fast to curl my hair now. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this wand. Curls well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> THIS IS LOVE it does exactly hat the discription says. it cam quickly so i dident have to wait very long at all. this is my first curling wand and my hair was flawless. no more odd crimps in the middle of curls, and no more burning you finger while attempting to hold it in place (item comes with a glove to prevent that) does great from root to tips!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and while this does curl my hair, it is very frustrating to use.  The way the end is tapered causes my hair to slide down the barrel which is incredibly frustrating.  I stopped using this after a few times and went back to wrapping  my hair the same way around a basic $10 curling iron (just not using the clip).  Don&#x27;t waste your money - I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This curler is amazing!  It heats up fast and the curls last.  It also does not burn my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this curling wand for a while now. I&#x27;ve used this more than anything because of how easy it is to use and the look it gives my hair. There are a lot of tutorials on youtube and it wasn&#x27;t long that this became my favorite hairstyling tool because it works with casual looks and elegant looks. I have no complaints about it. It works really well and I love that you can set how hot you want it to be. My curls usually last all day and night with this curler. I have another curler from a different brand and my curls are limp after 4 hours or so. Great, affordable product. I would definitely use this with heat protector as it gets pretty hot and can damage your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this wand! It heats it hot enough to curl my thick hair and the curls last throughout the day. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it and so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Bought two of these Curling Irons for my daughters for Christmas.  They both love them. The results:  Easy and Beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used curling irons before and this is my first curling wand.  It heats up in record time, like 30 seconds and it&#x27;ll be at 350+ degrees.  Warning, it is extremely hot and I accidentally burnt my forehead my first attempt, but now that I&#x27;ve used it a few times, i can go from straight to wavy hair in under 10 mins.  Waves last all day too!</li>
            <li> either the barrel didn&#x27;t heat up evenly or something, but the curls came out very uneven (some parts curled, some parts straight). Plus the effort it takes to curl without trying to burn your fingers is not worth it with the crap curls you get as a result :[</li>
            <li> So hard to use, there is no clamp. The 1/4 of the glove that is given to you, is useless.</li>
            <li> Creates fantastic curls that last all day. Very easy to use. Would recommend buying this curling iron. I love it!</li>
            <li> The amputee glove needs to be shelved and some more thought put into how to hold the tip of iron without burning or getting close to burning skin.</li>
            <li> heats up great and the barrel is the perfect size for great waves or spiral curls. easy to use on any type of hair. the &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34; is difficult to use though. Yes, it keeps you from burning your fingers on the wand, but it is difficult to handle hair with the glove on and it tends to fall off since its not a full glove (only covers 3 fingers as shown in picture). also, because of the way the on/off buttons are on the handle I&#x27;ve often accidentally turned the curling iron off in the middle of doing my hair simple from handling the wand. but since it heats up so quickly i just turn it back on and have to wait a few seconds to use it again. also i don&#x27;t use the glove, just make sure to hold the very tip of the barrel to keep from burning. otherwise, great product for the price!</li>
            <li> It has a tempeture setting and is cheap and work well  it also comes with a glove (although i never use it) it is nice and helps prevent against burns this is a do buy!!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, very curly, and a little frizzy.  Letting my hair go au naturel is not bad, but with this wand, I can now have larger, frizz-free, shiny loose curls.  Today was the first day I used it, and it will definitely take a little more practice, but I still liked the result.  It would be nice if the light would change color letting me know when it&#x27;s heated up all the way.  My big complaint is that I accidentally kept pushing the 2 buttons during use, either shutting the wand off or unintentionally changing the temperature.  This happened about 5 or 6 times and I didn&#x27;t even notice until I&#x27;m wondering why my hair isn&#x27;t being curled.  Now I know to keep an eye on the buttons, but it is a major nuisance and I took 2 stars off because of it.  I am also not happy that 3 days after ordering mine, the price dropped over $6.00.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect the quality to be this high.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Heats very quickly and to a high enough temperature.&lt;br /&gt;Glove is very useful (as it does get very hot).&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to all you curl lovers out there; works great and brings you many hair compliments!</li>
            <li> Got this for my aunt for Christmas. She seems to like it and it is what she wanted. Must be good. I am a male so I guess I don&#x27;t have first hand experience with it.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE!!! I&#x27;ve been through so many sucky curling irons ,and this is the best! My curls look perfect and LAST DAYS!</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast even in five minutes it is almost fully heated! There is a power button so you can leave it plugged it and turn it on and off when needed.</li>
            <li> Well, I like the curling iron itself, but the glove that comes with it&#x27;s a joke, at least for inexperienced hands like mine. So now I need to buy a heat resistant glove.  Adding cost to it.  So not sure if there is another curling iron as good but for better price including the glove, so you don&#x27;t have to make the purchase separate. So be aware of it when you make your decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the curling iron itself, it works pretty well for me.  I have shoulder length hair -fine, not straight but irregular texture- and this is the first time I get pretty curls easily.  I like it much better than the other style curling iron, with the clamp.  Hair looks very shiny, like other costumers have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty happy with my purchase so far, although I bought it only two days ago.</li>
            <li> I compared this to the T3 one out there.  This is just as good, if not better than the T3!  I love this thing.  I have hair that is almost to my waist, and this works wonders on it.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! It is super easy, fast, and makes my extra straight hair stay perfectly curled all day. It is also priced great. I get complements all the time, and always recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Saved a great deal of money over the salon wands... and this iron heats up well and curls great.  My daughter love it!  Fast shipping, no issues.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been wanting a curling wand for a while.  I began to research and saw that there was a small and a large curling wand.  Since my daughter has pretty thick hair I decided to go with the XL curling wand and the price was reasonable.  I gave it to my daughter for christmas and she loves it.  It heats up quickly and curls beautifully!  I would definitely recommend this curling wand that wants that flowing, spiral curl look.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a curling iron without the clamp to get more natural looking beach curls.  This is a popular inexpensive one that does the job.  My hair takes curls pretty easily, so I got the XL instead of the smaller size.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you about my expertise with hair tools; it&#x27;s practically zero. I&#x27;m the type of gal who was NOT blessed with amazing hair or the patience to deal with unruly curls, which is my curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 34 and my hair has been turning gray since I was 9 years old. Needless to say that grays are difficult to control, imagine my pain dealing with grays as a teen. Nothing ever worked. The curling irons only helped tear the hair out of my head &amp; the flat iron was the only thing that worked for me...then I ran across this baby.. OMG this curling wand is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People were complaining about burning themselves so I ordered a Kevlar sleeve and industrial heat resistant gloves. I used them ONCE and I was done. If you are VERY careful you WILL NOT burn yourself. I don&#x27;t know what the other ladies were doing but I found it EXTREMELY easy to use. Take it from me, I only use a flat iron because that&#x27;s all I could do before this beauty! I ordered the XL because I wanted the option of having waves or curls. I am EXTREMELY satisfied with this wand and will be ordering different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use! Use your left hand to hold the iron as you do the right side of your head and use the right hand to do the left. It&#x27;s SUPER EASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For tight curls keep the hair on the wand longer and for waves keep it on the wand for less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing! I did my research and am very happy with my purchase. I can&#x27;t believe this cost $25. My flat iron was almost $100 and the results are not as smooth as this curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CANNOT lose with this curling wand!</li>
            <li> I received this product in the mail within just a few days, and I really enjoy how easy it is to use. The type of curls it produces are different than a regular curling iron or straightener, which is what I like.</li>
            <li> I reallyyy enjoyed this product, fun if you like messing with your hair and creating new do&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Had to watch videos on how to use it since it&#x27;s very different from a normal curling iron but it&#x27;s better. You don&#x27;t really need the glove if you&#x27;re careful. My first time I didn&#x27;t do a very good job but my second time turned out beautiful. You need to put it behind your head (as most videos show) and do the opposite side for good results.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite curling tool. Curls come out beautiful and you really have more flexibility on the desired outcome than with a standard curling iron. You have to be careful that you don&#x27;t burn your fingers, but it includes a three finger glove for protection. Adjustable heat settings are a plus.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Heats up quickly, has multiple heat settings for various types of hair, and the ceramic barrel leaves your hair soft and shiny. A really great value compared to the rest of the tools out there. I would also recommend a good heat styling product and hairspray for the best results. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This has nothing to do with the product itself, but the lack of information! When I ordered it i had no idea it couldn&#x27;t be used in Europe because of the plug. I hope this is a help to people in Europe wondering wether to buy it or not. I&#x27;m very sad because I was really looking forward to using this curling iron, but now i&#x27;ve just got a useless thing..</li>
            <li> After 4 curling irons that promised to get hot enough to curl my nieces straight hair, this one did it. It is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and usually have trouble getting that soft beach wave look with a traditional curling iron, let alone having it stay that way throughout the day.  The Conair Infiniti You Curl Iron has solved that issue though.  Seriously gives you a great natural wave and you don&#x27;t have to worry about a clamp leaving weird kinks at the end or having that \\&quot;Curly Sue\\&quot; look.  I&#x27;m obsessed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quick and gets very hot, I typically turn mine down a bit since I have such fine hair.  It also comes with a finger glove to prevent burning yourself but I haven&#x27;t found a need for it.  Once you get the hang of holding the wand with one hand and wrapping with the other, it&#x27;s super easy and fast!</li>
            <li> not easy to use.  Every time I tried to roll in the hair I had to way to clip my hair to the curling iron.  I had to use my fingers and I kept betting burned even though, a partial glove is provided in the package for 3 fingers!  Did not like it at all, and returning it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple ...I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and no complaints!&lt;br /&gt;I Keep it at 350 degrees...the curls come out smooth and shiny and they last without Hair spray! I got the XL and they still come out a little tight so if you want loose curls the XL is your best bet just grab bigger chunks of hair and start curling the lower part. The price of this is great! and don&#x27;t forget your heat protector!</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron. The tourmaline helps to reduce the frizz and it comes with a glove so you can hold the hair in place without burning your fingertips. It took a few sessions to learn how to use it right</li>
            <li> The packaging was damage and was not what I expected...It arrived in good time.&lt;br /&gt;  This is so stupid because I do not have anything</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand!  It curls my hair perfectly!  I have tried other brands, but I like this one better!</li>
            <li> I like the concept of the glove but I cannot use this iron with long hair. Personally, I found that my is way too long to try and wrap around the iron. Also, I found trying to wrap my hair around the iron myself to be too time consuming. This is not for me...I gave 3 stars for the quality of the product and glove. The iron seems to have a nice consistent heat and heats up in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> This handy device has transformed my hair appearance. Now I get how all those catalog models have flowy locks.</li>
            <li> This gives you amazing curls. Great for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Still learning but like product very much. I have to use it on the highest setting, and although it is XL I have long hair and am still learning how not to run out of room on the barrel. Best price as always and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;XL&amp;#34; and instead received the regular 1 inch barrel. The wand itself works very well, however, and I would have given 5 stars had it not been for receiving the incorrect product. Just be aware that if you order the &amp;#34;XL&amp;#34; you may not actually receive the larger wand.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and have spent years trying to find a way to curl my hair that won&#x27;t leave it straight in an hour. This is it! Using the lowest heat setting, it holds my curls for two days. It does take a use or two to get used to, but now I can do my entire head in 15 minutes. I also love that they are the perfect wavy curls, not ringlets or tiny kinky curls. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since using this.</li>
            <li> It gets hot very quickly, just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to hold it, and the different setting are good for different types of hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really dried out using it so i rarely use it as to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I liked the curling iron very much; heated quickly, variety of settings. The glove was useless, but I find it easier working without it anyway.</li>
            <li> The curling iron works great, but I hate the 3-fingered glove! It&#x27;s too big and ended up being too awkward to use. It also only has the heat protection on one side, so you can&#x27;t switch hands with it, which made it hard to do one side of my hair. I will be buying another thermal glove separately. But again, curling iron was great. :)</li>
            <li> I would love it if it would control more freeze but for the price this is a great product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very straight and fine hair. I have tried many different types of curling irons and even straighteners to curl my hair. No amount of product in my hair would allow those curling irons to produce the results that I wanted. A friend recommended the You Curl wand to me. Let me tell you, I have AMAZING curls now. I didn&#x27;t even use any product in my hair and now I have gorgeous, loose curls. They look beautiful. I even slept in my curls and they still look good the next day! I like how this product has a few different temperature options. Honestly, I think that&#x27;s why it works so well; it&#x27;s so hot! The only downside to this product is that it is a little tricky to use at first. It definitely takes time to master but it&#x27;s totally worth it. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially someone who thought they&#x27;d never be able to curl their hair like every one else! Buy it and try it to see for yourself!</li>
            <li> I had tried a friends and really liked it. I was hoping it would be purple like the pic but it still works the same.</li>
            <li> hair slides right off. even bought a heat resistant glove to hold my hair on the rod but the glove doesn&#x27;t work great either, still gets very hot to touch. the glove that comes with it is akward, should be full size glove. definitely don&#x27;t get the great curls that it shows. disappointed.</li>
