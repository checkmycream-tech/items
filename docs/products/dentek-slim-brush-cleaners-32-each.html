            <li>an observational update: It would be nice if the tips were protected with covers</li>
            <li>I would have liked some caps for these brush</li>
            <li>I Like the brush more hard,this one too soft,but it&#x27;s ok for use!</li>

            <li>I bought a bunch of different kinds to help with my gingivitis and these were among the best.</li>

            <li>Love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>I tried them and like them much better than floss.  </li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Took my gums from a grade 5 to a 2 and my dentist was so impressed he actually now uses them himself, with his familty and in his practice.  </li>
            <li>Best product to add upto ur personal hygiene .</li>
            <li>They hold up well for many cleanings.</li>
            <li>and I hope my dentist will notice too :-)</li>
            <li>But I have enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>Dentist recommend this because it does a better job than tooth picks, flossing and tooth brushing alone.</li>
            <li>love it better than floss</li>
            <li>Only four stars since I still prefer floss, but these are great and easy to use!</li>
            <li>These are pricey, but if they get you to floss more, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Goes easily between almost all of my teeth, and no problems with the brush breaking off as you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>The brush heads bend around easily</li>
            <li>BE AWARE THIS IS NOT THE TRAVEL VERSION which I got as a sample from my dentist (which has its own cap for the brush).  </li>
            <li>DenTek is a leading dental supply manufacturer and these are wonderful &#x27;picks&#x27; for tight teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The handle is a bit tiny and you don&#x27;t have a great grip.</li>
            <li>fit into yor pruse or where ever needed</li>
            <li>If you are in a state that Amazon does not operate in, then you get these tax free as well.  </li>
            <li>They will bend and I guess that could be used as a heads up that they don&#x27;t fit here.</li>
            <li>Keeps ur teeth free from any inter dental blockage and bacteria free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they work really well for most people</li>
            <li>The price is right if they help maintain dental health, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Especially good for between the molars with a small bend.</li>
            <li>I also use them to floss in between my teeth in place a traditional floss and it works GREAT and it fast and does a better job them floss and even the $90 air flosser I bought and then returned after discovering these.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my airbrush.</li>
            <li>It your teeth are very close together, be sure to order the slims so they wil fit between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind if there wasn&#x27;t a cap for every brush, but I&#x27;d clean and reuse the caps (perhaps 5 to 10 caps and a tool brush to clean the caps packaged with these Slim Brushes?).</li>
            <li>I have a Broxodent electric toothbrush that gets my teeth squeaky clean on the surface, but it just can&#x27;t clean in between.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>and I like the way they clean between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I do love the large brush ones.</li>
            <li>the free shipping makes it definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other similar products before including this one and have concluded that this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I know they&#x27;re doing a good job; even after flossing, they get out more trapped debris and save me from the dreaded halitosis.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about being able to actually brush BETWEEN your teeth?</li>
            <li>These are as good as the GUM brand and as long as you rinse them</li>
            <li>I bet these would be good for people with braces to clean more thoroughly as they are so small that they can be slipped parallel to the teeth and brace more easily.</li>
            <li>They are really slim and can get through teeth easily.</li>
            <li>The tips are bendable for easy reach and it is so much faster and cleaner then flossing.  </li>
            <li>Work great for people who have tight teeth or braces wearers.  </li>
            <li>My son uses them everyday, and is happy with them.</li>
            <li>These are probably the best of this type of brush pick I&#x27;ve used because of its thin brush end.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, exactly as described</li>
            <li>I have a dental implant and this brush really helps clean around it.  </li>
            <li>Although I have trouble fitting between all of my teeth, that is probably a matter of finding the appropriate size, they clean very well.</li>
            <li>These are good for tight situations with your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>Great product, you have to be gentle since the wire is thin, they tend to bend too easily.</li>
            <li>I have braces and these work very well!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes simple is better, which is the case with this product.</li>
            <li>They are more discreet than brushing in public.  </li>
            <li>I definitely prefer these to dental floss as the cleaning is more thorough.</li>
            <li>They work extremely well and the cost is amazing for the product.</li>
            <li>It is soft and gentle yet strong and efficient, and really does the job.</li>
            <li>They are good for someone who has very little space between teeth.</li>
            <li>Good brush but no top.  </li>
            <li>For those of you who are not good at flossing this is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it bends quite easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to reach the teeth at the back without the wire folding or getting destroyed.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fill up the space between teeth very well for me.</li>
            <li>Whenever I can get a dentist to personally pay for something instead of using what they get for free that tells you something.  </li>
            <li>These really work for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like these interdental brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re no longer readily on shelves</li>
            <li>REALLY Slim</li>
            <li>While they do a nice job of cleaning my well spaced front teeth they do not fit between my rear ones at all.</li>
            <li>I personally use the slim ones for my front teeth and the easy brush normal ones everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>These are just the right size to get between my rather narrow spaces, but also quite effective in larger spaces as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They can get into places that my toothbrush simply can&#x27;t and are much better than trying to use a toothpick or similar item to remove food particles.</li>
            <li>The little brushes are great, the only problem is they do not actually go between my teeth!</li>
            <li>Other than that this product is a fine one to remove food particles between teeth.</li>
            <li>B009MHV3VW DenTek Slim Brush, Professional Interdental Cleaners, Tight Teeth, Mouthwash Mint, 32 Count]] - Keeping healthy teeth and gums is so vital for your smile and your general well-being.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a single use itwm</li>
            <li>It really gets between your teeth clean and they last really long.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my dental hygienist remarked last time on the good condition of my gums (not always the case) and that is due in large part to my recent habit of using these little gems.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really blame the company for my crooked teeth</li>
            <li>These were the same as I have previously bought in local store, however, price is better.</li>
            <li>so I need the slim brushes, which means they slip in very smoothly, then the little brushes go to work all the way down to the gum line.</li>
            <li>I really like these, they are stronger than other brushes I used and</li>
            <li>Well worth the small price.</li>
            <li>Even the slim brush was to large for about half of my teeth.</li>

            <li> Not bad for a single use itwm</li>
            <li> It really gets between your teeth clean and they last really long.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my dental hygienist remarked last time on the good condition of my gums (not always the case) and that is due in large part to my recent habit of using these little gems.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really blame the company for my crooked teeth</li>
            <li> These were the same as I have previously bought in local store, however, price is better.</li>
            <li> so I need the slim brushes, which means they slip in very smoothly, then the little brushes go to work all the way down to the gum line.</li>
            <li> I really like these, they are stronger than other brushes I used and</li>
            <li> Well worth the small price.</li>
            <li> Even the slim brush was to large for about half of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in tight spaces.</li>
            <li> These are far too big for my tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Mini brush for a single use, since there is no cap to cover it for next time.</li>
            <li> The bristles come out easier than some other similar products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with dental hygiene, so I love these little brushes.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking to get slimmer floss for an easier time on my tight back teeth when I came across these and decided to try them.</li>
            <li> But for tight teeth, definitely not!</li>
            <li> I suspect they work for some, but they were too small for me and ore one time use only.</li>
            <li> It has a finer point than my other brushes so it fits where others won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> However, the wire does bend a bit faster after less use, but this is to be expected, I guess, to get the thinnest brush.</li>
            <li> They come in multiple sizes and remove food you never knew flossing left behind.  </li>
            <li> One can be used for all of your teeth, so this pack should last you at least a month.  </li>
            <li> And try the competition for something less flimsy.</li>
            <li> They are slightly minty.  </li>
            <li> The slim ones are for tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> These are the thinnest little inter-tooth cleaners I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just no way that floss can remove plaque from your teeth as well as these little brushes can.</li>
            <li> Maybe the wire could be a little bit stronger in making the brushes.</li>
            <li> Tiny brushes go between tight teeth and remove irritating bits of food.</li>
            <li> you can use them a few times.</li>
            <li> When my son got braces his dentist gave him a few brushes that looked like this</li>
            <li> I did not know that the size is  half of the usual brush size.</li>
            <li> I also carry some in a small snack bag in my purse when I go out to eat.  </li>
            <li> Just what you need to get to the hard places to get the food out from between teeth.</li>
            <li> I still use dental floss but getting around the bottom of the crown was really hard and this has made that job easier.</li>
            <li> So go slow when flossing.</li>
            <li> Wrong item, brushes are very small.  </li>
            <li> I am a Dental Assistant and have been obsessed with oral hygene for quite some time.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to locate them anywhere except on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The ones I received were not the very thin brushes.</li>
            <li> and it is almost impossible to use floss.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The handle is a bit tiny and you don&#x27;t have a great grip. If you need this, check out the Plackers brand one that has a &amp;#34;duck&amp;#34; look - it&#x27;s an L-shape handle and much larger and easier to grip and angle around your mouth. This one&#x27;s too tiny and slips around in your hands.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter just got braces and this was a good buy</li>
            <li> This product is the best. I am a Dental Assistant and have been obsessed with oral hygene for quite some time. I have tried many other similar products before including this one and have concluded that this one is the best. It is soft and gentle yet strong and efficient, and really does the job. Two thumbs up for DenTek Slim Brush. I love it.</li>
            <li> I like these slim brushes. I bought a bunch of different kinds to help with my gingivitis and these were among the best.</li>
            <li> Great substitute for flossing.  Small enough to fit in tight spaces.</li>
            <li> I suspect they work for some, but they were too small for me and ore one time use only.</li>
            <li> I did not know that the size is  half of the usual brush size. Mini brush for a single use, since there is no cap to cover it for next time.</li>
            <li> Great mini brush for cleaning between teeth.  Works better than floss.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say bout this.</li>
            <li> Gets to the back area where my braces end and food gets caught.</li>
            <li> These are great for cleaning in and around braces. My son uses them everyday, and is happy with them.</li>
            <li> just what the doctor / dentist ordered</li>
            <li> Just what you need to get to the hard places to get the food out from between teeth. good price will order again when needed. fit into yor pruse or where ever needed</li>
            <li> I wish I had found these earlier in life.&lt;br /&gt;I keep a pack at work, in my car, etc. Better than toothpicks and easier than flossing.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  But try the various DenTek similar items, to find what you prefer.  And try the competition for something less flimsy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really blame the company for my crooked teeth but I thought they would be stronger.  I&#x27;m sure they work really well for most people</li>
            <li> Work great for people who have tight teeth or braces wearers.  There are a great price and the free shipping makes it definitely worth it.  If you are in a state that Amazon does not operate in, then you get these tax free as well.  One can be used for all of your teeth, so this pack should last you at least a month.  Well worth the small price.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B009MHV3VW DenTek Slim Brush, Professional Interdental Cleaners, Tight Teeth, Mouthwash Mint, 32 Count]] - Keeping healthy teeth and gums is so vital for your smile and your general well-being. My dental hygienist suggested I add brushing between my teeth to my daily ultra-sonic brushing and flossing regimen. These are just the right size to get between my rather narrow spaces, but also quite effective in larger spaces as well. I know they&#x27;re doing a good job; even after flossing, they get out more trapped debris and save me from the dreaded halitosis.</li>
            <li> DenTek is a leading dental supply manufacturer and these are wonderful &#x27;picks&#x27; for tight teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Just an observational update: It would be nice if the tips were protected with covers</li>
            <li> I have braces and these work very well!  Only four stars since I still prefer floss, but these are great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Did not like - I ordered the bigger ones but received the slim brush type.  I do love the large brush ones.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my airbrush. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these on your teeth since it&#x27;s basically a metal wire pipe cleaner on the end of a plastic body. Another brand that uses and all rubber pick will probably be safer</li>
            <li> I have dental iplants and it is almost impossible to use floss. These work great. It your teeth are very close together, be sure to order the slims so they wil fit between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, exactly as described</li>
            <li> Sometimes simple is better, which is the case with this product. They work extremely well and the cost is amazing for the product. I use them at home and when I travel and they work and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can get into places that my toothbrush simply can&#x27;t and are much better than trying to use a toothpick or similar item to remove food particles.</li>
            <li> I Like the brush more hard,this one too soft,but it&#x27;s ok for use!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> very good I like. Thank you</li>
            <li> Best thing for braces ever !  Better than any toothpick, even without braces. Especially good for between the molars with a small bend.</li>
            <li> Tiny brushes go between tight teeth and remove irritating bits of food. Better than floss. Easier to use than floss. The bristles come out easier than some other similar products I have tried.</li>
            <li> They are good for someone who has very little space between teeth. I wish I had bought some larger ones. They don&#x27;t fill up the space between teeth very well for me.</li>
            <li> BE AWARE THIS IS NOT THE TRAVEL VERSION which I got as a sample from my dentist (which has its own cap for the brush).  Other than that this product is a fine one to remove food particles between teeth. No complaints but cannot carry it in your pocket for use away from home.</li>
            <li> These are probably the best of this type of brush pick I&#x27;ve used because of its thin brush end. However, the wire does bend a bit faster after less use, but this is to be expected, I guess, to get the thinnest brush. I would have liked some caps for these brush picks so I could carry one in my pocket when needed. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if there wasn&#x27;t a cap for every brush, but I&#x27;d clean and reuse the caps (perhaps 5 to 10 caps and a tool brush to clean the caps packaged with these Slim Brushes?).</li>
            <li> Great product, you have to be gentle since the wire is thin, they tend to bend too easily. So go slow when flossing.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these and I was unable to locate them anywhere except on Amazon.  They work great.</li>
            <li> These are great. The brush end is so thin that they fit between my teeth. I use them for around my crown because that darn thing cost a bundle and I would like to have healthy gums in my mouth. They are slightly minty.  If they don&#x27;t want to get smashed between close teeth, they are not going to go.  They will bend and I guess that could be used as a heads up that they don&#x27;t fit here. I don&#x27;t know what else to say.  They came unbroken and in sealed bags and they work. I bet these would be good for people with braces to clean more thoroughly as they are so small that they can be slipped parallel to the teeth and brace more easily. I still use dental floss but getting around the bottom of the crown was really hard and this has made that job easier. The price is right if they help maintain dental health, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> good quality, does a great job, good price</li>
            <li> Not bad for a single use itwm</li>
            <li> Good brush but no top.  I can&#x27;t carry it in my pocket unless I want to brush with pocket lint.</li>
            <li> These are the thinnest little inter-tooth cleaners I&#x27;ve found. In fact, my dental hygienist remarked last time on the good condition of my gums (not always the case) and that is due in large part to my recent habit of using these little gems. Love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Perfect cleaners! They are really slim and can get through teeth easily. I definitely recommend them</li>
            <li> These are pocket size, and I dip the brush tip in hydrogen peroxide to cleanse and oxygenate the periodontal pockets of my dental patients.  I give them some to take home, and they love them!</li>
            <li> Not sturdy enough to go between my teeth without bending.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Slimmer than the slimmest similar Gum brush cleaner, but stronger.  Goes easily between almost all of my teeth, and no problems with the brush breaking off as you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about being able to actually brush BETWEEN your teeth? These Brush Cleaners beat flossing by a mile. There&#x27;s just no way that floss can remove plaque from your teeth as well as these little brushes can. I have a Broxodent electric toothbrush that gets my teeth squeaky clean on the surface, but it just can&#x27;t clean in between. My teeth are fairly close together so I need the slim brushes, which means they slip in very smoothly, then the little brushes go to work all the way down to the gum line. Been using them for years and truly couldn&#x27;t do without them. I&#x27;m so happy Amazon is now carrying them -- goes well with my Prime &lt;smile&gt;.</li>
            <li> These are as good as the GUM brand and as long as you rinse them&lt;br /&gt;and wrap in a tissue you can use them a few times.</li>
            <li> When my son got braces his dentist gave him a few brushes that looked like this so we bought them.  I tried them and like them much better than floss.  We keep one in our wallets too, just in case.</li>
            <li> These were not as ordered I got a different package and did not fill my needs. The ones I received were not the very thin brushes.</li>
            <li> Our dentist suggested these and We love these things!</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for the quality.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are not good at flossing this is the next best thing.  I use them after brushing my teeth before I rinse.  I also carry some in a small snack bag in my purse when I go out to eat.  They are more discreet than brushing in public.  They seem to be easier on my gums than flossing.  Hope they work for you.</li>
            <li> Once you switch you will get everyone else to.  They come in multiple sizes and remove food you never knew flossing left behind.  Took my gums from a grade 5 to a 2 and my dentist was so impressed he actually now uses them himself, with his familty and in his practice.  Whenever I can get a dentist to personally pay for something instead of using what they get for free that tells you something.  The slim ones are for tight teeth.  I personally use the slim ones for my front teeth and the easy brush normal ones everywhere else.  The tips are bendable for easy reach and it is so much faster and cleaner then flossing.  Imagine never picking up floss off the floor again or anywhere else your kids or loved ones seem to leave it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with dental hygiene, so I love these little brushes.  They are great for scrubbing between teeth.</li>
            <li> These really work for me.  I have a dental implant and this brush really helps clean around it.  It has a finer point than my other brushes so it fits where others won&#x27;t.  The only downside is that it bends quite easily.</li>
            <li> Best product to add upto ur personal hygiene . Must for eveyone . Keeps ur teeth free from any inter dental blockage and bacteria free</li>
            <li> I like these, but sometimes the metal part of the brush cuts my gums when inserting the brush; my husband has no such problem and loves them! These are pricey, but if they get you to floss more, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling clean. Works great and great for my purse. They hold up well for many cleanings.</li>
            <li> I really like these, they are stronger than other brushes I used and the handle is very comfortable. It&#x27;s easy to reach the teeth at the back without the wire folding or getting destroyed. I think I found my dental hygiene favourite and I hope my dentist will notice too :-) I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I really like these interdental brushes. Although I have trouble fitting between all of my teeth, that is probably a matter of finding the appropriate size, they clean very well. I definitely prefer these to dental floss as the cleaning is more thorough.</li>
            <li> works great just as advertised..perfect size to keep one in the car and one in wallet...great purchase :)</li>
            <li> It took time to figure out the best way to use them.  But I have enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Slim Brush to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; between my teeth for a couple of years.  They&#x27;re no longer readily on shelves and so glad to find them on the web!</li>
            <li> It really gets between your teeth clean and they last really long.  A good investment in the health of your teeth</li>
            <li> Why these are sold without covers is beyond me.  These are good for tight situations with your teeth and gums.  But again no covers.</li>
            <li> I just got braces and these work great to get between and around braces to get food out. I also use them to floss in between my teeth in place a traditional floss and it works GREAT and it fast and does a better job them floss and even the $90 air flosser I bought and then returned after discovering these.</li>
            <li> Even the slim brush was to large for about half of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Wrong item, brushes are very small.  REALLY Slim</li>
            <li> These were the same as I have previously bought in local store, however, price is better. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are far too big for my tight teeth. I had been looking to get slimmer floss for an easier time on my tight back teeth when I came across these and decided to try them. While they do a nice job of cleaning my well spaced front teeth they do not fit between my rear ones at all.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for getting between teeth to remove food debris.</li>
            <li> Does what its designed to  do.</li>
            <li> The little brushes are great, the only problem is they do not actually go between my teeth! The price is great and the delivery was prompt. But for tight teeth, definitely not! It also curves into my gums when I try to stick it in between my teeth, hurting my gums. I got the waterpik, now that works!</li>
            <li> Dentist recommend this because it does a better job than tooth picks, flossing and tooth brushing alone.</li>
            <li> These brushes were recommended by my dentist and I like the way they clean between the teeth.  The brush heads bend around easily and sometimes I can&#x27;t get them lined up for use on the back teeth.  Maybe the wire could be a little bit stronger in making the brushes.</li>
            <li> love it better than floss</li>
            <li> Good for my daughter, orthodontist recommended. cleans between braces, no problems.</li>
