    <ol>
            <li>This was perfect for us!</li>
            <li>I just be happy to see you?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Works great as a wallet though.</li>
            <li>Came just as it looks like makes great gift.</li>
            <li>it was nice!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fairly well conceived/executed, at that.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s the best fit for my bully sunglasses  </li>
            <li>Best funny gift ever!</li>
            <li>Nice novelty item.</li>
            <li>It fits right into my purse and the zipper works great..</li>
            <li>For those who&#x27;d like to stick a pencil in this taco, it sure does the trick.</li>
            <li>well, I&#x27;m sure it can be arranged.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be more satisfied than the widow who just moved in across the street.</li>
            <li>I can barely fit anything in it!</li>
            <li>Cute product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a pencil holder.</li>
            <li>The zipper is nice quality and the material is smooth.</li>
            <li>Have to fight me kids over it, it is so cute.  </li>
            <li>and I love the taco shape.</li>
            <li>exactly what my daughter liked,.,.</li>
            <li>And it smelled kind of funny which can cause some embarrassment when you whip it out.</li>
            <li>It is fun to take it out of your purse and see the looks you get from people. :)</li>
            <li>Taco looks better in the photo than in real life.</li>
            <li>,..it ripped quite quickly, but until that point,....</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I have the hot dog one as well.</li>
            <li>so it has turned out to be useful.</li>
            <li>This is great to keep in my purse and keep small things in that</li>
            <li>I like this one a lot, but for some reason my wife prefers the hot dog.</li>
            <li>All said and done, it&#x27;s a pretty compact taco to have in hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute; the &amp;#34;shell&amp;#34; of the taco has a slight texture, adding to the tortilla feel.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect too much from it</li>
            <li>Looks real.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because you really can&#x27;t shove a full-sized hot dog in here.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the type who prefers something thicker, like a magic marker or small cigar to go in your taco...</li>
            <li>Bought this because I was very hungry, and even though the pen seemed like an odd topping, I took a chance.</li>

            <li> where this character crazy Dave has a magic taco</li>
            <li> I mean, you could try, but an all-beef frank would be too tight of a fit and probably split this taco wide open and leave quite a mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to loose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a wallet.</li>
            <li> But I wish it came in pink!  </li>

            <li> Or anyone you know whose mind leans toward the slightly smutty.</li>
            <li> I promptly returned the uneaten half of this \\&quot;taco\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The zipper and pull is a bit small and awkward to use on a regular basis, but we bought it for the looks anyway...</li>
            <li> And when I do it&#x27;s hard to see what&#x27;s inside because of its size</li>
            <li> It was tough, hard to chew, and stuck in my throat.  </li>
            <li> My kids are obsessed with the game Plants vs Zombies</li>
            <li> False advertising, indeed!</li>
            <li> Material is very thin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I got this for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Tastes absolutely awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> For everyone who has ever chased pocket taco.  This product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Do you have a taco in your pocket?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Can&#x27;t I just be happy to see you?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I like this one a lot, but for some reason my wife prefers the hot dog. Must be a gender thing.</li>
            <li> For those who&#x27;d like to stick a pencil in this taco, it sure does the trick. If you&#x27;re the type who prefers something thicker, like a magic marker or small cigar to go in your taco...well, I&#x27;m sure it can be arranged. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because you really can&#x27;t shove a full-sized hot dog in here. I mean, you could try, but an all-beef frank would be too tight of a fit and probably split this taco wide open and leave quite a mess. All said and done, it&#x27;s a pretty compact taco to have in hand. Just don&#x27;t expect too much from it and you&#x27;ll be more satisfied than the widow who just moved in across the street.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was very hungry, and even though the pen seemed like an odd topping, I took a chance. Tastes absolutely awful. Works great as a wallet though. 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> exactly what my daughter liked,.,.,..it ripped quite quickly, but until that point,....it was nice!</li>
            <li> I like it alot and deff. would tell another friend or friends bout this..Love the product. I might purchase another.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s fairly well conceived/executed, at that.  Give it to fans of Mexican or Tex-Mex food.  Or Taco Bell employees.  Or anyone you know whose mind leans toward the slightly smutty.</li>
            <li> Best funny gift ever!</li>
            <li> Uhhh I like it but I thought it would be bigger I can barely fit anything in it! And when I do it&#x27;s hard to see what&#x27;s inside because of its size</li>
            <li> I use this taco for my pencils and stuff at school and today, for April Fools, I had it and people kept asking me why there was a taco on my desk! I love it so much, I have the hot dog one as well. It&#x27;s very cute; the &amp;#34;shell&amp;#34; of the taco has a slight texture, adding to the tortilla feel. A+!</li>
            <li> Came just as it looks like makes great gift. I got one for my sister as a change purse and she getts comments on it all the time</li>
            <li> Cute product. Looks real. Nice novelty item. Ample storage for dollars, coins, a key or two, maybe a chapstick too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a wallet. It&#x27;s more like a pencil holder. I was disappointed when I got this for my daughter.</li>
            <li> But I wish it came in pink!  Who doesn&#x27;t like a pink taco!  And it smelled kind of funny which can cause some embarrassment when you whip it out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t taste like a taco at all!  It was tough, hard to chew, and stuck in my throat.  My tummy definitely didn&#x27;t think it was yummy.  I promptly returned the uneaten half of this \\&quot;taco\\&quot;.  False advertising, indeed!</li>
            <li> This bag is the prefect size for foundation and brush.  The zipper is nice quality and the material is smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the cutest wallet ever!! It is fun to take it out of your purse and see the looks you get from people. :)</li>
            <li> Have to fight me kids over it, it is so cute.  The zipper and pull is a bit small and awkward to use on a regular basis, but we bought it for the looks anyway... My kids are obsessed with the game Plants vs Zombies where this character crazy Dave has a magic taco...  This was perfect for us!</li>
            <li> This is great to keep in my purse and keep small things in that I don&#x27;t want to loose.  It fits right into my purse and the zipper works great..and I love the taco shape.</li>
            <li> Material is very thin. Taco looks better in the photo than in real life. However, it&#x27;s the best fit for my bully sunglasses  so it has turned out to be useful.</li>
