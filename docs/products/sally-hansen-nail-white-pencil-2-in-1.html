            <li>It worked fantastic!</li>
            <li>He does not whiten his nails. :-)</li>
            <li>I have used these pencils for many years.</li>
            <li>sharpened it more, the point broke off again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buffing my nails for more than fifty years.  </li>
            <li>and I was excited to find them!</li>
            <li>They work wonderfully if you sharpen them and wet</li>
            <li>The lead breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>No matter how easy you are they break.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this pencil for the first usage.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I bought a bunch of them, and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product for the angled other side, that not only pushes cuticles, but, is the best product that I have found to clean under your nails!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of this pencil, love the look of clean white natural nails, but this is not the product to get that look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere, because I love the concept and the results...just not this particular brand.</li>
            <li>It does wash off after several handwashings, but as needed reapplication is quick and easy!  </li>
            <li>I threw away three in a row after the first attempt to sharpen it.  </li>
            <li>The big &#x27;stores&#x27; just don&#x27;t carry it any more.  </li>
            <li>The pencil broke the first time I attempted to use it.</li>
            <li>It always works and makes my nails look so healthy and white.  </li>
            <li>This, along with a fresh filing and a coat of clear, makes my nails look acrylic-perfect without the damage!!</li>
            <li>it dissolves very quickly and you have to resharpen it constantly.</li>
            <li>That allows you to gently glide the pencil under the nails</li>
            <li>this product i really wanted</li>
            <li>I plan on using this product forever,really, I really will</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;ve got 4 fingers on my left hand nice and white, and the rest of them I&#x27;m not going to bother</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to know if there are other products out there</li>
            <li>pencil whitener is crumbly, but, everyone that uses this to clean their nails and push back cuticles loves it!  </li>
            <li>would give it a 5 star, if only the white pencil were stronger and did not break so easily.  </li>
            <li>that work better and achieve the same result, but this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I took a chance and ordered the \\&quot;Flowery\\&quot; brand from Amazon, and it is harder material and easy to sharpen, works just like the Revlon and seems like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using nail white pencils for the past 15 years just to even out the line between my nail plate and free edge.  </li>
            <li>This was after wetting just the very tip of it, and I also tried to get it real wet to see if that worked.</li>
            <li>In the past 20 years I have always used this product right out of the shower.  </li>

            <li> Later I visited a local salon warehouse store and found a white pencil that was twice as long and half the price.  </li>
            <li> It should be a harder compound to last longer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sharpen well; it breaks off every time I get it to a point sharp enough to work.</li>
            <li> Yet, I use the other side CONSTANTLY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of white nail pencils, but Walgreen&#x27;s stopped carrying Revlon.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not worth the frustration, and after sharpening it over and over just to get a point, it is now only about 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> No matter how carefully I sharpen the pencil it crumbles.  </li>
            <li> Pencil was shorter than expected.  </li>
            <li> Every time I carefully sharpen it, the tip breaks off before I can even use it.</li>
            <li> No matter how carefully I sharpen it and apply it to nails, the pencil reduces to talc and does not dutifully do one nail well.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of my time and of course money.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than others I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Since then, however, I can&#x27;t get a sharp edge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried whittling it with a sharp knife and that also results in breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other brands have held up with sharp points these will not!  </li>
            <li> I bought this pencil just a few days ago and it&#x27;s almost gone already due to all the sharpening and breaking.</li>
            <li> The previous reviewer was maybe not wetting the tip per instructions.  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this type of product for several years.  </li>
            <li> I tried this by Sally Hansen and it is a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> A pencil a week is a little too expensive.  </li>
            <li> but after several, a bad product.</li>
            <li> This is not a good value.</li>
            <li> Trying to get a dull tip all the way to the base of your nail is frustrating and pretty much impossible.</li>
            <li> but it is poor quality</li>
            <li> Broken on the inside and falls apart when sharpening.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll have to be buying one every week..very sad about this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it looks like Revlon has discontinued their version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I was sorry to see my walgreens stopped carrying these!</li>
            <li> Once a bad pencil</li>
            <li> Product has become crap.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> This shipment was terrible and not usable.</li>

            <li> I like to buy several white pencils at a time.  I am very disappointed in this product.  No matter how carefully I sharpen the pencil it crumbles.  I can&#x27;t get it to sharpen into a point.  I threw away three in a row after the first attempt to sharpen it.  I tried hand sharpening and an electric sharpener and neither works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Pencil was shorter than expected.  The lead breaks easily.  It performs wonderfully.  My nails appear to have had a French manicure.  I have been unable to find this type of product for several years.  The big &#x27;stores&#x27; just don&#x27;t carry it any more.  Glad to find it, even though it was rather pricy.  Later I visited a local salon warehouse store and found a white pencil that was twice as long and half the price.  Guess where I&#x27;ll go to get my next one.</li>
            <li> I was sorry to see my walgreens stopped carrying these! My nails get compliments they are so white.  The previous reviewer was maybe not wetting the tip per instructions.  That allows you to gently glide the pencil under the nails so the tip doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using nail white pencils for the past 15 years just to even out the line between my nail plate and free edge.  They work wonderfully if you sharpen them and wet juuuust the tip in a drop of water.  It does wash off after several handwashings, but as needed reapplication is quick and easy!  This, along with a fresh filing and a coat of clear, makes my nails look acrylic-perfect without the damage!!</li>
            <li> The pencil broke the first time I attempted to use it. It is smaller than others I have purchased in the past. This is not a good value.</li>
            <li> this product i really wanted but it is poor quality it dissolves very quickly and you have to resharpen it constantly. It should be a harder compound to last longer. you&#x27;ll have to be buying one every week..very sad about this</li>
            <li> I really liked this pencil for the first usage. It worked fantastic! Since then, however, I can&#x27;t get a sharp edge. Every time I carefully sharpen it, the tip breaks off before I can even use it. Trying to get a dull tip all the way to the base of your nail is frustrating and pretty much impossible. I bought this pencil just a few days ago and it&#x27;s almost gone already due to all the sharpening and breaking. I&#x27;ve even tried whittling it with a sharp knife and that also results in breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere, because I love the concept and the results...just not this particular brand.</li>
            <li> Purchased several at one time and not one will hold a point.  Sharpen and break . . . sharpen and break. No matter how easy you are they break.  A pencil a week is a little too expensive.  Other brands have held up with sharp points these will not!  Once a bad pencil but after several, a bad product.</li>
            <li> I use the plastic cap....great for cleaning under the nail.</li>
            <li> It always works and makes my nails look so healthy and white.  I plan on using this product forever,really, I really will</li>
            <li> In the past 20 years I have always used this product right out of the shower.  My nail tips are moist and I have never had a problem with the tips breaking.  You will use more product but your nails will look beautiful!</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning under your fingernails without damaging the nail.....my Mom always used these and I was excited to find them!</li>
            <li> I have ordered (on purpose) this pencil on three separate occasions.  No matter how carefully I sharpen it and apply it to nails, the pencil reduces to talc and does not dutifully do one nail well.  I will not order a fourth!</li>
            <li> If you have been looking for the Revlon nail whitening pencil, do not buy the Sally Hansen version.  It doesn&#x27;t sharpen well; it breaks off every time I get it to a point sharp enough to work. Very frustrating. Unfortunately, it looks like Revlon has discontinued their version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do have good news:  I took a chance and ordered the \\&quot;Flowery\\&quot; brand from Amazon, and it is harder material and easy to sharpen, works just like the Revlon and seems like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- I&#x27;m logged in under my husband&#x27;s account! He does not whiten his nails. :-)</li>
            <li> I was shocked and very disappointed with this product. I have used these pencils for many years. They always worked well. This shipment was terrible and not usable. The tips break off, they can not be sharpened and they are junk. A total waste of my time and of course money. Product has become crap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my nails, so white pencil is the only way to perk up my nail tips. This product works just great.</li>
            <li> I received this item in good time but it wase defective.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I tried to sharpen the pencil it fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;NOT GOOD&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Broken on the inside and falls apart when sharpening.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of this pencil, love the look of clean white natural nails, but this is not the product to get that look. When I got it, I used it under 2 nails and the tip broke off. Got out a pencil sharpener, sharpened another point out, and used it on another nail. Went to do the next nail, the point broke off again. sharpened it more, the point broke off again. Tried to sharpen it with a knife, and it worked for another nail till the point broke off. This was after wetting just the very tip of it, and I also tried to get it real wet to see if that worked. So now I&#x27;ve got 4 fingers on my left hand nice and white, and the rest of them I&#x27;m not going to bother, it&#x27;s not worth the frustration, and after sharpening it over and over just to get a point, it is now only about 2 inches long. I&#x27;d love to know if there are other products out there that work better and achieve the same result, but this is not worth the money. I wouldn&#x27;t have even paid a dollar if I&#x27;d know it was gonna be this much of a hassle and waste of time!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product for the angled other side, that not only pushes cuticles, but, is the best product that I have found to clean under your nails!&lt;br /&gt;The pencil whitener is crumbly, but, everyone that uses this to clean their nails and push back cuticles loves it!  I don&#x27;t know if this product is still being produced, though.  Fortunately, I bought a bunch of them, and use it all the time.  So do all of my friends and family!&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a 5 star, if only the white pencil were stronger and did not break so easily.  Yet, I use the other side CONSTANTLY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buffing my nails for more than fifty years.  I&#x27;m allergic to nail polish.  I&#x27;ve used other brands of white nail pencils, but Walgreen&#x27;s stopped carrying Revlon.  I tried this by Sally Hansen and it is a big disappointment.  I&#x27;ve just sharpened the pencil four times and it broke every time I tried to use it.  I won&#x27;t but this item again.</li>
