    <ol>
            <li>They both smell wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Best conditioner my wife ever used.</li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>It is great that I can purchase through Amazon, though -</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is that it&#x27;s fabulous for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and bought at th salon and love it.</li>
            <li>My beauty salon doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells and conditions my hair.</li>
            <li>I really love everything about this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I luv it! :)</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair!  </li>
            <li>great, helped my hair to be soft and shining</li>
            <li>hair has never been more conditioned or soft, however it&#x27;s very light and leaves a nice shiny coating on my hair.</li>
            <li>It was suggested because it is a sulphate &amp; sodium chloride free line.</li>
            <li>They are both absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic conditioner but is lightweight</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect if one&#x27;s hair can&#x27;t handle a heavy product.  </li>
            <li>It does a fabulous job conditioning though.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick fix for damaged hait</li>
            <li>is my new favorite line for shampoo &amp; conditioner!</li>
            <li>LOVE this conditioner so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see my hair after having this on all night (under a shower cap).</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel sooo soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing and all natural</li>
            <li>However, I love this product normally.  </li>
            <li>The scent is great and it is a rich and creamy consistancy which allows you to use less product!</li>
            <li>Love this product -- doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and gives it a nice conditioning.</li>
            <li>Aquage Biomega Moisture Conditioner works so well to moisten and calm my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t show up in more suggestions for damaged/bleached/chemically processed hair.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s super important to use products w/o sulfates and I live in AZ</li>
            <li>This one has just the right balance of floral as well as herbal notes that don&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this deep conditioning mask and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I am always looking for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; mask, but this seems pretty close.  </li>
            <li>I have long straight hair that gets tangled easily without the right products.</li>
            <li>so the UV protectant is also very helpful.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone that wants silky, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner but this tub dried my hair out(??)</li>
            <li>In fact, with my newly whitened hair, I have used it twice</li>
            <li>The results I got after using this product only one time, absolutely blew me away!  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Works great on my long, thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>We love it because it makes our hair very soft and silky, and only a few pumps does the trick!</li>
            <li>Its the only thing that makes a huge difference in my hair and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Regardless of how much I apply, this conditioner seems to do the total opposite of what it should.</li>
            <li>While there was no physical damage to the item, it leaked more than half of the contents over the other two items in the shipment.  </li>
            <li>This was too thin, although it&#x27;s better than nothing...  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is fine, but the packaging is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough there was no product seal, and the only thing holding the cap on was a clear piece of packing tape.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this conditioner since I got my first Brazilian Blowout a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, course, unruly, naturally curly hair that&#x27;s been colored, highlighted &amp; chemically straightened.</li>
            <li>This product makes my curly dry hair soft and manageable.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My daughter and I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is the only conditioner that allows me to get a brush through my hair when it is wet.</li>

            <li> Softens hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It smoothes and calms my hair and cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells heavenly and is so luxurious without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> Previous stylist introduced to me.  </li>
            <li> but I can find it for $14 less in town...</li>

            <li> The conditioner is fine, but the packaging is ridiculous. It&#x27;s almost a liquid, but it&#x27;s in a jar. I could imagine squirting this out of a bottle, but you have to sort of try to scoop it out of the jar while it&#x27;s draining out between your fingers. Just silly packaging.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this line after receiving a Keratin Treatment. It was suggested because it is a sulphate &amp; sodium chloride free line. I purchased the moisture shampoo &amp; the moisture conditoner. They are both absolutely fabulous. I have never had a shampoo &amp; conditioner leave my curly, thick, frizzy hair so soft! They both smell wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite line for shampoo &amp; conditioner!</li>
            <li> Wife exclusively uses this shampoo and rinse line.</li>
            <li> Love this product -- doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and gives it a nice conditioning.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this product for a long time. We love it because it makes our hair very soft and silky, and only a few pumps does the trick!</li>
            <li> LOVE this conditioner so much! It makes your hair feel sooo soft and healthy! I would buy again for sure. Love!</li>
            <li> I find this conditioner completely terrible, especially for the price. I have long straight hair that gets tangled easily without the right products. This conditioner not only does nothing for the tangles, but it also leaves my hair feeling grimy and looking greasy the moment it&#x27;s dry from the shower. I&#x27;ve tried using a little, and I&#x27;ve tried using a lot. Regardless of how much I apply, this conditioner seems to do the total opposite of what it should.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, course, unruly, naturally curly hair that&#x27;s been colored, highlighted &amp; chemically straightened. The results I got after using this product only one time, absolutely blew me away!  My hair &amp; I have never been happier!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner since I got my first Brazilian Blowout a few years ago. It is sulfate free. This product is the only conditioner that allows me to get a brush through my hair when it is wet. The scent is great and it is a rich and creamy consistancy which allows you to use less product! Works great on my long, thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is that it&#x27;s fabulous for fine hair.  It&#x27;s a fantastic conditioner but is lightweight so it&#x27;s perfect if one&#x27;s hair can&#x27;t handle a heavy product.  It does a fabulous job conditioning though.</li>
            <li> Daughter has been using this product for years, Although this actual container of conditioner is much more thin and runny than previous times we have ordered it.</li>
            <li> I have used for a long time.  Previous stylist introduced to me.  Great for natural hair!  Moisturizers without weighing hair down.  Great product... If you haven&#x27;t tried... U should.  this is one you will use again and again...</li>
            <li> This arrived poorly packed, unsealed, and leaking. I love this conditioner but this tub dried my hair out(??) I stopped using it and bought at th salon and love it. I am wondering if this was the &amp;#34;real McCoy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Softens hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Aquage Biomega Moisture Conditioner works so well to moisten and calm my hair.  I am caucasion and have thick, long hair that is course with a lot of body. Without this product on my hair I do not have the control I need. It smoothes and calms my hair and cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li> Wife, the one who insists on it, says it lasts longer than the liquid version.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner my wife ever used. She has long hair but all she needs if a dime sized amount and her hair is like silk.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this conditioner or any of the products in the Biomega line to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never been more conditioned or soft, however it&#x27;s very light and leaves a nice shiny coating on my hair. I use the shampoo, this conditioner and the leave in.  I dye my hair red so it&#x27;s super important to use products w/o sulfates and I live in AZ so the UV protectant is also very helpful.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product it&#x27;s amazing and all natural but I can find it for $14 less in town...</li>
            <li> While there was no physical damage to the item, it leaked more than half of the contents over the other two items in the shipment.  Oddly enough there was no product seal, and the only thing holding the cap on was a clear piece of packing tape.  Probably one of the worsts purchases I have made from Amazon.  However, I love this product normally.  Its the only thing that makes a huge difference in my hair and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wrong conditioner :(  I should have ordered the intensive conditioner.  This was too thin, although it&#x27;s better than nothing...  It is great that I can purchase through Amazon, though - My beauty salon doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and conditions my hair. Would recommend to anyone that wants silky, shiny hair. Great product</li>
            <li> Easy and quick fix for damaged hait</li>
            <li> great, helped my hair to be soft and shining</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells heavenly and is so luxurious without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> This product makes my curly dry hair soft and manageable.  Do not have yo use a lot either!&lt;br /&gt;Good value.</li>
            <li> I really love everything about this conditioner. I don&#x27;t like hair products that smell fruity. This one has just the right balance of floral as well as herbal notes that don&#x27;t overpower. It goes on nicely and a little goes a long way. I am asian with very long hair and have been using this product for a few years now after using a product with silicone and prefer this one hands down. Just beware that when you order this product online, some unscrupulous sellers seem to dilute the product, even the shampoo by the same name.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this deep conditioning mask and I&amp;#34;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t show up in more suggestions for damaged/bleached/chemically processed hair.  In fact, with my newly whitened hair, I have used it twice and It feels luxurious.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I am always looking for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; mask, but this seems pretty close.  I just used it after a two step protein treatment.  I&#x27;m excited to see my hair after having this on all night (under a shower cap).</li>
            <li> I have tried this Biomega product before. I highly recommend it.  It leaves ur hair smoorhly!  I luv it! :)</li>
            <li> I meant to purchase the &amp;#34;Intensive Care&amp;#34;, not moisture.  I love it!</li>
