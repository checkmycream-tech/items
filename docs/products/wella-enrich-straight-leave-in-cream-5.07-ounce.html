            <li>This stuff is wonderful - with the big sexy hair argan oil and this - my hair is lush and shiny and smooth. AHHhhhhh</li>

            <li>Works exactly as described!</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, is lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair harder/take longer to blow dry.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light feeling cream, not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, smooth, and silky feeling.  </li>
            <li>First time trying this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before allowing my hair to dry naturally, and the results were AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Used it on a very humid day and my hair did not frizz.  </li>
            <li>I Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Love other Wella products and this did not disappoint me.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, dry hair that goes nuts when humidity is involved.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product and it has made me want to buy and try other Wella Enrich products!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, manageable and straight without the use of a hair iron.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair that does its own thing in humid weather.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out smooth and soft and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>smell is also too strong for me, the typical salon smell.</li>
            <li>Also made my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and coarse, and with this just a little bit it smoothes out to salon perfect!</li>
            <li>If you use too much accidentally, your hair gets gross feeling.</li>
            <li>This cream solves some serious problems, as it leaves my hair soft, smooth, and helps my blowout sleekness last for days!!!</li>
            <li>Frustrating, right!?!</li>
            <li>When I just want to let my hair dry naturally</li>

            <li> Frustrating, right!?!</li>
            <li> When I just want to let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> I use it after I shampoo and towel dry my hair, and only from the middle of my head to  the ends of my hair, not at the crown, like he suggested.  </li>
            <li> The benefits last until the next wash &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> Only product that helps control curly hair even when it gets long.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair, and I alternate between wearing it curly and blow drying it straight.</li>
            <li> when I use this it takes a lot longer to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I can flat iron my hair without using any other product, and my ends don&#x27;t look split anymore.  </li>
            <li> My hair can look and feel dry less than 24 after washing, conditioning, and a blow dry.</li>
            <li> Be careful</li>
            <li> It also gives hair texture and does not way it down.</li>
            <li> It does not do straighten at all, instead it makes my hair appear much less in volume and the hair is still curvy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, either.</li>
            <li> but a small amount will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Was not sure is an orignal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; type of product, but I still like it a lot.</li>
            <li> My type of hair does well with this conditioner,  having dry and wavy hair it won&#x27;t weigh my hair down to a oil dirty look.</li>
            <li> I never liked spending money on hair products, but my hair stylist used this cream on my hair and I have been hooked ever since.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, though; and</li>
            <li> So was not happy.</li>
            <li> I am addicted!</li>

            <li> I always get compliments on my hair when I use this cream. I have very thick hair, though; and it when I use this it takes a lot longer to blow dry my hair. If you use too much accidentally, your hair gets gross feeling. Be careful</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair, and I alternate between wearing it curly and blow drying it straight. My hair dresser uses this product in my hair the last two times when she&#x27;s blown my hair out and it works great! My hair comes out smooth and soft and it lasts a long time! So glad I found it on Amazon, so I can try it at home!!</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this cream on my hair every month, so I decided to try it myself.  It&#x27;s a light feeling cream, not heavy or oily. I have medium length hair (to my shoulders).  I use it after I shampoo and towel dry my hair, and only from the middle of my head to  the ends of my hair, not at the crown, like he suggested.  My hair is soft, smooth, and silky feeling.  I can flat iron my hair without using any other product, and my ends don&#x27;t look split anymore.  I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Great hair product! Smells divine. I have the tendency to use too much because the texture is so nice and it smells so good but a small amount will do the trick. Hair stays silky for days! Love it!</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I never liked spending money on hair products, but my hair stylist used this cream on my hair and I have been hooked ever since.  I have thick hair that does its own thing in humid weather.  This is the only hair product I use to keep it under control. It leaves my hair soft, manageable and straight without the use of a hair iron.  I love the smell of the product and it has made me want to buy and try other Wella Enrich products!</li>
            <li> I am addicted! LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! Worth every penny! My hair is thick and coarse, and with this just a little bit it smoothes out to salon perfect!</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping ~ good purchase, THX!&lt;br /&gt;suggestion:  I don&#x27;t like the tape over the lid because it doesn&#x27;t come off and the plastic stays sticky</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in straightener. It smooths and helps fly always. It also gives hair texture and does not way it down.</li>
            <li> Bottle was sealed by duct tape. So was not happy. Was not sure is an orignal. Would not recommend. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> Good product.  Fast delivery</li>
            <li> it gets rid of my frizz.  I like it very much</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described! I buy numerous tubes at a time.</li>
            <li> My type of hair does well with this conditioner,  having dry and wavy hair it won&#x27;t weigh my hair down to a oil dirty look. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product.  Love other Wella products and this did not disappoint me.  Used it on a very humid day and my hair did not frizz.  Also made my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> good for humid weather!!!</li>
            <li> just love it. It smooths my &amp;#34;bushy&amp;#34; hair visibly and makes styling easier.</li>
            <li> Only product that helps control curly hair even when it gets long. Does not look or feel like gel - so not &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look/feel</li>
            <li> I love the texture and smell of this product and I would recommend it to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cream - it makes my hair look healthy and blows out well!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful - with the big sexy hair argan oil and this - my hair is lush and shiny and smooth. AHHhhhhh</li>
            <li> Love these products !! This is the second time ordering great price !! Would recommend strongly to anyone who love salon products</li>

            <li> I Really like this product. Great for curly ethnic hair. Softens and leaves manageable.I will buy again, you should too!</li>
            <li> It does not do straighten at all, instead it makes my hair appear much less in volume and the hair is still curvy.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also too strong for me, the typical salon smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great leave in conditioner for curly/wavy hair. When I just want to let my hair dry naturally I spray leave in conditioner and use some of the Wella leave in cream and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I use the entire Wella Enrich line, and this is great. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; type of product, but I still like it a lot. As with the rest of the line, it smells great!</li>
