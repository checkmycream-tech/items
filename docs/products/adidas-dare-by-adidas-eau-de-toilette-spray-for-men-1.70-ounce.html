            <li>my buddy who bought $90 spray doesn&#x27;t get nearly as many comments as I do with this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff &amp; am so glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is perfect for me as a personal trainer.  </li>
            <li>It had a very nice smell to it, kind of a sweet masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this, my dad bought me one of these when I was really young</li>
            <li>First off I didn&#x27;t receive the product I received the Adidas Dare two piece set which would have been nice because I got more than I ordered.</li>
            <li>I was pretty pleased with Adidas Dare!  </li>
            <li>with one on one training, this is extremely important.</li>
            <li>Smells cheap just like it&#x27;s price</li>

            <li>For those of you who don&#x27;t want to use your $90 colognes everyday but have a nice professional smell, this is it.</li>
            <li>You are practically getting a whole other bottle for free when you get this here compared to the bottle you get if purchased at Wally World.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong either, like other cheaper cologne that make you smell like the boy&#x27;s locker room in high school.</li>
            <li>I own several much more expensive colognes and yet Adidas Dare is my go-to.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite everyday scents.</li>
            <li>This product was as I expected it to be, as in past I did use a Body Deo Spray from Adidas and I was very satisfied with it</li>

            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the smell didn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>This is the larger bottle and you get it for very nearly the same price as the smaller bottle.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this, my dad bought me one of these when I was really young and I could never find it in stores. Amazon saved me with this, I will be buying another one soon.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend. Then I got one for my room for when he is away, so I can smell him. Best Decision of my life. The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this smell and so do all the woman at my job lol. Cant beat the price and the smell last a while also.</li>
            <li> I looove this colgne for my husband!!. Bought it a few years ago, and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere since then, until I decided to check amazon, and there it was. Price was awesome, Was afraid it would of been old and out of date, but instead it was packaged beautifully, new and perect!! Thanks</li>
            <li> My Son loves this product and I was able to save money by ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;A win-win for both of us...</li>
            <li> The Adidas Dare eau-de-toillette cologne was a gift for my husband for father&#x27;s day and he loves it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great smelling in an easy to spray bottle.  Smells like a lot of other Adidas, if you like the fruity smell Adidas has then Dare will not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this order.</li>
            <li> excellent product, thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff for years.  It smells amazing and I&#x27;m always getting compliments.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for over 5 years now and I love it. Not to mention my girlfriend loves it too. It&#x27;s not too strong either, like other cheaper cologne that make you smell like the boy&#x27;s locker room in high school.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Grandson for a very good price. Thought it might be a knock off but its wasn&#x27;t. It was the same quality you would get at the department stores</li>
            <li> elegi esta calificiacion porque el producto es muy buena el envio es rapido y es facil para la compra, se los recomiendo</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne for that special person.</li>
            <li> I never ordered this product and never received this product</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my son for years and he still loves it. He&#x27;s 19. Girls compliment him all the time and think it&#x27;s a much more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Dare is definitely worth the money. Talk about Bang for your buck. I have people commenting on how good I smell. my buddy who bought $90 spray doesn&#x27;t get nearly as many comments as I do with this. Love it! Been buying it since freshmen year in HS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a little bit skeptical because of the cologne scams. I buy this cologne on a monthly basis in NY at rite aid or Walgreens for $30 and it&#x27;s only the 1oz bottle. So I was amazed this was the same brand everything&#x27;s the same except the price is 1/4 of retail and it&#x27;s 2x the size. That&#x27;s why I bought 2. So thank you for an amazing deal!!! I&#x27;ll defiantly be a returning customer!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, As shown!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon PRIME rocks!!&lt;br /&gt;Gift ....</li>
            <li> Great smell! Really like this one!</li>
            <li> This product was as I expected it to be, as in past I did use a Body Deo Spray from Adidas and I was very satisfied with it and so I ordered more but in different brands and or categories.This one here is a Good Product.</li>
            <li> This was a great gift for my friend. He loves it and it smells absolutely amazing. My friend loves it. It came on time and everything.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff &amp; am so glad I found it on here. You are practically getting a whole other bottle for free when you get this here compared to the bottle you get if purchased at Wally World. I have been buying these bottles from Amazon since November 2012 &amp; have been a happy camper ever since.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is perfect for me as a personal trainer.  Not overpowering, and really pleasant smell.  with one on one training, this is extremely important.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say much regarding this product as was given to someone for Christmas.  I assume they like the fragrance</li>
            <li> One of my favorite everyday scents.</li>
            <li> First off I didn&#x27;t receive the product I received the Adidas Dare two piece set which would have been nice because I got more than I ordered. But, there was a leak in the bottle so I got an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle my son has used. He specifically requested the DARE.  I think it is perfect for use before going to the golf club on the weekend.</li>
            <li> Smells cheap just like it&#x27;s price</li>
            <li> This cologne smells sooooo good!!! My BF would only wear Curve until I bought this....smells AMAZING! Def a good purchase and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> do not waste your time with adidas dare. i brought it to wear after a workout, and it last all of 5 mins. pretty bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this when it was $11.83! Smells great and lasts all day. Arrived early than expected also. This deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I own several much more expensive colognes and yet Adidas Dare is my go-to. Great scent at a great value. My girlfriend loves it too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again..... I got wrong product..... . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,  VENDIDO TAL COMO DESCRIBE EN LA WEB DE AMAZON , RECOMENDADO ESPECIALMENTE PARA QUIENES DESEEN DARSE UN REGALO Y AHORRAR AL MISMO TIEMPO</li>
