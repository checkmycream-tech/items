            <li>Love this cologne!</li>
            <li>Will be buying more soon!</li>
            <li>Smell&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>and he can&#x27;t stop spraying it on him, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t brag about it enough,a one of a kind smell</li>
            <li>Love love love this scent!</li>
            <li>After reading great reviews about people getting positive compliments all the time, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>But i like the original very sexy from VS better.</li>
            <li>Better priced here than at the store.</li>
            <li>the girls love it.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>So fresh &amp; sexy</li>
            <li>Worth it for sure.</li>
            <li>Stays on for 4hrs and has a light fragrance to it .</li>
            <li>Also, I would recommend original Curve for men.</li>
            <li>Type of cologne you wear to fancy dinners, weddings, and special occasions.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;You will absolutely be complimented when you choose this as your scent of the day : )</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>It arrived extremely quick and had no issues.</li>
            <li>Recieved it today shipped very fast packaged right but not sold on the smell kind of loud then disappears as the day goes on</li>
            <li>and I have to say its well worth the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, citrus/floral but pleasant to all, not overwhelming like Abercrombie type colognes.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and long lasting,&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Just be aware that itbdoesnfade kind of quickly and becomes more subtle than anything.</li>
            <li>For someone like me who is allergic to heavy fragrances, this one is almost a good choice.</li>
            <li>I was pretty certain</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying any next cologne purchase in a store, even if it costs 20-30% more, for authenticity, unless you really know the dealer or source.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty light and clings along for few hours, this is an everyday wear for those who like to smell good at professional environment.</li>
            <li>Surprised my boyfriend with this</li>
            <li>It can be a everyday cologne or a special occasion</li>
            <li>It has what starts as a nice smell but then finishes a little different then expected.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, that may be a nice smell to some demographics, but</li>

            <li> Yes the cologne has met my expectation my boyfriend enjoys the cologne</li>
            <li> Recieved it today shipped very fast packaged right but not sold on the smell kind of loud then disappears as the day goes on that&#x27;s the reason four 3 stars .</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent! So fresh &amp; sexy&lt;br /&gt;You will absolutely be complimented when you choose this as your scent of the day : )</li>
            <li> Great product great delivery</li>
            <li> Type of cologne you wear to fancy dinners, weddings, and special occasions. Women&#x27;s mouth salivate when they catch a whiff, *scoff* don&#x27;t get my started what it does to their hormones. Just get it.. trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It won&#x27;t do it all for you, you&#x27;ll have to bring it home with charm and charisma.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! Bought it for my boyfriend and he loves it too.</li>
            <li> Surprised my boyfriend with this and he can&#x27;t stop spraying it on him, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> My son loves this. I was pretty certain I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with Victoria Secret so I gave it a shot. Worth it for sure. ( I think it smells great too)</li>
            <li> I used it for couple weeks and kept in my office until somebody stole it :I  The smell is pretty light and clings along for few hours, this is an everyday wear for those who like to smell good at professional environment. For someone like me who is allergic to heavy fragrances, this one is almost a good choice. But i like the original very sexy from VS better.</li>
            <li> Not a time goes by when i wear this that I dont get an attractive woman saying that I smell yummy.</li>
            <li> Bought in store . Never had a bad complement from any woman or man. Stays on for 4hrs and has a light fragrance to it . Will be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> It has what starts as a nice smell but then finishes a little different then expected. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not great either.    After reading great reviews about people getting positive compliments all the time, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. In the few times I&#x27;ve worn it, I received no compliments, just a comment how someone thought it smelled like Abercrombie in the room. I knew they referring to me because I recently put on this cologne. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, that may be a nice smell to some demographics, but certainly not the smell I&#x27;m going for. And now I can see what they meant after paying close attention to ththe smell.     I recommend the original Very Sexy the best and should have stuck with that. I used to get compliments from it but wanted to try something different. Also, I would recommend original Curve for men. Similar in that&#x27;s it&#x27;s light, citrus/floral but pleasant to all, not overwhelming like Abercrombie type colognes. I feel this smelled different in the store too. I would highly recommend buying any next cologne purchase in a store, even if it costs 20-30% more, for authenticity, unless you really know the dealer or source.</li>
            <li> I have the very sexy for him 2 and I loved it so when my friends recommend This one to me I had to try it and I have to say its well worth the price. It can be a everyday cologne or a special occasion Cologne ether way its a great product</li>
