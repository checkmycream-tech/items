            <li>Really nice spring time color.</li>

            <li>It looks kind of sparkly in the bottle</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this color.  </li>
            <li>I really love bikini so teeny.</li>
            <li>I have used this nail polish before and it is my favorite of all time.</li>
            <li>the last time I used this nail polish it was silky and went on flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love the color, but with Essie, as always, formulation is hit and miss.</li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>and I got so many compliments...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on these two colors.</li>
            <li>love this color for the spring and summer.</li>
            <li>Perfect for summer with just a tiny hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this polish.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy it anyway, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is a bit darker than what the photo shows, but I still really love it.  </li>
            <li>Favorite polish color for Summer</li>
            <li>but as I&#x27;m always on the look out for a bargain, decided to try Amazon. :)</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Dry time isn&#x27;t the best though.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Essie nail polish and have many bottles.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a pastel lavender or a light periwinkle color that I think is adorable.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty nice glossy or with a matte top coat.</li>
            <li>Quick &amp; easy!</li>
            <li>and it chips easily</li>
            <li>I got lots of compliments on it as well, chips kinf of easily tho, but I feel like all nail polish does</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful periwinkle blue, but streaky beyond belief.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful color</li>
            <li>Takes more than one coat to achieve the color, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>For obvious reasons, it&#x27;s gorgeous in the summer, but even in the winter, it&#x27;s refreshing and cool, like a periwinkle version of mint.</li>
            <li>I wear polish all the time and can apply my own polish with very professional results.  </li>
            <li>This color looks amazing with a tan or on ladies with a natural tan/deep complexion!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen such a gorgeous summer color beforeâ€¦.</li>
            <li>Have used this color before in nail salons, and loved it, and the above was not an issue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous periwinkle blue with a hint of white/silver shimmer.</li>
            <li>So Teeny needed 2 coats but it is so gorgeous and goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry tacky like a lot of 2 dollar nail polishes do.</li>
            <li>The color goes on smooth and the polish itself is just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>even so it doesn&#x27;t clump, does not chip easily, looks exactly like the color in the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>tip - if you want the color to appear brighter or more neon, wear a layer of opaque white (I use OPI Alpine Snow) underneath :)</li>
            <li>I love love love how this color contrasts against my pale skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this color, but I figured I&#x27;d try something new anyways.  </li>
            <li>Item is exactly as described!</li>
            <li>This will make my chipped manicures much easier to fix Thank you!!</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and used it right away</li>
            <li>When this arrived the top looked like the old packaging.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a fun spring/summer shade, and cheaper than in stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a really fun pedi</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast as well!</li>
            <li>It dried super fast and has a nice, smooth finish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, this one can go on my toes and it looks fine there, far away from criticism and critique.</li>
            <li>I really love this shade of blue in the Essie line.  </li>
            <li>such a cute summer-y color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unique and different!</li>
            <li>The color is a little darker than pictured but I still liked the color.  </li>
            <li>Really does remind you of summer, bikinis, and the beach.  </li>
            <li>and it really stands out.</li>
            <li>polish seems to dry super quick as in as you are painting your nails.</li>
            <li>Definitely great that it is half the price than in stores!!!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying anything by Essie; I generally believe that anything higher than $4 for a nail polish is too much, but in this case, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>This color applies really nicely but make sure you have very little on the brush when you because it&#x27;s slightly watery, and too much overflows the nail.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>the formula was fairly clumpy and very difficult to apply smoothly,.</li>
            <li>I finally saw the bottle in person (in a store) and barely noticed the sparkle until I held it up to the fluorescent light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s richer than a pastel and bright enough to be fun, but muted enough to avoid a juvenile cutesy look.</li>
            <li>those will be new bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so when I found them for a few dollars cheaper on Amazon, I was excited!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received SO many compliments because it&#x27;s a unique color without being too over-the-top.</li>
            <li>Not to mention I&#x27;ve noticed after I let it settle for some time, you can now see the bottle is clearly only 1/2 or a third full.</li>
            <li>It definitely dries darker than it appears in the bottle and is more periwinkle than baby blue when its dry.</li>
            <li>From now on I will be steering clear of ordering polish online.</li>
            <li>Either this is a knock off or they sent me a really old bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe an old batch?&lt;br /&gt;I will try some thinner in the hope that it will help application, otherwise this nail varnish will find its way into my bin.</li>
            <li>Shipped early</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 24 hours now and so far, it hasn&#x27;t chipped at all.</li>
            <li>If I use a base coat, 2 coats of Essie polish and a quick dry top coat, such as Seche Vite (my favorite)</li>
            <li>Polish was not thick enough, when applying to the nail it appeared watery, after two layers of application it still appeared streaky.</li>
            <li>The shimmer is VERY subtle and to be honest, I barely noticed it.</li>
            <li>It becomes thick really easily and my brush keeps falling out of the cap.</li>
            <li>Very pretty on pale skin and darker skin alike.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay for doing your toes, but nails are really tough.</li>
            <li>Even with a base and top coat, it chips instantly - pretty much the same day.</li>
            <li>stuff is old and dry....</li>
            <li>There is only a little glitter that you can only notice if you really look at them.</li>

            <li> Like I said before the consistency of Essie is different to OPI, but this one was even different from to other Essie polishes.</li>
            <li> Lasts long without chipping.</li>
            <li> but it goes on clumpy and dry and streaky....</li>
            <li> In the picture above it looks like there is a lot of shimmer in it, which is not true.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it requires several coats to get it even</li>
            <li> Reminds me of fun in the sun even though it is cold outside.</li>
            <li> No matter how carefully I applied it, there was univeness in the surface (not streaky color).</li>
            <li> Came in on time and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Now I am not sure if this is the sellers fault or maybe that is just the standard formula.</li>
            <li> The application is thinner than other Essie polishes I have, and requires 3 coats for maximum opacity.</li>
            <li> It has subtle shimmer in it, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> the formula and brush are simply unusable because the it is so thick and gloopy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the color isn&#x27;t permenant in Essie&#x27;s collection !</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it does take a few coats to get an even application.</li>
            <li> After three coats (one base coat) it looked really cheap on my hands</li>
            <li> Received via mail within just a few days or purchasing.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately I found very gloopy and thick.</li>
            <li> It might benefit from a white base coat, but I don&#x27;t think it really needs it.</li>
            <li> No worth all my hard work.  </li>
            <li> But this past week I went to pull the color out again for summer 2014  and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed because you can&#x27;t really get this color anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I tend to avoid shimmer, so that&#x27;s how subtle it is.</li>
            <li> my manicure lasts at least 10 days!</li>
            <li> it was very hard to find because it was a summer collection, but amazon had it and not a price rip off.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed cause</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a weird one, maybe</li>
            <li> and/or I did a really crap job.</li>

            <li> I saw this color on a friend of mine a while back and have been coveting this polish ever since.  I absolutely love this color.  I often apply white polish under pastel colors to make them pop but I actually prefer the way this looks without white underneath.  It definitely dries darker than it appears in the bottle and is more periwinkle than baby blue when its dry.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect blue/purple color! I can finally stop searching for a color like this! It is more beautiful on the nails than even in the bottle!</li>
            <li> I really love this shade of blue in the Essie line.  It makes my nails look longer.  Really does remind you of summer, bikinis, and the beach.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The color is a little darker than pictured but I still liked the color.  It was nice to wear as a spring/summer color.</li>
            <li> I really love bikini so teeny. it&#x27;s like a pastel lavender or a light periwinkle color that I think is adorable. In the picture above it looks like there is a lot of shimmer in it, which is not true. There is only a little glitter that you can only notice if you really look at them. Bikini So Teeny rocks my socks.</li>
            <li> I have used this nail polish before and it is my favorite of all time. When this arrived the top looked like the old packaging. The color looks the same but it goes on clumpy and dry and streaky.... the last time I used this nail polish it was silky and went on flawlessly. Either this is a knock off or they sent me a really old bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, buy this from Target or CVS.... those will be new bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is old and dry.... I&#x27;ll try to use it up while I can but I will be buying this from the store when this bottle is no longer usable.</li>
            <li> Looooooved this color. It&#x27;s just the greatest light periwinkle that you could ever hope to find!! This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I love all of essie&#x27;s beautiful colors, but this nail polish has been some of the toughest I&#x27;ve used. Even with a base and top coat, it chips instantly - pretty much the same day. It becomes thick really easily and my brush keeps falling out of the cap. I&#x27;m really disappointed because you can&#x27;t really get this color anywhere else. I guess it&#x27;s okay for doing your toes, but nails are really tough.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful periwinkle blue, but streaky beyond belief.  I wear polish all the time and can apply my own polish with very professional results.  This took three coats and streaked even on the third coat.  It evened out with some Seche Vite on top of it, but it&#x27;s still not perfect if I look closely in sunlight.  No worth all my hard work.  I&#x27;ll take it off in a couple of days.  It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> my wife had this color put on at a beauty salon and we both loved it. it was very hard to find because it was a summer collection, but amazon had it and not a price rip off.</li>
            <li> I found Essie nail polihes at my local drug store for $9 so when I found them for a few dollars cheaper on Amazon, I was excited! I ordered Bikini So Teeny and Peach Daquiri. I absolutely love the colors. Bikni So Teeny needed 2 coats but it is so gorgeous and goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry tacky like a lot of 2 dollar nail polishes do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such a gorgeous summer color beforeâ€¦. it&#x27;s like beyond words how great this polish is. It paints on PERFECT, it&#x27;s shiny, and flat / even so it doesn&#x27;t clump, does not chip easily, looks exactly like the color in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly this nail polish could not be more perfect and I think that everyone needs to have it.</li>
            <li> I love the color, but with Essie, as always, formulation is hit and miss. Bikini So Tiny unfortunately I found very gloopy and thick. No matter how carefully I applied it, there was univeness in the surface (not streaky color). Maybe an old batch?&lt;br /&gt;I will try some thinner in the hope that it will help application, otherwise this nail varnish will find its way into my bin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and beautiful brand. Definitely great that it is half the price than in stores!!!! Would surely recommend to anyone who loves beautiful spring colors.</li>
            <li> I love this color and I got so many compliments... Totally a favorite now! It looks pretty nice glossy or with a matte top coat.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail polish last summer since it was always out of stock at my local target. A few weeks later it arrived in the mail, and much to my surprise the formula was fairly clumpy and very difficult to apply smoothly,. Now I am not sure if this is the sellers fault or maybe that is just the standard formula. But this past week I went to pull the color out again for summer 2014  and the formula and brush are simply unusable because the it is so thick and gloopy. Not to mention I&#x27;ve noticed after I let it settle for some time, you can now see the bottle is clearly only 1/2 or a third full. From now on I will be steering clear of ordering polish online.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the color isn&#x27;t permenant in Essie&#x27;s collection ! It&#x27;s the perfect neon pastel shade! Love it!</li>
            <li> Really nice spring time color. I use this with fashion playground as an accent nail or vice versa. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on these two colors.</li>
            <li> love this color for the spring and summer. Very pretty on pale skin and darker skin alike. Shipped early and i have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I had been seeing Bikini So Teeny advertised a lot recently so I decided to try it. I love it! It&#x27;s such a beautiful color and it really stands out. I&#x27;d almost describe it as an &amp;#34;electric periwinkle blue&amp;#34;. Perfect for summer with just a tiny hint of shimmer. As others have noted, it does take a few coats to get an even application. It looked okay after 2, and good after 3. It might benefit from a white base coat, but I don&#x27;t think it really needs it. It dried super fast and has a nice, smooth finish. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 24 hours now and so far, it hasn&#x27;t chipped at all. Super happy about this polish and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it all summer!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover. Needed four coats.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. Color is just the best. I wouldn&#x27;t mind wearing this color all year round.love it</li>
            <li> Polish was not thick enough, when applying to the nail it appeared watery, after two layers of application it still appeared streaky. Have used this color before in nail salons, and loved it, and the above was not an issue.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this polish. My only complaint is that it requires several coats to get it even and it chips easily</li>
            <li> Love the color!  Has just a hint of lavender to it but it&#x27;s a fun spring/summer shade, and cheaper than in stores.  Shipping was super fast as well!</li>
            <li> I initially skipped Bikini So Teeny because I&#x27;m not into glittery, shimmery polish - just not my style. I finally saw the bottle in person (in a store) and barely noticed the sparkle until I held it up to the fluorescent light. I decided to buy it anyway, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received SO many compliments because it&#x27;s a unique color without being too over-the-top. It&#x27;s richer than a pastel and bright enough to be fun, but muted enough to avoid a juvenile cutesy look. The shimmer is VERY subtle and to be honest, I barely noticed it. It&#x27;s also a really fun pedi color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip - if you want the color to appear brighter or more neon, wear a layer of opaque white (I use OPI Alpine Snow) underneath :)</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Essie nail polish and have many bottles. When I saw this color, I didn&#x27;t hesitate! It&#x27;s a gorgeous periwinkle blue with a hint of white/silver shimmer. If I use a base coat, 2 coats of Essie polish and a quick dry top coat, such as Seche Vite (my favorite) my manicure lasts at least 10 days! It may be a \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; brand, but I&#x27;d rather purchase Essie over more expensive brands. This color looks amazing with a tan or on ladies with a natural tan/deep complexion! Loving this one!</li>
            <li> Great color for summer!</li>
            <li> This color is so flirty and perfect for summer. Came in on time and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This color applies really nicely but make sure you have very little on the brush when you because it&#x27;s slightly watery, and too much overflows the nail. It looks kind of sparkly in the bottle but it&#x27;s not sparkly on the nail at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this color, but I figured I&#x27;d try something new anyways.  The color is a bit darker than what the photo shows, but I still really love it.  It&#x27;s an excellent color for any season!  The application is thinner than other Essie polishes I have, and requires 3 coats for maximum opacity. I love this polish with silver glitter gradients or just by itself!</li>
            <li> Favorite polish color for Summer</li>
            <li> such a cute summer-y color. I got lots of compliments on it as well, chips kinf of easily tho, but I feel like all nail polish does</li>
            <li> I found this colour at Target and loved it but as I&#x27;m always on the look out for a bargain, decided to try Amazon. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish seems to dry super quick as in as you are painting your nails. After three coats (one base coat) it looked really cheap on my hands and/or I did a really crap job. I had to do three coats to try and get it even. Like I said before the consistency of Essie is different to OPI, but this one was even different from to other Essie polishes. Maybe I got a weird one, maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this one can go on my toes and it looks fine there, far away from criticism and critique. A little disappointed cause it looked so great to begin with!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. This is my first time buying anything by Essie; I generally believe that anything higher than $4 for a nail polish is too much, but in this case, you get what you pay for. The color goes on smooth and the polish itself is just the right consistency. It only took 2 coats to  achieve the color I wanted. Dry time isn&#x27;t the best though. The color itself is enough to satisfy me. It&#x27;s very unique and different!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome color and I have had lots of  compliments when wearing it.  Reminds me of fun in the sun even though it is cold outside.</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous in the winter or in the summer. For obvious reasons, it&#x27;s gorgeous in the summer, but even in the winter, it&#x27;s refreshing and cool, like a periwinkle version of mint. Lasts long without chipping. Beautiful color, lots of compliments, love this shade.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and used it right away I loved it! I was looking for it everywhere and I finally found it .</li>
            <li> I love love love how this color contrasts against my pale skin. Even my boyfriend said he liked it!  It has subtle shimmer in it, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable. I tend to avoid shimmer, so that&#x27;s how subtle it is. Perfect summer color!!!</li>
            <li> Great color. I have had a lot of compliments on this color. Takes more than one coat to achieve the color, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; easy! Received via mail within just a few days or purchasing.  Item is exactly as described! This will make my chipped manicures much easier to fix Thank you!!</li>
