            <li>And for me the best part is that it clears up blemishes in record time.  </li>
            <li>Was delivered in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>My skin feels good</li>
            <li>Galvanic Spa is really good.</li>
            <li>you will be very glad</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and happy after treatment, so do I.  </li>
            <li>It works even better if you use their skincare with it but any good line of products will do well for you.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s good for money with so many functions in one.     </li>
            <li>Best new toy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually very easy to sign up as customer/distributor with Nu Skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very important, before you buy this product, to meet with a distributor and make sure to have them explain the process and products needed.</li>
            <li>Um-yes that would explain many things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Her skin is brighter and seems to be more tonified.</li>
            <li>And you can be sure the gels are not expired.  </li>
            <li>I even ordered more products on Amazon from Nu Skin to try with this galvanic spa system.  </li>
            <li>I liked the first results after the procedure done through the company as promotion and decided to buy my own.</li>
            <li>Works great so far for me.  </li>
            <li>My mom was the one who showed be a picture of how I looked before and it was quite surprising to see a real difference.  </li>
            <li>It is easy when you look at yourself in the mirror each day to not see any difference, hence the pics.    </li>
            <li>When I declined and asked for the full refund they refused claiming a \\&quot;restocking\\&quot; fee of $35, more than 30%.  </li>
            <li>After 6 sessions, people in my office started telling me that my skin looked \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;, I could see fine lines and wrinkles fading.</li>
            <li>the skin is more softer and looks fresh.</li>
            <li>Moisture mist - fantastic.</li>
            <li>what I eat then I am doing the best that I can slow down the ageing process and look the best I can without face lifts and injecting chemicals into my face.</li>
            <li>It is important to go as written in the handbook and clean the face with their product before.</li>
            <li>I originally bought mine used from a friend who would rather get botox than spend 20 minutes twice a week.    </li>
            <li>It is a good price if it is the Ageloc edition; not so much if it is the older Galvanic Spa II.  </li>
            <li>My face looks narrower more sculpted and generally way better.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure:</li>
            <li>MANY THANKS,  EMMY</li>
            <li>I took close up pics of my face full on and profile and my neck area when I started and just after Christmas I took another set of pics to compare.  </li>
            <li>The puppet lines from the nose are greatly improved or lessened as are all the other lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better to buy direct from the company or through their distributors.  </li>
            <li>If you think you can just use this once or twice to get good results like other reviewers I&#x27;ve read for this product, you have unreasonable expectations.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see my stretch marks fade, but didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference on my face.  </li>
            <li>If you only want a quick fix, then you are better off with Botox or a face lift.    </li>
            <li>The last time I had this much hair pop up on my face was 3 years ago when I had been taking 2 rounds of steroids to get rid of an acute sinus infection.  </li>
            <li>Be consistent.</li>
            <li>This product DOES work and it works GREAT, but you need AT LEAST 4 sessions (2-3 sessions per week) over 2+ weeks before you see any results.</li>
            <li>Then you can enjoy wholesale price and let them direct deliver the product to you home.</li>
            <li>Be aware the seller(s) will accept only an unopened, resale able box for return -  in this case that means NO RETURNS (there is neither picture nor description on the box itself).</li>
            <li>but I an confident that if I use the spa, stay out of the sun as much as possible and continue to look after my body by exercise and</li>
            <li>really well when you use it consistently with the gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t usually pay that much attention to my skin because it is generally in good shape)</li>
            <li>used to have a huge double chin.</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;ve been using this product on me, I have seen a huge improvement on the puckering of the scars and have even gained some extra range of movement</li>
            <li>(thanks hormones).  </li>
            <li>I have tried to look at the picture, but cannot tell if it is the older Galvanic Spa II with Ageloc products included, or if it is the newer Ageloc device as well.  </li>
            <li>High quality creams.  </li>
            <li>I like this product so far and after a couple of treatments only I already feel that my skin got much softer, tender, radiant, visibly fresh and tighter.  </li>
            <li>- although my skin is rather sensitive to change in cosmetics, these products had no negative effect.  </li>
            <li>While my skin may have looked more hydrated than usual</li>
            <li>(bc my skin is FINALLY soft again!)</li>
            <li>5 months ago I was mauled by a large dog which left me nearly fatally wounded and severely scarred.</li>
            <li>leaves skin refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>I bough it from Nu Skin directly and not from the internet.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE AN OLD ONE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t be the only woman who has experienced this bad result, but I think NuSkin must be very careful about not letting this info get around.</li>
            <li>Roughly a month ago my OT tried the spa version on my right arm to help moisturize the scar tissue so that I could gain range of motion and have an easier time moving (the arm was nearly severed and there is scarring attaching my upper and lower arm.)</li>
            <li>it is really hard to use, is not that easy</li>
            <li>I WANTED A GALVANIC SPAS FOR A PROFESSIONAL FACIAL ROOM THATWE HAE IN MY SALON.</li>
            <li>I would get one large one every other month</li>
            <li>This product is not what it claims to be -- first it was very irritating to the skin and for $100 I expected a much better result.</li>
            <li>I tried to complain at the seller first (TommyLovo), then Amazon, it seems to have been just a big waste of time.</li>

            <li> Do buy from an authorized NuSkin distributor if you can as you will get the guarantee and other deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Not just it help me firm my face, I also like the trimming head reduce my dummy fat.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I agreed that there has been at least a 50% reduction in the lines around my eyes (crows feet).  </li>
            <li> and I was shocked because I look younger than my age anyways, just as my dad and his mother.  </li>
            <li> , I was shocked to see that my facial hair had sprouted like I was going through puberty!</li>
            <li> It is expensive but I can see some results on her face after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It was dreadful, and as soon as I stopped using the galvanic the hair stopped growing and has never come back.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately Galvanic II Body Shaping Gel (3.) was NOT a part of the package.</li>
            <li> The Galvanic Spa made a dramatic difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li> I was intrigued and started to use it, but not just for my face, I have horrible stretch marks on my belly after having 3 kids.  </li>
            <li> The customer service department is terrible, the operator refused to give me his  name or allow me to speak to his supervisor.  </li>
            <li> Terrible company, terrible product and worst customer service ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked the first results after the procedure done through the company as promotion and decided to buy my own. It takes some time, but after several uses it actually show results. the skin is more softer and looks fresh. It is important to go as written in the handbook and clean the face with their product before. High quality creams.  No allergies  - although my skin is rather sensitive to change in cosmetics, these products had no negative effect.  Moisture mist - fantastic. leaves skin refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I USED to be a NUSKIN distributor but chose not to be anymore as the business model was not my cup of tea. I will never stop using the products however which is how I got hooked into being a distributor. Not for me. Do buy from an authorized NuSkin distributor if you can as you will get the guarantee and other deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that I want to say that the Galvanic Spa and the follow on products work really well when you use it consistently with the gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way to tell if it is working for you is to take a before photo do half your face as directed and then take an after photo. Do that for a month or so and if you do not see a difference then you have not been following directions. It works even better if you use their skincare with it but any good line of products will do well for you. Be consistent. Use it. you will be very glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a huge double chin. It is all but gone. I used to have jowls, they are all but gone. My face looks narrower more sculpted and generally way better.  Like anything else if you don&#x27;t use it or use it sporadically you will not get the results you desire. When I was a distributor a woman called me to say the thing \\&quot;didn&#x27;t work\\&quot; as it turned out she hadn&#x27;t taken it out of the box. Um-yes that would explain many things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my Galvanic Spa with me to the gym and before I take my shower I give myself a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> If you think you can just use this once or twice to get good results like other reviewers I&#x27;ve read for this product, you have unreasonable expectations. This product DOES work and it works GREAT, but you need AT LEAST 4 sessions (2-3 sessions per week) over 2+ weeks before you see any results. If you only want a quick fix, then you are better off with Botox or a face lift.    After 6 sessions, people in my office started telling me that my skin looked \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;, I could see fine lines and wrinkles fading. I originally bought mine used from a friend who would rather get botox than spend 20 minutes twice a week.    I love this thing. You do need to use it 2x per week for maintenance and if you keep buying the Nuskin gels it can get pricey, but I&#x27;ve also found that the Miracle II (gel, lotion and soap) products work well with this spa and they are cheaper (google it and you will find others who use these with it).</li>
            <li> I was \\&quot;told\\&quot; by a friend that I just had to use this and I was shocked because I look younger than my age anyways, just as my dad and his mother.  I was intrigued and started to use it, but not just for my face, I have horrible stretch marks on my belly after having 3 kids.  I was so excited to see my stretch marks fade, but didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference on my face.  My mom was the one who showed be a picture of how I looked before and it was quite surprising to see a real difference.  It seems almost everyday I receive a compliment on my skin by either people I have known or strangers I just meet.  My skin feels good and now I use it on my teenagers and their breakouts disappear.  Best new toy!</li>
            <li> WAITING FOR ITEM TO BE TAKEN OFF MY CREDIT CARD.  THE GALVANIC SPA WAS FORHOME USE. I WANTED A GALVANIC SPAS FOR A PROFESSIONAL FACIAL ROOM THATWE HAE IN MY SALON. ANYONE CAN BUY THE SPA AND THERE GOES MY BUSINESS. IT IS A LOWER FORM FOR THE PUBLIC.   MANY THANKS,  EMMY</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this item so I gave it 3 stars; a neutral rating.  I don&#x27;t know how else to address my question than here.      Perhaps I am the only one confused.  The title and the product description do not list this as the newer version, the Ageloc Edition Galvanic Spa II System.  However the product details state it is indeed the newer Ageloc edition.  I have tried to contact the seller, but it goes to Amazon fulfillment.  I have tried to look at the picture, but cannot tell if it is the older Galvanic Spa II with Ageloc products included, or if it is the newer Ageloc device as well.  It is a good price if it is the Ageloc edition; not so much if it is the older Galvanic Spa II.  Also, would this be from an authorized distributor?  I want to ensure the warranty is in force.  Thank you for any guidance!</li>
            <li> I used the galvanic spa for 5 weeks, twice a week, as recommended and demonstrated.  While my skin may have looked more hydrated than usual (I don&#x27;t usually pay that much attention to my skin because it is generally in good shape), I was shocked to see that my facial hair had sprouted like I was going through puberty! The last time I had this much hair pop up on my face was 3 years ago when I had been taking 2 rounds of steroids to get rid of an acute sinus infection.  It was dreadful, and as soon as I stopped using the galvanic the hair stopped growing and has never come back.  I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t be the only woman who has experienced this bad result, but I think NuSkin must be very careful about not letting this info get around.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my mom (she is 50). She uses it in the way the vendor recomends it and with the gels of the same brand. She told me she saw results after one month using the system. Her skin is brighter and seems to be more tonified.</li>
            <li> You have to use it twice a day, morning &amp; night to get results and on is a waste of time &amp; money.  After two weeks, I don&#x27;t any difference. I&#x27;m returning the product.</li>
            <li> Galvanic Spa is really good. Not just it help me firm my face, I also like the trimming head reduce my dummy fat.  Now I just start to try the hair head as my hair is getting thinner.  Seems it gives back air to my hair and stronger hair.  So it&#x27;s good for money with so many functions in one.     I bough it from Nu Skin directly and not from the internet.  I think it&#x27;s better to buy direct from the company or through their distributors.  So that you are protected from the refund policy, and 2 years warranty.  And you can be sure the gels are not expired.  It&#x27;s actually very easy to sign up as customer/distributor with Nu Skin.  Then you can enjoy wholesale price and let them direct deliver the product to you home. [...]</li>
            <li> The Galvanic Spa made a dramatic difference in my skin!  And for me the best part is that it clears up blemishes in record time.  I began to get cystic acne in my 40s (thanks hormones).  I would get one large one every other month but it would stay with me for 3 weeks.  The Galvanic spa has made it so what was once a 3 week ordeal is now gone in 2 or 3 days!  [...]</li>
            <li> According to the product description you are supposed to get the following products:  1. Galvanic Spa System II w/Four Heads White   2. 2 boxes Galvanic Facial Gels with ageLOC   3. Galvanic II Body Shaping Gel   4. Galvanic ageLOC DVD   5. Galvanic Spa II Brochure Single   6. Galvanic Instruction Card    Unfortunately Galvanic II Body Shaping Gel (3.) was NOT a part of the package. I tried to complain at the seller first (TommyLovo), then Amazon, it seems to have been just a big waste of time. Be aware the seller(s) will accept only an unopened, resale able box for return -  in this case that means NO RETURNS (there is neither picture nor description on the box itself).</li>
            <li> I order two products of the same, they only shipped one, though they charged for both.    it is really hard to use, is not that easy and then u have to be purchasing the gels to keep using the machine.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Galvanic spa, I used all four viles and followed the directions.  I did not feel or see any difference in my appearance at all.  I called to see if maybe it was defective and they didn&#x27;t give me the time of day, they said there was nothing I could do because it was used.     Pricey mistake on my part.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far and after a couple of treatments only I already feel that my skin got much softer, tender, radiant, visibly fresh and tighter.  My skin feels so smooth and happy after treatment, so do I.  I even ordered more products on Amazon from Nu Skin to try with this galvanic spa system.  Works great so far for me.  Was delivered in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. She swears by it. It is expensive but I can see some results on her face after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am 63 and I bought this product in August and have been using it twice a week since then.  I took close up pics of my face full on and profile and my neck area when I started and just after Christmas I took another set of pics to compare.  It is easy when you look at yourself in the mirror each day to not see any difference, hence the pics.    My husband and I agreed that there has been at least a 50% reduction in the lines around my eyes (crows feet).  The puppet lines from the nose are greatly improved or lessened as are all the other lines around my mouth.  My eyebrows seem lifted and the frown lines are also diminished.    I used the vials that came with the package and then I bought larger sizes of the gels etc from Rankines in Canada.  Google for actual URL. Using the Rankines products means I can actually afford to buy the gels on an ongoing basis.    I am never going to look 25 again but I an confident that if I use the spa, stay out of the sun as much as possible and continue to look after my body by exercise and what I eat then I am doing the best that I can slow down the ageing process and look the best I can without face lifts and injecting chemicals into my face.</li>
            <li> 5 months ago I was mauled by a large dog which left me nearly fatally wounded and severely scarred. Roughly a month ago my OT tried the spa version on my right arm to help moisturize the scar tissue so that I could gain range of motion and have an easier time moving (the arm was nearly severed and there is scarring attaching my upper and lower arm.) Since they&#x27;ve been using this product on me, I have seen a huge improvement on the puckering of the scars and have even gained some extra range of movement (bc my skin is FINALLY soft again!) It is very important, before you buy this product, to meet with a distributor and make sure to have them explain the process and products needed. Skipping steps won&#x27;t allow the product to work....but take it from me....it truly worked a miracle.</li>
            <li> This product is not what it claims to be -- first it was very irritating to the skin and for $100 I expected a much better result. Then they automatically charge your account $100 for the next months product before even receiving it -- I called to cancel and was told they were going to first offer me the \\&quot;family\\&quot; discount of $50 if I would continue purchasing the product,which I think is extremely shady - why don&#x27;t they just offer that in the beginning? When I declined and asked for the full refund they refused claiming a \\&quot;restocking\\&quot; fee of $35, more than 30%.  The customer service department is terrible, the operator refused to give me his  name or allow me to speak to his supervisor.  Terrible company, terrible product and worst customer service ever. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!</li>
            <li> THE ITEM DID NOT WORK PROPERLY SO I RETURNED IT, THEY SENT IT BACK AND I RETURNED IT AGAIN AND ASKED BOT TO BE BILLED I HAVE AN OLD ONE SO I KNEW HOW TO USE IT</li>
