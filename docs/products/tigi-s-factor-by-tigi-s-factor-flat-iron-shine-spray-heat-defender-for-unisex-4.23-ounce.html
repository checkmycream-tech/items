            <li>Great product but research before buying on Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>Received very quickly and was packaged nicely and not damaged upon receipt.</li>
            <li>I still love Tigi products, just not this one.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>although there are better products out there, that does a better job than this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I absolutley Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I Love s-factor.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many things.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for your hair!</li>
            <li>Consistently works well to give your hair a polished finish while protecting from heat, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it...</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve wanted to heat style my hair more without frying it</li>
            <li>Really takes the frizz out of my hair and gives it great shine.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it made my ends shine and look healthy.</li>
            <li>I love all the S factor products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this spray and have been using it for years since it was recommended to me by a hair supply store.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST flat iron spray I have ever purchased!!  </li>
            <li>I try to take it easy on my hair, blow-dry or straighten every couple of weeks at most.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants perfect straight hair ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>the smell is so fantastic and it keeps your hair straight, shiny and smelling amazing!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot to get a good result.  </li>
            <li>I know that Tigi&#x27;s products are typically fantastic and was very excited to try this one.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s protecting from heat as well!</li>
            <li>It does a great job protecting your hair while making sure that your strands lay flat and are as silky and sleek as they would be leaving the salon.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine (but I have a lot of it)</li>
            <li>Quick delivery as well!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it, it makes your hair so smooth, smells great</li>
            <li>So, the bottom line is this: if you want smooth, shiny and manageable hair, this is your product.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair, no matter if I use one light spray, or five.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I have been using on my hair for years and it works great.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and shiny and the damage is practically gone.</li>
            <li>This seller wrapped this very well, these are prone to leaking, but it did not leak!!!  </li>
            <li>This is great to spray on hair before flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Works great for protecting hair from flat iron or curling iron heat damage</li>
            <li>It worked great with a flat iron!</li>
            <li>And what I have discovered is that if a product contains alcohol it will not protect your hair but most certainly will damage it!</li>
            <li>It has special nutrients that help protect your hair when using a flat iron, but it is also great for curling irons.</li>
            <li>It cost alot of money but it is worth  it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase, I&#x27;ll  buy it again!</li>
            <li>I have tried a huge amount of flat iron sprays but from the one&#x27;s I have tried this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Probably not for oily hair, but great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard or greasy wonderful smell as well.</li>
            <li>I apply it to wet hair and either use a flat iron or a paddle brush and blow dryer..makes my frizzy hair so incredibly silky smooth and so straight..can&#x27;t believe how well it works!!</li>
            <li>My stylist friend used it on my hair ten years ago and I fell in love with it, I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>, split ends show up rather quickly with that style.</li>
            <li>Will most definitely recommend to anyone looking for great flat iron protection!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, provides a great shine, and a little goes a along way.</li>
            <li>This product really helps to minimize the split end look, and keeps it silky and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>The price to me is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than most heat protectors because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair wet when you spray it on.  </li>
            <li>Keeps it healthy, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I think the product is worth a try --- I will still experiment w/it.  </li>
            <li>I think this would be a great spray for someone with dark and more coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Even if you are&#x27;t straightening your hair spray it on right after a shower</li>
            <li>I work out very often and I have to straighten my roots almost everyday and this product is the best heat protectant by far!</li>
            <li>a little protection from the sun is always nice!</li>
            <li>The reviews say to be careful about using too much; however, the more I use the better my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I also use this after dry shampooing to give it shine, it makes my hair look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>It is very important to have adequate protection for your hair before using a flat iron, also using this and combing through your hair prevents damage and keeps your hair from getting caught in a flat iron as it makes your hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>when using a hot straightening hair iron, the product helps to prevent from damaging your hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with how great it is compared to salon/beauty stores!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I just spray it into my hands before using any hot tool.</li>
            <li>But keep in mind you don&#x27;t need much to get your frizzy hair under control and shining!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li>My hair was dry and brittle before I switched to a better heat defender product, and since switching, my hair has grown due to far less breakage, and to top it all off, it smells great!</li>
            <li>Love this product for flat ironing.</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite Flat Iron spray!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many hair styling products I have become my own beauty store, it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have found that keeps my hair straight &amp; shiny all day.</li>
            <li>I have fine, blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product as the reviews were stellar.  </li>
            <li>While it does smell fantastic, the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that it gives left my hair looking very greasy.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this spray.</li>
            <li>I use to have really damaged hair and this product really helps</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>U don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>Very timely delivery as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy at the ends.</li>
            <li>fairly straight-</li>
            <li>S factor really tames the frizz and protects my hair when I straighten it..</li>
            <li>so it really seems to be working.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone trying to get stick straight hair</li>
            <li>Gives hair nice sheen and isn&#x27;t heavy at all on the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be more soft and instantly looks healthier!</li>
            <li>when I wanted to repurchase it, I was really lucky to find it on Amazon for only $19!</li>
            <li>I typically use a cheap heat protecting spray that holds and works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>and it does not weigh it down (which most products do) and makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried going cheap with Garnier Fructise (decent product), I&#x27;ve used CHI (decent), and I&#x27;ve tried other designer brands.  </li>
            <li>It also helps make my naturally curly hair super straight when I flat iron it, without this spray I still have waves and bumps.</li>
            <li>then a few more squirts before I straightened my hair.</li>
            <li>I feel like I can&#x27;t live without it now.  </li>
            <li>I live in Minnesota and the winters here</li>
            <li>This flat iron spray not only protects my hair, but keeps it staying smooth in high humidity.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that it adds shine to your hair, which I love because my hair looks dull after I&#x27;ve dried and straightened it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and silky after using it!</li>
            <li>The s factor line is amazing, and for my hair it&#x27;s hard to find something that constantly works.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shinning and soft</li>
            <li>This has totally transformed the way I get ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It was very rainy and humid and my hair STILL looked shiny and sleek like I had left the salon!</li>
            <li>My stylist used it on my hair and this is the cheapest price I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>bob with bangs nearly every day.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Smells good and prevents damage to my hair, which is thin enough as it is.</li>
            <li>how much happier I am when my hair doesn&#x27;t look like a hot mess.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have split ends or very little and my hair is so smooth.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not very heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>If your an african american women with natural hair and you like to wear it straight, you have to use this product.</li>
            <li>Really protects hair from flat irons especially if you use flat irons at high temperature for natural hair.</li>
            <li>It is a little costly, but I have tried pretty much everything else on the market and this is the only one that does the trick.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, coarse  and dry, but I prefer to wear it straight.</li>
            <li>I have thick fine hair.</li>
            <li>I dry my hair first then spray tigi and flat iron it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling softer and shiny but Not greasy, and you don&#x27;t need to use much so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>In the past year, my normally reasonably healthy hair had really begun looking dull and damaged.</li>
            <li>It may be too heavy though for those whose hair isn&#x27;t as dry or coarse so spray lightly.</li>
            <li>I am caucasian and have normal long black hair, however color treated and it made my hair SO shiny and silky and and straight but yet bouncy and have a lot of movement.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I try new flat iron sprays but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>wasnt exactly what I wanted, but I still use it everyday.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and even if I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, it does still work at keeping things smooth and</li>
            <li>If you use a little too much, just spray a little dry shampoo on the area and it will fix you right up!</li>
            <li>It works, I use it before blow dry, and it makes my hair soft, tames the frizzy.</li>
            <li>It does not damage my hair but rather shields it from the heat, while leaving my hair soft and manageable, and will last a long time because one spray is all you need to go through each section of your hair.</li>

            <li> I still love Tigi products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> although there are better products out there, that does a better job than this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I absolutley Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I Love s-factor.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many things.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for your hair!</li>

            <li> and I LOVE it...</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve wanted to heat style my hair more without frying it</li>
            <li> Really takes the frizz out of my hair and gives it great shine.</li>
            <li> I also love the way it made my ends shine and look healthy.</li>
            <li> I love all the S factor products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spray and have been using it for years since it was recommended to me by a hair supply store.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is the BEST flat iron spray I have ever purchased!!  </li>
            <li> I try to take it easy on my hair, blow-dry or straighten every couple of weeks at most.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants perfect straight hair ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> the smell is so fantastic and it keeps your hair straight, shiny and smelling amazing!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot to get a good result.  </li>
            <li> I know that Tigi&#x27;s products are typically fantastic and was very excited to try this one.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s protecting from heat as well!</li>
            <li> It does a great job protecting your hair while making sure that your strands lay flat and are as silky and sleek as they would be leaving the salon.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine (but I have a lot of it)</li>
            <li> Quick delivery as well!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it, it makes your hair so smooth, smells great</li>
            <li> So, the bottom line is this: if you want smooth, shiny and manageable hair, this is your product.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair, no matter if I use one light spray, or five.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I have been using on my hair for years and it works great.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and shiny and the damage is practically gone.</li>
            <li> This seller wrapped this very well, these are prone to leaking, but it did not leak!!!  </li>
            <li> This is great to spray on hair before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Works great for protecting hair from flat iron or curling iron heat damage</li>
            <li> It worked great with a flat iron!</li>
            <li> And what I have discovered is that if a product contains alcohol it will not protect your hair but most certainly will damage it!</li>
            <li> It has special nutrients that help protect your hair when using a flat iron, but it is also great for curling irons.</li>
            <li> It cost alot of money but it is worth  it!</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase, I&#x27;ll  buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have tried a huge amount of flat iron sprays but from the one&#x27;s I have tried this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Probably not for oily hair, but great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard or greasy wonderful smell as well.</li>
            <li> I apply it to wet hair and either use a flat iron or a paddle brush and blow dryer..makes my frizzy hair so incredibly silky smooth and so straight..can&#x27;t believe how well it works!!</li>
            <li> My stylist friend used it on my hair ten years ago and I fell in love with it, I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> , split ends show up rather quickly with that style.</li>
            <li> Will most definitely recommend to anyone looking for great flat iron protection!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, provides a great shine, and a little goes a along way.</li>
            <li> This product really helps to minimize the split end look, and keeps it silky and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> The price to me is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than most heat protectors because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair wet when you spray it on.  </li>
            <li> Keeps it healthy, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think the product is worth a try --- I will still experiment w/it.  </li>
            <li> I think this would be a great spray for someone with dark and more coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Even if you are&#x27;t straightening your hair spray it on right after a shower</li>
            <li> I work out very often and I have to straighten my roots almost everyday and this product is the best heat protectant by far!</li>
            <li> a little protection from the sun is always nice!</li>
            <li> The reviews say to be careful about using too much; however, the more I use the better my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I also use this after dry shampooing to give it shine, it makes my hair look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> It is very important to have adequate protection for your hair before using a flat iron, also using this and combing through your hair prevents damage and keeps your hair from getting caught in a flat iron as it makes your hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> when using a hot straightening hair iron, the product helps to prevent from damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with how great it is compared to salon/beauty stores!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just spray it into my hands before using any hot tool.</li>
            <li> But keep in mind you don&#x27;t need much to get your frizzy hair under control and shining!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and brittle before I switched to a better heat defender product, and since switching, my hair has grown due to far less breakage, and to top it all off, it smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this product for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite Flat Iron spray!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many hair styling products I have become my own beauty store, it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have found that keeps my hair straight &amp; shiny all day.</li>
            <li> I have fine, blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as the reviews were stellar.  </li>
            <li> While it does smell fantastic, the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that it gives left my hair looking very greasy.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray.</li>
            <li> I use to have really damaged hair and this product really helps</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> U don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> Very timely delivery as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy at the ends.</li>
            <li> fairly straight-</li>
            <li> S factor really tames the frizz and protects my hair when I straighten it..</li>
            <li> so it really seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone trying to get stick straight hair</li>
            <li> Gives hair nice sheen and isn&#x27;t heavy at all on the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be more soft and instantly looks healthier!</li>
            <li> when I wanted to repurchase it, I was really lucky to find it on Amazon for only $19!</li>
            <li> I typically use a cheap heat protecting spray that holds and works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> and it does not weigh it down (which most products do) and makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried going cheap with Garnier Fructise (decent product), I&#x27;ve used CHI (decent), and I&#x27;ve tried other designer brands.  </li>
            <li> It also helps make my naturally curly hair super straight when I flat iron it, without this spray I still have waves and bumps.</li>
            <li> then a few more squirts before I straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can&#x27;t live without it now.  </li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and the winters here</li>
            <li> This flat iron spray not only protects my hair, but keeps it staying smooth in high humidity.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that it adds shine to your hair, which I love because my hair looks dull after I&#x27;ve dried and straightened it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves it soft and silky after using it!</li>
            <li> The s factor line is amazing, and for my hair it&#x27;s hard to find something that constantly works.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shinning and soft</li>
            <li> This has totally transformed the way I get ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It was very rainy and humid and my hair STILL looked shiny and sleek like I had left the salon!</li>
            <li> My stylist used it on my hair and this is the cheapest price I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> bob with bangs nearly every day.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Smells good and prevents damage to my hair, which is thin enough as it is.</li>
            <li> how much happier I am when my hair doesn&#x27;t look like a hot mess.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have split ends or very little and my hair is so smooth.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not very heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> If your an african american women with natural hair and you like to wear it straight, you have to use this product.</li>
            <li> Really protects hair from flat irons especially if you use flat irons at high temperature for natural hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little costly, but I have tried pretty much everything else on the market and this is the only one that does the trick.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, coarse  and dry, but I prefer to wear it straight.</li>
            <li> I have thick fine hair.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair first then spray tigi and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling softer and shiny but Not greasy, and you don&#x27;t need to use much so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> In the past year, my normally reasonably healthy hair had really begun looking dull and damaged.</li>
            <li> It may be too heavy though for those whose hair isn&#x27;t as dry or coarse so spray lightly.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian and have normal long black hair, however color treated and it made my hair SO shiny and silky and and straight but yet bouncy and have a lot of movement.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I try new flat iron sprays but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> wasnt exactly what I wanted, but I still use it everyday.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and even if I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, it does still work at keeping things smooth and</li>
            <li> If you use a little too much, just spray a little dry shampoo on the area and it will fix you right up!</li>
            <li> It works, I use it before blow dry, and it makes my hair soft, tames the frizzy.</li>
            <li> It does not damage my hair but rather shields it from the heat, while leaving my hair soft and manageable, and will last a long time because one spray is all you need to go through each section of your hair.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, a lot of movement with my hair, totally eliminates frizz, and protects my hair from flat iron damage.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous flat iron / head guard sprays, and this one beats them all.  </li>
            <li> just know that upon your 1st try you may feel that it&#x27;s heavier than basic silicone flat iron sprays.</li>
            <li> I believe it says to spray each area before using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I also apply it before using flat iron, and it protects my hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> Works so well with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> but I still flat iron.  </li>
            <li> If I am going to flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> I then put Moroccan Oil in it AND spray this on my hair again before I flat iron.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it helps protect my hair from being damaged by my flat iron.</li>
            <li> This product makes it shiny and soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I wash, blow dry, and flat iron</li>
            <li> After I blow dry my hair I put this on before I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually dry, wiry, frizzy and wavy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product on my hair when blow drying or using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I tried using it on wet and dry hair and there was no change.  </li>
            <li> I spray it in my hair when it&#x27;s wet or damp out of the shower, then blow dry.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s very dry and curly).</li>
            <li> It makes my naturally curly hair smooth and shiny with a flat iron or curling iron, every time I venture out and try a different brand I am disappointed!  </li>
            <li> and you only need to spray a little.</li>
            <li> and when I tried to curl my hair with my flat iron (which typically holds 2 days) it didn&#x27;t even hold for an hour.  </li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair just about everyday</li>
            <li> I sprayed a bit on while wet as one other reviewer recommended and</li>
            <li> I have medium thick, wavy/curly hair that typically holds (with my old product) for two days.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after going through a lot of other sprays, serums, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky like other products.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t carry that burnt hair smell either you sometimes can get with other products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> even with being very careful to avoid the roots.  </li>
            <li> I tried a keratin treatment that didn&#x27;t work on taming them down.</li>
            <li> When I straightened my hair with this product it lasted half a day</li>
            <li> gives my hand/fingers a slight oily, silky feeling.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, slightly wavy, slightly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m having a lot less breakage</li>
            <li> Being unhappy about your hair is not a way to live--it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> Leaves hair a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I have a short, thin, frizzzzzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical but turned out to be very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> After trying at least three other heat protectant sprays and either getting no results or even worse damage, I saw the reviews for the Tigi and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> My hair is notoriously frizzy and hard to control.</li>
            <li> I always keep extra at home, afraid to run out</li>
            <li> And the last of instruction on the label is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously overpriced at Ulta.</li>
            <li> and I have A LOT in my bathroom, all failed attempts and a lot of money wasted.</li>
            <li> so my stylist always layers it with the razor to get rid of excessive weight, so needless to say</li>
            <li> I stand behind this product 100% and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Probably the worst location to live if you have hair issues!</li>
            <li> I listened to the reviewers and have in the past been skeptical of reviews because anybody (including the seller) can randomly rate an item.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and will pass it along to a friend to try. :(</li>
            <li> It may change color, texture, smell, or be completely useless.</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> It ends up making my hair look greasy or dirty.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  I typically use a cheap heat protecting spray that holds and works pretty well.  I know that Tigi&#x27;s products are typically fantastic and was very excited to try this one.  While it does smell fantastic, the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that it gives left my hair looking very greasy.  I have medium thick, wavy/curly hair that typically holds (with my old product) for two days.  When I straightened my hair with this product it lasted half a day and when I tried to curl my hair with my flat iron (which typically holds 2 days) it didn&#x27;t even hold for an hour.  I tried using it on wet and dry hair and there was no change.  I still love Tigi products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it smells yummy! Leaves hair shinning and soft</li>
            <li> Awesome product that leaves hair shiny with NO frizz!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Hard to find in stores for some reason. Shipping was fast. This is great to spray on hair before flat ironing. Gives hair nice sheen and isn&#x27;t heavy at all on the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray. I flat iron my hair just about everyday and I don&#x27;t have split ends or very little and my hair is so smooth. It works great! The seller was awesome and received the product in full it didn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve ordered it several times and have shared with friends. It&#x27;s my go-to when flat-ironing my hair. It&#x27;s not greasy, provides a great shine, and a little goes a along way. It&#x27;s seriously overpriced at Ulta. I always order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> gives my hand/fingers a slight oily, silky feeling. Feels uneasy, but it smells great and SOMEWHAT does the job, although there are better products out there, that does a better job than this. Smells nice though!</li>
            <li> Have used this awhile. They use it in the salons. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard or greasy wonderful smell as well. Really protects hair from flat irons especially if you use flat irons at high temperature for natural hair.</li>
            <li> This has totally transformed the way I get ready in the morning.  Spraying it in my damp hair before blowdrying has made my hair softer and shinier.  I feel like I can&#x27;t live without it now.  And the price on amazon is terrific!</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair continuously for over a year, and as an African-American woman, I need something that prevents breakage and still allows my hair to be weightless.  S-factor spray does that!  My hair was dry and brittle before I switched to a better heat defender product, and since switching, my hair has grown due to far less breakage, and to top it all off, it smells great!</li>
            <li> It cost alot of money but it is worth  it! The moment I put it on my hair I could see a difference. My hair seems to be more soft and instantly looks healthier! If your an african american women with natural hair and you like to wear it straight, you have to use this product. I work out very often and I have to straighten my roots almost everyday and this product is the best heat protectant by far!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, slightly wavy, slightly frizzy hair. Living on the Gulf Coast the humidity is a nightmare. Probably the worst location to live if you have hair issues! I bought this product after going through a lot of other sprays, serums, etc. After straightening my hair it looked amazing. It was very rainy and humid and my hair STILL looked shiny and sleek like I had left the salon! The price to me is worth it. Being unhappy about your hair is not a way to live--it&#x27;s funny how much happier I am when my hair doesn&#x27;t look like a hot mess. So, the bottom line is this: if you want smooth, shiny and manageable hair, this is your product. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love this product for flat ironing. And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product but research before buying on Amazon first.  Use [...] to see if you have purchased expired products.  I received this today and I searched the batch number on that site and it was manufactured in June of 2011.  Salons sell products that are manufactured months before they get them.  After 30 months a product is considered to be expired.  It may change color, texture, smell, or be completely useless.</li>
            <li> Really great for your hair and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair silky and smooth. It&#x27;s not sticky like other products. Occasionally I try new flat iron sprays but always come back to this one. I have thick fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received our product in excellent condition.  Great to use, when using a hot straightening hair iron, the product helps to prevent from damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  My stylist used it on my hair and this is the cheapest price I have found so far.  Very fast shipping.  It smells great and works awesome.  You don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot to get a good result.  It&#x27;s better than most heat protectors because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair wet when you spray it on.  Leaves it soft and silky after using it!</li>
            <li> This heat protectant/shine spray is amazing. I have very fine hair and it does not weigh it down (which most products do) and makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair a little greasy. I only used 2 sprays and it still leaves it greasy.</li>
            <li> I have fine, blonde hair.  It doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair, no matter if I use one light spray, or five.  It ends up making my hair look greasy or dirty.  I think this would be a great spray for someone with dark and more coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years - it was recommended by my Toni &amp; Guy stylist in maybe 2006 or 2007 and I have used it since. It is a little costly, but I have tried pretty much everything else on the market and this is the only one that does the trick. My hair is fine (but I have a lot of it) so my stylist always layers it with the razor to get rid of excessive weight, so needless to say, split ends show up rather quickly with that style. This product really helps to minimize the split end look, and keeps it silky and smooth all day. It smells amazing, and is very light weight. It does a great job protecting your hair while making sure that your strands lay flat and are as silky and sleek as they would be leaving the salon. I would never use anything else after coming back to this gem! If you use a little too much, just spray a little dry shampoo on the area and it will fix you right up!</li>
            <li> Finally I found THE product for my hair. I have a short, thin, frizzzzzy hair. I dry my hair first then spray tigi and flat iron it. The results are amazing. My hair never looked so great. Non greasy, a lot of movement with my hair, totally eliminates frizz, and protects my hair from flat iron damage. Yay for this product. I always keep extra at home, afraid to run out</li>
            <li> I have been using the S Factor Iron Shine Spray for a couple of years now.  I absolutley Love this product.  It def is a Heat Defender!&lt;br /&gt;I was purchasing this in the Salon untl I found it on Amazon.  Much better pricing!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a huge amount of flat iron sprays but from the one&#x27;s I have tried this is by far the best. Leaves my hair soft and frizz free. Even if you are&#x27;t straightening your hair spray it on right after a shower and it keeps fly-aways to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I Love s-factor. It&#x27;s the only thing I have been using on my hair for years and it works great. I use to have really damaged hair and this product really helps</li>
            <li> I have tried so many hair styling products I have become my own beauty store, it&#x27;s ridiculous! And what I have discovered is that if a product contains alcohol it will not protect your hair but most certainly will damage it! Thank the genius who created this iron spray!! It does not damage my hair but rather shields it from the heat, while leaving my hair soft and manageable, and will last a long time because one spray is all you need to go through each section of your hair. I straighten my hair almost every day so I need the best protection and between shampooing, treatments and styling S FACTOR helps out a lot! It also smells good so I don&#x27;t carry that burnt hair smell either you sometimes can get with other products. But what I love most is the affordable price!!! You can&#x27;t go wrong with how great it is compared to salon/beauty stores! Will most definitely recommend to anyone looking for great flat iron protection!</li>
            <li> Do it by spraying on sections and it&#x27;ll make your hair shiny not greasy! Pretty sure it&#x27;s protecting from heat as well! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for protecting hair from flat iron or curling iron heat damage</li>
            <li> Works GREAT on thick/coarse hair. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I have tried sooooo many things. They work until I walk outside into the humidity. This is the first product I have found that keeps my hair straight &amp; shiny all day.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, coarse  and dry, but I prefer to wear it straight. This flat iron spray not only protects my hair, but keeps it staying smooth in high humidity. It costs $30 in store so when I wanted to repurchase it, I was really lucky to find it on Amazon for only $19! It may be too heavy though for those whose hair isn&#x27;t as dry or coarse so spray lightly.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Smells good and leaves my hair smooth after straightening! Not oily like some products. My hair is usually dry, wiry, frizzy and wavy.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST flat iron spray I have ever purchased!!  It makes my naturally curly hair smooth and shiny with a flat iron or curling iron, every time I venture out and try a different brand I am disappointed!  Quick delivery, great packaging as well!  This seller wrapped this very well, these are prone to leaking, but it did not leak!!!  Quick delivery as well!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for your hair! It has special nutrients that help protect your hair when using a flat iron, but it is also great for curling irons. It leaves your hair feeling softer and shiny but Not greasy, and you don&#x27;t need to use much so it will last a long time. Well worth the purchase, I&#x27;ll  buy it again! Thanks Tigi S Factor, your products are the best!</li>
            <li> Consistently works well to give your hair a polished finish while protecting from heat, and smells amazing! Love!!</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive so I could buy it regularly. It smells awesome too - kind of like strawberries.</li>
            <li> Love this. Smells good and prevents damage to my hair, which is thin enough as it is.</li>
            <li> Brings the shine back</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much. I believe it says to spray each area before using a flat iron. U don&#x27;t need that much. Sometimes I just spray it into my hands before using any hot tool.</li>
            <li> wasnt exactly what I wanted, but I still use it everyday.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a great straighting serum this should be it! I just purchased this and once I received this I did my hair. W O W the smell is so fantastic and it keeps your hair straight, shiny and smelling amazing! I would recommend this to anyone who wants perfect straight hair ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I wash, blow dry, and flat iron my chin length bob with bangs nearly every day. I also have it foiled with three colors every four weeks. In the past year, my normally reasonably healthy hair had really begun looking dull and damaged. I had been on a mission to find something that would help to protect it from all of the abuse. After trying at least three other heat protectant sprays and either getting no results or even worse damage, I saw the reviews for the Tigi and decided to try it. My hair is saved! It is smooth and shiny and the damage is practically gone. The reviews say to be careful about using too much; however, the more I use the better my hair looks. Probably not for oily hair, but great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly &amp; it&#x27;s just like I would buy it at Ulta but cheaper! I love the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Smells great, leaves my hair so shiny and smooth. Very timely delivery as well. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Oil spray which leaves hair silky and shiny....but use too much and it leaves hair feeling oily and heavy. 1-2 sprays depending on length of hair. Leaves hair smelling good.</li>
            <li> Prodects your hair from heat damage. Keeps it healthy, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite Flat Iron spray! It smells great, works wonderfully, and gives my hair a nice shine!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous flat iron / head guard sprays, and this one beats them all.  I have incredibly curly hair, and this is the best straightening product that I&#x27;ve found after years of searching.  I&#x27;ve tried going cheap with Garnier Fructise (decent product), I&#x27;ve used CHI (decent), and I&#x27;ve tried other designer brands.  This one has a great smell - kind of like strawberries but not overpowering or too sweet.  Every time I use it people compliment the smell of my hair.  My favorite part is that it adds shine to your hair, which I love because my hair looks dull after I&#x27;ve dried and straightened it.  This product helps out with that problem without making my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> It works, I use it before blow dry, and it makes my hair soft, tames the frizzy. I also apply it before using flat iron, and it protects my hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> I ONLY use this product and I LOVE it...</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy at the ends. No matter if I go every 8 weeks for a cut or not. I tried a keratin treatment that didn&#x27;t work on taming them down. Then my good friend recommended this product to me. I have to admit I was skeptical but turned out to be very pleasantly surprised. It worked great with a flat iron! And smells good too! I now do not have frizzy ends and am very happy! I recommend this product. But keep in mind you don&#x27;t need much to get your frizzy hair under control and shining!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. My hair is notoriously frizzy and hard to control. This product makes it shiny and soft without weighing it down. And it STAYS shiny all day. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product on my hair when blow drying or using a flat iron. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I try to take it easy on my hair, blow-dry or straighten every couple of weeks at most. But I&#x27;ve wanted to heat style my hair more without frying it (it&#x27;s very dry and curly). This stuff has been really great. Smells awesome and does the job, leaves my hair really soft and silky. And it&#x27;s not very heavy or oily. A little goes a long way and even if I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, it does still work at keeping things smooth and a little protection from the sun is always nice!</li>
            <li> Works so well with my flat iron. Really takes the frizz out of my hair and gives it great shine.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  This product is amazing...I apply it to wet hair and either use a flat iron or a paddle brush and blow dryer..makes my frizzy hair so incredibly silky smooth and so straight..can&#x27;t believe how well it works!! Would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li> I tried this after using garnier sleek &amp; shine for over a year.  this one-- Tigi- seems oily to me.  maybe it&#x27;s not for my hair type?  I have shoulder length blunt cut /bevel cut hair. fairly straight- but I still flat iron.  I think the product is worth a try --- I will still experiment w/it.  just know that upon your 1st try you may feel that it&#x27;s heavier than basic silicone flat iron sprays.</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells. I also love the way it made my ends shine and look healthy. I love all the S factor products.</li>
            <li> I swear by this!! My hair is colored and frizzy. S factor really tames the frizz and protects my hair when I straighten it.. You can not but it on the coast any more,,, I have to order it!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spray and have been using it for years since it was recommended to me by a hair supply store. It is a heat defending spray to protect your hair while styling and it gives your hair a wonderful shine. I spray it in my hair when it&#x27;s wet or damp out of the shower, then blow dry. If I am going to flat iron my hair I then put Moroccan Oil in it AND spray this on my hair again before I flat iron. It is very important to have adequate protection for your hair before using a flat iron, also using this and combing through your hair prevents damage and keeps your hair from getting caught in a flat iron as it makes your hair very smooth. I stand behind this product 100% and recommend it to all my friends. I also use this after dry shampooing to give it shine, it makes my hair look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> My style holds even if I enter a humid area. I can tell it protects.  Seals in the moisture.  I love it.  I start to get nervous when the bottle is getting low.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, worth every penny. After I blow dry my hair I put this on before I flat iron my hair. It makes my hair so soft and shiny it&#x27;s amazing. It also helps make my naturally curly hair super straight when I flat iron it, without this spray I still have waves and bumps. Not to mention it helps protect my hair from being damaged by my flat iron. Ever since using this I have noticed my hair looks healthier and I&#x27;m having a lot less breakage so it really seems to be working. Plus it smells great to! Would recommend to anyone trying to get stick straight hair that&#x27;s shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as the reviews were stellar.  Maybe it&#x27;s my hair type?  But the product made my hair look greasy...even with being very careful to avoid the roots.  And the last of instruction on the label is disappointing.  Waste of money and will pass it along to a friend to try. :(</li>
            <li> Received very quickly and was packaged nicely and not damaged upon receipt. But even BETTER! THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING product that I have tried for a shiner/straightener/heat protectant. I live in Minnesota and the winters here are unbearable in regards to manageable hair and fly aways. I received this yesterday and I used this morning with my straightener.  I sprayed a bit on while wet as one other reviewer recommended and then a few more squirts before I straightened my hair. I am caucasian and have normal long black hair, however color treated and it made my hair SO shiny and silky and and straight but yet bouncy and have a lot of movement. This is the best stuff on the market...and I have A LOT in my bathroom, all failed attempts and a lot of money wasted. I will forever buy this product and wish I could give it 100 stars!  I listened to the reviewers and have in the past been skeptical of reviews because anybody (including the seller) can randomly rate an item.  However you guys spoke, I listened and am a very, very happy girl!</li>
            <li> The s factor line is amazing, and for my hair it&#x27;s hard to find something that constantly works. My stylist friend used it on my hair ten years ago and I fell in love with it, I have very fine hair and it works great. I would definitely recommend it, it makes your hair so smooth, smells great and you only need to spray a little.</li>
