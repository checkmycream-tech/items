    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful hair product!</li>
            <li>This is the best alternative for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li>I tried this henna and I must say, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to be a redhead again!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to a T and my hair was bright Orange!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>and you can get great results.</li>
            <li>and it came out great.</li>
            <li>Great henna.  </li>
            <li>and it gave great color on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the lack of smell.</li>
            <li>The first three times my hair came out perfect.  </li>
            <li>I tried this and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Great product, leaves my hair strong and shiny</li>
            <li>My hair came out a beautiful rich auburn, and the grays became nice</li>
            <li>I read to apply warm mineral oil to your hair for 25-30 min to help remove henna.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to find and more cost effective.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>It went on very smoothly</li>
            <li>They did change my grays to a very light blond, but that was it.  </li>
            <li>Henna has so many benefits</li>
            <li>Henna (real henna) is nothing but GREAT for hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo happy that I did a &amp;#34;strand test&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t do my whole head.</li>
            <li>I just wish I knew more before hand</li>
            <li>I love Rainbow Henna.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels fabulous!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to use henna once every three days.</li>
            <li>I also realized that I should have put way more water in it than the directions told me to.  </li>
            <li>so I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I found some liquid henna and it is SOOOOO much better.  </li>
            <li>I would never use the powder again, but I will for sure keep using the liquid.</li>
            <li>You will need more water than what is called for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself was ok, it&#x27;s just a tougher process to use than I want to deal with monthly.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy again and I was told having used chemicals on my hair and then henna it could hurt it more, but I had no issues with this henna.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t expect the color to completely go away, especially on light hair.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something more bold.  </li>
            <li>excellent hair product with good colour results and long lasting results</li>
            <li>I have been using henna for years as a way to get lovely natural looking red hair, I was pleased to find it so inexpensively priced here, and especially pleased that it came so quickly</li>
            <li>I suggest having gloves to keep your hands from turning orange (we use cheap vinyl exam gloves) and a disposable shower cap (to cover your hair while you let it process).</li>
            <li>The gray is covered and I like the way the light catches my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair color is naturally light</li>
            <li>It was like an art project, just clean up after yourself and be patient.</li>
            <li>We usually re-do ours about a week before we want ideal results to give it time to settle.</li>
            <li>my very first try with henna-</li>
            <li>I love the color so much and when I washed it with hot water and shampoo</li>
            <li>It left the texture of my hair very curly (major shrinkage!), silky and shiny :) All in all, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>Fabulous, pure henna.  </li>
            <li>After having read some poor reviews and good, I have to say I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have used Lush&#x27;s caca rouge henna many times in the past and loved it</li>
            <li>The color takes much more easily than the henna that I&#x27;ve used in the past, and leaves my hair with a nice red sheen.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is not a drastic dye, more like a red tint.  </li>
            <li>It will make them shine a pretty copper.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and healthy looking, and a great subtle shade of red over my brunette.</li>
            <li>A nice natural red</li>
            <li>worth it for a natural alternative to dyeing!</li>
            <li>Also, Henna is VERY permanent if you want to bleach or lighten your hair after using Henna you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just how henna works though, so no fault of the company really.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t very informed at first, I&#x27;m glad I wanted Red so that i can still dye my hair with regular dye if I want to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other henna and wasn&#x27;t exactly satisfied, after researching henna online, this brand kept popping up.</li>
            <li>So happy to have a way to keep my hair red without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>This is why a Strand Test is so important to see how long you want your Henna on for what color you are looking for</li>
            <li>Today is day 3 and my hair is so soft and shiny, however I decided to use a hot oil treatment with coconut oil, honey and olive oil.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, vibrant, and SUPER red again.</li>
            <li>The next morning I used very hot water and let the pressure rinse out the henna</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, but leave on longer than recommended.</li>
            <li>The next day I noticed more henna, but my hair was shiny, red and soft!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately no noticeable difference to the color, texture, or general condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>(Which I read online can be normal with Henna)</li>
            <li>This brand gives a really vibrant permanent color and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It started becoming a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li>I recently found it in whole foods, so I might not buy it online because when it&#x27;s on sale at whole foods</li>
            <li>I used shampoo first, and my hair felt very brittle and dry.</li>
            <li>I was scared at first because I read alot of mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>Henna was the only treatment that had a positive effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>However, ALL HAIR IS DIFFERENT so results can not be certain.</li>
            <li>My hair is super-soft, not stiff.</li>
            <li>How much of a difference it makes in your hair color will, of course, depend in part on what color you&#x27;re starting with--</li>
            <li>And yes, the potency can vary some from batch to batch, as it is a natural product that is just ground up plants.</li>
            <li>We only have to redo ours because the roots are showing, not because the ends have faded much.</li>
            <li>: It was not messy or stinky.</li>
            <li>I also found out that a lot of henna isn&#x27;t as natural as they advertise.  </li>
            <li>is that it takes about a week for residue it to completely wash from my hair.  </li>
            <li>but the Lush in my city stopped applying it in store.</li>
            <li>It did darken to a  more red color after a few days.</li>
            <li>We will definitely keep coming back to this product as long as we want to boost the red :-)</li>
            <li>I have fine, mousey medium brown hair which is starting to get a few strands of gray.  </li>
            <li>Henna is a great conditioner and free of terrible chemicals though.</li>
            <li>I also found out that REAL Henna is ONLY Red.</li>
            <li>you get much redder results starting from blonde (like my daughter) than starting from medium brown (like me), for instance.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheaper, but if you can&#x27;t find it in stores near you, this is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li>They barely deposited any color at all.  </li>
            <li>The color is very similar to the caca rouge from Lush.</li>
            <li>My hair is dark so the red showed up with a lovely dark red/burgundy tint.  </li>
            <li>This is much cheaper, easier to work with since it comes in powder form (lush comes in blocks that have to be chopped and melted down before application).</li>
            <li>This also didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down nearly as much as the Lush brand.</li>
            <li>I always thought the instructions that came with this to be a little strange, because so many long-time henna users say you must mix with something acidic, let it sit for a long time for the dyes to release, then keep it on your head for several hours or over night.  </li>
            <li>Do keep in mind that the color can change a little over the first week or so after treatment.</li>
            <li>you can really see the red at the tips of my hair and just a little bit where my natural color is in the sun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I brewed Raspberry zinger tea, and mixed with one and 1/4 containers of the persian red henna that I picked up at the local natural co-op store.</li>
            <li>Also that when doing a shade of Red it can be Orange at first and after a few days change to a Red.</li>
            <li>Instead of just adding hot water, I add raw African shea butter.</li>
            <li>I set the mix in front of a heater set on high for about 4 hours until mix turned brown and the test spot left a dark orange color on my palm after 5 minutes, Next I spread it throughout my hair using a brush starting at the roots.</li>

            <li> On a single gray hair you can actually see that the part previously treated is still red, and the new growth that I just henna&#x27;ed  is blond.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that upset about the money, as it&#x27;s not very expensive, but I am annoyed by the time and effort I&#x27;ve wasted on these last two jars, as using henna is no quick and easy thing.</li>
            <li> The texture and amount of mess is similar to Lush&#x27;s henna.</li>
            <li> I followed the package directions and it was pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> This was very messy, very smelly and did not work at all for me.</li>

            <li> I am a natural red head, but my hair had been turning blonde so for the past 2 years</li>
            <li> But it was so thick to apply, and i dont know that this is pure henna, it concerns me.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I have very dark wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and it made it very red, after I left it in for about 3 hours.  </li>

            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other brands of henna for our hair, and always come back to Rainbow Research.</li>
            <li> This was an issue for me because I have thick hair down to my waist and the Lush henna was super thick and would give me a head and neck ache.</li>
            <li> my hair felt dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> still like this product because chemical dye turns my hair brittle and dry.  </li>
            <li> If you buy a box labeled henna that claims to dye hair blonde, brown or black, there is something other than henna in that box.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Henna because I damage my hair using Boxed - Red dye every few weeks.</li>
            <li> These can result in green, purple, or totally fried hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells like wet hay.</li>
            <li> The color was not exactly what I was hoping for - a little lighter red than I am used to.  </li>
            <li> Any other color usually has other stuff added like Indigo for Blacks, Chemicals, metallic salts or other plants must be added to henna to make any color other than red.</li>

            <li> I have been using henna hair dye for years because I&#x27;m allergic to the Clairol, L&#x27;Oreal etc. hair dyes.  This brand gives a really vibrant permanent color and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair product!</li>
            <li> Henna has so many benefits but YOU CANNOT BLEACH OR USE REGULAR COLOR OVER IT. It will turn green/turquoise/purple, depending on what colors you are have used and are using. Chemical color over henna will literally disintegrate your hair. So think long and hard. Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen. You have to grow it all the way out. If you darken with henna bleach is the only way to lighten which you cannot do. No salon can fix this.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this, followed the instructions to the letter. She&#x27;s an average brunette, ZERO color transfer. Find another product.</li>
            <li> excellent hair product with good colour results and long lasting results Adds shine to your hair. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a dirty blond, curly and almost to my bra strap. I have dyed my hair 3 times with a red box hair dye, to have it wash out. Very disappointing and damaging to my hair. So this time I tried henna instead.&lt;br /&gt;First I brewed Raspberry zinger tea, and mixed with one and 1/4 containers of the persian red henna that I picked up at the local natural co-op store. I set the mix in front of a heater set on high for about 4 hours until mix turned brown and the test spot left a dark orange color on my palm after 5 minutes, Next I spread it throughout my hair using a brush starting at the roots. It went on very smoothly and I didn&#x27;t mind the smell. I wrapped my head with plastic wrap and then with a scarf (I was afraid of henna seeping out, I could of got away with just one container, so I used the excess to coat my hair again.). I slept with it in for 9 hours. The next morning I used very hot water and let the pressure rinse out the henna so my curls wouldn&#x27;t tangle. I used shampoo first, and my hair felt very brittle and dry. After I used conditioner twice. The next day I noticed more henna, but my hair was shiny, red and soft!  Today is day 3 and my hair is so soft and shiny, however I decided to use a hot oil treatment with coconut oil, honey and olive oil. I love the color so much and when I washed it with hot water and shampoo, no red color came out (unlike box dye). I highly recommend this product, but leave on longer than recommended. Here is a picture of the color after 1 day: [...]</li>
            <li> I rated this a 4 star because i&#x27;s not their fault for the lack of info on the container or my knowledge of Henna. I wanted to try Henna because I damage my hair using Boxed - Red dye every few weeks. Henna (real henna) is nothing but GREAT for hair. I&#x27;m soooo happy that I did a &amp;#34;strand test&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t do my whole head. I followed the directions to a T and my hair was bright Orange! It did darken to a  more red color after a few days. (Which I read online can be normal with Henna) I learned some information about Henna, AFTER I was doing my hair. You are supposed to let the mixture set-up for Hours, I&#x27;ve read anywhere from 3-12 hrs. Also that when doing a shade of Red it can be Orange at first and after a few days change to a Red. However, ALL HAIR IS DIFFERENT so results can not be certain. This is why a Strand Test is so important to see how long you want your Henna on for what color you are looking for AND if you want to had Coffee to the mixture for deepening Reds, or add Apple Cider vinegar to help cover Grays. There are TONS of recipes online to achieve the color shade/brightness you want. Also, Henna is VERY permanent if you want to bleach or lighten your hair after using Henna you can&#x27;t. The cuticle becomes sealed. I read to apply warm mineral oil to your hair for 25-30 min to help remove henna. Henna is a great conditioner and free of terrible chemicals though. I also found out that REAL Henna is ONLY Red. The plant Henna, (AKA- lawsonia inermis), has only one dye molecule and that molecule is red-orange. Any other color usually has other stuff added like Indigo for Blacks, Chemicals, metallic salts or other plants must be added to henna to make any color other than red. These pre-mixed colors  are compound hennas.  If you buy a box labeled henna that claims to dye hair blonde, brown or black, there is something other than henna in that box. Hair bleach, permanent hair color, and permanent wave solution are a disastrous combination with compound (metallic salt) henna dyes. These can result in green, purple, or totally fried hair.  Sorry I rambled so much I just wish I knew more before hand and I&#x27;ve never ever done one of these... just thought it might help someone. I&#x27;m not AGAINST Henna I just wasn&#x27;t very informed at first, I&#x27;m glad I wanted Red so that i can still dye my hair with regular dye if I want to. I&#x27;m going to try another strand test now that I have a couple mixtures that I&#x27;ve left out overnight and the paste looks so much different so I can see there is a reason to leave it for a while.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I love Rainbow Henna. It is the only brand I use anymore. It seems to be the one that mixes the smoothest. I like the color I get when I mix this color with chamomile tea. I would suggest that they start packaging it in a paper bag so I could throw it in the compost bin- No need for a container in my opinion.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other brands of henna for our hair, and always come back to Rainbow Research. Some other suppliers use sand as a filler, which is REALLY annoying to wash out of your hair. Follow the directions on the canister with this and you can get great results. How much of a difference it makes in your hair color will, of course, depend in part on what color you&#x27;re starting with--you get much redder results starting from blonde (like my daughter) than starting from medium brown (like me), for instance. But our hair always winds up shinier and being less prone to split ends. Yes, it smells weird. It&#x27;s a plant. It smells like wet hay. I do suggest adding a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, as the directions say you can. It does help make it a bit easier to wash out, and does help condition some. I suggest having gloves to keep your hands from turning orange (we use cheap vinyl exam gloves) and a disposable shower cap (to cover your hair while you let it process). You definitely need to use petroleum jelly or some other heavy oil-based heavy product (we use cocoa butter from a tub) as a waterproof barrier on your skin on your ears and around your hairline to keep from getting orange skin. And yes, the potency can vary some from batch to batch, as it is a natural product that is just ground up plants. If you want to gauge the results, do the test strip as they recommend. Do keep in mind that the color can change a little over the first week or so after treatment. We usually re-do ours about a week before we want ideal results to give it time to settle. Also, don&#x27;t expect the color to completely go away, especially on light hair. We only have to redo ours because the roots are showing, not because the ends have faded much. We will definitely keep coming back to this product as long as we want to boost the red :-)</li>
            <li> Thanks! My hair looks and feels fabulous!</li>
            <li> I recommend Rainbow. It&#x27;s easier to find and more cost effective. The texture and amount of mess is similar to Lush&#x27;s henna. It takes a lot of time to rinse all the seeds out of my hair. Instead of just adding hot water, I add raw African shea butter. It makes the consistency smoother and causes less mess. The shea butter helps the henna to not clump. I leave this mixture in for about six hours. I rinse my hair, wash, and add conditioner. While the conditioner is still in, I use my Tangle Tweezer to detangle and remove the seeds. After I henna my hair, I usually go out for a night on the town with my boyfriend. Everyone loves my hair. It&#x27;s soft and very manageable. It&#x27;s safe to use henna once every three days. I&#x27;ve been using it weekly for a month to help strengthen my hair. I&#x27;m black and have natural hair. It started becoming a frizzy mess. Henna was the only treatment that had a positive effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other henna and wasn&#x27;t exactly satisfied, after researching henna online, this brand kept popping up. I decided to give it a try. After having read some poor reviews and good, I have to say I&#x27;m satisfied. I used brewed tea instead of just water and avocado oil instead of olive, because it&#x27;s what I had on hand and it came out great. A nice natural red and it lasts. And I didn&#x27;t even leave it in for the recommended amount of time. I would definitely recommend it, and have to others. I recently found it in whole foods, so I might not buy it online because when it&#x27;s on sale at whole foods it&#x27;s cheaper, but if you can&#x27;t find it in stores near you, this is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have been using henna for years as a way to get lovely natural looking red hair, I was pleased to find it so inexpensively priced here, and especially pleased that it came so quickly and the jars were even overfull!</li>
            <li> It was actually easier to use than I thought it would be.  I followed the package directions and it was pretty thick.  I usually drip onto my towel, but not with this!  The color was not exactly what I was hoping for - a little lighter red than I am used to.  I will probably ask for some advice from the manufacturer for my next purchase, but there will be a next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother has been after me to try this instead of using chemical hair dye.  I was very pleased with the lack of smell. My hair still came out shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was scared at first because I read alot of mixed reviews. My Experience: It was not messy or stinky. It was like an art project, just clean up after yourself and be patient. Naturally, I have very dark wavy hair. I had the ends of my hair dyed blonde about a year ago (ombre). So now that i have completed henna  you can really see the red at the tips of my hair and just a little bit where my natural color is in the sun. This is not a drastic dye, more like a red tint.  It took a long time to wash it all out. It left the texture of my hair very curly (major shrinkage!), silky and shiny :) All in all, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I cant wait to do it again.</li>
            <li> Color was nice-bright orange. But it was so thick to apply, and i dont know that this is pure henna, it concerns me. my hair felt dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great henna.  I have dark brown hair and it made it very red, after I left it in for about 3 hours.  I had to shampoo my hair twice and the process of applying the henna was annoying and exhausting, but worth it for a natural alternative to dyeing!</li>
            <li> Fabulous, pure henna.  Makes my hair shiny and healthy looking, and a great subtle shade of red over my brunette.</li>
            <li> Rainbow Henna covers my gray, conditions my hair, and washes out gradually so I never worry about roots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rainbow Henna in Persian Red a total of five times.  The first three times my hair came out perfect.  I have fine, mousey medium brown hair which is starting to get a few strands of gray.  I mixed only with water, and left it on 2 hrs rather than 65-75 mins recommended.  My hair came out a beautiful rich auburn, and the grays became nice strawberry/copper highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two jars I used, I bought them at the same time, so they were probably from the same batch. They barely deposited any color at all.  They did change my grays to a very light blond, but that was it.  On a single gray hair you can actually see that the part previously treated is still red, and the new growth that I just henna&#x27;ed  is blond.  I did nothing different than before, so they either filled the jars with the wrong color, or it was a bad batch/crop. I always thought the instructions that came with this to be a little strange, because so many long-time henna users say you must mix with something acidic, let it sit for a long time for the dyes to release, then keep it on your head for several hours or over night.  While the packaging says it&#x27;s organic, no added chemicals, etc. I&#x27;ve wondered if they treated it somehow to allow for a shorter processing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Either way it&#x27;s poor quality control.  I&#x27;m not that upset about the money, as it&#x27;s not very expensive, but I am annoyed by the time and effort I&#x27;ve wasted on these last two jars, as using henna is no quick and easy thing. I&#x27;m not going to bother with this brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m persian so I thought all the &#x27;persian&#x27; in the descriptions meant that it would work for my type of hair.  It didn&#x27;t.  I should have read the reviews before I tried this.  This was very messy, very smelly and did not work at all for me. It sounds like I should have left it in my hair longer than the directions told me to, but I couldn&#x27;t do it because of the smell.  I also realized that I should have put way more water in it than the directions told me to.  After reading the reviews I ordered some pre-mixed, liquid henna.  I also found out that a lot of henna isn&#x27;t as natural as they advertise.  Other people recommended to look for bottles that say \\&quot;100% henna\\&quot; and I didn&#x27;t see that on this one.  My hair also smelled for 3 or 4 days after using this so I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I found some liquid henna and it is SOOOOO much better.  It didn&#x27;t smell at all and it gave great color on my hair.  I would never use the powder again, but I will for sure keep using the liquid.</li>
            <li> Last time I used medium auburn- my very first try with henna- and I wanted something more bold.  So this is why I purchased this Persian Red.  My hair is dark so the red showed up with a lovely dark red/burgundy tint.  It&#x27;s just what I&#x27;m going for.  Have grays?  It will make them shine a pretty copper.  I like that!  I followed the instructions that came with it and added olive oil and vinegar to the mix.  You will need more water than what is called for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that it takes about a week for residue it to completely wash from my hair.  Could be my hair type (google Scary Spice), or could be because I use a gentle sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like this product because chemical dye turns my hair brittle and dry.  This is the best alternative for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Has a &amp;#34;hemp-like&amp;#34; odor.  Makes sense.  It&#x27;s from a plant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair with henna for about six months now, but couldn&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  I tried this henna and I must say, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The color takes much more easily than the henna that I&#x27;ve used in the past, and leaves my hair with a nice red sheen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately no noticeable difference to the color, texture, or general condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> The product itself was ok, it&#x27;s just a tougher process to use than I want to deal with monthly. It was really hard to rinse out, and made a HUUUGE mess. That&#x27;s just how henna works though, so no fault of the company really.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves my hair strong and shiny</li>
            <li> I have used Lush&#x27;s caca rouge henna many times in the past and loved it but the Lush in my city stopped applying it in store. I found a stylist who applies henna and she used the Rainbow Research Persian Red henna on my hair. The color is very similar to the caca rouge from Lush. This is much cheaper, easier to work with since it comes in powder form (lush comes in blocks that have to be chopped and melted down before application). This also didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down nearly as much as the Lush brand. This was an issue for me because I have thick hair down to my waist and the Lush henna was super thick and would give me a head and neck ache. I didn&#x27;t experience that with the Rainbow Research henna. I left it on for 6 hours under a shower cap. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to be a redhead again! My hair is super-soft, not stiff. The gray is covered and I like the way the light catches my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took less than half the jar to do my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! I Have recommended it to coworkers!  I Will always use this product. It&#x27;s fantastic. Yep</li>
            <li> I wish i could have bought this product from rainbow research site. I applied this henna and got no color it is suppose to be persian red, but no change in hair shade. My hair color is naturally light and I have not colored my hair for years now. I think it is a mere imitation of original product, I don&#x27;t even feel like returning it as it waste of time for 5 -10 bucks! However i can save others time and money by this review. Thanks</li>
            <li> I am a natural red head, but my hair had been turning blonde so for the past 2 years I&#x27;ve dyed it when box color. This worked, but the chemicals were starting to take effect on my hair. I tried this and absolutely love it! My hair looks healthy again and I was told having used chemicals on my hair and then henna it could hurt it more, but I had no issues with this henna. My hair is shiny, vibrant, and SUPER red again. So happy to have a way to keep my hair red without the harsh chemicals! Will be using this again and again!!!</li>
