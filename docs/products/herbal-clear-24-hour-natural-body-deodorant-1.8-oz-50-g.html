    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have three types of deodorant and this is almost the best one.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li>Not the best scent, but it works!</li>
            <li>Awesome deodorant with great scent.</li>
            <li>Works great on my husband and the best part is no aluminum</li>
            <li>This deodorant happens to work really great for me.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>a great product, no toxins and great smell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>but if you perspire moderately it&#x27;s a great find.</li>
            <li>But it works great as a combo</li>
            <li>Skin looks and feels great with Herbal Clear!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t find it very effective after a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find any antiperspirant that was perfect, but I haven&#x27;t seen any more sweating than I had when I used Ban or Degree.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IF applied liberally, you&#x27;ll get about six-eight hours tops of good odor-reduction.</li>
            <li>The smell was good if you like tea tree....smelled \\&quot;manly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>But my wife gave me the sniff test after a good workout and couldn&#x27;t smell a thing.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells good going on.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about three years and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I have to admit it doesn&#x27;t stop odor for 24 hours if I get hot and sweaty, but for me it&#x27;s the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of the product!</li>
            <li>Even better than antiperspirants at stopping the smell!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another reasonably effective alternative is [[ASIN:B004153MG4</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fairly effective.</li>
            <li>It kind of has a more boyish smell, but I&#x27;ll take that over BO and pit stains.</li>
            <li>Pretty effective in odor control, noticeable but pleasant smell of its own.  </li>
            <li>Like the scent- not too strong or flowery- and effective for exercise and sport.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>, so we order it from Amazon in &amp;#34;bulk,&amp;#34; which I find hilarious.</li>
            <li>ha :)</li>
            <li>and/or they go out of business! :)</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>advice to those looking for aluminum- and talc-free deodorants is to try several to find the one that works best for you.</li>
            <li>I have tried many deodorants, but this stuff is king.  </li>
            <li>Me and my husband has been using this for 2 years and we love this product.</li>
            <li>I got to know this product from my sister and they also love this.</li>
            <li>Why, because I didn&#x27;t know any better.</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve been using Truly&#x27;s deodorant and it has been the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever found!!!</li>
            <li>Best part is: No Yellow Armpit Stains!</li>
            <li>Deodorant works for me most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but the smell is extremely strong and overwhelmingly manly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a great natural deodorant</li>
            <li>but it is so strong.</li>
            <li>Smells so strong.</li>
            <li>Plus, the scent isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent, which I like fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching over from using antiperspirant what I did found that works natural grooming mountain maximum protection: its the best stopping  body odor and is really a natural product!</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because despite the draw backs, it has been the best natural deodorant I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Fortunately there&#x27;s amazon.com</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle product but it works great on low stress days.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does not burn my arm pits like herbal essences.</li>
            <li>superior natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried is [[ASIN:B013PAYICM Stinkbug Naturals Tea Tree Deodorant Stick, 2.1 Ounce -- 1 each.]]</li>
            <li>had tried many natural deodorants over the years to see if I could stop using antiperspirants but never found anything to stop the smell effectively.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li>No underarm smell and a significant reduction of perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>We get 6 sticks at a time - they last forever, they smell amazing, and they don&#x27;t make either of us break out in a rash, like most &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; deodorants do.</li>
            <li>Also it has a very light scent which I really like and no residue.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good natural deodorant, with no aluminum.</li>
            <li>As many of us know, you really have to mix and match between 2 or 3 deodorants so that the body won&#x27;t find a way to overpower one of them.</li>
            <li>my husband has very sensitive skin and has reacted to many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deoderants.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for him and it has a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t clog his pores and his armpits are no longer red.  </li>
            <li>But if you live in a more reasonable climate or if it&#x27;s winter, or you sit in a climate controlled office environment, this deodorant works</li>
            <li>It works better than most of the other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried (Tom&#x27;s) and seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li>fast delivery...a little cheaper than the store...very happy</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have strong body odor, so this was unusual for me.</li>
            <li>I think it needs to be re-applied more than once daily.    </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this when my boyfriend wears it!</li>
            <li>However, the scent is relatively light and some may consider it too masculine of a scent.</li>
            <li>My husband was hesitant to use it at first because he didn&#x27;t think it would prevent underarm sweat and odor because it was a non-name brand product</li>
            <li>This one works pretty well.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it when I know that I am going to sweat a lot or when it is really hot</li>
            <li>This is my favorite natural deodorant so far - it delivers.</li>
            <li>So I had sticky armpits that smelled less stinky and more manly!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works fine if I am not going to be outside in hot weather.</li>
            <li>Also, even though it may allow my pits to stink a bit - the stench isn&#x27;t strong enough to reach the nostrils of those around me.</li>
            <li>I think the only difference is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I just realized that the main ingredient in this deodorant is propylene glycol!</li>
            <li>Basically very aftershave-like.</li>
            <li>It also stayed sticky the whole time.</li>
            <li>No compromise, whole day deodorant.</li>
            <li>product works for the whole day, work or play.</li>
            <li>My hubby really likes this deodorant stick.  </li>
            <li>It works better for me than other non-alumuninum deodorants.</li>
            <li>, I can no longer keep my rating of it as high considering how much you get &amp; need to use to avoid having smelly armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing that is kind of crazy about this deodorant is that I almost smell Too good.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t keep you dry, but it should keep you odor free.</li>
            <li>Most stop preventing odor after a few hours but this lasts my whole work day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it really does last a very long time.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve continued to have success with this product, so I&#x27;ve purchased a few more for the future.</li>
            <li>My problem is that the scent isn&#x27;t strong enough to overpower stink, so perhaps there&#x27;s just not enough &amp;#34;active ingredient&amp;#34; to make this stuff work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Granted, I live in TX so hot would be 90s and above which happens quite often!</li>
            <li>, when I do choose to wear this deodorant over aluminum-containing ones, I usually have to reapply once more during the course of the day.</li>
            <li>I am always fresh and dry with Herbal Clear Sport.</li>
            <li>I appreciate it &#x27;healthier&#x27; take on deodorants, but generally speaking, by the end of the day I can catch small whiffs of myself, and it&#x27;s not all too cute.</li>
            <li>and for the price Herbal Clear Sport has gone up to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been combining this Herbal Clear with a sage oil deodorant</li>
            <li>I like that this deodorant has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>works well for natural deo</li>
            <li>For those who are highly sensitive to the chemicals in anti-perspirants.  </li>
            <li>Not quite a 5 star as it is only 1.8 oz, so price per oz is a bit much.</li>
            <li>I would buy it even if it wasn&#x27;t all natural because it works so well.</li>
            <li>I am typically a pretty heavy sweater and this seems to control that pretty well too.  </li>
            <li>far as natural deodorants go, it&#x27;s by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brand from Maine, which has always certainly felt like a compromise to me, is definitely my back-up now (if I&#x27;ve forgotten to order herbal clear from Amazon).</li>
            <li>I thought this might be a very gender neutral deodorant or at least have a mild smell</li>
            <li>I used it daily for about a week during normal weather, and by the evening I had started to smell.</li>
            <li>I have used all different brands from clinical series deodorant to normal.  </li>
            <li>Like many people, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, just not a very effective one for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In general I wouldn&#x27;t have cared about the smell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat any more than the normal person, but I find that in the Florida humidity, this deodorant doesn&#x27;t fail.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t yellow my shirt, and goes on clear.</li>
            <li>I often have to reapply the Herbal Clear later in the day if I&#x27;ve ben sweating a lot.</li>
            <li>And I like the fragrance, which is masculine enough and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if my new white shirts aren&#x27;t turning yellow, but even if they do, I&#x27;ll stick with Herbal Clear Sport.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several types of aluminum-free deodorant, and I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that because humans are so different in their smell and production of sweat, that natural deodorants perform differently from person-to-person.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin that was constantly too dry or irritated when using aluminum-based deodorants.</li>

            <li> , I can no longer keep my rating of it as high considering how much you get &amp; need to use to avoid having smelly armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that is kind of crazy about this deodorant is that I almost smell Too good.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t keep you dry, but it should keep you odor free.</li>
            <li> Most stop preventing odor after a few hours but this lasts my whole work day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it really does last a very long time.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve continued to have success with this product, so I&#x27;ve purchased a few more for the future.</li>
            <li> My problem is that the scent isn&#x27;t strong enough to overpower stink, so perhaps there&#x27;s just not enough &amp;#34;active ingredient&amp;#34; to make this stuff work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Granted, I live in TX so hot would be 90s and above which happens quite often!</li>
            <li> , when I do choose to wear this deodorant over aluminum-containing ones, I usually have to reapply once more during the course of the day.</li>
            <li> I am always fresh and dry with Herbal Clear Sport.</li>
            <li> I appreciate it &#x27;healthier&#x27; take on deodorants, but generally speaking, by the end of the day I can catch small whiffs of myself, and it&#x27;s not all too cute.</li>
            <li> and for the price Herbal Clear Sport has gone up to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been combining this Herbal Clear with a sage oil deodorant</li>
            <li> I like that this deodorant has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> works well for natural deo</li>
            <li> For those who are highly sensitive to the chemicals in anti-perspirants.  </li>
            <li> Not quite a 5 star as it is only 1.8 oz, so price per oz is a bit much.</li>
            <li> I would buy it even if it wasn&#x27;t all natural because it works so well.</li>
            <li> I am typically a pretty heavy sweater and this seems to control that pretty well too.  </li>
            <li> far as natural deodorants go, it&#x27;s by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brand from Maine, which has always certainly felt like a compromise to me, is definitely my back-up now (if I&#x27;ve forgotten to order herbal clear from Amazon).</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a very gender neutral deodorant or at least have a mild smell</li>
            <li> I used it daily for about a week during normal weather, and by the evening I had started to smell.</li>
            <li> I have used all different brands from clinical series deodorant to normal.  </li>
            <li> Like many people, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, just not a very effective one for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In general I wouldn&#x27;t have cared about the smell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat any more than the normal person, but I find that in the Florida humidity, this deodorant doesn&#x27;t fail.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t yellow my shirt, and goes on clear.</li>
            <li> I often have to reapply the Herbal Clear later in the day if I&#x27;ve ben sweating a lot.</li>
            <li> And I like the fragrance, which is masculine enough and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if my new white shirts aren&#x27;t turning yellow, but even if they do, I&#x27;ll stick with Herbal Clear Sport.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of aluminum-free deodorant, and I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that because humans are so different in their smell and production of sweat, that natural deodorants perform differently from person-to-person.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin that was constantly too dry or irritated when using aluminum-based deodorants.</li>
            <li> (I think I have seen it in Whole Foods in the past?)</li>
            <li> It never makes me itch and it lasts for such a long time.</li>
            <li> However it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> With all the crap in regular name brand deodorant, I thought going to the natural stuff might be better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the smell later on other people&#x27;s clothes, but maybe I would if i washed my clothes with it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep you dry all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stinkbug Naturals smells more like tea tree, and comes in a coconut oil base that doesn&#x27;t sweat off like the Herbal Clear Sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve several other &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;organic&#x27; or &#x27;hippie&#x27; deoderants in the past.</li>
            <li> That means it breaks down the skin’s protective barrier, making it easier for other potentially harmful ingredients in the formula to sink deeper into your tissues and perhaps even into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> It works as well as other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Sorry - I love the concept of a natural sport deoadrant, but it stinks.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin after shaving, unlike conventional antiperspirant/deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after throwing away countless yellow-stained white shirts, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work well for him even while working out and being active!</li>
            <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t say antiperspirant, but you&#x27;ll find after your body gets done with the toxins you&#x27;ve been putting on, you&#x27;ll sweat less.</li>
            <li> Using nothing I smell less, so have switched to something else.</li>
            <li> Lay it on thick and it works, as long as you&#x27;re not dripping sweat for hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes because it lacks all the harsh chemicals that do that.  </li>
            <li> They hold up through all workouts, and don&#x27;t make you feel like you have a heavy layer of slime holding all your sweat in...</li>
            <li> Will keep buying until we&#x27;re dead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for 5 years.</li>
            <li> after a few hours, I didn&#x27;t like my smell.  </li>
            <li> The efficacy is reduced a small amount if you sweat, but Herbal Clear Sport becomes nearly useless if you sweat a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not able to buy this deodorant anywhere</li>
            <li> Reeks after a few hours and have to re apply at least three times.</li>
            <li> No more rash under the arms.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how it is alone.</li>
            <li> so I keep unwanted chemicals and hard metals out of my system.</li>
            <li> He is a sports guy and hard worker</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for at least 7 years.</li>
            <li> Bad part is I cannot find it locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; formulations, some of them make you smell worse!</li>
            <li> cyanide).&lt;br /&gt;It gets worse.</li>
            <li> Definitely not impressed with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> He never smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even wear it - it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> it is making my friend Sam feel bad because he smells stinky in comparison.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a deodorant without all the bad stuff and this one works well.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as she used to, so</li>
            <li> deodorant was my go-to for a while after switching from aluminum-containing brands &amp; having a painful reaction from the Arm &amp; Hammer brand &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I hate odor.  </li>
            <li> But the worst was how sticky my armpits got after applying this.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff. It works as well as other deodorants. Bad part is I cannot find it locally. Fortunately there&#x27;s amazon.com</li>
            <li> tetrasodium ETDA, made from ethylenediamine, formaldehyde—a known carcinogen according to the National Cancer Institute—and sodium cyanide (which is made from the toxic gas hydrogen cyanide).&lt;br /&gt;It gets worse. This ingredient is also a penetration enhancer. That means it breaks down the skin’s protective barrier, making it easier for other potentially harmful ingredients in the formula to sink deeper into your tissues and perhaps even into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> I like that this deodorant has all natural ingredients. However, it doesn&#x27;t last all day for me. I used it daily for about a week during normal weather, and by the evening I had started to smell. I normally don&#x27;t have strong body odor, so this was unusual for me. However, I do like the smell of this deodorant. I think it needs to be re-applied more than once daily.    UPDATE:     I just realized that the main ingredient in this deodorant is propylene glycol! This is technically a toxin, so I would not recommend this deodorant to anyone who is trying to avoid toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> works well for natural deo</li>
            <li> my husband has very sensitive skin and has reacted to many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deoderants. he loves this product!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for me.</li>
            <li> it works, up to a point. I appreciate it &#x27;healthier&#x27; take on deodorants, but generally speaking, by the end of the day I can catch small whiffs of myself, and it&#x27;s not all too cute.</li>
            <li> This product does not handle the underarm body odor well at all.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used all different brands from clinical series deodorant to normal.  I have very sensitive skin but I hate odor.  I have been using this brand for years and it is fantastic!  It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes because it lacks all the harsh chemicals that do that.  I am typically a pretty heavy sweater and this seems to control that pretty well too.  I highly recommend this brand to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about three years and am very satisfied with it. Regular deodorant was starting to irritate my underarm skin and I had to try several holistic products before I found this one. I have to admit it doesn&#x27;t stop odor for 24 hours if I get hot and sweaty, but for me it&#x27;s the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a very gender neutral deodorant or at least have a mild smell but the smell is extremely strong and overwhelmingly manly. Basically very aftershave-like. I figured I would get used to it but every time I lifted my arm I got a big whiff. I did not smell BO but by the end of the day I could. It also stayed sticky the whole time. So I had sticky armpits that smelled less stinky and more manly! In general I wouldn&#x27;t have cared about the smell but it is so strong. Will probably be passing it to hubby.</li>
            <li> I try this Product and it did not measure up ! I&#x27;m switching over from using antiperspirant what I did found that works natural grooming mountain maximum protection: its the best stopping  body odor and is really a natural product! Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after throwing away countless yellow-stained white shirts, I decided to give it a try.  This product works for me.  *I will add that I shave my underarms every day, so this probably helps.  I don&#x27;t sweat any more than the normal person, but I find that in the Florida humidity, this deodorant doesn&#x27;t fail.  It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin after shaving, unlike conventional antiperspirant/deodorant.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if my new white shirts aren&#x27;t turning yellow, but even if they do, I&#x27;ll stick with Herbal Clear Sport.  I didn&#x27;t find any antiperspirant that was perfect, but I haven&#x27;t seen any more sweating than I had when I used Ban or Degree.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works fine if I am not going to be outside in hot weather. Granted, I live in TX so hot would be 90s and above which happens quite often! But if you live in a more reasonable climate or if it&#x27;s winter, or you sit in a climate controlled office environment, this deodorant works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I do choose to wear this deodorant over aluminum-containing ones, I usually have to reapply once more during the course of the day. I gave it 3 stars because despite the draw backs, it has been the best natural deodorant I have used so far.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my mom but I couldn&#x27;t find it in a local store so I ordered it online. I have tried a few different &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this is the best one so far. Most stop preventing odor after a few hours but this lasts my whole work day. I still wear regular antiperspirant on days where I know I will be stressed and sweating a lot. This isn&#x27;t a miracle product but it works great on low stress days.</li>
            <li> For those who are highly sensitive to the chemicals in anti-perspirants.  Has not irritated my skin yet. Pretty effective in odor control, noticeable but pleasant smell of its own.  I find I have to reapply it or Vichy deodorant (which I also use) in 12 hours.</li>
            <li> No aluminum or alcohol for a healthier deodarant.  And I like the fragrance, which is masculine enough and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I am not able to buy this deodorant anywhere (I think I have seen it in Whole Foods in the past?), so we order it from Amazon in &amp;#34;bulk,&amp;#34; which I find hilarious. We get 6 sticks at a time - they last forever, they smell amazing, and they don&#x27;t make either of us break out in a rash, like most &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; deodorants do. They hold up through all workouts, and don&#x27;t make you feel like you have a heavy layer of slime holding all your sweat in...ha :) Awesome deodorant with great scent. Will keep buying until we&#x27;re dead and/or they go out of business! :)</li>
            <li> USING FOR YEARS...LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this when my boyfriend wears it! It seems to work well for him even while working out and being active!</li>
            <li> My son uses this.  He never smells bad.  It does have a strong scent, which I like fine.  I do notice that when I do laundry, all of the laundry smells like this deodorant when I transfer it to the dryer.  (I use unscented laundry detergent.)  I don&#x27;t notice the smell later on other people&#x27;s clothes, but maybe I would if i washed my clothes with it.  (I do my laundry separately from mine.)</li>
            <li> Works great on my husband and the best part is no aluminum</li>
            <li> UPDATE (9/20/2017):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant was my go-to for a while after switching from aluminum-containing brands &amp; having a painful reaction from the Arm &amp; Hammer brand &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I&#x27;ve noticed after using it for several years:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF applied liberally, you&#x27;ll get about six-eight hours tops of good odor-reduction. However, the scent is relatively light and some may consider it too masculine of a scent. My problem is that the scent isn&#x27;t strong enough to overpower stink, so perhaps there&#x27;s just not enough &amp;#34;active ingredient&amp;#34; to make this stuff work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A superior natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried is [[ASIN:B013PAYICM Stinkbug Naturals Tea Tree Deodorant Stick, 2.1 Ounce -- 1 each.]] and for the price Herbal Clear Sport has gone up to, I can no longer keep my rating of it as high considering how much you get &amp; need to use to avoid having smelly armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stinkbug Naturals smells more like tea tree, and comes in a coconut oil base that doesn&#x27;t sweat off like the Herbal Clear Sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but you only need one to two swipes of the Stinkbug Naturals deodorant in order to get through an entire day. The efficacy is reduced a small amount if you sweat, but Herbal Clear Sport becomes nearly useless if you sweat a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reasonably effective alternative is [[ASIN:B004153MG4 Herban Cowboy Forest Deodorant Maximum Protection, 2.8 Ounce]], which also comes in an unscented option if you find the fragrances to be undesired.</li>
            <li> Like the scent- not too strong or flowery- and effective for exercise and sport.  It works better for me than other non-alumuninum deodorants.</li>
            <li> Definitely not impressed with this deodorant. This is the second I&#x27;ve tried and I would rather not wear anything compared to this. The smell was good if you like tea tree....smelled \\&quot;manly\\&quot;. I am a girl. But the worst was how sticky my armpits got after applying this. So, onto my next brand....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of aluminum-free deodorant, and I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that because humans are so different in their smell and production of sweat, that natural deodorants perform differently from person-to-person. This deodorant happens to work really great for me. No underarm smell and a significant reduction of perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;My advice to those looking for aluminum- and talc-free deodorants is to try several to find the one that works best for you. There&#x27;s just no need for long-term exposure to harmful ingredients in &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; deodorants.</li>
            <li> Smells so strong. Medicine-y. I can&#x27;t even wear it - it smells so bad. I&#x27;d return it, but time ran out. Sorry - I love the concept of a natural sport deoadrant, but it stinks.</li>
            <li> No compromise, whole day deodorant. Lay it on thick and it works, as long as you&#x27;re not dripping sweat for hours.&lt;br /&gt;As far as natural deodorants go, it&#x27;s by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brand from Maine, which has always certainly felt like a compromise to me, is definitely my back-up now (if I&#x27;ve forgotten to order herbal clear from Amazon).</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good natural deodorant, with no aluminum. It works better than most of the other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried (Tom&#x27;s) and seems to last most of the day. It won&#x27;t keep you dry, but it should keep you odor free.</li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants, but this stuff is king.  I sweat a lot and it doesn&#x27;t even touch this stuff.  I can put it on in the morning, work all day, and then run 3 miles at night without even a hint of odor.  It doesn&#x27;t yellow my shirt, and goes on clear.</li>
            <li> This is my backup deodorant. It goes on smooth and does not burn my arm pits like herbal essences. I have three types of deodorant and this is almost the best one. The only thing that is kind of crazy about this deodorant is that I almost smell Too good. it is making my friend Sam feel bad because he smells stinky in comparison.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep you dry all day. Reeks after a few hours and have to re apply at least three times.</li>
            <li> Me and my husband has been using this for 2 years and we love this product.No chemical,no itching.I got to know this product from my sister and they also love this.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I&#x27;ve several other &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;organic&#x27; or &#x27;hippie&#x27; deoderants in the past. None worked. This one does. Not quite a 5 star as it is only 1.8 oz, so price per oz is a bit much. However, I will continue to purchase so I keep unwanted chemicals and hard metals out of my system. Would definitely recommend.  Update March 2015 - I&#x27;ve continued to have success with this product, so I&#x27;ve purchased a few more for the future. No vendor at the moment sells them by the bulk, or in an affordable pack. Hopefully that will change for the future.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a deodorant without all the bad stuff and this one works well. I still sweat (it is not an antipersperant), but it controls odor relatively well.</li>
            <li> Like many people, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that actually works. As many of us know, you really have to mix and match between 2 or 3 deodorants so that the body won&#x27;t find a way to overpower one of them. I&#x27;ve been combining this Herbal Clear with a sage oil deodorant and it&#x27;s been fairly effective. I often have to reapply the Herbal Clear later in the day if I&#x27;ve ben sweating a lot. Also, even though it may allow my pits to stink a bit - the stench isn&#x27;t strong enough to reach the nostrils of those around me.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as she used to, so I think it&#x27;s working.  Either that or I&#x27;ve gotten used to her odor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the deodorant itself or the combination of my armpits and this deodorant, but it didn&#x27;t work. It made me stink. So if you have armpits like mine, buy something else.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am always fresh and dry with Herbal Clear Sport. It never makes me itch and it lasts for such a long time. I do not see it in stores but buy in bulk from Amazon. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. My husband has allergies to all but this deodorant. It has helped a lot finding it. No more rash under the arms.</li>
            <li> My husband was getting clogged pores and red splotches under his arms from using regular deodorant. I ordered this for him and it has a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t clog his pores and his armpits are no longer red.  My husband was hesitant to use it at first because he didn&#x27;t think it would prevent underarm sweat and odor because it was a non-name brand product but after a week of daily workouts and working 12hr days and no rash under his arms he now loves this deodorant!</li>
            <li> good stuff. fast delivery...a little cheaper than the store...very happy</li>
            <li> I would buy it even if it wasn&#x27;t all natural because it works so well. It kind of has a more boyish smell, but I&#x27;ll take that over BO and pit stains. Plus, the scent isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li> Why not have it both ways? Every day for years I woke up and applied toxic aluminum to my under arms. Why, because I didn&#x27;t know any better. Now I do.&lt;br /&gt;What a great product, no toxins and great smell.&lt;br /&gt;The product works for the whole day, work or play. Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I stopped using regular deodorant to avoid aluminum. I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and will never go back. It lasts throughout the day and through my daily workouts. Also it has a very light scent which I really like and no residue. It may not work for some of the stinkier people out there but if you perspire moderately it&#x27;s a great find.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of the product! However it does not last very long. I found myself having to reapply during the day. I&#x27;ve been looking for a great natural deodorant and I&#x27;m bummed this wasn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s not a bad product, just not a very effective one for me.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried many natural deodorants over the years to see if I could stop using antiperspirants but never found anything to stop the smell effectively. Recently, I&#x27;ve been using Truly&#x27;s deodorant and it has been the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever found!!! Even better than antiperspirants at stopping the smell!</li>
            <li> Maybe because it is herbal, it does not work as well as a traditional deodorant does. I could smell myself by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> My hubby really likes this deodorant stick.  He likes the smell and likes how well it works for him.  He is a sports guy and hard worker so the fact it works so well is a plus for this wife.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this deodorant for about 7 years.  I love the smell and it really does last a very long time.</li>
            <li> 1 stick lasts 2 months. I&#x27;ve used it everyday for 5 years. Amazon has the best price. I do the auto ship through Amazon, 3 sticks every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No yellow spots on your shirts! I know it doesn&#x27;t say antiperspirant, but you&#x27;ll find after your body gets done with the toxins you&#x27;ve been putting on, you&#x27;ll sweat less. Only time I sweat now is when I work out... when you are supposed to sweat and I don&#x27;t smell. My wife loves the way it smells. I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;yellow label&amp;#34; version of this stick... the one you find at your brick and mortar stores and it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as this one. They both say the same thing on the labels, but the ingredients are different. Pick the &amp;#34;Blue/White label&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wished they continued to make the one which repels bugs</li>
            <li> after a few hours, I didn&#x27;t like my smell.  Using nothing I smell less, so have switched to something else.</li>
            <li> I use this with a crystal deodorant stone so I am not sure how it is alone. But it works great as a combo and I have been using it for at least 7 years.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; formulations, some of them make you smell worse! This one works pretty well.</li>
            <li> No aluminum. Works well.</li>
            <li> With all the crap in regular name brand deodorant, I thought going to the natural stuff might be better. I was just worried, when switching to any brand, it wouldn&#x27;t work. But my wife gave me the sniff test after a good workout and couldn&#x27;t smell a thing. Plus it smells good going on. Will definitely be getting this again. Best part is: No Yellow Armpit Stains!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deodorant so far - it delivers. I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t find it very effective after a while.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that was constantly too dry or irritated when using aluminum-based deodorants. Skin looks and feels great with Herbal Clear!&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the non-sport version of this deodorant and it works just as well. I think the only difference is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Deodorant works for me most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it when I know that I am going to sweat a lot or when it is really hot out.&lt;br /&gt;It is not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Not the best scent, but it works!</li>
