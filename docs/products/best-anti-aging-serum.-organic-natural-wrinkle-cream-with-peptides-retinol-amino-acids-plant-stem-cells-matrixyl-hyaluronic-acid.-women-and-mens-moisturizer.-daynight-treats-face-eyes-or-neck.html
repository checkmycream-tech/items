            <li>As a woman who is not afraid to drop some money on a good product, I can&#x27;t even explain how awesome this product is and the price point is incredible.</li>

            <li>Seems to work good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m optimistic that I&#x27;ll have a good update to my review then.</li>
            <li>I suppose I am trying to keep my skin to be receptive of the good products.  </li>
            <li>Word to the wise, teacher your children</li>
            <li>It was surprising what toxic chemicals all of these mainstream companies use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a fair trial before writing a review.</li>
            <li>What one product may lack, another will have so they all work together to give me superior results.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice any  good changes.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before I ordered, and they were all good, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I have never used anything before that made my face look and feel so good.  </li>
            <li>I have good skin that is getting wrinkled because I am now 66 and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>God bless keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>can say I agree with the comments on how good it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>I have used Olay products for skin firming but feel this one is superior to those.</li>
            <li>I am fair complexed, and over 65.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll read that it doesn&#x27;t have a good smell.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t wear any makeup I like to use a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work, Xfacio Labs.</li>
            <li>For being 61, to hear that felt really good.</li>
            <li>I am delighted that I tried it and gave it a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles of this and gave it a good 8 weeks</li>
            <li>It smells the way you think something is good for you smells.  </li>
            <li>Your products are  wonderful but the real frosting on the cake is YOU!!!</li>
            <li>Nothing exceptional but good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product is great, but more important, the customer service is exceptionally awesome.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I think this product is wonderful and very inexpensive for the great results</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the improvement of my skin since I began using Xfacio.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this great serum, as I am involved in many skin care endeavors.  </li>
            <li>So, I got this instead and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it as well.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more products!</li>
            <li>why would I want another bottle of something in my cabinet that doesn&#x27;t work even if it is free?!?!  </li>
            <li>I want my free bottle of all of them because I know they WORK for me!!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I Love this product !</li>
            <li>Works perfect, I saw the results just at the first night ....</li>
            <li>I love the product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>But I am pretty impressed with what has transpired</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>, what can I say I just look better!</li>
            <li>Love them !</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s great because strong scented moisturizers make me nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very friendly and helpful!</li>
            <li>I am always hip on making myself look amazing....</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>The results from using this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING product.</li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing for any skin type.  </li>
            <li>Took a photo of myself one month ago and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It does soften my skin and make it look amazing.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li>I also REALLY liked how it smelled, or rather, didn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>+ days, I have had some nice compliments form friends,</li>
            <li>Anyway, is a great product that gives result in short period of time, great!</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t say that it helped these kind of problems, but definetly improvement in wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I need more time to see results but this product feels so good when applied.</li>
            <li>Thanks for great service and product!</li>
            <li>but i was using another kind before this one</li>
            <li>I have been using this for maybe a month to be able to give a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am seeing a nice improvement in the tightening of my skin and the collagen in my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>It smells astringent, kind of witch hazel-like.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this product does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I am not one to wear any kind of foundation or powder except for some except for some blush.  </li>
            <li>Now he want his own bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although in the headline it says it &amp;#34;lifts and tightens,&amp;#34; I do not see that kind of results.</li>
            <li>Along with actually doing what it claims to do, it feels great going on, is a superb moisturizer, and has even helped even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>This one is nice and I will order it again to be part of my multi-product regime.</li>
            <li>I am impressed that it really does what it says,</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>My daughter in law sales and brand product for this kind of cream</li>
            <li>and I just ordered my second bottle which I&#x27;m happy to announce worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It is ever bit as good as the strivectin and maybe even better.</li>
            <li>The serum has a nice texture to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it has no oily feeling and doesn&#x27;t leave</li>
            <li>I bought the whole line and must say these products leave your skin beautiful!!</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>XFACIO had the most and the best reviews, after reading, I purchased my first jar two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product so far!!</li>
            <li>does not leave your skin with a film over, is smooth, absorbs quickly, absolutly wonderful; I used it together with hyaluric acid and vit</li>
            <li>The serum is very rich but not greasy, makes the skin feel very smooth, and had NO IRRITATION even using it around my eyes!</li>
            <li>There are products out there just as good or even better in a container that is more efficient.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product!  </li>
            <li>Feels very nice going on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Feels GREAT!,  with in a week I could see a more vibrant face and firming of my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good clean effective product.</li>
            <li>We both are very happy with these products and highly recommend XFACIO LABS to anyone looking to have truly healthy skin and not just a temporary fix.</li>
            <li>helped a great deal with the laugh lines which I use it for.</li>
            <li>ad am looking for something more effective.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, is absorbed into the skin and feels great.</li>
            <li>but they are incredibly minimized with much improved skin tone and clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good smell, and let the skin of your face smooth for all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my results so far.  </li>
            <li>This anti aging serum  is wonderful, it makes your face so soft.  </li>
            <li>In addition to solving my problem immediately her own lovely personality just shined through.</li>
            <li>Those reviews are true, it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell, but I put a night cream over it that does (after the serum soaks into my skin and dries) and the night cream smells good.  </li>
            <li>The special pump works perfectly and the anti aging serum comes out easily and applies smoothly to my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>

            <li>This stuff feels great even with first time use.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too good to be true than its a lie.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and absorbs well into my skin.</li>
            <li>and my face feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>I do see a difference, and skin feels very smooth.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The biggest difference at this point is my neck which looks much better.  </li>
            <li>I also use a cream with ceramides and hyaluronic acid that I love, but if I get it too close to my eyes</li>
            <li>This is why there are so, so, so MANY reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than many products in the market.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>Also, I love the way it makes my face feel moisturized even though it is not advertised as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is nice that the seller will send me a free jar for trying this product.</li>
            <li>They follow up with you and make sure you like the product and how it is working for you.</li>

            <li>, I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>This is better.  </li>
            <li>There is so much better serums out there.  </li>
            <li>However, it had too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I guess this cream is ok but</li>
            <li>and I did take the top off and scrape some of the serum out.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and the texture of the creme.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be exploring more of the Xfacio products.</li>
            <li>In fact, most have asked me if I changed my make up :</li>
            <li>I really love this product</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>After a challenging arrival of the product (to no fault of the company) the magical serum arrived.  </li>
            <li>and I would love to have a years supply.  </li>
            <li>Again, thanks for the great customer service...</li>
            <li>I love it and plan to never be out of it again.</li>
            <li>Customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on and absorbs.</li>
            <li>I think I will be using this for some time to come, I love the results.</li>
            <li>but when I went to reorder found the price had gone up way more</li>

            <li>Really love this serum.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, thank you.</li>

            <li>I really love this anti aging serum</li>
            <li>I will no doubt buy more.  </li>
            <li>If nothing else it will help keep more wrinkles from showing up.</li>
            <li>My lines have already softened and my skin looks supple and healthy</li>
            <li>I will continue to observe but am glad, at this point, that I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it was ok on my neck though.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product...wwill definitely purchase again</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE  </li>
            <li>I get many compliments since I stated using it.  </li>
            <li>Love what it has done for my neck too...</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I really love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love the jar and that it&#x27;s a  &amp;#34;Biophotonic&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using a hyaluronic acid as well, but after reading the review about the vitamin c, I think I will add it to my regimen.</li>
            <li>LOVE,LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Recieved Xfacio about 4 days ago, I love the feel of this product on my face from day one.</li>
            <li>I am 45 and even though I do not have many visable rinkles,</li>
            <li>Really do love what&#x27;s it&#x27;s doing for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love  the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than any cream I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>So far, sooo good!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery of a product which seems to be very effective for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but I love how it feels nice and cool when putting on face and neck after shower.</li>
            <li>On top of a fine product at an appropriate price, this company says it doesn&#x27;t test on animals, so I am all the more pleased.</li>
            <li>The serum is not oily and it has a good light scent which disappears quickly</li>
            <li>Nice texture, no bad smell, not greasy feeling</li>
            <li>The product is delightful to use and each bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I, like you, am a woman who is willing to spend money without having to mortgage her house on a good skin product, and I think I struck gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can honestly say it&#x27;s done a fantastic job at diminishing fine lines around my eyes and the deeper lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>After about a week, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that this serum could give such great results, but it has to be from this amazing serum...</li>
            <li>Many of the fragrant ones are too strong.  </li>
            <li>honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  </li>
            <li>She asked me what kind of product I&#x27;m using to have such a great skin elasticity.</li>
            <li>Makes you feel very special.</li>
            <li>I like the way it goes on,  very smooth and light.</li>
            <li>My skin is more supple and I&#x27;ve notice some of the fine lines diminishing.</li>
            <li>Prior I had tried Dermaset, which is a very good product, but a bit pricey to continue using for a longer period.</li>
            <li>but by the way it feels so far, I think it will work out great.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately after 8 days applying twice a day, my skin felt softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a light cream consistency.</li>
            <li>the company is more than fabulous to work with..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, and so far my skin is looking great</li>
            <li>It works which is the most important</li>
            <li>I think so far, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>At 71 years old I need all the help I can get, but this would be a great product whether you are 71 or 17.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the product and it seems to go on smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many serums and creams, and while I know there is no stopping the aging process, I do hope to find lotions that make my skin feel moisturized and comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a awesome face anti age cream that instantly makes your face feel cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li>so i am really trying to keep my skin in good shape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been searching for something reasonably priced, yet good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>At this point I have not noticed much difference in my skin but my skin feels good when I apply the serum.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very easily, and I am able to apply makeup right after the serum.  </li>
            <li>They e-mailed me right after I got it to see if it had arrived and asked me to let them know after using it how I liked it.  </li>
            <li>This shows that they really care that you get the most out of the product and are pleased with it!</li>
            <li>Three weeks after I purchased my first product, I just re-ordered and purchased two more jars!  </li>
            <li>I just received the cream and love the fresh scent and feel of it on my face!</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, it gives the smooth skin feeling, i&#x27;m 42 year old man</li>
            <li>Also, I like the texture as it is easy to put makeup overtop when needed.</li>
            <li>, it can be easily spread all over face, including neck and eyess</li>
            <li>Easy to use........</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my skin is much smoother/softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li>good product, would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Product seems to work better for me as an under eye cream than as a full face</li>
            <li>Upon my return I was met with some pretty nice compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t have anymore fine lines or wrinkles and can&#x27;t wait for my family to see my &amp;#34;new look&amp;#34; at our family reunion in June.  </li>
            <li>, the coloration is brighter, the fine lines are diminished, the elasticity seems improved.  </li>
            <li>It practically erases fine lines and severely reduces stubborn forehead wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li>It does well with fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>The texture feels fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give more feedback in a week or so, but my first reaction is I LOVE</li>
            <li>The fine lines have diminished and my skin tone is even.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines are not noticable anymore.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to trying out this product and it arrived quickly and has elegant packaging.</li>
            <li>It seems more like a mild moisturiser...period.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the product feels and absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Not a harsh smell, but a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>of my product was SUPER FAST!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have found this to be a light cream that is non-irritating &amp; seems to be softening fine lines.</li>
            <li>Nice large jar with almost 2 ounces.</li>
            <li>As for the customer service, Mia is outstanding and very helpful!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product, absorbs quickly and evenly, and leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 weeks and notice a huge  difference.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the how easily it is absorbed in the skin and goes on smoothly and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>This sounds like it could be a safe and effective product for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The light texture is so comfortable and not greasy.</li>
            <li>When you put it on your face, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel \\&quot;clogged\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Their money back guarantee is great though.</li>
            <li>-  well, my face is so smooth,the serum is luxurious and it is so light on my skin.  </li>
            <li>i would reccomend it, it is for sure worth the price, buy it now</li>
            <li>The product goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>velvety smooth consistency..</li>
            <li>think the company would double their sales and that would make us all happy.</li>
            <li>Glides on and leaves your face feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>, I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one</li>
            <li>it is cheap if compared to others antiaging cream</li>
            <li>It glides on my face like silk, and makes my face feel absolutely fantastic..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it absorbs well</li>
            <li>The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise.</li>
            <li>Great product it works from the second day of using</li>
            <li>Great results in short time....</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>; under my eyes and this product has definitly helped to smooth under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>with xfacio  advanced vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I noticed improvement in under a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice a day after cleansing my face and applied a light moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>It is light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>So I have to admit I&#x27;ve only used it for one day, but it feels GREAT on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>After some applications I could see a difference - collagen production is important and this serum encourages it.</li>
            <li>This was my second purchase; I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in during my 65+ years and this is, by far, the best!</li>
            <li>It is smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does not feel sticky or thick--especially important under makeup living in the humid South.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>But overall, great product.  </li>
            <li>This is important.</li>
            <li>Im 60 years old and as far as my complection goes it is not the best because years and years ago i had bump issues.</li>
            <li>So Far, So Good.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working -- so far so good.  </li>
            <li>My face feels soft with a nice healthy glow after I use all 4 products together.</li>
            <li>Waiting to see the results but so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>No, didn&#x27;t turn into a 25 year old, 6&#x27; gorgeous blond, athletic woman....</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been great: the cream is light (very little goes very long way), smells good (organic/leafy), great customer service, good price.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my facial skin gets &amp;#34;accustomed&amp;#34; to a product after 3-6 months and then my skin does not look as good as it did before, so what I do is &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34; to another very good products and then switch back to the original in 3 months.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product so far!</li>
            <li>I bought this product after have read the reviews from other buyers and they were totally right, it is a very good quality product and it delivers what it promises!</li>
            <li>It feels so refreshing; helps me wake up and feels so clean right before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THANK YOU very much for this FANTASTIC product!</li>
            <li>Best face serum hands down!!</li>
            <li>I love the smell too ;)</li>
            <li>I am going to be 70 this month, God Willing:)  </li>
            <li>i am very pleased so far with the results...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle yet, but there will be more to come.  </li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>When visited xfacio labs site I was excited to see that an eye cream will come out soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only have it for a couple of weeks, but what I can see so far is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am in my upper 50s, I&#x27;m not afraid to spend money on great products for my skin.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with this product and will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with this new product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Loving this product so far!</li>
            <li>Loving what I&#x27;m seeing so far!  </li>
            <li>So far I love the product!</li>
            <li>Other products that are this good at making my skin brighter and more supple also irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>w/the mildest and pure product on the market; however, even on days my face felt irritated XFacio made it feel so much better and reduced the burning and irritation experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, they tell you the jar the cream comes in is a special jar and not to throw it away.  </li>
            <li>I can feel my neck area tightening up right now!</li>
            <li>The texture is pleasant with no apparent fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so very much!!!</li>
            <li>I have not been using this for very long to see any difference yet, but I have high expectations because it goes on very smoothly and feels really great on my over 50 skin.</li>
            <li>She is happy with the product she has used but, it seems the bottle of serum was almost empty when she opened the package.</li>
            <li>I will also state that my boyfriend actually made a comment about how great my skin looked exactly two days after using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty good results so far.</li>
            <li>The product shipped fast, and the customer service follow up was outstanding.  </li>
            <li>This is a  true find!&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I have drawers and even a closet full of skin care products.</li>
            <li>They are so nice and professional.  </li>
            <li>(If I could, I jump into a full jar feet</li>
            <li>I used this for over a month to make sure I can really post a review.</li>
            <li>its ingredits only good can come out  Walter Sosa Trani</li>
            <li>Hopefully I love them as much.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to see how I look after a full month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Never purchase a product before and get such good customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells nice and my sensitive skin can handle a twice per day application.</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old and my skin is in a pretty good shape to start with.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it a week but already see a difference in my skin - softening of fine lines and more even skin tone!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, is absorbed quickly, and makes my skin feel really smooth.  </li>
            <li>I had some really dry places on my face and this product has helped remarkably already.</li>
            <li>This Xfacio Anti-Aging Serum is different, and I am excited to use it and very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and soft it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li>You get a great product at a reasonable price and can only get it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>At my age, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference, but I really like it as a fabulous  moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I like the that it absorbs quickly as my skin is oily and</li>
            <li>Super hydrating when used in conjunction with moisturizer</li>
            <li>Plus, quick delivery too.</li>
            <li>and it dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully light, cooling and refreshing serum-cream that leaves my skin feeling soft but not oily.  </li>
            <li>I use so many different &#x27;anti-aging&#x27;/&#x27;anti-wrinkle&#x27; creams that I can&#x27;t say for sure that this one does the trick all by itself</li>
            <li>I LOVE the fact that it&#x27;s organic, all natural and paraben free too.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves a clean fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, goes on well under make up.</li>
            <li>they respond quickly to any concern or question and they do what it takes to earn the business.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use over the next month where I should be able to say more.</li>
            <li>I got the product in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am trying several different brands of face cream to find what works best for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that really works!!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>First of all, the seller of this item was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve always been an avid consumer of Dr perricone products big price difference I loved how it smoothes in the skin and</li>
            <li>good moisture control for my dry skin, but</li>
            <li>It does make your skin very soft and it does make my face appear more evenly toned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using a few days (both morning and night), and am very pleased with how quickly this serum is absorbed into the skin--and have experienced no irritation.</li>
            <li>This was a first for me after ordering via Amazon for 25 years!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got!  </li>
            <li>The consistency is like whipped cream, absolutely AMAZING...Not to mention what it does for my skin!!  </li>
            <li>At age 60, I really needed something that would soften the fine lines and give my skin a firmer texture.  </li>
            <li>It came in very nice packaging---a black velour bag and glass jar.</li>
            <li>After looking for a face product that is mostly organic but also highly rated and not outrageously expensive I found Xfacio.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to confess when I saw all the positive reviews I was both excited and also suspect, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are definitely becoming less prominent.</li>
            <li>With this product, I literally saw a very noticeable difference over night and a huge difference in just days.  </li>
            <li>It is very hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels really light on my skin and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>That alone is worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Rarely write product feedback</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical.</li>
            <li>My 64 yr old skin looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>She kindly asked if I would write a review once i gave the product enough time to work.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different creams, and XFacio is the ONLY one that has given me results this good.</li>
            <li>In addition, my skins feels soft, is even-toned and has a lovely glow.</li>
            <li>Great product especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>and so it is also economical.</li>
            <li>I have laugh lines, crow&#x27;s feet, and your garden variety age spot.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and it gives my skin fresh look.</li>
            <li>I wanted soft, healthy looking skin...</li>
            <li>so when I applied it to my face, it absorbed immediately.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look like my 20 year old self, yet :)</li>
            <li>it does seem as though there&#x27;s a more natural vibrancy&lt;br /&gt;and glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>I do the smile test.....</li>
            <li>live in a dry climate, but Xfacio is a great help.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really skin friendly.</li>
            <li>Have used some of the most expensive brands available and this product holds its own!</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>You can put your mkeup right over it.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>It soaks right in,</li>
            <li>love it, there are no other words...</li>
            <li>and this works great for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>The laugh lines by my eyes are less noticeable and my face even looks good in the magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>I will probably reorder soon since it really takes about 3 months to see true results of skincare products.</li>
            <li>The more that I have used it, the more my skin is looking younger and I am 65 years old...  </li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin, like having rosacea like me, this is good for neck (at least for me) but not face or even decollate, the consistency was nice too.</li>
            <li>I have only used the product for a few days but am very happy with the quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, creamy, smells good and doesn&#x27;t feel thick, pasty or greasy.  </li>
            <li>I received the product quickly and the price was quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this goes on my face and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>and I really feel like it makes such a nice difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I am excited about the potential of it reducing the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I waited for 6 weeks to review this product as I wasn&#x27;t aware of any difference right at first.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast, too.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>and it came very fast.</li>
            <li>Bottom line this product smoothes and softenens, absorbs very fast into your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like how light it feels and how quickly and completely it absorbs.</li>
            <li>because I was excited bout using my new product.</li>
            <li>I have strong vertical lines around my lips and have been pleased that these are so much less visible with this product.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my skin felt really soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I would not say it was completely odorless, but the smell it had was extremely light and felt organic, not perfumey.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth immediately and even my wrinkles appear to plump out.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a two weeks, BUT I love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of this product and of course it is not a miracle serum</li>
            <li>Most definitely will order this product again.  </li>
            <li>After trying the product, my face instantly felt smoother and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Can feel the firming and supporting effect.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>this is my first Amazon review ever...</li>
            <li>following morning of the first time I used it, I could feel my skin more taught and just a fresher look.</li>
            <li>May actually be contributing to drier skin and more wrinkles and lines.</li>
            <li>But I love the fact that I can use the same product morning and night.</li>
            <li>I have just received my second jar of this lovely product.  </li>
            <li>Fast  shipping!</li>
            <li>This my first expirence with Xfacio</li>
            <li>, first I have  point out it lightweight</li>
            <li>Thanks XFACIO!</li>
            <li>I put this on first after cleansing my face and then follow with another moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product because my skin just drinks it up!  </li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars only because it was an okay moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>but I can already see that the texture of my skin is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>this really works!</li>
            <li>I am just about finished with my first jar of xfacio</li>
            <li>and  I like how smoothly the product goes on and how soft and moisturized my face feels.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, kudos to their customer service AKA Mia; she&#x27;s very responsive and helpful and does a bang up job on follow-up!</li>
            <li>No perfume, I have an allergic reaction to the perfumes in creams, and can&#x27;t use most big brand&#x27;s creams.</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relieved to have finally found a skin system that I&#x27;ll stick with and quit spending more to get the results that this gives.</li>
            <li>I Absolutely love this serum you can actually feel the lifting effects.</li>
            <li>and i tried too many products with big names</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many skincare products , I have to say the customer service is above and beyond what you could ever expect !</li>
            <li>Received this product several weeks ago and love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed reading Mia&#x27;s after purchase emails on facial cleansing tips.</li>
            <li>You can really tell the difference!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and will help de-age the hands, too!</li>
            <li>I use this serum under a moisturizer and so far so good on my 54 year old sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and yes, a little goes a very long way so a great value as well!</li>
            <li>The addition of a little aromatherapy would make this serum better than perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very much for being such an attentive company too!&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference right away, but about 2 weeks ago I happen to be looking at myself in the mirror and noticed that the skin under my chin wasn&#x27;t sagging as much.  </li>
            <li>This it&#x27;s an excellent cream for the money and does so much as a when even compared to more expensive creams that provide the same thing.</li>
            <li>I appreciate all the most current &amp; hot ingredients on the market at high potency!  </li>
            <li>I am completely amazed &amp; satisfied with the result of Xfacio anti aging serum - organic -natural - peptide .</li>
            <li>They love it not only because it works, but also because it is gentle, doesn&#x27;t bother their eyes when wearing their contacts, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>With the realization the cost may seem rather high, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>This lovely light-weight anti-aging sinks right into the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I think they hired a bunch of people to write positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>After just a week of use, I can see some positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>husband of 34 years noticed a positive difference of my face after about a week.</li>
            <li>I am hoping by using it in long term, I see even more improvement.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than if has in a long while.</li>
            <li>Started using it; this is my third day and my skin does feel different; I am 62 years old and am happy to have a cream that feels non sticky and glides into my skin.</li>
            <li>My face looks younger and so much more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the cream and the serum because my face is always dry</li>
            <li>and I feel it absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>As they did last time, the company shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>It gets irritated and red easily</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin the way so many others have done and it isn&#x27;t at all greasy.</li>
            <li>I mostly have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I am a lady of a &amp;#34; certain age&amp;#34; who used to have lines, lines, lines, on my face.  </li>
            <li>will certainly order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>I realize that they won&#x27;t ever disappear because this is a genetic problem, but they certainly aren&#x27;t so noticeable anymore.  </li>
            <li>but i AM ALWAYS DISSAPPOINTED, hopeing its different this time, as the price for Xfacio products is really reasonable compared to a lot of others, will give another reveiw after 28 days when I can see full results!</li>
            <li>Still, as far as fine lines and making the skin feel very soft, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Actually, the fine lines around my eyes are all but gone at this point.</li>
            <li>I do not see my deep wrinkles decreasing yet, but I do see some results on my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Frankly, although you have a good product, I didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference between this product and the previous products I&#x27;ve used as far as result.</li>
            <li>older ;-)&lt;br /&gt;That didn&#x27;t happen (really?)</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s not any better than the stuff you pay a little more extra at the grocery store like Oil of Olay Eye serum.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely re-purchase another and give the product a little more time.</li>
            <li>This serum feels very good going on, and my skin instantly seems to tighten, which makes it a good base for make up application.</li>
            <li>Again, I saw a big difference literally over night on both arms but a HUGE difference on the arm where I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid, and moisturizer  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this serum because it&#x27;s all natural with vitamins and no artificial fragrances.  </li>
            <li>preference is always to find paraben free products with natural ingredients and ones that are fragrance free, and since I am sensitive to fragrances and toxins this made a big difference to me.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t help it, hahaha...  </li>
            <li>I wrote the manufacturer and they were FANTASTIC in getting back to me with a helpful video.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come out fast, wasting the product.</li>
            <li>&quot; as I call menopause has come and taken its toll on parts of your body and face that do things you really don&#x27;t like...</li>
            <li>I tried this anti-aging serum by Xfacio and really like what its doing for me....</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well on my face</li>
            <li>My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product about 2 weeks ago because my very strict skincare regiment to control my acne-prone skin was drying out my face.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my skin look and</li>
            <li>I had took a close-up before picture, so I decided to take a pic at 4wks, and to my surprise there was absolutely decrease in the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a budget and the Xfacio anti-aging serum is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the company.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>BEWARE, they give you a free 2nd product if you write a review here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>For the price of this product you absolutely can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li>it goes on very nicely..not serum like.</li>
            <li>I will say is that I really really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with under eye wrinkles and bags.</li>
            <li>and then it really pays off.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, I could REALLY notice a difference, and so can my co-workers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>what time of the day or evening, is clear, bright, and has a natural pink tone to my cheeks now.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in the texture and tone of my skin since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li>At 64 years i am blessed to have no wrinkles but bags under my eyes and this really helps.</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>It really radiates my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really did not see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not seeing much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>You really need to take a close up photo when you start using and then again in 30 nd 60 days.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really see the difference in the texture and tone in my face.</li>
            <li>Reduces the lines around my mouth  texture of my skin feels much firmer</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch...</li>
            <li>I really appreciated this as I sometimes ignore the inserts in the boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this serum has no odor and feels very soothing going on.</li>
            <li>already.no fumes very ligh just what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>X-faciolabs is a gentle and soothing serum.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Serum.</li>
            <li>I like this product so much that I just made another order.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a reasonable price for serum.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, Mia, for your graciousness in fixing my problem in record time.</li>
            <li>Noticed absolutely nothing even after 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product.</li>
            <li>All products from this line have left my skin looking so great in such a short period of time  </li>
            <li>and thanks for buying our product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li>I like the quality of the pump, the serum pumps out very well and the look and design of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and am very hopeful to see its results.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very supple and toned.</li>
            <li>So far the cream is keeping my face smooth and soft feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a reduction in fine lines after a few weeks and am excited to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s smooth on my skin and for the first time in a very long time, I look like&lt;</li>
            <li>I always apply whatever product I use on my face on my hands also, WOW I can see the difference on my hands right away.</li>
            <li>I see prices out there for products , that may or may not work ,that only the rich could afford.</li>
            <li>I gave this a 4 star because I&#x27;ve just started using it, but am so excited about the results even after only 3 days.  </li>
            <li>My foundation goes on smoother and looks fresh and natural AND my under eye area looks refreshed and bright; as opposed to my normal look of complete fatigue and ready to drop dead!  </li>
            <li>My skin is dry and is easily irritated.  </li>
            <li>I will say that I believe dark circles under the eyes are genetic; however, if you don&#x27;t have \\&quot;eye baggage\\&quot;, make up does a better job hiding the circles.</li>
            <li>This Xfacio Labs Anti-Aging Serum is full of key, up-to-the-minute anti-aging ingredients.</li>
            <li>It not only makes my skin silky soft (which my husband loves to touch), it also helps to minimize the fine lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I also have pretty dry skin, and it has helped tremendously with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it certainly leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>There are much more effective, less expensive moisturisers available.  </li>
            <li>When I went for my monthly facial, my girl noticed that the texture of my skin is better, I had no extractions, and my skin appears overall smoother.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever been consistent with any facial product.</li>
            <li>I have only used this serum for a few days but my skin feels good ...</li>
            <li>It essentially has no scent, which I love, and I also apply it to the backs of my hands because it is a big jar for the money.</li>
            <li>Have you ever heard the two main ones described as \\&quot;1 1\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>I believe I see an improvement already on my face , particularly lines around eyes.  </li>
            <li>I just had a facial procedure done and the product is doing wonders at helping my skin to heal quickly.  </li>
            <li>I do believe that using multiple products, of this nature, provides better results than using only one.  </li>
            <li>the combination feels great on my tired old skin.</li>
            <li>No different than the $5 moisture lotion at the local store, better buys are out there somewhere</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product - highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend giving this a try</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you want a youthful look to your face, I would highly recommend you use this anti-aging serum.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using Xfacio for a few weeks but like the fact that the serum is light and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Certainly nothing to lose but the wrinkles so far.</li>
            <li>This product is like a little face lift in a bottle and I will be ordering another one and see if there are more changes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used countless face products and this one really works!!</li>
            <li>I really like this cream so far.  </li>
            <li>Some people say save your money and use general witch hazel instead of purchasing a higher priced product which has witch hazel in it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really too early to tell.</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old, spend way too much time in the sun</li>
            <li>It has a very silky, not heavy texture.  </li>
            <li>and I really like how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li>It arrived early and it comes with much online support for your beauty regime.</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied just with the way it moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t smell or feel greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li>I have used many creams in the past and they have never worked this fast.  </li>
            <li>I just noticed my laugh lines are starting to show even when I&#x27;m not laughing!  </li>
            <li>Does not irritate my skin like many products that contain SLS or harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin, Not sure if there is any noticeable difference yet, but I will continue to use for the next month or so... keep your fingers crossed...</li>
            <li>but I do know that it is a good moisturizer for putting all around the eyes because it is non irritating and doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to burn or get sticky during the night.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is it could smell just a little bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li>This cream after a weeks use is beginning to make such a big difference by the fine lines around my eyes have softened  and my crows feet have softened.</li>
            <li>This is cheap in comparison to other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>but I have to say this product is far superior to the many $$$$ products I&#x27;ve tried and been disappointed time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>This is a new comment...</li>
            <li>he said yes I figured you got new makeup.</li>
            <li>and she has already saved some money to order a new one.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to try your new products.</li>
            <li>I am a new customer and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I like the way my skin feels after applying the serum, very soft and smooth, not sticky (like some other serum products).  </li>
            <li>After the huge difference I saw this morning on the arm that I used 3 products instead of just 2, I&#x27;m definitely going back to using all 3 of those in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I was concerned I might have a reaction.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is also very professional.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the products are very reasonably priced, I always try products in different combinations to see if I can get results by using fewer products because of cost and time!  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very sensitive skin and can become irritated</li>
            <li>I have used various anti-aging serums over the past few years and Xfacio is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and how very little is needed to achieve hydration.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve noticed slight improvement on my skin, more firm, soft and smooth, and also, is a light-weight serum, without leaving greasy or sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time.</li>
            <li>I am not a big believer in topicals, and I have not had the results other posted about, I believe that may work better for Caucasian  skin.</li>
            <li>note it&#x27;s Veteran&#x27;s Day. ;)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a regular reviewer, but I know that there are many of us who make decisions on the basis of the product description plus other customers&#x27; input.</li>
            <li>Wow what a difference in 2 days!</li>
            <li>It has given me better results than any other facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews</li>
            <li>First they sent an email explaining proper use because they want the customer to experience results.</li>
            <li>Surprise, surprised!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third week of use and am absolutely amazed at the difference!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if the product really had anything to do with what I&#x27;m about to say , but just had a nice compliment a few days go when someone thought I was 20 years younger than my actual age.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to any wrinkle reduction since I have only used it for a short time, but I do love the fact that it contains only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>young, so do not give up, I am looking forward to the new serum</li>
            <li>so i checked back on the instructions the company had emailed me which really help.&lt;br /&gt;Fulfillment, delivery and follow-up were very professional.</li>
            <li>I dont really believe a topical creme can get rid of spots or age lines, I think you need drastic intervention for that, and I am sure there is data to prove me wrong, but in my experience, I don&#x27;t find this to be true -</li>
            <li>There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li>There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li>I know this to be true because my 17 year old foreign exchange &#x27;daughters&#x27; have asked to borrow a moisturizer, and I have given them my XFACIO.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been the sort of person to obsess about my skin or spend a lot on skin care products, but I recently bought a 12x mirror for plucking my eyebrows and it really showed up the little blemishes and fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve notice fine lines around my eyes and started using this serum - it really works.</li>
            <li>Of course, I also use Xfacio all over my face, but after I&#x27;ve finished with all of my skin products I go back and dab a little more of the Xfacio around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin and have tried many other products.</li>
            <li>half hour later my face was round, glowing, fresh, fresh, fresh!</li>
            <li>No information was sent to me by email or in the box and customer service was bright, chipper, and useless.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge turkey neck, but was definitely noticing that I could see a double chin starting</li>
            <li>Not only that, the serum is luxurious, goes on smoothly, and while it sinks into the skin, it also keeps the skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft to touch.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for those with sensitive skin and anyone wanting to try it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and soft but NOT greasy.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and when I wake up my face can feel its action....</li>
            <li>Leaves your face soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to receive this product in 2 days.</li>
            <li>Disclosure---I am 65 years old and have not been one of those people who pamper my skin.  </li>
            <li>I think price is reasonable , especially since it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I just turn 40  and could pass for early 30.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, Hispanic, light-med brown complected.</li>
            <li>otherwise the product shoots out at an unexpected angle and you don&#x27;t want to miss a drop of it.</li>
            <li>I feel it has improved my face and neck so far.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product (a friend of mine recommended it to me) and I thought, all creams are alike, how much difference can it possibly make?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old and just started using this cream.</li>
            <li>I waited at least a month before writing this review to make sure I could see the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fast approaching 50</li>
            <li>I am 62 years young, and my husband (and myself) do not believe in facelifts.</li>
            <li>I am 52 years old and always in search of anti aging products.  </li>
            <li>I have mature skin (age 53) and have noticed a softening of the crows feet around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have 56 years old, I used to products for my face Avanon and Derma e,  </li>
            <li>I am not a skin care novice (I am a clinical research professional) and</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and supple, I re-ordered another jar today</li>
            <li>I saw results within a week on my 61 year old face.</li>
            <li>So far, the item has been proved to be working, not drastically, but my skin did seem to be tighter after just two weeks of usage.</li>
            <li>I am 58 yr old man and</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and no heavy perfume scent.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>; He said it has really made a big difference.</li>
            <li>I think it is too early to see any results.  </li>
            <li>Natural wrinkle cream?  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>purchased their Vit C serum as well, and wow</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s with skin that has experinced life.  </li>
            <li>Thank you XFacio Labs for making the effort with natural and efficient ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I find that this product leaves  my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It felt so soothing on my face and my skin felt so soft after each application.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for going beyond the last mile for me.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised how well this product works.  </li>
            <li>my skin  is soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>, they are too sensitive for this.  </li>
            <li>I have only had this product a few weeks, however, I honestly feel an improvement in this short time.  </li>
            <li>Even though I have had it only for a few weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to see what long-term results will be for more reduction in wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have been using it regularly for 3 weeks but wasn&#x27;t paying too close attention to my fine lines, but the other day I realized there&#x27;s a slight-yet-noticeable difference already.  </li>
            <li>I used it on only the left side of my face while using another infomercial serum on the right side.</li>
            <li>also they send you friendly little emails just to say hi...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and the serum is light and non-greasy..</li>
            <li>I am noticing some small changes in the fine lines around eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li>BUT I definitely think my skin is smoother and my fine wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>This is only my first bottle but will not be my last.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many serums in the past, but have finally found one that works.  </li>
            <li>The seller emailed me to explain how the pump works as it is not a typical air pump.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it is a decent product, but does not do what it advertised, ie, remove saggy skin and bags and make you look younger.</li>
            <li>I am only halfway thru my first jar but will continue on to the second to finalize my opinion.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see much effect as a full face and neck cream, but have seen the skin under my eyes definately become less dry and baggy whilst using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>there is no other explaination!</li>
            <li>Also the neck lines are barely visible, I am 54 years old.</li>
            <li>when I run out I will definitely buy more and make it a regular addition to my everyday skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>My skin is more firm overall, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>product disappears so quickly and I need to use so little of it!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>After three weeks of twice daily application of both products on their respective sides, there is a noticeably improvement on the left side as compared to the right side.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to say the least!  </li>
            <li>The product goes on clean, no greasy feeling, and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light which I enjoy, heavy fragrance gives me a headache which then  I am unable to use.</li>
            <li>After using this product twice a day for almost two weeks, those pesky old lines have softened and my skin is glowing enough to get compliments.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Have only used the product since early February</li>
            <li>I am 64 yrs old and this product is making my skin feel so much younger.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing - in fact I thought my complexion became paler especially after I switched back to my regular brand.</li>
            <li>(apparently).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and have extremely sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>I believe the use of organic ingredients is a big part of why this works so well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far the knife seems to be the only cure.</li>
            <li>and I definitely had zero expectation of having my 25 year old skin return.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin extra soft.</li>
            <li>so a miracle is not expected.  </li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars looking for skincare that really works</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, having used a lot of anti-aging creams in the past, but after using using Xfacio anti aging serum for several weeks, I am happy to say that I have finally found a product that actually does what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this lotion, I noticed a slight fragrance though it says it&#x27;s unscented, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it since.  </li>
            <li>When I ran out of my previous jar, I tried an alternate cream temporarily and noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I do not have any wrinkles on my face however no matter what I used in the past, for me it never looked alive for more than a day or two with any product until Xfacio</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well priced and has lasted longer than other anti aging creams &amp; serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Not sure what you could use it for, maybe keeping the ashes of your pet snail that passed away recently or something...but a special jar is not to be sneezed at ..</li>
            <li>I have tried many face creams, expensive and not, and tend to get a reaction because my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>In a few weeks I hope to see changes worth reporting back here.</li>
            <li>had some trouble with the pump at first.</li>
            <li>My only complaints are than even using the tips provided by the seller to pump the product out (tap the bottom a few times, flip bottle over and tap the top a few times) there is always an issue of the lotion not coming out.</li>
            <li>No, it didn&#x27;t erase my DEEP lines that took 50+ years to create but it has smoothed out the wrinkles to the degree that my friends tell me I look \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; than usual, that I look more rested and less stressed.</li>
            <li>This organic serum delivers a high percentage of Matrixyl 3000 as well as peptides, retinol, plants stem cells, amino acids, argan oil, Vitamin B12 and other skin nutrients.</li>
            <li>i really do see a difference after a month and z half.</li>
            <li>I can say it that the scent is a little unusual.  </li>
            <li>It’s too early to see dramatic changes but my skin feels soft after using the Serum and pretty toned after using the Toner.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this product just do nothing,neither good or bad.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m optimistic that I&#x27;ll have a good update to my review then.</li>
            <li> I suppose I am trying to keep my skin to be receptive of the good products.  </li>
            <li> Word to the wise, teacher your children</li>
            <li> It was surprising what toxic chemicals all of these mainstream companies use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a fair trial before writing a review.</li>
            <li> What one product may lack, another will have so they all work together to give me superior results.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any  good changes.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I ordered, and they were all good, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I have never used anything before that made my face look and feel so good.  </li>
            <li> I have good skin that is getting wrinkled because I am now 66 and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> God bless keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> can say I agree with the comments on how good it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay products for skin firming but feel this one is superior to those.</li>
            <li> I am fair complexed, and over 65.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll read that it doesn&#x27;t have a good smell.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t wear any makeup I like to use a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work, Xfacio Labs.</li>
            <li> For being 61, to hear that felt really good.</li>
            <li> I am delighted that I tried it and gave it a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of this and gave it a good 8 weeks</li>
            <li> It smells the way you think something is good for you smells.  </li>
            <li> Your products are  wonderful but the real frosting on the cake is YOU!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing exceptional but good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is great, but more important, the customer service is exceptionally awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I think this product is wonderful and very inexpensive for the great results</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the improvement of my skin since I began using Xfacio.</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this great serum, as I am involved in many skin care endeavors.  </li>
            <li> So, I got this instead and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with it as well.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Just look at the ingredient list and all the most beneficial ingredients are at the top of the ingredient list!!  </li>

            <li> I am always hip on making myself look amazing....</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> The results from using this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing for any skin type.  </li>
            <li> Took a photo of myself one month ago and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It does soften my skin and make it look amazing.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li> I also REALLY liked how it smelled, or rather, didn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> + days, I have had some nice compliments form friends,</li>
            <li> Anyway, is a great product that gives result in short period of time, great!</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t say that it helped these kind of problems, but definetly improvement in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I need more time to see results but this product feels so good when applied.</li>
            <li> Thanks for great service and product!</li>
            <li> but i was using another kind before this one</li>
            <li> I have been using this for maybe a month to be able to give a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am seeing a nice improvement in the tightening of my skin and the collagen in my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> It smells astringent, kind of witch hazel-like.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this product does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I am not one to wear any kind of foundation or powder except for some except for some blush.  </li>
            <li> Now he want his own bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although in the headline it says it &amp;#34;lifts and tightens,&amp;#34; I do not see that kind of results.</li>
            <li> Along with actually doing what it claims to do, it feels great going on, is a superb moisturizer, and has even helped even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> This one is nice and I will order it again to be part of my multi-product regime.</li>
            <li> I am impressed that it really does what it says,</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> My daughter in law sales and brand product for this kind of cream</li>
            <li> and I just ordered my second bottle which I&#x27;m happy to announce worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It is ever bit as good as the strivectin and maybe even better.</li>
            <li> The serum has a nice texture to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it has no oily feeling and doesn&#x27;t leave</li>
            <li> I bought the whole line and must say these products leave your skin beautiful!!</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> XFACIO had the most and the best reviews, after reading, I purchased my first jar two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product so far!!</li>
            <li> does not leave your skin with a film over, is smooth, absorbs quickly, absolutly wonderful; I used it together with hyaluric acid and vit</li>
            <li> The serum is very rich but not greasy, makes the skin feel very smooth, and had NO IRRITATION even using it around my eyes!</li>
            <li> There are products out there just as good or even better in a container that is more efficient.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product!  </li>
            <li> Feels very nice going on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Feels GREAT!,  with in a week I could see a more vibrant face and firming of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good clean effective product.</li>
            <li> We both are very happy with these products and highly recommend XFACIO LABS to anyone looking to have truly healthy skin and not just a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> helped a great deal with the laugh lines which I use it for.</li>
            <li> ad am looking for something more effective.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, is absorbed into the skin and feels great.</li>
            <li> but they are incredibly minimized with much improved skin tone and clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good smell, and let the skin of your face smooth for all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my results so far.  </li>
            <li> This anti aging serum  is wonderful, it makes your face so soft.  </li>
            <li> In addition to solving my problem immediately her own lovely personality just shined through.</li>
            <li> Those reviews are true, it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell, but I put a night cream over it that does (after the serum soaks into my skin and dries) and the night cream smells good.  </li>
            <li> The special pump works perfectly and the anti aging serum comes out easily and applies smoothly to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I am excited to give it a good try.</li>
            <li> far, this one is the best cream, better than Dior.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product, I&#x27;ve ordered it twice already wanting to make sure the long term results were good and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Best product that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick, product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> This stuff feels great even with first time use.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too good to be true than its a lie.  </li>
            <li> It is very light and absorbs well into my skin.</li>
            <li> and my face feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> I do see a difference, and skin feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> The product is very light and refreshing...</li>
            <li> Also, the seller has been very attentive in checking in to make sure I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>

            <li> Love it .</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product in return for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really love this anti aging serum</li>
            <li> , my skin is more even, the wrinkles are minimized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try, and the product has a good guarantee if you don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> If you reorder, be sure to give it a month for shipping.  </li>
            <li> Within the first week I saw amazing results!</li>
            <li> I love that their product is organic, and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> My skin was okay, but I needed more - I needed it to feel and look healthy.  </li>
            <li> This product accomplishes that and more.  </li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference at this point is my neck which looks much better.  </li>
            <li> I also use a cream with ceramides and hyaluronic acid that I love, but if I get it too close to my eyes</li>
            <li> This is why there are so, so, so MANY reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than many products in the market.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon is carrying the Anti Aging Serum.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more :)</li>
            <li> and I really LOVE it.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;ll need it now.</li>

            <li> Also, I love the way it makes my face feel moisturized even though it is not advertised as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is nice that the seller will send me a free jar for trying this product.</li>
            <li> They follow up with you and make sure you like the product and how it is working for you.</li>

            <li> :- )</li>
            <li> I will never leave home without it, saying goodbye to my facial lines and flaws is awesome!!</li>
            <li> , I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> This is better.  </li>
            <li> There is so much better serums out there.  </li>
            <li> However, it had too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I guess this cream is ok but</li>
            <li> and I did take the top off and scrape some of the serum out.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and the texture of the creme.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be exploring more of the Xfacio products.</li>
            <li> In fact, most have asked me if I changed my make up :</li>
            <li> I really love this product</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> After a challenging arrival of the product (to no fault of the company) the magical serum arrived.  </li>
            <li> and I would love to have a years supply.  </li>
            <li> Again, thanks for the great customer service...</li>
            <li> I love it and plan to never be out of it again.</li>
            <li> Customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on and absorbs.</li>
            <li> I think I will be using this for some time to come, I love the results.</li>
            <li> but when I went to reorder found the price had gone up way more</li>
            <li> I will know better when I have used it longer.</li>
            <li> Really love this serum.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, thank you.</li>

            <li> This is a fabulous product!  </li>

            <li> I really love this anti aging serum</li>
            <li> I will no doubt buy more.  </li>
            <li> If nothing else it will help keep more wrinkles from showing up.</li>
            <li> My lines have already softened and my skin looks supple and healthy</li>
            <li> I will continue to observe but am glad, at this point, that I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it was ok on my neck though.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product...wwill definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE  </li>
            <li> I get many compliments since I stated using it.  </li>
            <li> Love what it has done for my neck too...</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love the jar and that it&#x27;s a  &amp;#34;Biophotonic&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using a hyaluronic acid as well, but after reading the review about the vitamin c, I think I will add it to my regimen.</li>
            <li> LOVE,LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Recieved Xfacio about 4 days ago, I love the feel of this product on my face from day one.</li>
            <li> I am 45 and even though I do not have many visable rinkles,</li>
            <li> Really do love what&#x27;s it&#x27;s doing for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love  the way it feels.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than any cream I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> So far, sooo good!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery of a product which seems to be very effective for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> but I love how it feels nice and cool when putting on face and neck after shower.</li>
            <li> On top of a fine product at an appropriate price, this company says it doesn&#x27;t test on animals, so I am all the more pleased.</li>
            <li> The serum is not oily and it has a good light scent which disappears quickly</li>
            <li> Nice texture, no bad smell, not greasy feeling</li>
            <li> The product is delightful to use and each bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I, like you, am a woman who is willing to spend money without having to mortgage her house on a good skin product, and I think I struck gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can honestly say it&#x27;s done a fantastic job at diminishing fine lines around my eyes and the deeper lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> After about a week, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that this serum could give such great results, but it has to be from this amazing serum...</li>
            <li> Many of the fragrant ones are too strong.  </li>
            <li> honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  </li>
            <li> She asked me what kind of product I&#x27;m using to have such a great skin elasticity.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel very special.</li>
            <li> I like the way it goes on,  very smooth and light.</li>
            <li> My skin is more supple and I&#x27;ve notice some of the fine lines diminishing.</li>
            <li> Prior I had tried Dermaset, which is a very good product, but a bit pricey to continue using for a longer period.</li>
            <li> but by the way it feels so far, I think it will work out great.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately after 8 days applying twice a day, my skin felt softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li> It is more of a light cream consistency.</li>
            <li> the company is more than fabulous to work with..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, and so far my skin is looking great</li>
            <li> It works which is the most important</li>
            <li> I think so far, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> At 71 years old I need all the help I can get, but this would be a great product whether you are 71 or 17.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the product and it seems to go on smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many serums and creams, and while I know there is no stopping the aging process, I do hope to find lotions that make my skin feel moisturized and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome face anti age cream that instantly makes your face feel cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li> so i am really trying to keep my skin in good shape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something reasonably priced, yet good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> At this point I have not noticed much difference in my skin but my skin feels good when I apply the serum.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very easily, and I am able to apply makeup right after the serum.  </li>
            <li> They e-mailed me right after I got it to see if it had arrived and asked me to let them know after using it how I liked it.  </li>
            <li> This shows that they really care that you get the most out of the product and are pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Three weeks after I purchased my first product, I just re-ordered and purchased two more jars!  </li>
            <li> I just received the cream and love the fresh scent and feel of it on my face!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, it gives the smooth skin feeling, i&#x27;m 42 year old man</li>
            <li> Also, I like the texture as it is easy to put makeup overtop when needed.</li>
            <li> , it can be easily spread all over face, including neck and eyess</li>
            <li> Easy to use........</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my skin is much smoother/softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li> good product, would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and makes your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work better for me as an under eye cream than as a full face</li>
            <li> Upon my return I was met with some pretty nice compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t have anymore fine lines or wrinkles and can&#x27;t wait for my family to see my &amp;#34;new look&amp;#34; at our family reunion in June.  </li>
            <li> , the coloration is brighter, the fine lines are diminished, the elasticity seems improved.  </li>
            <li> It practically erases fine lines and severely reduces stubborn forehead wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> It does well with fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> The texture feels fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give more feedback in a week or so, but my first reaction is I LOVE</li>
            <li> The fine lines have diminished and my skin tone is even.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines are not noticable anymore.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying out this product and it arrived quickly and has elegant packaging.</li>
            <li> It seems more like a mild moisturiser...period.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the product feels and absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not a harsh smell, but a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> of my product was SUPER FAST!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have found this to be a light cream that is non-irritating &amp; seems to be softening fine lines.</li>
            <li> Nice large jar with almost 2 ounces.</li>
            <li> As for the customer service, Mia is outstanding and very helpful!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product, absorbs quickly and evenly, and leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and notice a huge  difference.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the how easily it is absorbed in the skin and goes on smoothly and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> This sounds like it could be a safe and effective product for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The light texture is so comfortable and not greasy.</li>
            <li> When you put it on your face, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel \\&quot;clogged\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Their money back guarantee is great though.</li>
            <li> -  well, my face is so smooth,the serum is luxurious and it is so light on my skin.  </li>
            <li> i would reccomend it, it is for sure worth the price, buy it now</li>
            <li> The product goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> velvety smooth consistency..</li>
            <li> think the company would double their sales and that would make us all happy.</li>
            <li> Glides on and leaves your face feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> , I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one</li>
            <li> it is cheap if compared to others antiaging cream</li>
            <li> It glides on my face like silk, and makes my face feel absolutely fantastic..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it absorbs well</li>
            <li> The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise.</li>
            <li> Great product it works from the second day of using</li>
            <li> Great results in short time....</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> ; under my eyes and this product has definitly helped to smooth under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> with xfacio  advanced vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I noticed improvement in under a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice a day after cleansing my face and applied a light moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> It is light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> So I have to admit I&#x27;ve only used it for one day, but it feels GREAT on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> After some applications I could see a difference - collagen production is important and this serum encourages it.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase; I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in during my 65+ years and this is, by far, the best!</li>
            <li> It is smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel sticky or thick--especially important under makeup living in the humid South.  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> But overall, great product.  </li>
            <li> This is important.</li>
            <li> Im 60 years old and as far as my complection goes it is not the best because years and years ago i had bump issues.</li>
            <li> So Far, So Good.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working -- so far so good.  </li>
            <li> My face feels soft with a nice healthy glow after I use all 4 products together.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see the results but so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> No, didn&#x27;t turn into a 25 year old, 6&#x27; gorgeous blond, athletic woman....</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been great: the cream is light (very little goes very long way), smells good (organic/leafy), great customer service, good price.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my facial skin gets &amp;#34;accustomed&amp;#34; to a product after 3-6 months and then my skin does not look as good as it did before, so what I do is &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34; to another very good products and then switch back to the original in 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after have read the reviews from other buyers and they were totally right, it is a very good quality product and it delivers what it promises!</li>
            <li> It feels so refreshing; helps me wake up and feels so clean right before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THANK YOU very much for this FANTASTIC product!</li>
            <li> Best face serum hands down!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell too ;)</li>
            <li> I am going to be 70 this month, God Willing:)  </li>
            <li> i am very pleased so far with the results...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle yet, but there will be more to come.  </li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> When visited xfacio labs site I was excited to see that an eye cream will come out soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only have it for a couple of weeks, but what I can see so far is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I am in my upper 50s, I&#x27;m not afraid to spend money on great products for my skin.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this product and will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy with this new product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Loving this product so far!</li>
            <li> Loving what I&#x27;m seeing so far!  </li>
            <li> So far I love the product!</li>
            <li> Other products that are this good at making my skin brighter and more supple also irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> w/the mildest and pure product on the market; however, even on days my face felt irritated XFacio made it feel so much better and reduced the burning and irritation experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, they tell you the jar the cream comes in is a special jar and not to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> I can feel my neck area tightening up right now!</li>
            <li> The texture is pleasant with no apparent fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so very much!!!</li>
            <li> I have not been using this for very long to see any difference yet, but I have high expectations because it goes on very smoothly and feels really great on my over 50 skin.</li>
            <li> She is happy with the product she has used but, it seems the bottle of serum was almost empty when she opened the package.</li>
            <li> I will also state that my boyfriend actually made a comment about how great my skin looked exactly two days after using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty good results so far.</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast, and the customer service follow up was outstanding.  </li>
            <li> This is a  true find!&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have drawers and even a closet full of skin care products.</li>
            <li> They are so nice and professional.  </li>
            <li> (If I could, I jump into a full jar feet</li>
            <li> I used this for over a month to make sure I can really post a review.</li>
            <li> its ingredits only good can come out  Walter Sosa Trani</li>
            <li> Hopefully I love them as much.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see how I look after a full month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never purchase a product before and get such good customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells nice and my sensitive skin can handle a twice per day application.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and my skin is in a pretty good shape to start with.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a week but already see a difference in my skin - softening of fine lines and more even skin tone!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, is absorbed quickly, and makes my skin feel really smooth.  </li>
            <li> I had some really dry places on my face and this product has helped remarkably already.</li>
            <li> This Xfacio Anti-Aging Serum is different, and I am excited to use it and very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and soft it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li> You get a great product at a reasonable price and can only get it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> At my age, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference, but I really like it as a fabulous  moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I like the that it absorbs quickly as my skin is oily and</li>
            <li> Super hydrating when used in conjunction with moisturizer</li>
            <li> Plus, quick delivery too.</li>
            <li> and it dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light, cooling and refreshing serum-cream that leaves my skin feeling soft but not oily.  </li>
            <li> I use so many different &#x27;anti-aging&#x27;/&#x27;anti-wrinkle&#x27; creams that I can&#x27;t say for sure that this one does the trick all by itself</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fact that it&#x27;s organic, all natural and paraben free too.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves a clean fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, goes on well under make up.</li>
            <li> they respond quickly to any concern or question and they do what it takes to earn the business.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use over the next month where I should be able to say more.</li>
            <li> I got the product in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am trying several different brands of face cream to find what works best for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that really works!!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> First of all, the seller of this item was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve always been an avid consumer of Dr perricone products big price difference I loved how it smoothes in the skin and</li>
            <li> good moisture control for my dry skin, but</li>
            <li> It does make your skin very soft and it does make my face appear more evenly toned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using a few days (both morning and night), and am very pleased with how quickly this serum is absorbed into the skin--and have experienced no irritation.</li>
            <li> This was a first for me after ordering via Amazon for 25 years!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what I got!  </li>
            <li> The consistency is like whipped cream, absolutely AMAZING...Not to mention what it does for my skin!!  </li>
            <li> At age 60, I really needed something that would soften the fine lines and give my skin a firmer texture.  </li>
            <li> It came in very nice packaging---a black velour bag and glass jar.</li>
            <li> After looking for a face product that is mostly organic but also highly rated and not outrageously expensive I found Xfacio.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to confess when I saw all the positive reviews I was both excited and also suspect, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are definitely becoming less prominent.</li>
            <li> With this product, I literally saw a very noticeable difference over night and a huge difference in just days.  </li>
            <li> It is very hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels really light on my skin and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> That alone is worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> Rarely write product feedback</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical.</li>
            <li> My 64 yr old skin looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> She kindly asked if I would write a review once i gave the product enough time to work.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different creams, and XFacio is the ONLY one that has given me results this good.</li>
            <li> In addition, my skins feels soft, is even-toned and has a lovely glow.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I think this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> and so it is also economical.</li>
            <li> I have laugh lines, crow&#x27;s feet, and your garden variety age spot.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and it gives my skin fresh look.</li>
            <li> I wanted soft, healthy looking skin...</li>
            <li> so when I applied it to my face, it absorbed immediately.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look like my 20 year old self, yet :)</li>
            <li> it does seem as though there&#x27;s a more natural vibrancy&lt;br /&gt;and glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> I do the smile test.....</li>
            <li> live in a dry climate, but Xfacio is a great help.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really skin friendly.</li>
            <li> Have used some of the most expensive brands available and this product holds its own!</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> You can put your mkeup right over it.  </li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> It soaks right in,</li>
            <li> love it, there are no other words...</li>
            <li> and this works great for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> The laugh lines by my eyes are less noticeable and my face even looks good in the magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> I will probably reorder soon since it really takes about 3 months to see true results of skincare products.</li>
            <li> The more that I have used it, the more my skin is looking younger and I am 65 years old...  </li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin, like having rosacea like me, this is good for neck (at least for me) but not face or even decollate, the consistency was nice too.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for a few days but am very happy with the quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, creamy, smells good and doesn&#x27;t feel thick, pasty or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and the price was quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way this goes on my face and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> and I really feel like it makes such a nice difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I am excited about the potential of it reducing the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I waited for 6 weeks to review this product as I wasn&#x27;t aware of any difference right at first.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast, too.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> and it came very fast.</li>
            <li> Bottom line this product smoothes and softenens, absorbs very fast into your skin.</li>
            <li> I really like how light it feels and how quickly and completely it absorbs.</li>
            <li> because I was excited bout using my new product.</li>
            <li> I have strong vertical lines around my lips and have been pleased that these are so much less visible with this product.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin felt really soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I would not say it was completely odorless, but the smell it had was extremely light and felt organic, not perfumey.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth immediately and even my wrinkles appear to plump out.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a two weeks, BUT I love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of this product and of course it is not a miracle serum</li>
            <li> Most definitely will order this product again.  </li>
            <li> After trying the product, my face instantly felt smoother and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Can feel the firming and supporting effect.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> this is my first Amazon review ever...</li>
            <li> following morning of the first time I used it, I could feel my skin more taught and just a fresher look.</li>
            <li> May actually be contributing to drier skin and more wrinkles and lines.</li>
            <li> But I love the fact that I can use the same product morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have just received my second jar of this lovely product.  </li>
            <li> Fast  shipping!</li>
            <li> This my first expirence with Xfacio</li>
            <li> , first I have  point out it lightweight</li>
            <li> Thanks XFACIO!</li>
            <li> I put this on first after cleansing my face and then follow with another moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product because my skin just drinks it up!  </li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars only because it was an okay moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> but I can already see that the texture of my skin is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> this really works!</li>
            <li> I am just about finished with my first jar of xfacio</li>
            <li> and  I like how smoothly the product goes on and how soft and moisturized my face feels.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, kudos to their customer service AKA Mia; she&#x27;s very responsive and helpful and does a bang up job on follow-up!</li>
            <li> No perfume, I have an allergic reaction to the perfumes in creams, and can&#x27;t use most big brand&#x27;s creams.</li>
            <li> and I can really see a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relieved to have finally found a skin system that I&#x27;ll stick with and quit spending more to get the results that this gives.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love this serum you can actually feel the lifting effects.</li>
            <li> and i tried too many products with big names</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many skincare products , I have to say the customer service is above and beyond what you could ever expect !</li>
            <li> Received this product several weeks ago and love it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed reading Mia&#x27;s after purchase emails on facial cleansing tips.</li>
            <li> You can really tell the difference!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and will help de-age the hands, too!</li>
            <li> I use this serum under a moisturizer and so far so good on my 54 year old sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and yes, a little goes a very long way so a great value as well!</li>
            <li> The addition of a little aromatherapy would make this serum better than perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very much for being such an attentive company too!&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference right away, but about 2 weeks ago I happen to be looking at myself in the mirror and noticed that the skin under my chin wasn&#x27;t sagging as much.  </li>
            <li> This it&#x27;s an excellent cream for the money and does so much as a when even compared to more expensive creams that provide the same thing.</li>
            <li> I appreciate all the most current &amp; hot ingredients on the market at high potency!  </li>
            <li> I am completely amazed &amp; satisfied with the result of Xfacio anti aging serum - organic -natural - peptide .</li>
            <li> They love it not only because it works, but also because it is gentle, doesn&#x27;t bother their eyes when wearing their contacts, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> With the realization the cost may seem rather high, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This lovely light-weight anti-aging sinks right into the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I think they hired a bunch of people to write positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> After just a week of use, I can see some positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> husband of 34 years noticed a positive difference of my face after about a week.</li>
            <li> I am hoping by using it in long term, I see even more improvement.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than if has in a long while.</li>
            <li> Started using it; this is my third day and my skin does feel different; I am 62 years old and am happy to have a cream that feels non sticky and glides into my skin.</li>
            <li> My face looks younger and so much more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the cream and the serum because my face is always dry</li>
            <li> and I feel it absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> As they did last time, the company shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> It gets irritated and red easily</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin the way so many others have done and it isn&#x27;t at all greasy.</li>
            <li> I mostly have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a lady of a &amp;#34; certain age&amp;#34; who used to have lines, lines, lines, on my face.  </li>
            <li> will certainly order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I realize that they won&#x27;t ever disappear because this is a genetic problem, but they certainly aren&#x27;t so noticeable anymore.  </li>
            <li> but i AM ALWAYS DISSAPPOINTED, hopeing its different this time, as the price for Xfacio products is really reasonable compared to a lot of others, will give another reveiw after 28 days when I can see full results!</li>
            <li> Still, as far as fine lines and making the skin feel very soft, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Actually, the fine lines around my eyes are all but gone at this point.</li>
            <li> I do not see my deep wrinkles decreasing yet, but I do see some results on my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Frankly, although you have a good product, I didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference between this product and the previous products I&#x27;ve used as far as result.</li>
            <li> older ;-)&lt;br /&gt;That didn&#x27;t happen (really?)</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not any better than the stuff you pay a little more extra at the grocery store like Oil of Olay Eye serum.  </li>
            <li> I will most likely re-purchase another and give the product a little more time.</li>
            <li> This serum feels very good going on, and my skin instantly seems to tighten, which makes it a good base for make up application.</li>
            <li> Again, I saw a big difference literally over night on both arms but a HUGE difference on the arm where I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid, and moisturizer  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this serum because it&#x27;s all natural with vitamins and no artificial fragrances.  </li>
            <li> preference is always to find paraben free products with natural ingredients and ones that are fragrance free, and since I am sensitive to fragrances and toxins this made a big difference to me.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t help it, hahaha...  </li>
            <li> I wrote the manufacturer and they were FANTASTIC in getting back to me with a helpful video.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t come out fast, wasting the product.</li>
            <li> &quot; as I call menopause has come and taken its toll on parts of your body and face that do things you really don&#x27;t like...</li>
            <li> I tried this anti-aging serum by Xfacio and really like what its doing for me....</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well on my face</li>
            <li> My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 weeks ago because my very strict skincare regiment to control my acne-prone skin was drying out my face.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my skin look and</li>
            <li> I had took a close-up before picture, so I decided to take a pic at 4wks, and to my surprise there was absolutely decrease in the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a budget and the Xfacio anti-aging serum is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the company.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> BEWARE, they give you a free 2nd product if you write a review here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> For the price of this product you absolutely can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li> it goes on very nicely..not serum like.</li>
            <li> I will say is that I really really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with under eye wrinkles and bags.</li>
            <li> and then it really pays off.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, I could REALLY notice a difference, and so can my co-workers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> what time of the day or evening, is clear, bright, and has a natural pink tone to my cheeks now.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in the texture and tone of my skin since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> At 64 years i am blessed to have no wrinkles but bags under my eyes and this really helps.</li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> It really radiates my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really did not see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not seeing much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> You really need to take a close up photo when you start using and then again in 30 nd 60 days.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really see the difference in the texture and tone in my face.</li>
            <li> Reduces the lines around my mouth  texture of my skin feels much firmer</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch...</li>
            <li> I really appreciated this as I sometimes ignore the inserts in the boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this serum has no odor and feels very soothing going on.</li>
            <li> already.no fumes very ligh just what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> X-faciolabs is a gentle and soothing serum.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this Serum.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much that I just made another order.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a reasonable price for serum.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, Mia, for your graciousness in fixing my problem in record time.</li>
            <li> Noticed absolutely nothing even after 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product.</li>
            <li> All products from this line have left my skin looking so great in such a short period of time  </li>
            <li> and thanks for buying our product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li> I like the quality of the pump, the serum pumps out very well and the look and design of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and am very hopeful to see its results.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very supple and toned.</li>
            <li> So far the cream is keeping my face smooth and soft feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a reduction in fine lines after a few weeks and am excited to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s smooth on my skin and for the first time in a very long time, I look like&lt;</li>
            <li> I always apply whatever product I use on my face on my hands also, WOW I can see the difference on my hands right away.</li>
            <li> I see prices out there for products , that may or may not work ,that only the rich could afford.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star because I&#x27;ve just started using it, but am so excited about the results even after only 3 days.  </li>
            <li> My foundation goes on smoother and looks fresh and natural AND my under eye area looks refreshed and bright; as opposed to my normal look of complete fatigue and ready to drop dead!  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry and is easily irritated.  </li>
            <li> I will say that I believe dark circles under the eyes are genetic; however, if you don&#x27;t have \\&quot;eye baggage\\&quot;, make up does a better job hiding the circles.</li>
            <li> This Xfacio Labs Anti-Aging Serum is full of key, up-to-the-minute anti-aging ingredients.</li>
            <li> It not only makes my skin silky soft (which my husband loves to touch), it also helps to minimize the fine lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I also have pretty dry skin, and it has helped tremendously with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it certainly leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> There are much more effective, less expensive moisturisers available.  </li>
            <li> When I went for my monthly facial, my girl noticed that the texture of my skin is better, I had no extractions, and my skin appears overall smoother.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever been consistent with any facial product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this serum for a few days but my skin feels good ...</li>
            <li> It essentially has no scent, which I love, and I also apply it to the backs of my hands because it is a big jar for the money.</li>
            <li> Have you ever heard the two main ones described as \\&quot;1 1\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> I believe I see an improvement already on my face , particularly lines around eyes.  </li>
            <li> I just had a facial procedure done and the product is doing wonders at helping my skin to heal quickly.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that using multiple products, of this nature, provides better results than using only one.  </li>
            <li> the combination feels great on my tired old skin.</li>
            <li> No different than the $5 moisture lotion at the local store, better buys are out there somewhere</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product - highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend giving this a try</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you want a youthful look to your face, I would highly recommend you use this anti-aging serum.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Xfacio for a few weeks but like the fact that the serum is light and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Certainly nothing to lose but the wrinkles so far.</li>
            <li> This product is like a little face lift in a bottle and I will be ordering another one and see if there are more changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless face products and this one really works!!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream so far.  </li>
            <li> Some people say save your money and use general witch hazel instead of purchasing a higher priced product which has witch hazel in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too early to tell.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old, spend way too much time in the sun</li>
            <li> It has a very silky, not heavy texture.  </li>
            <li> and I really like how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li> It arrived early and it comes with much online support for your beauty regime.</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied just with the way it moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t smell or feel greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> I have used many creams in the past and they have never worked this fast.  </li>
            <li> I just noticed my laugh lines are starting to show even when I&#x27;m not laughing!  </li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin like many products that contain SLS or harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin, Not sure if there is any noticeable difference yet, but I will continue to use for the next month or so... keep your fingers crossed...</li>
            <li> but I do know that it is a good moisturizer for putting all around the eyes because it is non irritating and doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to burn or get sticky during the night.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is it could smell just a little bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li> This cream after a weeks use is beginning to make such a big difference by the fine lines around my eyes have softened  and my crows feet have softened.</li>
            <li> This is cheap in comparison to other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> but I have to say this product is far superior to the many $$$$ products I&#x27;ve tried and been disappointed time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> This is a new comment...</li>
            <li> he said yes I figured you got new makeup.</li>
            <li> and she has already saved some money to order a new one.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to try your new products.</li>
            <li> I am a new customer and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels after applying the serum, very soft and smooth, not sticky (like some other serum products).  </li>
            <li> After the huge difference I saw this morning on the arm that I used 3 products instead of just 2, I&#x27;m definitely going back to using all 3 of those in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I was concerned I might have a reaction.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is also very professional.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the products are very reasonably priced, I always try products in different combinations to see if I can get results by using fewer products because of cost and time!  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very sensitive skin and can become irritated</li>
            <li> I have used various anti-aging serums over the past few years and Xfacio is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and how very little is needed to achieve hydration.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve noticed slight improvement on my skin, more firm, soft and smooth, and also, is a light-weight serum, without leaving greasy or sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time.</li>
            <li> I am not a big believer in topicals, and I have not had the results other posted about, I believe that may work better for Caucasian  skin.</li>
            <li> note it&#x27;s Veteran&#x27;s Day. ;)</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a regular reviewer, but I know that there are many of us who make decisions on the basis of the product description plus other customers&#x27; input.</li>
            <li> Wow what a difference in 2 days!</li>
            <li> It has given me better results than any other facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews</li>
            <li> First they sent an email explaining proper use because they want the customer to experience results.</li>
            <li> Surprise, surprised!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third week of use and am absolutely amazed at the difference!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if the product really had anything to do with what I&#x27;m about to say , but just had a nice compliment a few days go when someone thought I was 20 years younger than my actual age.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to any wrinkle reduction since I have only used it for a short time, but I do love the fact that it contains only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> young, so do not give up, I am looking forward to the new serum</li>
            <li> so i checked back on the instructions the company had emailed me which really help.&lt;br /&gt;Fulfillment, delivery and follow-up were very professional.</li>
            <li> I dont really believe a topical creme can get rid of spots or age lines, I think you need drastic intervention for that, and I am sure there is data to prove me wrong, but in my experience, I don&#x27;t find this to be true -</li>
            <li> There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li> There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li> I know this to be true because my 17 year old foreign exchange &#x27;daughters&#x27; have asked to borrow a moisturizer, and I have given them my XFACIO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been the sort of person to obsess about my skin or spend a lot on skin care products, but I recently bought a 12x mirror for plucking my eyebrows and it really showed up the little blemishes and fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve notice fine lines around my eyes and started using this serum - it really works.</li>
            <li> Of course, I also use Xfacio all over my face, but after I&#x27;ve finished with all of my skin products I go back and dab a little more of the Xfacio around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin and have tried many other products.</li>
            <li> half hour later my face was round, glowing, fresh, fresh, fresh!</li>
            <li> No information was sent to me by email or in the box and customer service was bright, chipper, and useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge turkey neck, but was definitely noticing that I could see a double chin starting</li>
            <li> Not only that, the serum is luxurious, goes on smoothly, and while it sinks into the skin, it also keeps the skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft to touch.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for those with sensitive skin and anyone wanting to try it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and soft but NOT greasy.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and when I wake up my face can feel its action....</li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to receive this product in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Disclosure---I am 65 years old and have not been one of those people who pamper my skin.  </li>
            <li> I think price is reasonable , especially since it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I just turn 40  and could pass for early 30.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, Hispanic, light-med brown complected.</li>
            <li> otherwise the product shoots out at an unexpected angle and you don&#x27;t want to miss a drop of it.</li>
            <li> I feel it has improved my face and neck so far.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product (a friend of mine recommended it to me) and I thought, all creams are alike, how much difference can it possibly make?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and just started using this cream.</li>
            <li> I waited at least a month before writing this review to make sure I could see the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fast approaching 50</li>
            <li> I am 62 years young, and my husband (and myself) do not believe in facelifts.</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and always in search of anti aging products.  </li>
            <li> I have mature skin (age 53) and have noticed a softening of the crows feet around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have 56 years old, I used to products for my face Avanon and Derma e,  </li>
            <li> I am not a skin care novice (I am a clinical research professional) and</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and supple, I re-ordered another jar today</li>
            <li> I saw results within a week on my 61 year old face.</li>
            <li> So far, the item has been proved to be working, not drastically, but my skin did seem to be tighter after just two weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I am 58 yr old man and</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and no heavy perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> ; He said it has really made a big difference.</li>
            <li> I think it is too early to see any results.  </li>
            <li> Natural wrinkle cream?  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> purchased their Vit C serum as well, and wow</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s with skin that has experinced life.  </li>
            <li> Thank you XFacio Labs for making the effort with natural and efficient ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I find that this product leaves  my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It felt so soothing on my face and my skin felt so soft after each application.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for going beyond the last mile for me.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised how well this product works.  </li>
            <li> my skin  is soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> , they are too sensitive for this.  </li>
            <li> I have only had this product a few weeks, however, I honestly feel an improvement in this short time.  </li>
            <li> Even though I have had it only for a few weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to see what long-term results will be for more reduction in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly for 3 weeks but wasn&#x27;t paying too close attention to my fine lines, but the other day I realized there&#x27;s a slight-yet-noticeable difference already.  </li>
            <li> I used it on only the left side of my face while using another infomercial serum on the right side.</li>
            <li> also they send you friendly little emails just to say hi...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and the serum is light and non-greasy..</li>
            <li> I am noticing some small changes in the fine lines around eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li> BUT I definitely think my skin is smoother and my fine wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is only my first bottle but will not be my last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many serums in the past, but have finally found one that works.  </li>
            <li> The seller emailed me to explain how the pump works as it is not a typical air pump.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it is a decent product, but does not do what it advertised, ie, remove saggy skin and bags and make you look younger.</li>
            <li> I am only halfway thru my first jar but will continue on to the second to finalize my opinion.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much effect as a full face and neck cream, but have seen the skin under my eyes definately become less dry and baggy whilst using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> there is no other explaination!</li>
            <li> Also the neck lines are barely visible, I am 54 years old.</li>
            <li> when I run out I will definitely buy more and make it a regular addition to my everyday skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> My skin is more firm overall, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> product disappears so quickly and I need to use so little of it!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> After three weeks of twice daily application of both products on their respective sides, there is a noticeably improvement on the left side as compared to the right side.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to say the least!  </li>
            <li> The product goes on clean, no greasy feeling, and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very light which I enjoy, heavy fragrance gives me a headache which then  I am unable to use.</li>
            <li> After using this product twice a day for almost two weeks, those pesky old lines have softened and my skin is glowing enough to get compliments.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Have only used the product since early February</li>
            <li> I am 64 yrs old and this product is making my skin feel so much younger.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing - in fact I thought my complexion became paler especially after I switched back to my regular brand.</li>
            <li> (apparently).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and have extremely sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> I believe the use of organic ingredients is a big part of why this works so well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far the knife seems to be the only cure.</li>
            <li> and I definitely had zero expectation of having my 25 year old skin return.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> so a miracle is not expected.  </li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars looking for skincare that really works</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, having used a lot of anti-aging creams in the past, but after using using Xfacio anti aging serum for several weeks, I am happy to say that I have finally found a product that actually does what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this lotion, I noticed a slight fragrance though it says it&#x27;s unscented, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it since.  </li>
            <li> When I ran out of my previous jar, I tried an alternate cream temporarily and noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I do not have any wrinkles on my face however no matter what I used in the past, for me it never looked alive for more than a day or two with any product until Xfacio</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well priced and has lasted longer than other anti aging creams &amp; serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not sure what you could use it for, maybe keeping the ashes of your pet snail that passed away recently or something...but a special jar is not to be sneezed at ..</li>
            <li> I have tried many face creams, expensive and not, and tend to get a reaction because my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> In a few weeks I hope to see changes worth reporting back here.</li>
            <li> had some trouble with the pump at first.</li>
            <li> My only complaints are than even using the tips provided by the seller to pump the product out (tap the bottom a few times, flip bottle over and tap the top a few times) there is always an issue of the lotion not coming out.</li>
            <li> No, it didn&#x27;t erase my DEEP lines that took 50+ years to create but it has smoothed out the wrinkles to the degree that my friends tell me I look \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; than usual, that I look more rested and less stressed.</li>
            <li> This organic serum delivers a high percentage of Matrixyl 3000 as well as peptides, retinol, plants stem cells, amino acids, argan oil, Vitamin B12 and other skin nutrients.</li>
            <li> i really do see a difference after a month and z half.</li>
            <li> I can say it that the scent is a little unusual.  </li>
            <li> It’s too early to see dramatic changes but my skin feels soft after using the Serum and pretty toned after using the Toner.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product just do nothing,neither good or bad.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the way more expensive serums, but have not found one that I like as much as this one.</li>
            <li> with this cream the wrinkles smile a little less than I do.</li>
            <li> It seems very soft and I do believe the pores are a little smaller.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not talking about the little crows feet and fine wrinkles that women in their late 30&#x27;s are whining about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never waste my money on such little product that does nothing.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and have found this product really lightens these dark areas</li>
            <li> My son is 23 years old and he says he already has less sun damage and sagging skin</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it runs out way too fast.</li>
            <li> had a little bit of trouble using the pump the first time</li>
            <li> I still LOVE this product, but I am extremely unhappy that it hasn&#x27;t been shipped promptly.  </li>
            <li> It is not long, but extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> As it has only been a short time that I&#x27;ve used it, I expect to see improvements over the next few months.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try this product  over long term use 45</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for long</li>
            <li> but now the outer \\&quot;1&#x27;s\\&quot; are softer and I&#x27;m back to \\&quot;1 1\\&quot;, just the two center frown lines.</li>
            <li> a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> long as this stuff continues to work, I&#x27;ll continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to see my improvement after long term use.</li>
            <li> I was having to apply with a finger and was blowing through what was left at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> jar  for the long term potency, preservation and effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> I especially notice the bags under my eyes starting to go down.  </li>
            <li> use it mainly at night just over my laugh lines, for some reason, if I use it all over my face, I end up with a headache, weird!</li>
            <li> Have only been using this product for a short time and have seen a slight improvement in skin smoothness.</li>
            <li> other thing - customer service - above and beyond.  </li>
            <li> Ordered my second jar and checking out the other products.  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue to buy this product and other products that Xfacio Labs may develop in the future.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased expensive designer products and have had fillers and Botox injected in an effort to defy Mother Nature and years of skin neglect to age a little more gracefully.</li>
            <li> Nothing can really turn back the hands of time, but with this product you can slow it down a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a product I will be using for a very long time.”</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t working on getting my temples and hairline area from being dry.  </li>
            <li> Not so dry.  </li>
            <li> The product is not moisturizing and my skin looks and feels dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is in between oily and dry</li>
            <li> but when I wash it&#x27;s extremely dry.</li>
            <li> thank u anyway, customer service are nice,  but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work, maybe if I keep using for at least another month.</li>
            <li> But during the last few months, my wrinkles have softened (some were very deep).  </li>
            <li> look 10 years younger, my dark circles have lightened considerably.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> My skin texture, dark spots, and firmness have improved and this is my second purchase.</li>
            <li> it only takes a little bit to cover my face so a bottle is going to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Rather than making my skin feel silky, it just left it dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed since I had seen so many positive comments.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel as if there is almost no product left inside, and at $35+ for a small bottle, a week of use is definitely not enough.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and just started using facial products during the past year.</li>
            <li> still 69 and short, but it has provided a tiny improvement, The wrinkles are a little less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different than I am used to.</li>
            <li> Also, a little big goes</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a natural product that has the retinol and peptides.  </li>
            <li> It just sinks into my skin.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I had no further trouble with it.</li>
            <li> I am a girl who has spent thousands x 10 for face products.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely  no improvement.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do in the next few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Have used for a few weeks, definitely see a difference in the clarity of my skin.</li>
            <li> Of course I expected all my wrinkles to be gone overnight and</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about 2 weeks now, roughly once a day.</li>
            <li> I am noticing tighter and smoother appearing skin, although it&#x27;s only been a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> To save money and time,  in the last few weeks, I have just been using the Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer on my face without the spray toner and vitamin C</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days, but can already see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> This is my second round buying this product.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I am not ready to recommend the purchase of this product yet.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m really careful with the ingredients I use on my face.</li>
            <li> Because of the way it feels, I will continue using it for a few months and then make a final decision.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no difference in wrinkle improvement.  </li>
            <li> Have only used for a few days and see a noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li> The product smells bad and is not any better than any other face moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The serum spreads nicely so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the skin does feel and look brighter and tighter.</li>
            <li> Some other products I have purchased have a pump that clogs</li>
            <li> My husband is caucasian, and he has not had the tightening affect posted in other reviews but his skin looks a bit nourished and a bit healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products</li>
            <li> I will definitely be including this in my everyday regimen!</li>
            <li> The other arm I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try some of their other products now too!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to other women or men.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it due to the fact that it makes a difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It has been keeping my face softer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try and I have used it several times over the past three days.  </li>
            <li> I want to try other products of this company.</li>
            <li> Just like any other cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried other serums and creams that disappear into the skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or heavy film, and the dry patches on my temples went away after one use.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find something that actually works.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after trying quite a few products...</li>
            <li> I had a problem with dark circles under my eyes and am already noticing a difference in them diminishing.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the past month which is about how long the container lasted.  </li>
            <li> I probably left at least a 1/4th of the serum in the bottle and just threw it away.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they just don&#x27;t add perfumes or if they have to deodorize something, but I usually hate the fragrance in most moisturizers and</li>
            <li> does it rennovate my old, tired saggy eyes?  </li>
            <li> The site would not let me leave or click out in any way I had to shut down my computer.</li>
            <li> I had bags under my eyes that nothing worked to tone them down.</li>
            <li> Read all the other reviews HAD TO TRY IT!  </li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other Xfacio products!</li>
            <li> I was offered a 60% discount to try their other product!</li>
            <li> With my moisterizer, it seems that I have less flaws and tones are improving with time.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer, looks smoother, and the pores are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I had never used either serum previously.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my wrinkles under my eyes are less noticeable now since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I typically have problems with a &amp;#34;sunken</li>
            <li> My moisture cream, which has a slight tint to it glides on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the comments of previous customers.</li>
            <li> It is the dead of winter here in Maine and my face is not as dry as it usually gets this time of year.</li>
            <li> I am a couple months shy of 66 years old and everyone tells me I look at least 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> but I like the way it goes on smoothly; isn&#x27;t harsh and I&#x27;m seeing a smoother slightly tighter complexion.</li>
            <li> While I have not noticed the dramatic changes in my skin that other reviewers have noted, I do notice several improvements.</li>
            <li> A little about me</li>
            <li> I used them for just a little longer than one week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have before and after pictures, but I will say that my eye wrinkles (I&#x27;m 33 - I have a little under my eyes and</li>
            <li> I have used this product a little under a week.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also an eye cream, makes things a little simpler.</li>
            <li> and I have been using the serum for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> It helps a little with lines.</li>
            <li> Wish it would have worked even a little, but nothing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had little changes but never have I had anything like this.</li>
            <li> 3-4 days, and already skin seems a little smoother.</li>
            <li> I have been using XFACIO for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> and I put a little bit on in the morning under my day creme.  </li>
            <li> I believe with a little time, this may be the product to assist in lessening them.</li>
            <li> I will follow up with an update after I have used this serum for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> but you know how they say you shouldn&#x27;t touch your face or you&#x27;ll get blemishes, but I did do it a few times cause</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday twice a day...</li>
            <li> I was expecting the serum to tighten my skin and make it firm</li>
            <li> I keep looking in the mirror everyday</li>
            <li> I am using this product for a few weeks morning and night.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> As of now, I do not regret the purchase, nor have I found any product qualities that have caused me to consider using it a waste of time.</li>
            <li> a few days, and no...</li>
            <li> I apply my makeup a few minutes after I applied this Anti Aging Serum</li>
            <li> the few that I  do see visable have smoothed out and my skin looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> I feel  during the harsh Chicago winters.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is firmer and of course that means less wrinkles!</li>
            <li> The skin on my face and neck is tighter and does not look weighed down, as I was looking a little rough, tired and sleepy.</li>
            <li> I have tried serums that make my face sticky or a bit stiff but this anti aging serum blends well into my skin.</li>
            <li> However past years have been faithfully using sunblock.</li>
            <li> I pat on a little Xfacio and no more puffy eyes!</li>
            <li> I have been using this anti-aging cream for two weeks and have been getting daily, random compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was missing this cream!</li>
            <li> I guess I will keep looking for a product that may work : /</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Took before pic &amp; anxious to see results.</li>
            <li> I told him he should try using it also, not sure if he will</li>
            <li> according to my husband and a few of my friends, they had!</li>
            <li> Be patient and consistent; you won&#x27;t be disappointed either.</li>
            <li> I put it on in am then put my usual moisture cream over it.</li>
            <li> And, I was not confident that it would work.  </li>
            <li> It does everything it claims, and a small amount is all that is needed for one application.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure what Biophotonic means</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to make any outrageous claims, such as finding the Fountain of Youth in this serum, but for me, it really does work wonders.</li>
            <li> When I applied my moisturizer &amp; make up I noticed my makeup last all day ,my pores look smaller &amp; my wrinkles are very faint!</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;tired eyes&#x27; and this tightens the skin under my eye and reduced the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find customer service like this anymore...</li>
            <li> at least thats been my experience  with them.</li>
            <li> the company would at least give us gal&#x27;s (TWO OZ.</li>
            <li> I swear this product has taken at least 10 years off my hands.</li>
            <li> I complained to the company about it</li>
            <li> I am in my late 60s</li>
            <li> I mean really...amazing.</li>
            <li> You need to be vigilant about the subtle and drastic changes that will occur with its use.</li>
            <li> I saw softer skin and wrinkles soften within a day, seriously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great products are hard to find!</li>
            <li> Reviewing this very early, I would comeback in a week or so, but today, after 4 days of sumptuous and toxic celebration, my face and skin looked awful, tired, droopy, wasted and puffed.</li>
            <li> It is thin and not sticky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using Xfacio approximately 3 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER experienced a product like this.</li>
            <li> I get tired of being ripped off by people telling you things work</li>
            <li> The facebook ad and the agreement was a farce.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C bottle arrived with its stopper broken.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a dramatic difference yet.  </li>
            <li> So he has been using for about a month and we can see dramatic difference in the bags under his eyes gone.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t bother my skin, but for the money i would rather buy from the drug store if you&#x27;re not looking for anything that has a dramatic result buy this.</li>
            <li> Tired of spending lots of money on department store serums&amp; anti aging creams!</li>
            <li> I figured all those people can&#x27;t be wrong after all.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for about three weeks and have not noticed any difference in my skin, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I can tell by the repetition that these reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed, unless you have to use it for 1/2 year or so to see a difference.</li>
            <li> and, unfortunately, everything has either caused me to breakout or develop a rash.</li>
            <li> I will rather use this product compared to the expensive one that I purchased before.</li>
            <li> Ill keep ya updated.....</li>
            <li> No improvement, did not see any ,  one line disappear not totally impressed, with that product wou not it</li>
            <li> A lot of people claim that there expensive product is the one to use.</li>
            <li> However, it has been disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of expensive moisturizers and this tops them all!  </li>
            <li> a bad thing to say about this product or this company.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BE A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> smells bad, so I haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you expect miracles, you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with xfacio products!!</li>
            <li> I hate waiting for that promise of a miracle that never comes.</li>
            <li> Product worthless.</li>
            <li> Have bought some very expensive products that performed but were outrageously costly.  </li>
            <li> I always hated that.  </li>
            <li> The container is horrible!  </li>
            <li> the packaging is the worst that I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> I hate looking all shiny!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too good to be true than its a lie.  I Used it for 6 weeks and it just made my face break out...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, love the cream</li>
            <li> I have tried serums that make my face sticky or a bit stiff but this anti aging serum blends well into my skin. My face feels soft to touch. I am looking forward to even more changes in my skin. I use it on my under eyes and neck, too. In a few weeks I hope to see changes worth reporting back here. In the meantime I suggest anyone should give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been the sort of person to obsess about my skin or spend a lot on skin care products, but I recently bought a 12x mirror for plucking my eyebrows and it really showed up the little blemishes and fine lines on my face.  I decided to try this serum because it&#x27;s all natural with vitamins and no artificial fragrances.  I love how smooth and soft it leaves my skin.  The laugh lines by my eyes are less noticeable and my face even looks good in the magnifying mirror.  My husband noticed the difference, so that seals the deal. I&#x27;ll definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love it . The light texture is so comfortable and not greasy. My face looks and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying out this product and it arrived quickly and has elegant packaging. The special pump works perfectly and the anti aging serum comes out easily and applies smoothly to my face and neck. Some other products I have purchased have a pump that clogs but this one works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference is always to find paraben free products with natural ingredients and ones that are fragrance free, and since I am sensitive to fragrances and toxins this made a big difference to me. I have only used the product for a few days but am very happy with the quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to rejuvenating my skin. Feels like it is working already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I just received this product.  It smells good and soothes my irritated skin.  It does not feel greasy.  It just sinks into my skin.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like after a week or two of using this product.  I will follow up with an update after I have used this serum for a few weeks.  The delivery was very fast, too.</li>
            <li> I have tried many face creams, expensive and not, and tend to get a reaction because my skin is sensitive.  But I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week and it&#x27;s really nice.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or heavy film, and the dry patches on my temples went away after one use.  Prior to this, I was using the Olay Regenerative(?) line and it wasn&#x27;t working on getting my temples and hairline area from being dry.  The first time I used this lotion, I noticed a slight fragrance though it says it&#x27;s unscented, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it since.  I also noticed that my skin felt really soft and smooth and I kept wanting to touch it, but you know how they say you shouldn&#x27;t touch your face or you&#x27;ll get blemishes, but I did do it a few times cause I couldn&#x27;t help it, hahaha...  Anyway, I&#x27;m going to keep a note on how this product works over time and how my skin looks in my big, dredded magnifying mirror - but by the way it feels so far, I think it will work out great.  I recommend this product for those with sensitive skin and anyone wanting to try it.  It&#x27;s a good price and it really makes a difference after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product in return for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some trouble with the pump at first. I wrote the manufacturer and they were FANTASTIC in getting back to me with a helpful video. I don&#x27;t know if Amazon will allow a link, so let me just say if you need help with this, go to YouTube and search How-To Prime Your Airless Pump by Kelly Robertson. It is not long, but extremely helpful. Big points to Xfacio Labs for pointing me to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the pump was \\&quot;primed\\&quot; I had no further trouble with it. I like that it doesn&#x27;t come out fast, wasting the product. You don&#x27;t need a lot. I also like how the product feels. It&#x27;s creamy and soft but NOT greasy. When you put it on your face, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel \\&quot;clogged\\&quot;. I also REALLY liked how it smelled, or rather, didn&#x27;t smell. I would not say it was completely odorless, but the smell it had was extremely light and felt organic, not perfumey. I don&#x27;t know if they just don&#x27;t add perfumes or if they have to deodorize something, but I usually hate the fragrance in most moisturizers and serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the serum for five days and while my skin feels softer, I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of wrinkles yet. Of course, no one claimed it would be instant, so I&#x27;m not faulting anyone for that. I am quite satisfied just with the way it moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t smell or feel greasy and heavy. That alone is worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> This serum feels very good going on, and my skin instantly seems to tighten, which makes it a good base for make up application. There is no feeling of oiliness whatsoever.  I can&#x27;t attest to any wrinkle reduction since I have only used it for a short time, but I do love the fact that it contains only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This serum is great. I have dry sensitive skin and have tried many other products. I find that the Xfacio serum is  luxurious and penetrates beautifully into my skin. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth immediately and even my wrinkles appear to plump out. The serum is odorless which is a big plus. I am so happy with this new product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am always hip on making myself look amazing....\\&quot;Mother Time\\&quot; as I call menopause has come and taken its toll on parts of your body and face that do things you really don&#x27;t like...lol I tried this anti-aging serum by Xfacio and really like what its doing for me....There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and the serum is light and non-greasy..last thing I want is a shiny greasy face...I put it on at night and when I wake up my face can feel its action....when I run out I will definitely buy more and make it a regular addition to my everyday skincare regimen. A very good product....thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product!  It makes my face feel so soft and smooth!  I&#x27;m enjoying the cream and the serum because my face is always dry and now it feels very nice like it should!!  Thank you for a great product.  Three weeks after I purchased my first product, I just re-ordered and purchased two more jars!  I love it and my face feels great!  I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t have anymore fine lines or wrinkles and can&#x27;t wait for my family to see my &amp;#34;new look&amp;#34; at our family reunion in June.  This product has worked very well on my face and I will order it again!</li>
            <li> I really love this anti aging serum and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time. It goes on and disappears into my skin without any oily or sticky feeling whatsoever. My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother. I&#x27;ve tried a number of the much more expensive brand name anti aging serums and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product. There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 weeks ago because my very strict skincare regiment to control my acne-prone skin was drying out my face. So far, it&#x27;s been great: the cream is light (very little goes very long way), smells good (organic/leafy), great customer service, good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month.  I have very sensitive skin, and I was concerned I might have a reaction.  No problems!  This is a very nice product, absorbs quickly and evenly, and leaves skin feeling soft.  I use it under moisturizer at night, and under sunscreen moisturizer during the day.  I&#x27;ve seen some good results, my skin is more even, the wrinkles are minimized. I am extremely pleased with the way it has worked on my wrinkly neck area!  As it has only been a short time that I&#x27;ve used it, I expect to see improvements over the next few months.  This is a solid product and has a remarkably low price.  It&#x27;s worth a try, and the product has a good guarantee if you don&#x27;t like it.  ****** This is a new comment...I still LOVE this product, but I am extremely unhappy that it hasn&#x27;t been shipped promptly.  If you reorder, be sure to give it a month for shipping.  I reordered quite a while ago, and still don&#x27;t have it. Yes, the company has been awesome about keeping me informed, but I NEED the product!  I have been using for over a year and my skin is dying for it!  GET IT SHIPPED!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I can actually see the results daily.  I will definitely be a returning customer.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a two weeks, BUT I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I am a girl who has spent thousands x 10 for face products.  This is cheap in comparison to other products I have tried.  I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Nothing exceptional but good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have to confess when I saw all the positive reviews I was both excited and also suspect, but decided to give it a try. Fortunately after 8 days applying twice a day, my skin felt softer and more supple.  I was really pleased! It has now been almost 3 weeks and I am so tickled I found this product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really skin friendly. I don&#x27;t especially like the texture of it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I am not a big believer in topicals, and I have not had the results other posted about, I believe that may work better for Caucasian  skin. I dont really believe a topical creme can get rid of spots or age lines, I think you need drastic intervention for that, and I am sure there is data to prove me wrong, but in my experience, I don&#x27;t find this to be true - I wanted overall moisturizing - so I thought I&#x27;d try this product  over long term use 45+ days, I have had some nice compliments form friends, Like your skin looks great- what are you using, or did you do something different..  When I went for my monthly facial, my girl noticed that the texture of my skin is better, I had no extractions, and my skin appears overall smoother.  My husband is caucasian, and he has not had the tightening affect posted in other reviews but his skin looks a bit nourished and a bit healthier. Over all I thing the product does what it can do and I like it.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!!! Very happy with this purchase!!..Within the first week I saw amazing results! Will be a returning customer!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of this product and of course it is not a miracle serum BUT I definitely think my skin is smoother and my fine wrinkles are less noticeable. I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Oh, is an amazing serum!  I&#x27;ve just started using it for a couple of times, as I was away on holidays for two weeks.  Since then, I&#x27;ve noticed slight improvement on my skin, more firm, soft and smooth, and also, is a light-weight serum, without leaving greasy or sticky feeling.  Anyway, is a great product that gives result in short period of time, great!</li>
            <li> OK! I received this product today.  I put it on tonight and I feel like I just had a facelift.  My lips feel like I just had botox, too.  I can&#x27;t believe it!!! Most definitely will order this product again.  I have used many creams in the past and they have never worked this fast.  Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  The product shipped fast, and the customer service follow up was outstanding.  After trying the product, my face instantly felt smoother and more hydrated.  I have noticed a reduction in fine lines after a few weeks and am excited to continue to use this product. I love that their product is organic, and made in the USA.  Would definitely recommend it !</li>
            <li> Love it! The best Anti Aging Serum! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews of products unless the product is exceptional - in this case, this product is awesome!  My skin was okay, but I needed more - I needed it to feel and look healthy.  This product accomplishes that and more.  It not only makes my skin silky soft (which my husband loves to touch), it also helps to minimize the fine lines around the eyes.  I&#x27;ve only have it for a couple of weeks, but what I can see so far is wonderful.  I received the Serum in the time promised and I have nothing but praise for the Serum and the company, as well as the Seller.</li>
            <li> I am a lady of a &amp;#34; certain age&amp;#34; who used to have lines, lines, lines, on my face.  Not any more!  After using this product twice a day for almost two weeks, those pesky old lines have softened and my skin is glowing enough to get compliments.  The folks who produce this product are just lovely - which is a bonus.  They contacted me by email when the product was delivered. This was a first for me after ordering via Amazon for 25 years!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was on a mission to find a moisturizer that not only worked but  was organic and smelled wonderful.  I am so pleased with this purchase! I love the citrus smell and feel.  I have used twice a day on my face and neck and love the results!!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to receive this product in 2 days. It came in very nice packaging---a black velour bag and glass jar. It is more of a light cream consistency. I have been using the product for a month now, morning and night,  and notice some improvement in my neck and lines around eyes. I have good skin and rarely need makeup to hide problems so can&#x27;t say that it helped these kind of problems, but definetly improvement in wrinkles. Disclosure---I am 65 years old and have not been one of those people who pamper my skin.  However past years have been faithfully using sunblock. The company has very good communication--- they don&#x27;t sell you the product and that&#x27;s it. They communicate with further information on use of product and reach out . This shows that they really care that you get the most out of the product and are pleased with it! Very impressed and will order again. Also, I like the texture as it is easy to put makeup overtop when needed. I think price is reasonable , especially since it helps with wrinkles. I see prices out there for products , that may or may not work ,that only the rich could afford.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Second bottle and counting!!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased from Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;Second bottle came today...note it&#x27;s Veteran&#x27;s Day. ;)&lt;br /&gt;I look 10 years younger, my dark circles have lightened considerably.&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad thing to say about this product or this company.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BE A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for giving me...ME!!</li>
            <li> I need more time to see results but this product feels so good when applied. It blends in well and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all even with another one of their products. Their money back guarantee is great though. I wished it worked  just because of the great customer service.</li>
            <li> A very nice product. Feels wonderful on my skin. This is my second order will certainly order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Rarely write product feedback but I am so happy with this product! I have only been using it a week but already see a difference in my skin - softening of fine lines and more even skin tone!</li>
            <li> I think they hired a bunch of people to write positive reviews.  The product does not work as they said it does.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> A little about me I am in my upper 50s, I&#x27;m not afraid to spend money on great products for my skin. This is amazing. when I put it on my face it feels so yummy. I will buy this again, I love it!</li>
            <li> This serum firms my skin, lightens, and the lines appear to be gone just after one use.  I really like the way it makes my skin look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Have only used the product since early February but I like the way it goes on smoothly; isn&#x27;t harsh and I&#x27;m seeing a smoother slightly tighter complexion. This is a go to product :)  I also like the way the company stays in touch with the customer.  Makes you feel very special.</li>
            <li> helped a great deal with the laugh lines which I use it for. I just turn 40  and could pass for early 30. Don&#x27;t have  wrinkle on my face howerver I just noticed my laugh lines are starting to show even when I&#x27;m not laughing!  use it mainly at night just over my laugh lines, for some reason, if I use it all over my face, I end up with a headache, weird! But it&#x27;s working and I notice a change!</li>
            <li> Loving this product so far! I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, Hispanic, light-med brown complected. My under eye circles AND acne scars are lighter and diminishing, Hallelujah! The skin on my face and neck is tighter and does not look weighed down, as I was looking a little rough, tired and sleepy. I use this serum in the morning and at night, 2 pumps each time (4 pumps daily). This product is like a little face lift in a bottle and I will be ordering another one and see if there are more changes. One bottle looks like it will last me a month or so. Great job Xfacio Labs!</li>
            <li> Look forward to use Xfacio cream.</li>
            <li> This organic serum delivers a high percentage of Matrixyl 3000 as well as peptides, retinol, plants stem cells, amino acids, argan oil, Vitamin B12 and other skin nutrients. The carrier for these nutrients is organic aloe vera. I&#x27;ve only been using a few days (both morning and night), and am very pleased with how quickly this serum is absorbed into the skin--and have experienced no irritation.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, great packaging.  The results from using this is amazing.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> An excellent product that delivers what it promises</li>
            <li> Absolutely  no improvement.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Their is nothing  advance or potent about this marginal product .</li>
            <li> I used this product til it was gone and am going to order it again.  I have dark circles under my eyes and have found this product really lightens these dark areas</li>
            <li> I love this product! After about a week, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin! Wow! This a fabulous product! I just ordered the vitamin c serum to try. I bet that&#x27;s awesome too!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using this for about 3 weeks and notice a huge  difference.  I&#x27;ve used other products but I&#x27;ve never noticed anything like this.</li>
            <li> After 4 wks I didn&#x27;t think it was working.  I had took a close-up before picture, so I decided to take a pic at 4wks, and to my surprise there was absolutely decrease in the wrinkles.  I plan to keep using!!</li>
            <li> Just starting using the product.  Don&#x27;t see a dramatic difference yet.  It does make your skin very soft and it does make my face appear more evenly toned.</li>
            <li> Seems to work good. With my moisterizer, it seems that I have less flaws and tones are improving with time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a budget and the Xfacio anti-aging serum is reasonably priced.  So far I&#x27;m really impressed with the product and have noticed a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> my wife love this cream! She already used 2 jars of this wonderful serum and her face looks fresh and nice. Thank you, Xfacio for the wonderful product !</li>
            <li> I have wasted sooooo much money on products that do not produce results as they claim.  This product works ... period.  I have used it for almost a week now and can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin, the coloration is brighter, the fine lines are diminished, the elasticity seems improved.  I am a convert for life.  I&#x27;m 62 and trust me this works.  Plus they have a money back guarantee and their customer service is incredible.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT.  WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing xfacio Labs,Anti aging Serum. This product I feel has helped my skin greatly.This is the first time I have ever been consistent with any facial product. I feel the reason for my consistency is because it works for me. Thanks so very much!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this serum for a few days but my skin feels good ... Not so dry.  The biggest difference at this point is my neck which looks much better.  I will keep using this product because its the best I&#x27;ve tried since the aging process has come upon me.</li>
            <li> I may not be the best judge, because I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with another product, but, the 2 together seem to be putting those pesky wrinkles on the run.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this for very long to see any difference yet, but I have high expectations because it goes on very smoothly and feels really great on my over 50 skin. I do want to add that  Xfacio Labs have provided the best customer service I have ever experienced.  They emailed me to let me know that it was on its way and instructions on how to best use the product.  They did a, non sales, follow up with additional helpful skin care tips.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to purchase anything from this company. You get a great product at a reasonable price and can only get it from Amazon.  This is a  true find!&lt;br /&gt;Note; You do have to re-prime the pump now and then, (because it is airless) otherwise the product shoots out at an unexpected angle and you don&#x27;t want to miss a drop of it.</li>
            <li> I have drawers and even a closet full of skin care products. I&#x27;ve been easily spending $200+ every month on the best money can buy. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks but it immediately solved one problem...it got rid of under eye bags!  I also use a cream with ceramides and hyaluronic acid that I love, but if I get it too close to my eyes I get puffy eyes.  I pat on a little Xfacio and no more puffy eyes! Of course, I also use Xfacio all over my face, but after I&#x27;ve finished with all of my skin products I go back and dab a little more of the Xfacio around my eyes. I travel quite a bit, so I&#x27;ve already re-ordered. This is a product I do not want to be without!  I also really like the company.  I haven&#x27;t had to contact them with a problem, but from the beginning they&#x27;ve contacted me by email to ask if I received the product and if I had any questions or concerns. The company and the product are both responsive to their customer&#x27;s needs!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your email.  Frankly, although you have a good product, I didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference between this product and the previous products I&#x27;ve used as far as result.</li>
            <li> A great product.  Did my research and it&#x27;s hard to find a natural product that has the retinol and peptides.  My skin is glowing!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for great service and product! Can feel the firming and supporting effect.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream serum.  Moisturizes and soaks into the skin.  Very gentle.  I think I can already see a difference in my face.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Works very well. You can see the difference in a couple of days. I will continue to reorder. It&#x27;s economical.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week now, once in the am, but I am definitely noticing a difference.  My face feels hydrated and luminous. My foundation goes on smoother and looks fresh and natural AND my under eye area looks refreshed and bright; as opposed to my normal look of complete fatigue and ready to drop dead!  So far I am very happy with this product and will definitely order again.  Finally a product that gives you immediate results!  I hate waiting for that promise of a miracle that never comes.</li>
            <li> BEWARE, they give you a free 2nd product if you write a review here on Amazon.  This is why there are so, so, so MANY reviews.  The product smells bad and is not any better than any other face moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> what a concept...a product that actually delivers......??</li>
            <li> Wonderful organic product!  It absorbs very easily, and I am able to apply makeup right after the serum.  It essentially has no scent, which I love, and I also apply it to the backs of my hands because it is a big jar for the money. At my age, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference, but I really like it as a fabulous  moisturizer.  The customer service has emailed me, letting me know that they are there if I have any questions or concerns. I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I just started using this product and I really like it. I feel it has improved my face and neck so far. I am hoping by using it in long term, I see even more improvement. I would recommend this product to everyone. It is much better than many products in the market.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a week and I can already see a difference.  I especially notice the bags under my eyes starting to go down.  I realize that they won&#x27;t ever disappear because this is a genetic problem, but they certainly aren&#x27;t so noticeable anymore.  I always hated that.  For the price of this product you absolutely can&#x27;t beat it.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do in the next few weeks.  I will be ordering this again.  Their Customer Service is just that!  CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Wow!  They are so nice and professional.  They e-mailed me right after I got it to see if it had arrived and asked me to let them know after using it how I liked it.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon is carrying the Anti Aging Serum.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Definitly noticed a difference within a week of using! Will be buying more :)</li>
            <li> I have found this to be a light cream that is non-irritating &amp; seems to be softening fine lines. Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a month now and I really LOVE it. It is very light and absorbs well into my skin. I do see  the lines on my cheeks getting fainter. I am 64 yrs old and this product is making my skin feel so much younger. I highly recommend it. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this anti-aging cream for two weeks and have been getting daily, random compliments on my skin. I am 45 and had just begun noticing wrinkles (I called it onion skin) under my eyes - I have always had oily skin so I had never needed a moisturizer before.  I ordered this product based on reviews and I was so impressed with the results, I  ordered the anti wrinkle serum as well- though I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;ll need it now. Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product (a friend of mine recommended it to me) and I thought, all creams are alike, how much difference can it possibly make?  -  well, my face is so smooth,the serum is luxurious and it is so light on my skin.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will feel like in a month from now.</li>
            <li> I purchased to try Anti Aging Serum and Xtreme XT Anti Aging Toner. I used them for just a little longer than one week but I think I like both products. It’s too early to see dramatic changes but my skin feels soft after using the Serum and pretty toned after using the Toner. I will keep using them. I would like to try Eye cream which is supposed  to come out soon.</li>
            <li> Over 50 and drying up? Try this lotion. I use retin A and this works great for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product is equivalent to Lancome or Estee Lauder and the price is fabulous!!  Give it a try!  You will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. L. Terranova&lt;br /&gt;Hospice Chaplain</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing, works well!! i would reccomend it, it is for sure worth the price, buy it now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and just started using this cream. I like the that it absorbs quickly as my skin is oily and some creams just seem to bring out more oil. This cream also seems to make my skin feel firmer which, at my age is key.  Also, the seller has been very attentive in checking in to make sure I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this company!  Lots of skin care this and info. Very fast delivery of a product which seems to be very effective for fine lines and wrinkles. This is only my first bottle but will not be my last.  Great follow up from company. Can&#x27;t praise enough!</li>
            <li> Have used for a few weeks, definitely see a difference in the clarity of my skin. Super hydrating when used in conjunction with moisturizer and yes, a little goes a very long way so a great value as well!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for long but I like the way this feels on my skin. It is thin and not sticky. Does not irritate my skin like many products that contain SLS or harsh ingredients. The smell is a little different than I am used to. Customer service is great.</li>
            <li> This company has dynamite customer service.  They are both pro-active and responsive.  I am nearing 70 and have deep wrinkles around my mouth and on my chin.  I have been using this product for about three weeks, and have already ordered a second jar.  The product goes on smoothly and I feel it absorbs quickly and completely.  My skin feels softer, looks smoother, and the pores are much less noticeable.  My wrinkles also look softer and the skin around them looks plumper.  They are still there, but I hope with continued use, there will be further improvement.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the company..velvety smooth consistency..love the way it feels on the skin..this is my first Amazon review ever...really seems to firm the skin..the company is more than fabulous to work with..</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this product....it goes on very nicely..not serum like. When i think of serum i think oily..at least thats been my experience  with them. This is more cream like. I have not noticed a big difference but i was using another kind before this one so it may be too soon to tell. But i definetly like the way this goes on. It really makes my skin feel nice and smooth. I am over 40 so i am really trying to keep my skin in good shape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday twice a day...morning and evening...i really do see a difference after a month and z half. My skin looks better than if has in a long while. I will definetly continue to use this serum...my lines have definetly softened..and the customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for maybe a month to be able to give a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;This is working for me and has helped around the cheek area and the&lt;br /&gt;little wrinkles on the forehead and eye area around the temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 68 yrs. young, so do not give up, I am looking forward to the new serum&lt;br /&gt;the company is coming out with.&lt;br /&gt;The pump has worked great for me. I ordered two at one time so I am&lt;br /&gt;hoping the 2nd. bottle works as well as the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish (for the money) the company would at least give us gal&#x27;s (TWO OZ. BOTTLES)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the company would double their sales and that would make us all happy.</li>
            <li> Read all the other reviews HAD TO TRY IT!  I LUV IT.  My skin is now like chocolate porcelain! I mean really...amazing.</li>
            <li> But life isn&#x27;t like that!&lt;br /&gt;What I will say is that I really really like this product.  It&#x27;s smooth, creamy, smells good and doesn&#x27;t feel thick, pasty or greasy.  Glides on and leaves your face feeling silky smooth.  Of course I expected all my wrinkles to be gone overnight and my pores to shrink back to when I was 20 - I&#x27;m just a couple + decades  older ;-)&lt;br /&gt;That didn&#x27;t happen (really?) but I have to say this product is far superior to the many $$$$ products I&#x27;ve tried and been disappointed time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing - customer service - above and beyond.  Thank you Xfacio Labs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my daughter. She is happy with the product she has used but, it seems the bottle of serum was almost empty when she opened the package. There was no evidence of leakage within the package so I&#x27;m at a loss as to how this could happen.</li>
            <li> I thought my wife looked so youthful that I asked her if she had been getting botox treatments.</li>
            <li> Really love this product and the way my skin drinks it in.</li>
            <li> This from someone forever looking for the perfect serum!  I am seeing a nice improvement in the tightening of my skin and the collagen in my cheeks.  Certainly enough to purchase my second tube and continue using the product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have been using this and the Hyaluronic Acid serum, both morning and night.  I can tell a difference in my skin and it has only been a week!!!! I have used all kinds of expensive moisturizers and this tops them all!  I will definitely be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> Feels GREAT!,  with in a week I could see a more vibrant face and firming of my skin. I apply it in the morning and at night.  I will definitely continue with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am very pleased with my purchase.  AFACIO cream has got to be the best Anti-Aging product on the market today. Love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  It&#x27;s the only product I will use from now on.</li>
            <li> It really helps with under eye wrinkles and bags. I have been trying to get my husband do wear eye cream, he never would. Then he asked me how to get rid of the bags under his eyes. So he has been using for about a month and we can see dramatic difference in the bags under his eyes gone. Wrinkles lessened as well, he is very happy with results.</li>
            <li> I have been on this for going on 3 weeks now, im about to buy a second bottle. To me it looks like my face and neck are smoother and some of the wrinkles are smoothing out. Im 60 years old and as far as my complection goes it is not the best because years and years ago i had bump issues. Now, as i am using this nightly my skin just seems to look brighter and smoother. i will try another bottle of it!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after trying quite a few products...I figured what the heck let&#x27;s give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning of the first time I used it, I could feel my skin more taught and just a fresher look. After a week of use, I was asked by family and friends what I was using or doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a regular reviewer, but I know that there are many of us who make decisions on the basis of the product description plus other customers&#x27; input. So, for anyone still researching what to use to avoid costly medical alternatives, I&#x27;m sharing my thoughts. I have been using the Xfacio Serum for about a month. I have a line next to my left eye that I considered to be a noticeable crow&#x27;s feet. After one month of using Xfacio, it has softened so that it isn&#x27;t as obvious as before. I also have four frown lines slightly above, and between, my eyes. Have you ever heard the two main ones described as \\&quot;1 1\\&quot;? I thought&lt;br /&gt;I had \\&quot;1 1 1 1\\&quot; but now the outer \\&quot;1&#x27;s\\&quot; are softer and I&#x27;m back to \\&quot;1 1\\&quot;, just the two center frown lines. I have ordered my second Xfacio Serum, and will check out my results in the next 30 days. I&#x27;m optimistic that I&#x27;ll have a good update to my review then. Also, there were comments about the pump. Mine worked immediately and continuously. The packaging is also very professional. The seller is excellent in reaching out, and providing great suggestions. Very friendly and helpful! I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase, and hope to be a continuing client.</li>
            <li> Feels very nice! I only use at night.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work better for me as an under eye cream than as a full face cream.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see much effect as a full face and neck cream, but have seen the skin under my eyes definately become less dry and baggy whilst using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase it again, but solely to use as an eye cream. (Doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes either which is great).</li>
            <li> Trust, I have bought and tried every damn serum/lotion up in this piece.  I don&#x27;t have before and after pictures, but I will say that my eye wrinkles (I&#x27;m 33 - I have a little under my eyes and some crows&#x27; feet when I squint) haven&#x27;t bothered or upset me since I started using this product.  I intend to keep buying from Xfacio.  I love the smell too ;)</li>
            <li> I have been taking care of my skin since I was 13 and I will be 49 next month. I feel this product is an additional assest to my products.  I have noticed that my facial skin gets &amp;#34;accustomed&amp;#34; to a product after 3-6 months and then my skin does not look as good as it did before, so what I do is &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34; to another very good products and then switch back to the original in 3 months.  I suppose I am trying to keep my skin to be receptive of the good products.  Try that.  I would still buy this again.  Word to the wise, teacher your children boys and girls to start caring for their skin at middle school age and then it really pays off. My son is 23 years old and he says he already has less sun damage and sagging skin then some girls his age.  I wish this product was cheaper.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any effect. May actually be contributing to drier skin and more wrinkles and lines. Actually have stopped using it ad am looking for something more effective.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t assess the product because I can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle without going to great lengths.  The container is horrible!  I lost my receipt or I&#x27;d send it back.</li>
            <li> Best face serum hands down!! I&#x27;ve used countless face products and this one really works!! Thank you xfacio!! Awesome customer service too!!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream so far.  I have only been using for a week so have not noticed changes but I love how it feels nice and cool when putting on face and neck after shower.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I have been searching for something reasonably priced, yet good for my skin.  I found it.  This serum is great for morning and night.  It goes on smoothly, is absorbed quickly, and makes my skin feel really smooth.  Best part (in the AM routine) is that it doesn&#x27;t make my foundation feel sticky or flaky.  Really great product, give it a try!</li>
            <li> After just a week of use, I can see some positive changes in my skin. My only complaints are than even using the tips provided by the seller to pump the product out (tap the bottom a few times, flip bottle over and tap the top a few times) there is always an issue of the lotion not coming out. It makes me feel as if there is almost no product left inside, and at $35+ for a small bottle, a week of use is definitely not enough. Hopefully it&#x27;s just air bubbles, and there is still plenty left inside. The lotion is not scent-less. It smells astringent, kind of witch hazel-like.</li>
            <li> Great product, good packaging, I will buy again!!</li>
            <li> A wonderful Product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum! Tired of spending lots of money on department store serums&amp; anti aging creams! Iam so happy I tried Xfacio anti aging Serum. As soon as I applied this product I saw &amp; felt a difference in my skin! It felt smoother &amp; looked more polished! When I applied my moisturizer &amp; make up I noticed my makeup last all day ,my pores look smaller &amp; my wrinkles are very faint! My 64 yr old skin looks fabulous! Can&#x27;t wait to try more products! Don&#x27;t hesitate you will not be dissapointed!!!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find something that actually works. No, it won&#x27;t make me look 18 again but it does diminish the lines around my eyes. It is noticeable and it didn&#x27;t take weeks. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> A male reviewing a beauty product has got to be the pinnacle of Vanity but here goes. I decided to try this product to see if it would offer some help in diminishing lines that started showing around the eyes and forehead. The price was right so i decided to try it based on the outstanding reviews. I figured all those people can&#x27;t be wrong after all. Been using this product for about 2 weeks now, roughly once a day. The company owner/salesperson (Mikabel), has been keeping in contact to find out if the product is meeting my expectations. She kindly asked if I would write a review once i gave the product enough time to work. 2 weeks in and what I can say is that they have a legit product here. Fine lines are definitely becoming less prominent. Don&#x27;t know if the product really had anything to do with what I&#x27;m about to say , but just had a nice compliment a few days go when someone thought I was 20 years younger than my actual age. I shared that experience with the Xfacio owner and she said I should be on the cover of all their bottles. I don&#x27;t know about that but what I can say is the product delivers on its promise. Certainly nothing to lose but the wrinkles so far.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product. I have tried so many different creams, and XFacio is the ONLY one that has given me results this good. After 3 weeks, I could REALLY notice a difference, and so can my co-workers. My face looks younger and so much more vibrant. I recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I waited at least a month before writing this review to make sure I could see the results. I can honestly say that this product does what it claims to do. It practically erases fine lines and severely reduces stubborn forehead wrinkles, etc. In addition, my skins feels soft, is even-toned and has a lovely glow. I am extremely pleased with the Xfacio product line. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love, love this product!  My face has never felt so smooth and moisturized! I will definitely be including this in my everyday regimen!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great even with first time use.  Its not greasy at all.  I can feel my neck area tightening up right now!</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of weeks.  I can&#x27;t tell about the wrinkles yet but it certainly leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great after use. I am noticing tighter and smoother appearing skin, although it&#x27;s only been a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This worked for me!!  I tried this product because of the great reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me but this one did.  I truly believe what works for some doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. With this product, I literally saw a very noticeable difference over night and a huge difference in just days.  I&#x27;m fast approaching 50 so I&#x27;m not talking about the little crows feet and fine wrinkles that women in their late 30&#x27;s are whining about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the products are very reasonably priced, I always try products in different combinations to see if I can get results by using fewer products because of cost and time!  To save money and time,  in the last few weeks, I have just been using the Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer on my face without the spray toner and vitamin C and I have still seen results. However, keep reading!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products worked so well on my face, that last night I tried them on my forearms.  On one arm I put just the Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer.  The other arm I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer.  Again, I saw a big difference literally over night on both arms but a HUGE difference on the arm where I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid, and moisturizer  After the huge difference I saw this morning on the arm that I used 3 products instead of just 2, I&#x27;m definitely going back to using all 3 of those in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  Some people say save your money and use general witch hazel instead of purchasing a higher priced product which has witch hazel in it.  At some point I will do that comparison and update my post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  With that, keep this in mind....why would I want another bottle of something in my cabinet that doesn&#x27;t work even if it is free?!?!  I&#x27;ve lost countof the number of products I&#x27;ve purchased and thrown away because the products didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one too so that I do not catch myself without it.  As a business woman, kudos to this company for a marketing plan that not only benefits them but truly benefits the customer too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are going to see this similar but basically same post from me on the Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer cream.  I want my free bottle of all of them because I know they WORK for me!!  No need to recreate the wheel each time!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for about three weeks and have not noticed any difference in my skin, unfortunately. But I love the fact that I can use the same product morning and night. The fact that I am 70 might have some bearing on it too, the wrinkles are deeply ingrained. I was hoping my skin would be more hydrated.</li>
            <li> For Mothers Day, I went through my wife&#x27;s anti aging/wrinkle eliminating miracle product stash with her. We found ingredients in all of the standard off the shelf items which cost plenty of money which were unacceptable for use on human skin. It was surprising what toxic chemicals all of these mainstream companies use. As part of the same research, we made a list of things that we would like to see not used and one of ingredients which are proven to work and non-toxic. XFACIO LABS products met all of the list requirements using ingredients like Matrixyl 3000, Jojoba oil and Retinol. These help skin maintain health from the inside instead of just puffing it up from toxicity. Now that she has been using the XFACIO line, her skin looks healthier and has a glow about it that wasn&#x27;t there before. We both are very happy with these products and highly recommend XFACIO LABS to anyone looking to have truly healthy skin and not just a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s not oily but as the day goes on your skin gets this wonderful glow. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I  didn&#x27;t see any change and my friends  didn&#x27;t see either. thank u anyway, customer service are nice,  but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work, maybe if I keep using for at least another month. I don&#x27;t know,  it is cheap if compared to others antiaging cream</li>
            <li> Love, love the product !!!  It makes my skin so smooth !!! Plus, quick delivery too. For sure I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing - in fact I thought my complexion became paler especially after I switched back to my regular brand.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this product for a short time and have seen a slight improvement in skin smoothness. It&#x27;s really too early to tell. I&#x27;m very impressed with the companies follow up emails. They have additional tips and want feedback.</li>
            <li> didn&#x60;t notice any difference</li>
            <li> I have just received my second jar of this lovely product.  I love to put it on my face.  The texture is pleasant with no apparent fragrance.  The best part is that the lines and wrinkles appear diminished.  I have strong vertical lines around my lips and have been pleased that these are so much less visible with this product. My lipstick stays on the lips and not in the wrinkles.  I feel that after reading all of the wonderful ingredients contained in this serum, I have a winner. I look forward to trying other Xfacio products!</li>
            <li> I can truly feel the difference on my skin.  I am now on my second bottle and very happy with the softness difference and the reduction of some wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I had a little bit of trouble using the pump the first time so i checked back on the instructions the company had emailed me which really help.&lt;br /&gt;Fulfillment, delivery and follow-up were very professional.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the serum to tighten my skin and make it firm but it has made my acne almost disappear. I am quite happy with it an will surely buy more once this is over</li>
            <li> I have only had this product a few weeks, however, I honestly feel an improvement in this short time.  I am 62 years young, and my husband (and myself) do not believe in facelifts. (apparently).  So, I have been researching products and reviews.  XFACIO had the most and the best reviews, after reading, I purchased my first jar two weeks ago.  I especially liked the review where the person was using the product on their arms as well as their face.  I too, have experienced a lot of sun damage on my arms and hands.  (If I could, I jump into a full jar feet first).&lt;br /&gt;So, I am using product on my face and arms too.  I believe I see an improvement already on my face , particularly lines around eyes.  Also, my hands and arms feel a bit smoother in just this short time.  I am going to try to track my improvement.  The cream is soothing, and blends well into my skin.  So Far, So Good.</li>
            <li> I am going to be 70 this month, God Willing:)  Fortunately I do not have any wrinkles on my face however no matter what I used in the past, for me it never looked alive for more than a day or two with any product until Xfacio**********.  My face no mater what time of the day or evening, is clear, bright, and has a natural pink tone to my cheeks now.  I am not one to wear any kind of foundation or powder except for some except for some blush.  Now I wear blush only when we go out in the evening. I will also state that my boyfriend actually made a comment about how great my skin looked exactly two days after using.  Now he want his own bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using Xfacio approximately 3 weeks ago.  I Love it. Try it you have nothing to lose and everything to gain!!!!!</li>
            <li> Real good, my wife uses every day  It seems to make her skin smoother and softer! good product, would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I can tell by the repetition that these reviews are fake. They are selling snake oil. Please save your money. Product worthless.</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and always in search of anti aging products.  After trying this serum I am totally hooked.  It glides on my face like silk, and makes my face feel absolutely fantastic.. I even use it on my neck, chest and hands. I can really tell a difference in the texture and tone of my skin since I have been using this product. I have finally found the serum that does the trick..I will continue to use this product!! I love the smell and texture of this serum. My face already feels younger and firmer!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Fast  shipping! I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days, but can already see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I used this for over a month to make sure I can really post a review. This is a great product. My skin looks better after using the serum. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 2 weeks twice a day, I see a difference and will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a little under a week. I had a problem with dark circles under my eyes and am already noticing a difference in them diminishing.</li>
            <li> I keep looking in the mirror everyday and I keep looking better and better.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that this serum could give such great results, but it has to be from this amazing serum...there is no other explaination!</li>
            <li> Wow what a difference in 2 days! Complexion looks like it was air- brushed before and after makeup. I especially like that it is not running off my face in the heat it is nice and light.  At 64 years i am blessed to have no wrinkles but bags under my eyes and this really helps. I will be using this for when the wrinkles do come!</li>
            <li> I like this product overall. It does well with fine lines around the eyes. Although in the headline it says it &amp;#34;lifts and tightens,&amp;#34; I do not see that kind of results. Still, as far as fine lines and making the skin feel very soft, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s also an eye cream, makes things a little simpler. Nice texture, no bad smell, not greasy feeling and it dries fairly quickly. I&#x27;m going to continue using it.</li>
            <li> As they did last time, the company shipped very quickly. The product is delightful to use and each bottle lasts a long time. This is my second round buying this product. When I ran out of my previous jar, I tried an alternate cream temporarily and noticed the difference right away. My skin was missing this cream! :) I get compliments all the time on my skin. This cream is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel greasy at all. I use it under makeup in AM as well as at night before bed. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing for any skin type.  A little goes a long way.  I have tried so many products, but this one has it all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 weeks now. I wanted to give it a fair trial before writing a review. This is one of the better face creams that I have used. I really like how light it feels and how quickly and completely it absorbs. There is no greasy feel and my makeup goes on over it without a problem. While I have not noticed the dramatic changes in my skin that other reviewers have noted, I do notice several improvements. I have been using the skin toner, vitamin C serum, and anti-aging serum.  I have mature skin (age 53) and have noticed a softening of the crows feet around my eyes. My skin tone appears more even and &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; as well. I will definitely be reordering this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I think this product is wonderful and very inexpensive for the great results</li>
            <li> I just received the cream and love the fresh scent and feel of it on my face! It also doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all which many face creams do. I&#x27;ll write again after trying for a month or so letting you know the results.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best Facial/Neck Serums available today and it is organic! This is a good clean effective product.</li>
            <li> Got this for wife based on  reviews and it works great . She&#x27;s very happy as her skin appears to br getting smoother</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not any better than the stuff you pay a little more extra at the grocery store like Oil of Olay Eye serum.  I&#x27;m not impressed, unless you have to use it for 1/2 year or so to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I waited a while to see how this works. It&#x27;s light, it absorbs well and my skin looks tighter, smoother and brighter. Give it a try</li>
            <li> love it, there are no other words...It really works</li>
            <li> I have 56 years old, I used to products for my face Avanon and Derma e,  This my first expirence with Xfacio, first I have  point out it lightweight, it can be easily spread all over face, including neck and eyess no diferece at all, I took my photo today I I will se the results in 30 days, I know with the quaity of  its ingredits only good can come out  Walter Sosa Trani</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the improvement of my skin since I began using Xfacio. It has given me better results than any other facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. My skin texture, dark spots, and firmness have improved and this is my second purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light, cooling and refreshing serum-cream that leaves my skin feeling soft but not oily.  I just had a facial procedure done and the product is doing wonders at helping my skin to heal quickly.  When I put the product on at night and wake up the next morning, my skin is glowing, supple and youthful and I am 54!  I am not a skin care novice (I am a clinical research professional) and I appreciate all the most current &amp; hot ingredients on the market at high potency!  Just look at the ingredient list and all the most beneficial ingredients are at the top of the ingredient list!!  THANK YOU very much for this FANTASTIC product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty good results so far. My skin is more supple and I&#x27;ve notice some of the fine lines diminishing. I will be purchasing this product again</li>
            <li> Reviewing this very early, I would comeback in a week or so, but today, after 4 days of sumptuous and toxic celebration, my face and skin looked awful, tired, droopy, wasted and puffed. I decided to try Xfacio serum alone, to see what would happen and OMG! half hour later my face was round, glowing, fresh, fresh, fresh! So I want to know how it would be after a week of use it on a rested face. So far, sooo good! Thanks XFACIO! You made my day!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;m not going to make any outrageous claims, such as finding the Fountain of Youth in this serum, but for me, it really does work wonders. Along with actually doing what it claims to do, it feels great going on, is a superb moisturizer, and has even helped even out my skin tone. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and have extremely sensitive, acne-prone skin and, unfortunately, everything has either caused me to breakout or develop a rash. Not this one though - it truly is a miracle for me! I believe the use of organic ingredients is a big part of why this works so well for my sensitive skin. Also, a little big goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for context, I&#x27;m 32 and I have been using the serum for a little over a month now. I can honestly say it&#x27;s done a fantastic job at diminishing fine lines around my eyes and the deeper lines on my forehead. Actually, the fine lines around my eyes are all but gone at this point. In fact, a couple weeks ago I was asked, by another college student mind you, if I had my college ID with me so I could get the student discount on a purchase I was making! I haven&#x27;t had that happen since I was in my mid 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as this stuff continues to work, I&#x27;ll continue to reorder. I highly recommend it and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I Love this product ! The best facial anti-aging cream I ever had . Price is right , service is excellent &amp; does the best for my skin . Lovely &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have never written a review in my life and I just want to tell the world how much I LOVE this product. As a woman who is not afraid to drop some money on a good product, I can&#x27;t even explain how awesome this product is and the price point is incredible. This product has made my face more supple, but where I can see a drastic difference is in my hands. I swear this product has taken at least 10 years off my hands. If it can do that to my hands, what in the world is it doing for my face?!? I have NEVER experienced a product like this. Like I said, AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product and I have experienced visible results. I would recommend this product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely.  No obnoxious fragrance.  I put this on first after cleansing my face and then follow with another moisturizer.  I use so many different &#x27;anti-aging&#x27;/&#x27;anti-wrinkle&#x27; creams that I can&#x27;t say for sure that this one does the trick all by itself but I do get a lot of compliments on my 57 year-old skin that looks like 40-something.  I do believe that using multiple products, of this nature, provides better results than using only one.  What one product may lack, another will have so they all work together to give me superior results.  This one is nice and I will order it again to be part of my multi-product regime.</li>
            <li> This is just wonderful.  I really like this product because my skin just drinks it up!  Not too oily, just a touch will do. It has no smell.  The texture feels fine.  It really radiates my skin.  Even though I have had it only for a few weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to see what long-term results will be for more reduction in wrinkles. Thank you for your product.</li>
            <li> WONDELFUL, bought all products and will buy they Again. I noticed difference in just one week!!</li>
            <li> Works perfect, I saw the results just at the first night .... Love it!!!! I can&#x27;t wait until I done with it....</li>
            <li> I am a satisfied user of this product. It goes on easily, is absorbed into the skin and feels great. My skin is soft and supple, I re-ordered another jar today</li>
            <li> I saw results within a week on my 61 year old face. My skin looks and feels smoother and looks pleasantly plumper.&lt;br /&gt;This product disappears so quickly and I need to use so little of it!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is the scent. The addition of a little aromatherapy would make this serum better than perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very much for being such an attentive company too!&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this!!!  I am always looking for good organic skin products and this one is great!! The bonus is the price!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this product. I don&#x27;t know if it totally removes wrinkles or lifts the eyelids but I do know that it is a good moisturizer for putting all around the eyes because it is non irritating and doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to burn or get sticky during the night. I have very sensitive skin. I will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this then please do. You will be happy with the results.  The results gives a up lifting to your spirits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products, so I&#x27;m not making any promises. I seem to feel a difference in my skin.  I think this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for a few weeks morning and night.I did not notice any  good changes.The product is not moisturizing and my skin looks and feels dry.I am 49 years old and my skin is in a pretty good shape to start with.I was looking for firming benefits and I do not see them.In my opinion this product just do nothing,neither good or bad.</li>
            <li> I really did not see a difference in my skin. Will not be reordering. I guess I will keep looking for a product that may work : /</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars only because it was an okay moisturizer. But I used it for 2 months and didn&#x27;t notice any change to my face. Oil of olay works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Best anti-aging serum I have ever tried! This is my second jar, it is doing everything they advertise. My aging skin has never felt or looked better. Will continue to use Xfacio Labs products indefinitely. Love it and thank you for this great product!</li>
            <li> This product is great, but more important, the customer service is exceptionally awesome. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews but I wanted to for this product. I have been using the product for about 28 days and my face is a lot smoother than before. I notice people are looking at my skin differently too! I definitely would recommend this miracle cream to consumers!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love this product....I used it on only the left side of my face while using another infomercial serum on the right side. I had never used either serum previously.  After three weeks of twice daily application of both products on their respective sides, there is a noticeably improvement on the left side as compared to the right side.  I&#x27;ll have to reverse sides of product usage for a couple of weeks just to even things out, then use Xfacio exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled!  I&#x27;ve tried so many serums in the past, but have finally found one that works.  I LOVE the fact that it&#x27;s organic, all natural and paraben free too.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product !!!!!!Easy to use........Wonderful results</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me. I read the reviews before I ordered, and they were all good, so I gave it a try. It did absolutely nothing for me. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very nice product and glad to have it.  Just waiting now for the wrinkles to disappear!  Nothing has happened as yet!  Have to keep on trying!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> So far, the item has been proved to be working, not drastically, but my skin did seem to be tighter after just two weeks of usage. The only problem I have is the product seems only last 4 to 6 weeks. Mine is already reaching the bottom. I will buy again to see if the result is constant.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would help with turkey neck and sagging eyelids. Nope. It helps a little with lines. But I&#x27;m not seeing much of an improvement. Still looking for that miracle product. So far the knife seems to be the only cure.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product about a month now and I can say that I see and feel a difference in my skin. It is very hydrated and smooth. I love the product! It is affordable and produces results! I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Took a photo of myself one month ago and the difference is amazing.  My skin feels softer, my under eye bags are gone, wrinkles around the eye almost disappeared and the same with the wrinkles around my mouth,  I am 49 years old, spend way too much time in the sun and I have never looked better.  A friend even asked me what I was using on my skin.  Just don&#x27;t forget sunscreen.  Ordered my second jar and checking out the other products.  Thank you for this miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, and so far my skin is looking great , I am almost 50 ,so  I am impressed that it really does what it says, will order again and I would recommend</li>
            <li> I love this face serum.  I&#x27;m on my third purchase.  I have never used anything before that made my face look and feel so good.  I would highly recommend this.  My only complaint is that it runs out way too fast. Could be because I use it on my face, neck, chest, and hands!!</li>
            <li> this cream is making a difference in my skin. You really need to take a close up photo when you start using and then again in 30 nd 60 days.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working -- so far so good.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> great !!  I am 58 yr old man and this smooths out years of lines on my forehead..</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients included in this cream.  And the feel is great also.  Only bit on constructive input I can say it that the scent is a little unusual.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought all 4 products from XFACIO and absolutely love them.  I really see the difference in the texture and tone in my face. People are asking me what are you doing you look wonderful !! It is not greasy and no heavy perfume scent. My face feels soft with a nice healthy glow after I use all 4 products together. I use once in the morning before my makeup and than again as my nightly routine.  I have been only using for 2 weeks now can&#x27;t wait to see my improvement after long term use. The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise. I will be buying again. Love It !!</li>
            <li> The saggines under my eyes is gone!! does not leave your skin with a film over, is smooth, absorbs quickly, absolutly wonderful; I used it together with hyaluric acid and vit C.&lt;br /&gt;So far, this one is the best cream, better than Dior.</li>
            <li> Great product it works from the second day of using</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Makes my skin smooth and soft. Reduces the lines around my mouth  texture of my skin feels much firmer</li>
            <li> I used this product for the past month which is about how long the container lasted.  I only used it on my neck.  I do feel like it has helped reduce lines and creepiness.  No smell which is a great plus for me.  Many of the fragrant ones are too strong.  It has a very silky, not heavy texture.  I will probably reorder soon since it really takes about 3 months to see true results of skincare products.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.Just use it &amp; see the difference yourself when others will be noticing you constantly.Love this product. You will love it too.</li>
            <li> smells bad, so I haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li> I love this serum and have been using it every day since I bought it....&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s smooth on my skin and for the first time in a very long time, I look like&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m awake!  I have good skin that is getting wrinkled because I am now 66 and&lt;br /&gt;I live in a dry climate, but Xfacio is a great help.  Thanks a bunch...and btw, their&lt;br /&gt;customer service is great too!</li>
            <li> The seller emailed me to explain how the pump works as it is not a typical air pump. I really appreciated this as I sometimes ignore the inserts in the boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about 2 weeks and I love it. I have sensitive skin and this serum has no odor and feels very soothing going on. It absorbs quickly and leaves a clean fresh feeling. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks but I can already see that the texture of my skin is so smooth and soft. So pleased with this product that I bought one for my mother. :)</li>
            <li> Wish it would have worked even a little, but nothing. Just another bottle to put into the pile of lost dreams. Don&#x27;t bother girls.</li>
            <li> I waited for 6 weeks to review this product as I wasn&#x27;t aware of any difference right at first.  Now I can see the lines on each side of my face are not as deep.  Also, I love the way it makes my face feel moisturized even though it is not advertised as a moisturizer.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product. I noticed that my wrinkles under my eyes are less noticeable now since I started using this product. My face is clearer and even my pores are getting smaller. It is nice that the seller will send me a free jar for trying this product. I will rather use this product compared to the expensive one that I purchased before.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference after a month.</li>
            <li> I love this product! This is my second order. I tried it and took a picture before I started using this and I definitely see a difference. My skin is plumper, my lines are fading and I love the fact that it is all natural. I bought it again to see how I look after using another jar. I am going to try some of their other products now too!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Used this and Vernal and neither worked for me.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working well..and I will continue to use it...i am very pleased so far with the results...</li>
            <li> It is a serum that drive results within a short period of time. You need to be vigilant about the subtle and drastic changes that will occur with its use. I would recommend this product to others who are searching in their appearance regarding wrinkles and firming of skin.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin. Waiting to see the results but so far so good. Excellent customer service. They follow up with you and make sure you like the product and how it is working for you.</li>
            <li> First they sent an email explaining proper use because they want the customer to experience results. It&#x27;s all purpose:  For Your Face, Under Eye and Neck Guaranteed To Work. I saw softer skin and wrinkles soften within a day, seriously. I&#x27;m encouraged and will continue to use it and expect to see even greater results. Using with the Vitamin C serum. It doesn&#x27;t take but a bit to work and so it is also economical. Much better than products I&#x27;ve paid five times more for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and I am very satisfied. It is the dead of winter here in Maine and my face is not as dry as it usually gets this time of year. I also use the Xfacio vitamin C serum underneath it once a day and my face feels very smooth. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I took before photos , gave it several weeks , reshot photos and saw NO DIFFERENCE at all. guess it doesn&#x27;t work for me ????</li>
            <li> Great results in short time....I love it and see a smoother, more luminous skin...it glows.</li>
            <li> I am completely amazed &amp; satisfied with the result of Xfacio anti aging serum - organic -natural - peptide . My face is GLOWING  .</li>
            <li> love it,i can see the difference already.no fumes very ligh just what i wanted.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Took before pic &amp; anxious to see results. Used about 5 days now. Got what I order and it came very fast. Will buy again if I see a difference in one month. Back to say, it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks &amp; I noticed some change about 2 wks into it. Today a wk later I ask my husband, does my face look different...he said yes I figured you got new makeup. I Told him what I was doing and I don&#x27;t have any makeup on.&amp;#34; He said it has really made a big difference. I told him he should try using it also, not sure if he will but I think it would be great for men also. I was forever spending money to find something that works and I&#x27;ve had little changes but never have I had anything like this. If your like me and think &amp;#34;yea just another sales pitch&amp;#34; I promise you I wouldn&#x27;t do that. I get tired of being ripped off by people telling you things work and they don&#x27;t so for me....this really works! My daughter in law sales and brand product for this kind of cream but I won&#x27;t pay her price and this may even be better then the one she has. A lot better price that&#x27;s for sure. :- )</li>
            <li> I think it is too early to see any results.  I will repost once I have used it for awhile longer.</li>
            <li> Have bought some very expensive products that performed but were outrageously costly.  These from Xfacto, have three, deliver solid results without skin reactions. Have used for one month and recommend trying</li>
            <li> After looking for a face product that is mostly organic but also highly rated and not outrageously expensive I found Xfacio.&lt;br /&gt;My husband of 34 years noticed a positive difference of my face after about a week. That endorsement speaks volumes!&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems brighter and smoother, so gratefully, the search is over!</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks now, I see a difference in my face.  It seems very soft and I do believe the pores are a little smaller.  I am going to continue using product to see if I have a visible difference in lines and tightness.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results.  I have found my skin appears drier with use.  I am not ready to recommend the purchase of this product yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for mom and she is using it every day and she has already saved some money to order a new one. Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum based on the reviews.  However, it has been disappointing.  It seems more like a mild moisturiser...period.  There are much more effective, less expensive moisturisers available.  I wish I had saved my money for a truly working product.  Save your money!</li>
            <li> Natural wrinkle cream?  well I don&#x27;t see any difference at all.....so maybe it just didn&#x27;t work on me....I will keep looking for a cream that does what it says...</li>
            <li> I am just about finished with my first jar of xfacio and  I like how smoothly the product goes on and how soft and moisturized my face feels.  I am noticing some small changes in the fine lines around eyes and lips.  I use it twice daily morning and evening and a little goes a long way.  I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does soften my skin and make it look amazing.  Just ordered the vitamin C serum and flash firming spray.  Hopefully I love them as much. I am 46 and have been using this for a couple months now and I really like how soft my face feels. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for approx. 3-4 days, and already skin seems a little smoother. It feels good on my skin, Not sure if there is any noticeable difference yet, but I will continue to use for the next month or so... keep your fingers crossed... Ill keep ya updated..... looking forward to posting the difference.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. I have used this product for two weeks.  My skin is more firm overall, especially around my eyes.  Best product that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick, product was exactly as described.  Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. It gets irritated and red easily so I&#x27;m really careful with the ingredients I use on my face. X-faciolabs is a gentle and soothing serum. Within  a week of using X-faciolabs I can see my skin is hydrated giving me a younger glow. Even my sister asked me what I was using. The serum is not oily and it has a good light scent which disappears quickly and that&#x27;s great because strong scented moisturizers make me nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found X-faciolabs because it works as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended X-faciolabs  anti-aging serum to my sister.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful! I will never leave home without it, saying goodbye to my facial lines and flaws is awesome!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I have been using it for about 1 week and I see results!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Just started using product.  Shipping and customer service have been great.  Hope it lives up to its reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Not greasy or oily.  I used it for a week, and I started to notice my crows feet were not so deep, and the wrinkles in my forehead were also getting smaller.  I cant wait to see how I look after a full month.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star because I&#x27;ve just started using it, but am so excited about the results even after only 3 days.  My skin feels smoother already.  There is a tightening effect upon using the serum and they do recommend using a moisturizer over it, which basically eases the tightness feeling.  But means the serum is working.  Would highly recommend giving this a try, I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;Just purchased their Vit C serum as well, and wow the combination feels great on my tired old skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m another person who has never written a review however after using this serum I feel compelled to do so.  And no, I am not an employee of the company nor was I paid to promote the product.  I, like you, am a woman who is willing to spend money without having to mortgage her house on a good skin product, and I think I struck gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s with skin that has experinced life.  I have laugh lines, crow&#x27;s feet, and your garden variety age spot.  Well, it&#x27;s been almost a month and I still have all of those things but they are incredibly minimized with much improved skin tone and clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the serum with the understanding that it may or may not be sucessful and I definitely had zero expectation of having my 25 year old skin return.  But I am pretty impressed with what has transpired and I just ordered my second bottle which I&#x27;m happy to announce worked perfectly.  What a concept, designing a bottle that actually allows you to use every last drop of the product...brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, kudos to their customer service AKA Mia; she&#x27;s very responsive and helpful and does a bang up job on follow-up!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item, I spect that was as others that I have bought before.  No.  This is better.  Good smell, and let the skin of your face smooth for all day. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Instructions were for a pump. The bottle was not a pump. I noticed no facial change! The facebook ad and the agreement was a farce. The site would not let me leave or click out in any way I had to shut down my computer. No information was sent to me by email or in the box and customer service was bright, chipper, and useless. Closing remark was &amp;#34;Merry Christmas&amp;#34;. I was offered a 60% discount to try their other product!</li>
            <li> I will never waste my money on such little product that does nothing.  There is so much better serums out there.  It is a total rip off</li>
            <li> The serum is very rich but not greasy, makes the skin feel very smooth, and had NO IRRITATION even using it around my eyes! No perfume, I have an allergic reaction to the perfumes in creams, and can&#x27;t use most big brand&#x27;s creams. Excellent product so far!! Thank you XFacio Labs for making the effort with natural and efficient ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;Also excellent service from this company. Had a problem with 1 of the 2 bottles I bought and they are replacing it, plus sending an extra one because they want me to send the problem one back in order to check it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now.  I can honestly say that my skin is much smoother/softer and more supple.  I typically have problems with a &amp;#34;sunken look&amp;#34; under my eyes and this product has definitly helped to smooth under my eyes.  I also have pretty dry skin, and it has helped tremendously with that.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery of my product was SUPER FAST!!!!  And the customer service support has been amazing!!!  I will def continue to try/use these products!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy  with xfacio  advanced vitamin c serum. This product is the best I have ever used. Trust me I have used a lot didn&#x27;t  get the result I was looking for. My face is toner and brighter after a week of using xfacio serum.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the follow up from the company.&lt;br /&gt;Never purchase a product before and get such good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Thank u Mia for taking such interest. Looking forward to try your new products. I will  recommend to my friends and family. God bless keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate its effectiveness because I didn&#x27;t use it. However, it had too many chemicals in it. That&#x27;s the reason for 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I guess this cream is ok but the packaging is the worst that I have ever seen.  I probably left at least a 1/4th of the serum in the bottle and just threw it away.  The pump dispenser does not work well and I did take the top off and scrape some of the serum out.  I prefer jars that let you use all of the product, especially at this price.  There are products out there just as good or even better in a container that is more efficient.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin the way so many others have done and it isn&#x27;t at all greasy. I used Oil of Olay for years and now I want to stick to this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have seen noticeable improvement, but over the age of 70, perhaps only surgery would do that.&lt;br /&gt;I can say I agree with the comments on how good it feels on my face. The product costs about the same as those I got at the drugstore.  Because of the way it feels, I will continue using it for a few months and then make a final decision.</li>
            <li> I recently returned from a 10 day trip to visit my family. Upon my return I was met with some pretty nice compliments on my skin.  I have been using XFACIO for a little over a month now and I hadn&#x27;t noticed any big differences but according to my husband and a few of my friends, they had! I was pleased to say the least!  I love the smell and the texture of the creme.  I use it at night and I put a little bit on in the morning under my day creme.  I will continue to use it, I even bought a jar for my husband! I will continue to update!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a very pleasant experience with this serum. Fortunately, I noticed improvement in under a week and I like the texture. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day after cleansing my face and applied a light moisturizer afterwards. I am looking forward to the results after 60 days. I&#x27;ll be exploring more of the Xfacio products.</li>
            <li> I really like this Serum. It is light and not greasy.  I use it day and night.  I will buy it again</li>
            <li> So I have to admit I&#x27;ve only used it for one day, but it feels GREAT on my face and neck. I&#x27;ll give more feedback in a week or so, but my first reaction is I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using Xfacio for about a week and I can really see a difference! No, it didn&#x27;t erase my DEEP lines that took 50+ years to create but it has smoothed out the wrinkles to the degree that my friends tell me I look \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; than usual, that I look more rested and less stressed. In fact, most have asked me if I changed my make up :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only change I&#x27;ve made is using Xfacio. I put it on in the morning before my moisturizer and I put it on at night after washing my face.  It feels so refreshing; helps me wake up and feels so clean right before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it only takes a little bit to cover my face so a bottle is going to go a long way.</li>
            <li> This lovely light-weight anti-aging sinks right into the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling.  You can put your mkeup right over it.  At age 60, I really needed something that would soften the fine lines and give my skin a firmer texture.  After using this product for a couple of weeks, I am really happy with the results!  The lines around my eyes have softened a lot.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I have seen results, around my lips and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to other women or men.&lt;br /&gt;In fact I&#x27;m ordering another supply today.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and i&#x27;ve always been an avid consumer of Dr perricone products big price difference I loved how it smoothes in the skin and a one day use made a big difference. Love it</li>
            <li> After a challenging arrival of the product (to no fault of the company) the magical serum arrived.  I have used it about a week and do notice some improvement in my aging areas.  My upper lip seemed to have some creases and under my eyes I had bags and sunken areas since having cataract surgery.  I love the way the product feels and absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  It is well worth the price and I would love to have a years supply.  Again, thanks for the great customer service...</li>
            <li> You know everyone skin is different, but this product works for me. I use it every morning and it gives my skin fresh look.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this great serum, as I am involved in many skin care endeavors.  This is a very nice serum - it goes on smoothly, have high-grade ingredients and feels good on the skin.  After some applications I could see a difference - collagen production is important and this serum encourages it. It also moisturizes well and I emphasized use under the eyes.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I just re-ordered XFACIO. I usually buy the way more expensive serums, but have not found one that I like as much as this one. I&#x27;m hooked and have been recommending it to others. I&#x27;m relieved to have finally found a skin system that I&#x27;ll stick with and quit spending more to get the results that this gives. I hope that it works as well for you too.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no difference in wrinkle improvement.  I was very disappointed since I had seen so many positive comments.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love this serum you can actually feel the lifting effects. I do not have wrinkles put puffiness under the eyes and am starting to get some neck lines. I have been using this product for over a month and the puffiness under the eyes is greatly reduced. Also the neck lines are barely visible, I am 54 years old. I used this product after I&#x27;ve cleansed my face and neck in the morning and at night. The serum spreads nicely so a little goes a long way. I have used Olay products for skin firming but feel this one is superior to those. Nothing can really turn back the hands of time, but with this product you can slow it down a bit. This product has given me the confidence to wear V necklines again. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Have just started using this product.  I love the scent and how very little is needed to achieve hydration.  It feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I will def purchase it again!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is working!  I can see a visible improvement in my skin.  I love it and plan to never be out of it again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love this serum!! This was my second purchase; I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in during my 65+ years and this is, by far, the best! So happy I gave this a try.  Customer service is outstanding. Highly recommend. &amp;#34;  April 13, 2015 Updated Review:  I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for almost 5 months now.  I mostly have dry skin.  I am fair complexed, and over 65.  I have noticed a great improvement in my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin.  Wrinkles don&#x27;t appear overnight, so I didn&#x27;t expect them to go away overnight either. But during the last few months, my wrinkles have softened (some were very deep).  I do believe sagging has improved also...but it&#x27;s not a facelift.  If you expect miracles, you will be disappointed.  I wanted soft, healthy looking skin...and that&#x27;s exactly what I got!  I&#x27;m very happy with my results so far.  I also use Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serums (under the Best Anti-Aging Serum).  Be patient and consistent; you won&#x27;t be disappointed either.</li>
            <li> This is great serum ~ feels good on the skin ~ however, there is no difference in wrinkles as it claims.  I have been using it morning &amp; evenings for 2 weeks now.  Maybe it just takes longer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far! I love the way it goes on and absorbs. I will be a regular customer from now on!</li>
            <li> I like this product so much that I just made another order.  I think I will be using this for some time to come, I love the results.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Xfacio so obviously I&#x27;m happy with it. It arrived early and it comes with much online support for your beauty regime. I find that this product leaves  my skin so soft. I put it on in am then put my usual moisture cream over it. My moisture cream, which has a slight tint to it glides on. At night after washing my face I us only the Xfacio. Try it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after have read the reviews from other buyers and they were totally right, it is a very good quality product and it delivers what it promises! Very good indeed! I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to pamper their skin. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product. I had been usung Strivectin TL-tightening face serum but when I went to reorder found the price had gone up way more then I wanted to pay. So, I got this instead and am very pleased with it. It is ever bit as good as the strivectin and maybe even better. I will know better when I have used it longer.I will definitely reorder this.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, goes on well under make up. Smells nice and my sensitive skin can handle a twice per day application. Jury is still out on the firming properties. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and just started using facial products during the past year. I have noticed reduction in the bags under my eyes. (Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is I can use this on and around my eyes with out burning). I will say that I believe dark circles under the eyes are genetic; however, if you don&#x27;t have \\&quot;eye baggage\\&quot;, make up does a better job hiding the circles. As of now, I do not regret the purchase, nor have I found any product qualities that have caused me to consider using it a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Really love this serum. Makes my skin extra soft. I&#x27;ve ordered it 3 times and plan to continue using. Love it!</li>
            <li> This anti aging serum  is wonderful, it makes your face so soft.  I had some really dry places on my face and this product has helped remarkably already. Haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle yet, but there will be more to come.  Love it.  I would recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> First of all, the seller of this item was fantastic.  I received the product quickly and the price was quite reasonable.  With that said, the product itself just is not what I was looking for in a serum.  Rather than making my skin feel silky, it just left it dry and tight.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bottle of this product. The product itself is great, it gives the smooth skin feeling, i&#x27;m 42 year old man and i&#x27;m trying to make delay any aging signs and i tried too many products with big names but i didn&#x27;t see any results and when i got this Xfacio Anti-Aging Serum i started to notice the difference on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Beside the product, i have to say the best thing is the customer service. they respond quickly to any concern or question and they do what it takes to earn the business.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day under my moisturizer. It is silky, and lightweight. I love this product, thank you.</li>
            <li> The product is very light and refreshing... So far I am very pleased. As for the customer service, Mia is outstanding and very helpful!! Hard to find customer service like this anymore... .&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t bother my skin, but for the money i would rather buy from the drug store if you&#x27;re not looking for anything that has a dramatic result buy this.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase Xfacio but once I started using the cream LOVED it!!!!!  It felt so soothing on my face and my skin felt so soft after each application.  FOR SURE will purchase this product again as it feels wonderful on the skin and my face looks great since I started to use the cream.  I&#x27;ve very sensitive skin and can become irritated w/the mildest and pure product on the market; however, even on days my face felt irritated XFacio made it feel so much better and reduced the burning and irritation experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A WINNER !!!!!</li>
            <li> Loving what I&#x27;m seeing so far!  I have been using it regularly for 3 weeks but wasn&#x27;t paying too close attention to my fine lines, but the other day I realized there&#x27;s a slight-yet-noticeable difference already.  It has also helped even out my complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month and 1/2 now.  I use it at night before I put on face mositurizer.  I wanted it to try and tighten up the sagging skin under my chin (turkey neck).  I don&#x27;t have a huge turkey neck, but was definitely noticing that I could see a double chin starting and nothing else I was using was changing it.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference right away, but about 2 weeks ago I happen to be looking at myself in the mirror and noticed that the skin under my chin wasn&#x27;t sagging as much.  I even tried moving my head in different directions just to see if maybe it was the way my head was tilted.  It was not, no matter which way I moved my head made no difference.  My skin under my neck is definitly tightened.  I&#x27;m sold and now will make this a part of my regular skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more note on this product.  You&#x27;ll read that it doesn&#x27;t have a good smell.  Those reviews are true, it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell, but I put a night cream over it that does (after the serum soaks into my skin and dries) and the night cream smells good.  Once the serum dries you don&#x27;t smell it.  It works which is the most important and why I will continue to buy.  Also, it&#x27;s a reasonable price for serum.</li>
            <li> I recently received my order for both the Vitamin C and Anti Aging serums. The Vitamin C bottle arrived with its stopper broken. During the shipment  the inside of the box was oily from the seepage and the stopper wouldn&#x27;t work. Instead of drawing out the serum it only produced bubbles; about 1/3 of the serum remained in the bottle. I was having to apply with a finger and was blowing through what was left at an alarming rate. I complained to the company about it and it was Mia to the rescue. She informed me that she would personally send me another bottle today Prime Shipping. In addition to solving my problem immediately her own lovely personality just shined through. Thank you so much, Mia, for your graciousness in fixing my problem in record time. I hope that your company realizes what a superlative employee they have in you! Thank you so much for going beyond the last mile for me. Your products are  wonderful but the real frosting on the cake is YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, having used a lot of anti-aging creams in the past, but after using using Xfacio anti aging serum for several weeks, I am happy to say that I have finally found a product that actually does what it advertises.  The serum has a nice texture to it so when I applied it to my face, it absorbed immediately. My skin seems to just drink it in!  The skin on my face feels softer and has a luminous youthful glow to it.  The fine lines have diminished and my skin tone is even.  I have actually gone to work without using foundation because my skin did not need it after applying the serum.  To my pleasure, I have received many compliments on my skin.  There are a lot of products I can&#x27;t use because of the smell, this product is not one of them.  I plan to continue to buy this product and other products that Xfacio Labs may develop in the future.  If you want a youthful look to your face, I would highly recommend you use this anti-aging serum.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;E.M.P.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it has no oily feeling and doesn&#x27;t leave&lt;br /&gt;my face all shiny after application. I&#x27;ve only used it&lt;br /&gt;for a few days, and no...I don&#x27;t look like my 20 year old self, yet :)&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ll let you know when I do ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does seem as though there&#x27;s a more natural vibrancy&lt;br /&gt;and glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this goes on my face and absorbs really quickly. It doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy and leaves a matt finish which I like. I hate looking all shiny! Since I don&#x27;t wear any makeup I like to use a really good moisturizer. I will update this review when I have been using the serum for longer and hopefully I will look 5 years younger by then!</li>
            <li> good moisture control for my dry skin, but does it rennovate my old, tired saggy eyes?  Nope, just another hopeful product that fell short. I gave it 3 stars because it is a decent product, but does not do what it advertised, ie, remove saggy skin and bags and make you look younger. No different than the $5 moisture lotion at the local store, better buys are out there somewhere but don&#x27;t pay the big bucks for this one and expect miracles</li>
            <li> I think so far, this is a great product. I had bags under my eyes that nothing worked to tone them down. I believe with a little time, this may be the product to assist in lessening them. I do see a difference, and skin feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!  I have used various anti-aging serums over the past few years and Xfacio is by far the best.  I am a couple months shy of 66 years old and everyone tells me I look at least 10 years younger.  Keep up the good work, Xfacio Labs.</li>
            <li> Noticed absolutely nothing even after 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great Serum! Feels very nice going on and absorbs quickly. Helps my moisturizer and night cream absorb better.&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have gone through one jar of this already and on my way through the second jar.  That&#x27;s why I just purchased my third jar!  I love the way this stuff feels.  It is smooth.  It does not feel sticky or thick--especially important under makeup living in the humid South.  Now, if we can just get an awesome face wash..... :)))</li>
            <li> I love the how easily it is absorbed in the skin and goes on smoothly and not greasy.  I&#x27;ve definitely notice a difference since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product, I&#x27;ve ordered it twice already wanting to make sure the long term results were good and I am very happy with it.  It&#x27;s an excellent product at a really good price!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Works great</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful  product and it does what is says! It works great for me, makes my skin look smoother,fuller and brighter.. I do not see my deep wrinkles decreasing yet, but I do see some results on my fine lines.And my skin feels tighter- I even got a compliment from esthetician when getting a facial. She asked me what kind of product I&#x27;m using to have such a great skin elasticity. For being 61, to hear that felt really good. A couple days ago I ordered the Best Vitamin C serum and I&#x27;m very pleased with it as well. When visited xfacio labs site I was excited to see that an eye cream will come out soon. I&#x27;m looking forward to it so, so, so much!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Xfacio for your excellent products!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  I will continue to use it due to the fact that it makes a difference on my skin.  I am delighted that I tried it and gave it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Great products are hard to find!</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of this and gave it a good 8 weeks and it did not change one line on my face or neck.  I will say that it did not irritate my eyes.  I would not recommend this product as it does not do what it claims.</li>
            <li> Tried lots of anti aging products....best ever! 60 and I can tell a difference in the feel of my skin after 2 weeks. Surprise, surprised!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the comments of previous customers. It has been keeping my face softer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried for quite some time. Thank you</li>
            <li> I really love this anti aging serum and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time. It goes on and disappears into my skin without any oily or sticky feeling whatsoever. My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother. I&#x27;ve tried a number of the much more expensive brand name anti aging serums and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product. There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it. I love it!</li>
            <li> No improvement, did not see any ,  one line disappear not totally impressed, with that product wou not it againuy I</li>
            <li> I have been using this Serum for a month. And, I was not confident that it would work.  But this is the best PRODUCT I have used in years.  I have noticed that my skin is softer and smoother.  I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and I have always received compliments on my skin.  (I always keep my skin protected from the sun and keep moisturized all the time). Lately I&#x27;ve notice fine lines around my eyes and started using this serum - it really works. The fine lines are not noticable anymore. This is a miracle SERUM!</li>
            <li> So far the cream is keeping my face smooth and soft feeling.  I am in my late 60s so a miracle is not expected.  I will no doubt buy more.  If nothing else it will help keep more wrinkles from showing up.</li>
            <li> So this is my second time ordering this product and I really feel like it makes such a nice difference in my skin tone.  My skin tone is firmer and of course that means less wrinkles! I am not fanatical about my skin routine but with just regular use this Serum makes a visible difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the product I&#x27;ve been looking for. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now.Other products that are this good at making my skin brighter and more supple also irritated my skin. For what it does its a bargain. On top of a fine product at an appropriate price, this company says it doesn&#x27;t test on animals, so I am all the more pleased.</li>
            <li> Loving this!!! I bought the whole line and must say these products leave your skin beautiful!! My lines have already softened and my skin looks supple and healthy, I can&#x27;t wait to see me in 28 days, as I have only been using for  three days and my skin has already perked up, what can I say I just look better! I have spent hundreds of dollars looking for skincare that really works but but i AM ALWAYS DISSAPPOINTED, hopeing its different this time, as the price for Xfacio products is really reasonable compared to a lot of others, will give another reveiw after 28 days when I can see full results!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It feels really light on my skin and very moisturizing. The best anti-aging serum I ever had, strongly recommend. I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Have only used for a few days and see a noticeable improvement.  I will continue to observe but am glad, at this point, that I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many skincare products , I have to say the customer service is above and beyond what you could ever expect ! All products from this line have left my skin looking so great in such a short period of time  , you have to try them , see for yourself  !!Love them !</li>
            <li> Started using it; this is my third day and my skin does feel different; I am 62 years old and am happy to have a cream that feels non sticky and glides into my skin. I will continue to use over the next month where I should be able to say more.</li>
            <li> This is my third order for this product. I love it. With the realization the cost may seem rather high, it is worth it. It does everything it claims, and a small amount is all that is needed for one application. At 71 years old I need all the help I can get, but this would be a great product whether you are 71 or 17. I know this to be true because my 17 year old foreign exchange &#x27;daughters&#x27; have asked to borrow a moisturizer, and I have given them my XFACIO. They love it not only because it works, but also because it is gentle, doesn&#x27;t bother their eyes when wearing their contacts, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream.  I have noticed an improvement.  No, didn&#x27;t turn into a 25 year old, 6&#x27; gorgeous blond, athletic woman....still 69 and short, but it has provided a tiny improvement, The wrinkles are a little less noticeable. I do the smile test.....with this cream the wrinkles smile a little less than I do. It feels wonderful when you apply the cream...and if nothing else it is holding the line or lines however you want to look at it.... also they send you friendly little emails just to say hi...how&#x27;s it goin&#x27;...and thanks for buying our product.  Additionally, they tell you the jar the cream comes in is a special jar and not to throw it away.  Not sure what you could use it for, maybe keeping the ashes of your pet snail that passed away recently or something...but a special jar is not to be sneezed at ..right?  So, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice large jar with almost 2 ounces. The product goes on clean, no greasy feeling, and you only need a little bit. I am excited to give it a good try.</li>
            <li> So far I love the product!</li>
            <li> my skin reacted to this cream. it was ok on my neck though. if you have sensitive skin, like having rosacea like me, this is good for neck (at least for me) but not face or even decollate, the consistency was nice too.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  It is suggested to take a selfie to see if the product works for you.  I don&#x27;t need a selfie, I can see the results.  The wrinkles on my lips aren&#x27;t as deep and my age spots are vanishing!  I am pleasantly surprised how well this product works.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product...wwill definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully. Prompt service and I will order again. Thank you</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE  this Best Anti Aging Serum.  It smells wonderful too.  The consistency is like whipped cream, absolutely AMAZING...Not to mention what it does for my skin!!  It soaks right in, no greasy feeling at all.  My make-up goes on beautifully too after it is applied.  The moment I put it on my face, my skin looks instantly firmer and  younger....I get many compliments since I stated using it.  The more that I have used it, the more my skin is looking younger and I am 65 years old...  Love what it has done for my neck too...I highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t make your skin greasy. It absorbs quickly and makes your skin very smooth. I am very pleased with this product. The fragrance is very light which I enjoy, heavy fragrance gives me a headache which then  I am unable to use. I am glad I found this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with xfacio products!! My mom and I swear by the anti aging serum. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Received this product several weeks ago and love it.  Have used some of the most expensive brands available and this product holds its own!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream. My skin is in between oily and dry but when I wash it&#x27;s extremely dry. When I apply the serum my skin  is soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I also never have to worry about wrinkles because it also help my skin from aging.&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends. I also received it days before it was suppose to arrive and that was a plus because I was excited bout using my new product. I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try and I have used it several times over the past three days.  I like the way my skin feels after applying the serum, very soft and smooth, not sticky (like some other serum products).  I like the quality of the pump, the serum pumps out very well and the look and design of the bottle.  I am excited about the potential of it reducing the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles. I need all the help I can get. I will continue to use this product and am very hopeful to see its results.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and is easily irritated.  This sounds like it could be a safe and effective product for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got the product in quickly.  I love the texture of the product and it seems to go on smooth.  Not a harsh smell, but a pleasant smell.  It smells the way you think something is good for you smells.  Not perfume type smell.  I will keep you updated on my progress on this product.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!  The texture and smell are wonderful and I look better and my skin just glows.  My friends tell me that I must have no stress at all because I look 10 years younger then I am :0)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product. It leaves my skin very supple and toned. It&#x27;s very well priced and has lasted longer than other anti aging creams &amp; serums I&#x27;ve used. I wear it at night and I don&#x27;t leave home without applying it in the morning.  I I love the jar and that it&#x27;s a  &amp;#34;Biophotonic&amp;#34;  jar  for the long term potency, preservation and effectiveness of the product. I am not exactly sure what Biophotonic means but it appears that it comes from photons which has something to do with electromagnetics. And bio means &amp;#34;life&amp;#34;.  I also enjoyed reading Mia&#x27;s after purchase emails on facial cleansing tips. I am encouraged to use a gentle exfoliate or facial cleansing brush to remove make up and dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using a hyaluronic acid as well, but after reading the review about the vitamin c, I think I will add it to my regimen. I&#x27;ve noticed that the marionette lines that I have are starting to soften up.</li>
            <li> I am trying several different brands of face cream to find what works best for me. This product i have been using for about 3 weeks now, and with favorable results. Prior I had tried Dermaset, which is a very good product, but a bit pricey to continue using for a longer period. Bottom line this product smoothes and softenens, absorbs very fast into your skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> LOVE,LOVE LOVE this product. Recieved Xfacio about 4 days ago, I love the feel of this product on my face from day one. I apply my makeup a few minutes after I applied this Anti Aging Serum and my makeup looks great. I always apply whatever product I use on my face on my hands also, WOW I can see the difference on my hands right away. This is a product I will be using for a very long time.”</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I want to try other products of this company.</li>
            <li> I have been using xfacio for 2 weeks now. I must say I saw a difference in my skin in a week after using it.  I am 45 and even though I do not have many visable rinkles, the few that I  do see visable have smoothed out and my skin looks healthier.  I will definitely buy it a gain.</li>
            <li> Just like any other cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent ingredient list at an excellent price!  Moisturizing and clarifying without making me break out.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Xfacio for a few weeks but like the fact that the serum is light and easy to apply.  At this point I have not noticed much difference in my skin but my skin feels good when I apply the serum.  I will most likely re-purchase another and give the product a little more time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased expensive designer products and have had fillers and Botox injected in an effort to defy Mother Nature and years of skin neglect to age a little more gracefully. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and tried XFACIO cream/serum as a last ditch effort. I&#x27;m on my third week of use and am absolutely amazed at the difference! Neck lines have all but disappeared except for one horizonal line. The biggest surprise is the definite loss of vertical lip lines! I apply a small amount morning and evening.This is a gem and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again as well as check out otherproducts from this company.</li>
            <li> I like the way it goes on,  very smooth and light. A little goes a long way and the skin does feel and look brighter and tighter. The only complaint is it could smell just a little bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Really do love what&#x27;s it&#x27;s doing for my skin.  Love  the way it feels.  I do have to watch it on upper eye lids though, they are too sensitive for this.  But overall, great product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Jury is still out on this cream.  It did seem to lighten the skin distress I feel  during the harsh Chicago winters. I am only halfway thru my first jar but will continue on to the second to finalize my opinion. I have tried so many serums and creams, and while I know there is no stopping the aging process, I do hope to find lotions that make my skin feel moisturized and comfortable. I use this serum under a moisturizer and so far so good on my 54 year old sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome face anti age cream that instantly makes your face feel cool and refreshed. This cream after a weeks use is beginning to make such a big difference by the fine lines around my eyes have softened  and my crows feet have softened. My skin it&#x27;s brighter and more radiant. This it&#x27;s an excellent cream for the money and does so much as a when even compared to more expensive creams that provide the same thing. A lot of people claim that there expensive product is the one to use. XFACIO will deliver all it says that it will do and for a great price. I am a new customer and will continue to use this product. It think it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using this product for 6 months now and it&#x27;s better than any cream I&#x27;ve used before.  I have &#x27;tired eyes&#x27; and this tightens the skin under my eye and reduced the dark circles.  You can really tell the difference!</li>
            <li> I am a skin care \\&quot;junkie,\\&quot; which means I read label ingredients and stay informed about ingredients that make a difference. This Xfacio Labs Anti-Aging Serum is full of key, up-to-the-minute anti-aging ingredients. Not only that, the serum is luxurious, goes on smoothly, and while it sinks into the skin, it also keeps the skin hydrated. This is important. I have tried other serums and creams that disappear into the skin and it&#x27;s as if I never applied anything. This Xfacio Anti-Aging Serum is different, and I am excited to use it and very pleased with the results. Beauty tip: Use it on the backs of your hands. It doesn&#x27;t take much and will help de-age the hands, too! Nice product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 months and I would not say I can see a big change in my wrinkles but my face is definitely smoother.  I only use this at night and do feel a tightness in my skin which I assume is resulting in the smoothness I&#x27;m experiencing.  I will definitely continue to use this product and would recommend it.</li>
