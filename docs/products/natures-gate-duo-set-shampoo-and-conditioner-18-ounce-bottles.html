            <li>Have not used the shampoo yet, but have used Nature&#x27;s Gate conditioner for a while now, and love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and i love that its not tested on animals &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I love the smell (which says a lot since I am allergic to most fragrances).  </li>
            <li>I shampooed and conditioned with it two times and love the results.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok, not my favorite.</li>
            <li>It acually frizzed up my hair more.</li>
            <li>Love the natures gate product line.</li>
            <li>The result is shiny, bouncy hair that looks and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>Could do better on the packaging.</li>
            <li>3 stars because it&#x27;s inexpensive, lasts forever, and feels refreshing on your scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is as described, but I just have found others I like better.</li>
            <li>It smells very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is very rich and creamy, too.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I was mostly looking for an affordable sulfate free shampoo and conditioner combo</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and my my hair looks great, but the conditioner is so hard</li>
            <li>Healthy and good for my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Great price, smells amazing and does not leave my hair dry!!</li>
            <li>I just sat for almost an hour and enjoyed the cool tingling on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I no longer have itchy scalp and my hair is super soft...love it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t testify to the long-term effects (i.e. build-up, dullness, etc.), but after a couple of uses, I am a HUGE fan.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my hair, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues to begin with.</li>
            <li>I hope this keeps working because it is so much more economical than salon shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very manageable and smelling nice but not an over powering smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told I should use sulfate free shampoo for my curly curly hair for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this duo set for three months now, and I love how natural and effective this product is.</li>
            <li>that I know many adults, older or with arthritis, that would probably not be able to get the product out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo &amp; conditioner seem to work well - plenty of lather and leaves you hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Works well,nice lather, leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and the gentle clean</li>
            <li>So I was super excited to receive this since I had an itchy scalp from hell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t help all that much with dandruff in my experience.. but the tea tree smell is pretty nice</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for his short hair and dandruff.</li>
            <li>It seems to work well, and I do like the smell even though it&#x27;s pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is super liquidy, so it just dumps out of the bottle when you go to get some.</li>
            <li>Super shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My shampoo and conditioner arrived very quickly and were even delivered on a Sunday thanks to prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>Especially my scalp ( as more product was on that area).</li>
            <li>And why can&#x27;t this stuff smell nice like other nature gate products and still work?  </li>
            <li>The tea tree makes my scalp feel refreshed and my hair looks soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is natural and cruelty free though I have oily hair and even with very minimal conditioner my hair stays pretty oily.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and since using it my hair loss has stopped and new hair is growing back!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for the smell and product did not work very well.</li>
            <li>As much as I need tee tree oil for my scalp, I will not purchase again.  </li>
            <li>I found this and was drawn to the fact it had tea tree for scalp treatment as I have a very dey scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine, highlighted hair, and the shampoo does make my hair feel very dry after sudsing up and rinsing.</li>
            <li>for the shampoo and conditioner, the smell is very different from most other products, but it grew on me very fast.</li>
            <li>When I received mine, both the shampoo and conditioner had leaked from the top and bottles were smashed a little.</li>
            <li>Normally if I stop the dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li>But doesn&#x27;t live up to what it says it should do.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells like some medical solution, not the refreshing tea tree scent I expected.</li>
            <li>after I started using these products my room mates began to comment on how nice my hair was lately, the only thing that changed in my normal hair routine was my transition to this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I spent a little extra money on this product, hoping for good quality</li>
            <li>So if you want something to make your hair feel soft and moisturizer after just a shampoo, I don&#x27;t think you will like this.</li>
            <li>hmmm hair is so soft... almost too soft.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and daughter have issues with oily + flaky scalps and after several uses this really cleared it up a lot (after not having any luck with T Gel and the like).</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a typical heavy/weigh down feeling, just kind of a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo after reading that tea tree oil is very helpful for dry scalps.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner adds in the right amount of moisture without weighing down your hair.</li>
            <li>It removed 100% of my dandruff and I would never go back to my old ways.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with this issue for almost a year and have tried several different shampoos and treatments, and this is the only one that has done much of anything.</li>
            <li>When left on a few minutes and rinsed off, the conditioner makes my scalp feels cool and tingly.</li>
            <li>The top lid was broken when it got delivered</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my flakes and my hair feels extra dry when I towl it out after my shower</li>
            <li>I have major scalp issues and this is the only one that seems to help</li>
            <li>I bought this with high hopes of ridding my scalp of white, dry, flaking, itching skin.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too bad to clean up and the cap went back on easily.  </li>
            <li>Also helped clear up my dry scalp</li>
            <li>The condition is super thick.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, but I found that it dried my hair out pretty bad.</li>

            <li> The conditioner adds in the right amount of moisture without weighing down your hair.</li>
            <li> It removed 100% of my dandruff and I would never go back to my old ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with this issue for almost a year and have tried several different shampoos and treatments, and this is the only one that has done much of anything.</li>
            <li> When left on a few minutes and rinsed off, the conditioner makes my scalp feels cool and tingly.</li>
            <li> The top lid was broken when it got delivered</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my flakes and my hair feels extra dry when I towl it out after my shower</li>
            <li> I have major scalp issues and this is the only one that seems to help</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes of ridding my scalp of white, dry, flaking, itching skin.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad to clean up and the cap went back on easily.  </li>
            <li> Also helped clear up my dry scalp</li>
            <li> The condition is super thick.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, but I found that it dried my hair out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> no tingle sensation, doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to control dandruff, and just not a huge fan of the way my hair feels after washing and conditioning.  </li>
            <li> Was having major issues with dry scalp...</li>
            <li> The conditioner did nothing to detangle the stripped mess the highly astringent shampoo caused my hair to become.  </li>
            <li> so there was not a mess in the box or on other items.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a shampoo and conditioner that used natural ingredients with as little of the harmful commercial varieties found in mainstream shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice and already about 80% of the dry flakes are gone.</li>
            <li> I have thick Asian hair and very dry/frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of tea tree shampoo and apparently when it comes to quality price matters.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair smelling minty all day long!</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry, while also looking greasy.</li>
            <li> However, this did absolutely nothing to help my dandruff, and I think it actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> I may add some water or other all natural liquid in there to help but that would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I used only a small amount and it left my hair so waxy and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I just mixed in a little water and that seemed to do the trick for now.</li>
            <li> There is a list of ingredients with some words that I can&#x27;t pronounce which is usually a bad sign, but it appears that most of the ingredients are plant derived.  </li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I tried many different products, but hated the way they smelled, especially sulfur.</li>
            <li> I have only been using these for a few weeks, but I like them.</li>
            <li> (havent changed my methods or duration of towl) which makes applying leave in conditioner a drag.</li>
            <li> The major complaint I have is with the Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The skin flakes seemed nearly endless.</li>
            <li> The reason I only give 4 stars is because the conditioner is really hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for several years, my hair is thick and when washed becomes frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have to keep the bottle upside down to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit desperate to find a natural remedy that would actually work without the overbearing smell.</li>
            <li> and I just remembered, when I opened the package one of the bottles had opened slightly.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after using half of each bottle.</li>
            <li> I tried several brands, including several expensive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands and came across this set.</li>
            <li> Thankfully they were tightly plastic wrapped together</li>
            <li> and I think it has helped a little with the flakes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was a little cheaper with both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few months now, but the none of my symptoms resolved.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> only problem I&#x27;ve had is that the conditoner is VERY thick and is sometimes hard to get out of the bottle, even with tons of shaking and squeezing.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t really bad, but I will probably look for something different next time.</li>
            <li> Shady.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers are correct in saying that the conditioner is so thick it&#x27;s difficult to get it out of the bottle, though I did not feel like it weighed my hair down like some people reported.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is very thick and weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on a cold winter day and I am not sure if it was the weather or the product (since it is still like that over a month later) but the conditioner would not come out of the bottle!  </li>
            <li> I have to squeeze the bottle really hard to get the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> It was so thick I had to squeeze with both hands until I was shaking to get it to come</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> It is so thick, you can hardly get it out of the container!</li>
            <li> We use tea tree shampoo because ticks and lice hate the smell and do not come near you!</li>
            <li> I was using Pantene for a while, but was never comfortable with the questionable chemicals in their products.</li>
            <li> what so ever i was disappointed big time.</li>
            <li> I was having really bad dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The itching has definitely decreased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because the conditioner is not good!</li>
            <li> I found  out about natures gate, merely by browsing the Internet.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t agree with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner as an alternative to expensive salon dandruff shampoo with oodles of chemicals and sulfates.  </li>
            <li> I received the wrong item.</li>
            <li> And the greasiness was visibly noticeable too :(  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this is just the worst shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It seems to work well, and I do like the smell even though it&#x27;s pretty strong.  The condition is super thick.  I have to keep the bottle upside down to use it.  I like it though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It hasn&#x27;t helped with dandruff. I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product. I like it and it smells great</li>
            <li> Great product. It has helped my problem remarkably</li>
            <li> I suffered with severe dandruff for quite a while now. I tried many different products, but hated the way they smelled, especially sulfur. I was a bit desperate to find a natural remedy that would actually work without the overbearing smell. I found  out about natures gate, merely by browsing the Internet. I&#x27;m glad that I gave it a try. It removed 100% of my dandruff and I would never go back to my old ways. It&#x27;s almost as if I can feel my scalp breathing. I love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair smelling minty all day long!</li>
            <li> My shampoo and conditioner arrived very quickly and were even delivered on a Sunday thanks to prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shampoo and conditioner, the smell is very different from most other products, but it grew on me very fast. It smells very clean and refreshing. I was mostly looking for an affordable sulfate free shampoo and conditioner combo and I think I found it! I was also happy to learn these products are vegan and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after I started using these products my room mates began to comment on how nice my hair was lately, the only thing that changed in my normal hair routine was my transition to this shampoo and conditioner so I am giving them credit for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that the conditoner is VERY thick and is sometimes hard to get out of the bottle, even with tons of shaking and squeezing. I just mixed in a little water and that seemed to do the trick for now. I would reccomend this brand to anyone that cares about their hair!</li>
            <li> Awesome price, that&#x27;s for sure. But doesn&#x27;t live up to what it says it should do. Didn&#x27;t help my problem at all. Smells great though. But I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great price, smells amazing and does not leave my hair dry!!</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to receive this since I had an itchy scalp from hell. So once it arrived I practically stripped at the doorstep to rush into the shower. . . Well. I should have waited until the next day.  The item arrived on a cold winter day and I am not sure if it was the weather or the product (since it is still like that over a month later) but the conditioner would not come out of the bottle!  It was so thick I had to squeeze with both hands until I was shaking to get it to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it a month later.  I love the scent and I think it has helped a little with the flakes. The itching has definitely decreased. I just wish the conditioner were thinned out. I may add some water or other all natural liquid in there to help but that would be my only complaint. I mean it&#x27;s so thick that I know many adults, older or with arthritis, that would probably not be able to get the product out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I just remembered, when I opened the package one of the bottles had opened slightly. It wasn&#x27;t too bad to clean up and the cap went back on easily.  Thankfully they were tightly plastic wrapped together so there was not a mess in the box or on other items.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for several years, my hair is thick and when washed becomes frizzy. This brand keeps it manageable.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes of ridding my scalp of white, dry, flaking, itching skin. I&#x27;ve been using it a few months now, but the none of my symptoms resolved. I have fine, highlighted hair, and the shampoo does make my hair feel very dry after sudsing up and rinsing. So if you want something to make your hair feel soft and moisturizer after just a shampoo, I don&#x27;t think you will like this. The conditioner, even though it hasn&#x27;t worked, is something I love and will be reordering. When left on a few minutes and rinsed off, the conditioner makes my scalp feels cool and tingly. I love it! That&#x27;s the reason for adding a couple of stars. Love the conditioner!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t agree with my hair.  It seems to have left a residue, that I could feel when I ran my fingers through it.  It wasn&#x27;t a typical heavy/weigh down feeling, just kind of a greasy feeling.  And the greasiness was visibly noticeable too :(  I have never had an issue with greasy hair; except when I was hospitalized and wasn&#x27;t able to wash my hair for four consecutive days!?!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a total bummer because it SMELLS wonderful</li>
            <li> I loove this shampoo. The tea tree makes my scalp feel refreshed and my hair looks soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that my husband has used for years.  He has never had dandruff since using this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is super liquidy, so it just dumps out of the bottle when you go to get some. It smells good, but I found that it dried my hair out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very thick and weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> This smells so minty and good. I liked how it made my hair feel. However, this did absolutely nothing to help my dandruff, and I think it actually made it worse. I stopped using it after using half of each bottle.</li>
            <li> No tea tree tingle what so ever i was disappointed big time. And why can&#x27;t this stuff smell nice like other nature gate products and still work?  The conditioner did nothing to detangle the stripped mess the highly astringent shampoo caused my hair to become.  I can&#x27;t say anything good about this one.</li>
            <li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner seem to work well - plenty of lather and leaves you hair feeling clean.  The major complaint I have is with the Conditioner.  It is so thick, you can hardly get it out of the container!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the smell and product did not work very well.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp feel happy and itch free.  My hair also feels great.  Best shampoo/conditioner combo</li>
            <li> Have not used the shampoo yet, but have used Nature&#x27;s Gate conditioner for a while now, and love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Was having major issues with dry scalp...this has helped tremendously!!</li>
            <li> I no longer have itchy scalp and my hair is super soft...love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t testify to the long-term effects (i.e. build-up, dullness, etc.), but after a couple of uses, I am a HUGE fan. I&#x27;ve had an itchy scalp for over a year, and the first time I used this combination of shampoo and conditioner, my scalp felt wonderful. I just sat for almost an hour and enjoyed the cool tingling on my scalp. The conditioner is very rich and creamy, too. I&#x27;ll buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> good for me not so good for girlfriend.</li>
            <li> conditioner like glue and jpour out</li>
            <li> We use tea tree shampoo because ticks and lice hate the smell and do not come near you! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Have purchased item before. Great. I love it.</li>
            <li> The top lid was broken when it got delivered</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help all that much with dandruff in my experience.. but the tea tree smell is pretty nice and i love that its not tested on animals &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, the way it smells and how good it makes my hair and scalp feel. I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> So great for my scalp. Healthy and good for my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner as an alternative to expensive salon dandruff shampoo with oodles of chemicals and sulfates.  This duo is a winner.  I love the smell (which says a lot since I am allergic to most fragrances).  It just smells like its good stuff and hopefully it is. I shampooed and conditioned with it two times and love the results.  My hair is squeaky clean and my scalp feels great.  Normally if I stop the dandruff shampoo I flake immediately, but no signs of any flaking at all.  I love the fact that it is sulfate free.  There is a list of ingredients with some words that I can&#x27;t pronounce which is usually a bad sign, but it appears that most of the ingredients are plant derived.  Tea Tree oil based shampoo was actually recommended to me by a hair stylist.  I hope this keeps working because it is so much more economical than salon shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the gentle clean I get without the extra ingredients!</li>
            <li> I have dandruff and thought this product would work, but i used it for 4 months and nothing. The smell is ok, not my favorite. I have thick Asian hair and very dry/frizzy. This product did not make my hair any smoother nor shiner. It acually frizzed up my hair more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive what the picture showed or what I read in the description.</li>
            <li> Works well,nice lather, leaves my hair feeling clean. Fragrance acceptable. Well packed and arrivedon time.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong item. I did not receive a shampoo/conditioner combination, but instead 2 different shampoos.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it several times a week to deal with itchy scalp. Works great! Love the natures gate product line.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, it smells good and lathers well.</li>
            <li> Arrived sealed and no leaks. I use this kind if shampoo for my daughter during the school year because it is know to help prevent head lice. She also loves the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner! I have major scalp issues and this is the only one that seems to help</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean feeling. Leaves hair very manageable and smelling nice but not an over powering smell. Also helped my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a shampoo and conditioner that used natural ingredients with as little of the harmful commercial varieties found in mainstream shampoos and conditioners. I was using Pantene for a while, but was never comfortable with the questionable chemicals in their products. I tried several brands, including several expensive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands and came across this set. I&#x27;ve used this duo set for three months now, and I love how natural and effective this product is. The shampoo thoroughly cleans my hair without over drying it. The conditioner adds in the right amount of moisture without weighing down your hair. The result is shiny, bouncy hair that looks and feels healthy. You cannot ask for a better product for the price, no way!</li>
            <li> As much as I need tee tree oil for my scalp, I will not purchase again.  Smells great and my my hair looks great, but the conditioner is so hard, it doesn&#x27;t even squeeze out of the container.  The itchiness of my scalp has not improved either.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well for getting rid of flakes and buildup, but then the conditioner does nothing. My hair feels dry, while also looking greasy. It&#x27;s because the conditioner is not good! It&#x27;s thick but once you put it in your hair it just slides off, it doesn&#x27;t sink in and moisturize.</li>
            <li> Super shampoo and conditioner.  I use this on my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of tea tree shampoo and apparently when it comes to quality price matters. I purchased this because it was a little cheaper with both shampoo and conditioner. I have no cooling / calming effect from this product. In fact my scalp and face broke out with bumps after using it. Especially my scalp ( as more product was on that area). I&#x27;ve ever had that problem before with any shampoo.</li>
            <li> no tingle sensation, doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to control dandruff, and just not a huge fan of the way my hair feels after washing and conditioning.  it wasn&#x27;t really bad, but I will probably look for something different next time.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> hmmm hair is so soft... almost too soft.</li>
            <li> Product is great and smells awesome. Could do better on the packaging. When I received mine, both the shampoo and conditioner had leaked from the top and bottles were smashed a little.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and daughter have issues with oily + flaky scalps and after several uses this really cleared it up a lot (after not having any luck with T Gel and the like). Plus it smells great. We will keep using it! Thank you Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
            <li> Buying this set again since mine&#x27;s running out. I love the smell and since using it my hair loss has stopped and new hair is growing back! One very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this is just the worst shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I used only a small amount and it left my hair so waxy and greasy looking. My hair looked as if it hadn&#x27;t been washed in 2 weeks. I spent a little extra money on this product, hoping for good quality but I won&#x27;t be using it again. Plus it smells like some medical solution, not the refreshing tea tree scent I expected. Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have only been using these for a few weeks, but I like them. It has helped with my dandruff. I think it smells like mint. The reason I only give 4 stars is because the conditioner is really hard to get out of the bottle. I have to squeeze the bottle really hard to get the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> This stuff cleared up my itchy, scabby scalp with one use! The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo after reading that tea tree oil is very helpful for dry scalps.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now, and my situation has not improved.  Other reviewers are correct in saying that the conditioner is so thick it&#x27;s difficult to get it out of the bottle, though I did not feel like it weighed my hair down like some people reported.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I have short hair?  Anyway, this may or may not work for you, but it definitely didn&#x27;t for me.  3 stars because it&#x27;s inexpensive, lasts forever, and feels refreshing on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo/conditioner and how it feels, it&#x27;s lovely! I also love that it is natural and cruelty free though I have oily hair and even with very minimal conditioner my hair stays pretty oily. My husband likes it it&#x27;s good for his short hair and dandruff. I will try a different Nature&#x27;s Gate for my oily hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! It alleviates the itching from the dandruff like build-up on my scalp and I looove the tea tree scent!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I was having scalp issues and they are all gone. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my hair, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues to begin with. It does smell great, and the conditioner tingles which feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit- I just reordered and received a totally different product. It has sea buckthorn or something. The conditioner does not tingle. Different bottles and everything. Shady.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the school season to keep lice away and so far it works perfectly! Also helped clear up my dry scalp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is as described, but I just have found others I like better.</li>
            <li> I was having really bad dry scalp. The skin flakes seemed nearly endless. I&#x27;ve only used this twice and already about 80% of the dry flakes are gone. I&#x27;ve been dealing with this issue for almost a year and have tried several different shampoos and treatments, and this is the only one that has done much of anything. I love it! Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s all a matter of personal preference. I personally kind of like it and don&#x27;t find it too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told I should use sulfate free shampoo for my curly curly hair for years. I finally gave in and started looking. I found this and was drawn to the fact it had tea tree for scalp treatment as I have a very dey scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my flakes and my hair feels extra dry when I towl it out after my shower (havent changed my methods or duration of towl) which makes applying leave in conditioner a drag. But I like the way it smells.</li>
