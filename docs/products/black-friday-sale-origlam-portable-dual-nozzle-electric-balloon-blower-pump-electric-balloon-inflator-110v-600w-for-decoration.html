            <li> the only problem is its hard to blow up balloons when it runs automatic because the air pressure wont allow you to place balloon properly onto valves.</li>
            <li> I recieved my portable dual nozzle air inflator eirlyer than I had expected.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time getting the balloons to inflate...</li>
            <li> Its power to inflate is weak.</li>
            <li> Worse yet it is designed to self destuct.</li>
