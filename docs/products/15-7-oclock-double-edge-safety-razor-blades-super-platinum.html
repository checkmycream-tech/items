            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband because he said Gillete blades where the best.  </li>
            <li>Perfect \\&quot;standard\\&quot; go to DE blade.</li>
            <li>...But not the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!!</li>
            <li>Maybe not the best shave ever, but a good blade for the price.</li>
            <li>Keep up the great work Gillette.</li>
            <li>always, YMMV greatly with razor blades.</li>
            <li>Great blades that perform almost as well as the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Blacks.  </li>
            <li>This is a great blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used Gillette products, not just because of that, but because they are made well and do a great job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s forgiving and still makes a great shave.</li>
            <li>I feel great</li>
            <li>Really great blades.  </li>
            <li>I got 8 great shaves and 4</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t great blades.</li>
            <li>You get a great shave.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great shave.</li>
            <li>These blades work great</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I felt to shave with the blade that I remembered from years ago and thought would never get to use again.</li>
            <li>These provide a great shave.</li>
            <li>These seem like a compromise between Feathers and Astra Superior Platinum.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how good these things felt on my face, and the shave?  </li>
            <li>As i say a good blade...  </li>
            <li>These blades give me a good shave.</li>
            <li>I have fair hair, and I don&#x27;t have a problem shaving with ANY blade or razor.</li>
            <li>I had read good things about all of them.</li>
            <li>We have difficulty finding good safety razor blades in store around here and often end up buying whatever the store has.</li>
            <li>Gillette silver blues are superior to these in my opinion.</li>
            <li>about 7-8 good shaves each.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>blade however, are a good quality blade.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Astra and Feathers</li>
            <li>teyar e a good choice if you are a returning safety razor shaver</li>
            <li>Knowing that Gillette was probably what our founding fathers were using to shave with (OK kiddies, don&#x27;t quote that to your history teachers or anything!)</li>
            <li>So cheap!!</li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband and he was impressed the first time he used them.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>These are made by Gillette India, and that being said (not US made) they are amazing - for me.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the Personna blades.  </li>
            <li>I ended up getting a box of Astra SPs, but I was also kind of liked the 7 O&#x27;clock greens and Goals from Gillette</li>
            <li>Nice shave without irritation or razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Husband liked the results he got from the shave.</li>
            <li>Product is awesome and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re good for some</li>
            <li>The 7 o&#x27;clock blades are, by far the best blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Turns out that they&#x27;re the best blade I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>They do give a good shave, but have a tendency to be easy to nick with - perhaps I&#x27;ll give them a try in a year or so after a bit more experience.  </li>
            <li>These were a huge step up!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have twice as many for a cutthroat razor.</li>
            <li>Singe blade shavers will love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 3 or 4 types, this is my preference and favorite.</li>
            <li>these razors worked way better than the ones that came with my safety</li>
            <li>I will definately be getting more of these blades</li>
            <li>These are my favorite in my Edwin Jagger DE89.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed these blades.  </li>
            <li>Way better than spending a bunch of money on electric blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shave is ok</li>
            <li>You get a lot better shave with this type of blade than the disposable razor blades and is more cost efficient.</li>
            <li>Not a terrible price (~45Â¢ each) if you just want to try them out.  </li>
            <li>The 7 O&#x27; Yellows are a much better purchase.</li>
            <li>Could you spend more money on safety razors?</li>
            <li>I suspect more money can be made on the plastic handle models.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this blade.</li>
            <li>They are my favorite of the 5 or 6 blades I have tried.</li>
            <li>(yeah I know not US made), but the Gillette blades are even better.  </li>
            <li>But again can be very mild, so this is best paired with an aggressive blade such as a slant bar.</li>
            <li>It still did a fine job shaving, but I felt it a bit more.</li>
            <li>Try the other blades, but I&#x27;m sure you will agree that these are the best in quality and price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud, but it cuts very effectively.</li>
            <li>So 15 will last a good while , save money too!</li>
            <li>not the sharpest blades around but good for someone with more sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Three stars for fast shipping and getting a good blade instead of something cheap like Derby.</li>
            <li>Also very sharp get a excellent shave with these</li>
            <li>/&gt;After years of paying increasingly higher prices for more and more blades per unit, I decided to try a simpler approach and return to the use of a safety</li>
            <li>My face was so smooth</li>
            <li>For me a great shave is like a deep tissue massage.  </li>
            <li>and my wife loves the smooth skin.</li>
            <li>To me Astra Green&#x27;s are the best followed closely by Feather&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>That is fantastic.</li>
            <li>These were smooth but cannot compare to the closeness and sharpness of the yellows in my edwin jagger kelvin.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy a clean smooth shave to frame my salt and pepper beard.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shaving with no irritation, no nicks, nothing but clean shaving bliss.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has recently returned to a safety razor after many years of using cartridge$$ razors, I am very satisfied with these blades.</li>
            <li>These are great for beginners as they allow you to press ever so slightly (even though you aren&#x27;t supposed to press at all while DE shaving) so that it gets a better cut faster.</li>
            <li>These blades have great longevity and keep their edge for a long while.</li>
            <li>IE they were removed from the original packaging.  </li>
            <li>The original Gillette (India) blades were cellophane wrapped, so perhaps these were seconds.  </li>
            <li>They are so comfortable and give such a good shave.</li>
            <li>I get a clean shave without any burn.</li>
            <li>Did not get a clean shave</li>
            <li>First time I have tried the Gillette black package blades, and I found them to be of excellent quality.</li>
            <li>, Gillette is much smoother, and more forgiving.</li>
            <li>They do such a good job.</li>
            <li>The Good news that I&#x27;m only out $5.</li>
            <li>It is true that everyone&#x27;s beard is different, but if you don&#x27;t have a thick/wiry beard, then these might be as good a choice for you as they have been for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think for a mild razor with a mild blade is a good combo if you have thicker facial hair like me.</li>
            <li>Super sharp blades like this or Feather do a great job.  </li>
            <li>I started off with the Shark Super Chrome that came with the razor.  </li>
            <li>but, these Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades combined with Gillette Foamy Shave Cream gives me a super close shave without any discomfort.</li>
            <li>I tried several different blades until i found what worked best for me.</li>
            <li>The blades I received were made in India and I am so pleased I will order some more just in case they become unavailable in the future.</li>
            <li>Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock super platinums as is pictured</li>
            <li>Mild razors with a sharp blade is much more effective.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good, sharp, smooth shave this blade</li>
            <li>but the blades are very think and easy to bend with some fading on the surface</li>
            <li>I gave this razor blade a try after using Derby blades and was very surprised at how much better they were.  </li>
            <li>This razor is pretty sharp, it did a great job on my face today.  </li>
            <li>A nice solid product that does exactly what is designed to do!</li>
            <li>The blades are new and clean and last a good bit before needing to be changed out.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s an advertising clich&amp;eacute;, but these blades really do provide a close comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>razor shipped with its own sample blade made by the same company</li>
            <li>Worth trying a variety pack before you commit to one brand though.</li>
            <li>I used a Gillette Safety Razor back in Viet Nam and enjoyed a close comfortable shave under adverse conditions.  </li>
            <li>Gillette Platinum blades have not been available in local stores for many years.</li>
            <li>Other than that good blade.</li>
            <li>These blades are sharp, so good shave prep is recommended.</li>
            <li>I have not found a razor yet that will give me a smooth shave on the first pass, and it may be that I need to use a straight razor for that.</li>
            <li>My husband says it&#x27;s nice to finally get a decent shave again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find the blades so he was happy I found them.</li>
            <li>These are my second favorite DE blades, after Feather brand blades.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to try their higher end blades.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will spend more money and buy betters ones .</li>
            <li>Brother, am I glad I went back.  </li>
            <li>I had looked for them locally, but most stores do not stock them as I could not find them.  </li>
            <li>After the first shave, the blade mellowed out a bit.</li>
            <li>These are my 3rd favorite.</li>
            <li>Got the exact item and shipped on time.  </li>
            <li>can use them, but they aren&#x27;t as good as the &amp;#34;Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock SharpEdge&amp;#34; blades (in the YELLOW box).&lt;br /&gt;Which, BTW, cost only 0.2099Â¢ each, when bought in a lot of 100.&lt;br /&gt;So, the seller is good, even if the Indian blades are less so.</li>
            <li>The package arrived in good order but instead of the blues, they were the black box (5 + 2 bonus!).</li>
            <li>While relatively new to DE shaving, these were by far my favorite blades followed closely by the feather blades.</li>
            <li>The yellows are a whole new level of baby smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>I liked the 7&#x27;oclock Super Stainless (Green Package).  </li>
            <li>I shave every other day, and I&#x27;ve used the same blade for weeks now with great results.</li>
            <li>I know that different faces respond differently to different blades; but, i have found these blades to be the most comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li>I would like to buy more but after more than just a few boxes, the shipping completely outweighs the cost of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just pure, baby&#x27;s butt smoothness.  </li>
            <li>Decent blade!</li>
            <li>However blacks can often difficult to find, but both are very good.</li>
            <li>Out of all the 7 O Clock series blades the super platinum series (in the Blue Wrapper) are the best overall as they are not TOO sharp yet will last for a reasonable number of shaves.  </li>
            <li>razor.they give you a much closer shave</li>
            <li>Really like these razors.</li>
            <li>Also you feel like a real man shaving with these.</li>
            <li>I really like this blade.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>the price for these is very fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You cannot buy straight safety razor blades anymore at stores in the USA, therefore you must go online.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.</li>
            <li>but I get a much closer shave with no side effects.</li>
            <li>not as shown received stainless steel instead of platinum</li>
            <li>Double edged razor blades, sharp, close shave, good price.  </li>
            <li>these are good solid blades...not too sharp, so</li>
            <li>The Feather blades were too aggressive, the derby blades were not aggressive enough - but these blades were just right!</li>
            <li>Frankly, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re as good as the Gillette yellow box blades that cost less.  </li>
            <li>Each shave was as good as the previous one except the last, when it was noticeably scratchy.</li>
            <li>But overall these are good blades just not worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Pretty sharp blades but not as comfortable as I would like.</li>
            <li>I like them better than the Astra SPs, which is to say also better than the couple of dozen other blades I&#x27;ve tried (mostly low - mid cost, but also including Feather).  </li>
            <li>, the paper covering is also funny and doesn&#x27;t look professional packing from gilette company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say again for the mature men that remember this blade, It&#x27;s The Real Thing!</li>
            <li>Not &#x27;bad&#x27; blades, just not the same as the &amp;#34;Russian&amp;#34; blades&#x27; as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I don&#x27;t have much experience with blades.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Oh well, need more of the black box anyway.</li>
            <li>Double Edge Safety Razor Blades SUPER PLATINUM]], or 30 with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B0059VTCSG 50 7 O&#x27;clock Double Edge Safety Razor Blades SUPER PLATINUM]])</li>
            <li>Luckily these only cost $5.82.  </li>
            <li>have tried Shark, Feather, and Derby blades, but after shaving with the Super Platinum 7 O&#x27;clock Double Edge Safety Razor Blades, I stopped looking.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these because the pics showed the RUSSIAN version of the &amp;#34;Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Platinum&amp;#34; blades.&lt;br /&gt;Instead</li>
            <li>These, not so gentle on the first shave (not rough either, but a noticeable difference).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t received the Gillette super platinum in the blue packaging made in Russia as described and displayed UN the pictures.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>overall this blade was a great blade , stays sharp for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I figured it was normal</li>
            <li>This is not a complaint against the seller nor the blade.  </li>
            <li>I got a little anxious at first, but the blades are top shelf!!</li>
            <li>Being new to the DE world, I thought nothing of it.  </li>
            <li>The Feather New Hi-Stainless Platinum Coated and the Personna Platinums.  </li>
            <li>im new to shving with a safety razor..actually learend on one and</li>
            <li>I actually had to look a the razor to be sure there was a blade in there, a slight hyperbole but not by much.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t shave every day, and Monday I my whiskers weren&#x27;t noticeable enough to worry with saving), but I think they&#x27;ll be good for another shave or two, at the least.  </li>
            <li>The green pack blades are extremely smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li>While looking to order some more blades, I ran across a sample pack of six different blades (actually  seven, but one was the same Sharks that came with the razor) that I decided to try just to see the difference between blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the first blade once, so</li>
            <li>No nicks, no pulling, and no excessive ex-foliation - thus no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that I received black-box (Indian made) blades and not blue box</li>
            <li>These blades last and stay sharp longer then most.  </li>
            <li>This blade is very very sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li>i have only used one blade so far and it worked better than any other so far.</li>
            <li>I quickly offered to get a different set off blades for him to try as the Derbys work well for me since I do not have a coarse beard, and he does.</li>
            <li>They are super sharp with no defects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too sharp or mild.</li>
            <li>Amazon should have made clear country of origin.</li>
            <li>(OMG, for you young&#x27;uns)  </li>
            <li>Not a big complaint since I love the Blacks but really wanted to try the Blues to compare.</li>
            <li>Have gone through 2 blades so far and will keep it in the rotation.</li>
            <li>And i have tried both Proraso and Musgo real shave creme with these blades tho the results seem about the same!.....  </li>
            <li>I gave up multi blades for the old style, and saving a lot of cash.</li>
            <li>When they came and I lathered up, put the blade in my forty five year old razor</li>
            <li>Sensitive neck issues disappeared for me using this blade.  </li>
            <li>my only complaint is these came in paper that said not for resale and the packaging was kind of primitive.</li>
            <li>None of the ones available looked the same as the sample pack I had, nor did they even look like each other.  </li>
            <li>I also really liked the Gillette green pack blades, but having settled on Derby blades for such a long time, I decided to continue looking.</li>
            <li>and I think they might be the exact same blade but in different packaging...</li>
            <li>(i need to give three or four passes before hair gets removed), and they only last one shave as they won&#x27;t shave anything after first use.</li>
            <li>What I did received was the Gillette super platinum in the black packaging made in India.</li>
            <li>The black blades are fine, but they do have different characteristics.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, the Astras seem to be a little more of a comfortable shave and have at least the same level of sharpness.</li>
            <li>These were a bit rough, and I ended up nicking myself quite a bit at first.  </li>
            <li>No other blade company made anything to compare and I thought I would never get to use them again.</li>
            <li>Any blades&#x27; performance can vary based on many things individual to you and your setup; try them out on a small scale believing good or bad hype/reviews on any blade and buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>, it was like going back in time and stroking my 12 year old cheek.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a ton of different blades going through all the sampler packs that I can find, but every time I try a new blade I go back to the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock.</li>
            <li>And as low as 30 cents/blade, I can live with only two shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving with a safety razor for the first time since I was a teenager took a little getting used to, but after about three shaves, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>These were sharp enough to shave without pulling, not too sharp that I&#x27;d nick myself too easily, and durable enough to last three or four shaves before changing out.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the vast price difference between the red ten pack and the blue five pack, both with the same name, I didn&#x27;t know if they were all the same or not, and really wanted the same blade that came in the sample pack.  </li>
            <li>7 O&#x27;Clock blades apparently are made in different countries.</li>
            <li>I really like the blacks from previous experience</li>

            <li> no nicks ,perfect.</li>
            <li> This blade works best for me.  </li>
            <li> Excellent value!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband because he said Gillete blades where the best.  </li>
            <li> Perfect \\&quot;standard\\&quot; go to DE blade.</li>
            <li> ...But not the best.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> Maybe not the best shave ever, but a good blade for the price.</li>
            <li> Keep up the great work Gillette.</li>
            <li> always, YMMV greatly with razor blades.</li>
            <li> Great blades that perform almost as well as the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Blacks.  </li>
            <li> This is a great blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Gillette products, not just because of that, but because they are made well and do a great job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s forgiving and still makes a great shave.</li>
            <li> I feel great</li>
            <li> Really great blades.  </li>
            <li> I got 8 great shaves and 4</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t great blades.</li>
            <li> You get a great shave.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great shave.</li>
            <li> These blades work great</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I felt to shave with the blade that I remembered from years ago and thought would never get to use again.</li>
            <li> These provide a great shave.</li>
            <li> These seem like a compromise between Feathers and Astra Superior Platinum.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how good these things felt on my face, and the shave?  </li>
            <li> As i say a good blade...  </li>
            <li> These blades give me a good shave.</li>
            <li> I have fair hair, and I don&#x27;t have a problem shaving with ANY blade or razor.</li>
            <li> I had read good things about all of them.</li>
            <li> We have difficulty finding good safety razor blades in store around here and often end up buying whatever the store has.</li>
            <li> Gillette silver blues are superior to these in my opinion.</li>
            <li> about 7-8 good shaves each.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> blade however, are a good quality blade.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Astra and Feathers</li>
            <li> teyar e a good choice if you are a returning safety razor shaver</li>
            <li> Knowing that Gillette was probably what our founding fathers were using to shave with (OK kiddies, don&#x27;t quote that to your history teachers or anything!)</li>
            <li> So cheap!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and he was impressed the first time he used them.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> These are made by Gillette India, and that being said (not US made) they are amazing - for me.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the Personna blades.  </li>
            <li> I ended up getting a box of Astra SPs, but I was also kind of liked the 7 O&#x27;clock greens and Goals from Gillette</li>
            <li> Nice shave without irritation or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Husband liked the results he got from the shave.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re good for some</li>
            <li> The 7 o&#x27;clock blades are, by far the best blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Turns out that they&#x27;re the best blade I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> They do give a good shave, but have a tendency to be easy to nick with - perhaps I&#x27;ll give them a try in a year or so after a bit more experience.  </li>
            <li> These were a huge step up!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have twice as many for a cutthroat razor.</li>
            <li> Singe blade shavers will love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 or 4 types, this is my preference and favorite.</li>
            <li> these razors worked way better than the ones that came with my safety</li>
            <li> I will definately be getting more of these blades</li>
            <li> These are my favorite in my Edwin Jagger DE89.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these blades.  </li>
            <li> Way better than spending a bunch of money on electric blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave is ok</li>
            <li> You get a lot better shave with this type of blade than the disposable razor blades and is more cost efficient.</li>
            <li> Not a terrible price (~45Â¢ each) if you just want to try them out.  </li>
            <li> The 7 O&#x27; Yellows are a much better purchase.</li>
            <li> Could you spend more money on safety razors?</li>
            <li> I suspect more money can be made on the plastic handle models.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this blade.</li>
            <li> They are my favorite of the 5 or 6 blades I have tried.</li>
            <li> (yeah I know not US made), but the Gillette blades are even better.  </li>
            <li> But again can be very mild, so this is best paired with an aggressive blade such as a slant bar.</li>
            <li> It still did a fine job shaving, but I felt it a bit more.</li>
            <li> Try the other blades, but I&#x27;m sure you will agree that these are the best in quality and price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, but it cuts very effectively.</li>
            <li> So 15 will last a good while , save money too!</li>
            <li> not the sharpest blades around but good for someone with more sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Three stars for fast shipping and getting a good blade instead of something cheap like Derby.</li>
            <li> Also very sharp get a excellent shave with these</li>
            <li> /&gt;After years of paying increasingly higher prices for more and more blades per unit, I decided to try a simpler approach and return to the use of a safety</li>
            <li> My face was so smooth</li>
            <li> For me a great shave is like a deep tissue massage.  </li>
            <li> and my wife loves the smooth skin.</li>
            <li> To me Astra Green&#x27;s are the best followed closely by Feather&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> That is fantastic.</li>
            <li> These were smooth but cannot compare to the closeness and sharpness of the yellows in my edwin jagger kelvin.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy a clean smooth shave to frame my salt and pepper beard.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shaving with no irritation, no nicks, nothing but clean shaving bliss.  </li>
            <li> As someone who has recently returned to a safety razor after many years of using cartridge$$ razors, I am very satisfied with these blades.</li>
            <li> These are great for beginners as they allow you to press ever so slightly (even though you aren&#x27;t supposed to press at all while DE shaving) so that it gets a better cut faster.</li>
            <li> These blades have great longevity and keep their edge for a long while.</li>
            <li> IE they were removed from the original packaging.  </li>
            <li> The original Gillette (India) blades were cellophane wrapped, so perhaps these were seconds.  </li>
            <li> They are so comfortable and give such a good shave.</li>
            <li> I get a clean shave without any burn.</li>
            <li> Did not get a clean shave</li>
            <li> First time I have tried the Gillette black package blades, and I found them to be of excellent quality.</li>
            <li> , Gillette is much smoother, and more forgiving.</li>
            <li> They do such a good job.</li>
            <li> The Good news that I&#x27;m only out $5.</li>
            <li> It is true that everyone&#x27;s beard is different, but if you don&#x27;t have a thick/wiry beard, then these might be as good a choice for you as they have been for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think for a mild razor with a mild blade is a good combo if you have thicker facial hair like me.</li>
            <li> Super sharp blades like this or Feather do a great job.  </li>
            <li> I started off with the Shark Super Chrome that came with the razor.  </li>
            <li> but, these Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades combined with Gillette Foamy Shave Cream gives me a super close shave without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> I tried several different blades until i found what worked best for me.</li>
            <li> The blades I received were made in India and I am so pleased I will order some more just in case they become unavailable in the future.</li>
            <li> Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock super platinums as is pictured</li>
            <li> Mild razors with a sharp blade is much more effective.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good, sharp, smooth shave this blade</li>
            <li> but the blades are very think and easy to bend with some fading on the surface</li>
            <li> I gave this razor blade a try after using Derby blades and was very surprised at how much better they were.  </li>
            <li> This razor is pretty sharp, it did a great job on my face today.  </li>
            <li> A nice solid product that does exactly what is designed to do!</li>
            <li> The blades are new and clean and last a good bit before needing to be changed out.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s an advertising clich&amp;eacute;, but these blades really do provide a close comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> razor shipped with its own sample blade made by the same company</li>
            <li> Worth trying a variety pack before you commit to one brand though.</li>
            <li> I used a Gillette Safety Razor back in Viet Nam and enjoyed a close comfortable shave under adverse conditions.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Platinum blades have not been available in local stores for many years.</li>
            <li> Other than that good blade.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp, so good shave prep is recommended.</li>
            <li> I have not found a razor yet that will give me a smooth shave on the first pass, and it may be that I need to use a straight razor for that.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s nice to finally get a decent shave again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the blades so he was happy I found them.</li>
            <li> These are my second favorite DE blades, after Feather brand blades.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to try their higher end blades.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will spend more money and buy betters ones .</li>
            <li> Brother, am I glad I went back.  </li>
            <li> I had looked for them locally, but most stores do not stock them as I could not find them.  </li>
            <li> After the first shave, the blade mellowed out a bit.</li>
            <li> These are my 3rd favorite.</li>
            <li> Got the exact item and shipped on time.  </li>
            <li> can use them, but they aren&#x27;t as good as the &amp;#34;Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock SharpEdge&amp;#34; blades (in the YELLOW box).&lt;br /&gt;Which, BTW, cost only 0.2099Â¢ each, when bought in a lot of 100.&lt;br /&gt;So, the seller is good, even if the Indian blades are less so.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in good order but instead of the blues, they were the black box (5 + 2 bonus!).</li>
            <li> While relatively new to DE shaving, these were by far my favorite blades followed closely by the feather blades.</li>
            <li> The yellows are a whole new level of baby smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> I liked the 7&#x27;oclock Super Stainless (Green Package).  </li>
            <li> I shave every other day, and I&#x27;ve used the same blade for weeks now with great results.</li>
            <li> I know that different faces respond differently to different blades; but, i have found these blades to be the most comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li> I would like to buy more but after more than just a few boxes, the shipping completely outweighs the cost of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just pure, baby&#x27;s butt smoothness.  </li>
            <li> Decent blade!</li>
            <li> However blacks can often difficult to find, but both are very good.</li>
            <li> Out of all the 7 O Clock series blades the super platinum series (in the Blue Wrapper) are the best overall as they are not TOO sharp yet will last for a reasonable number of shaves.  </li>
            <li> razor.they give you a much closer shave</li>
            <li> Really like these razors.</li>
            <li> Also you feel like a real man shaving with these.</li>
            <li> I really like this blade.</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> the price for these is very fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You cannot buy straight safety razor blades anymore at stores in the USA, therefore you must go online.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.</li>
            <li> but I get a much closer shave with no side effects.</li>
            <li> not as shown received stainless steel instead of platinum</li>
            <li> Double edged razor blades, sharp, close shave, good price.  </li>
            <li> these are good solid blades...not too sharp, so</li>
            <li> The Feather blades were too aggressive, the derby blades were not aggressive enough - but these blades were just right!</li>
            <li> Frankly, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re as good as the Gillette yellow box blades that cost less.  </li>
            <li> Each shave was as good as the previous one except the last, when it was noticeably scratchy.</li>
            <li> But overall these are good blades just not worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Pretty sharp blades but not as comfortable as I would like.</li>
            <li> I like them better than the Astra SPs, which is to say also better than the couple of dozen other blades I&#x27;ve tried (mostly low - mid cost, but also including Feather).  </li>
            <li> , the paper covering is also funny and doesn&#x27;t look professional packing from gilette company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say again for the mature men that remember this blade, It&#x27;s The Real Thing!</li>
            <li> Not &#x27;bad&#x27; blades, just not the same as the &amp;#34;Russian&amp;#34; blades&#x27; as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I don&#x27;t have much experience with blades.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Oh well, need more of the black box anyway.</li>
            <li> Double Edge Safety Razor Blades SUPER PLATINUM]], or 30 with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B0059VTCSG 50 7 O&#x27;clock Double Edge Safety Razor Blades SUPER PLATINUM]])</li>
            <li> Luckily these only cost $5.82.  </li>
            <li> have tried Shark, Feather, and Derby blades, but after shaving with the Super Platinum 7 O&#x27;clock Double Edge Safety Razor Blades, I stopped looking.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these because the pics showed the RUSSIAN version of the &amp;#34;Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Platinum&amp;#34; blades.&lt;br /&gt;Instead</li>
            <li> These, not so gentle on the first shave (not rough either, but a noticeable difference).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t received the Gillette super platinum in the blue packaging made in Russia as described and displayed UN the pictures.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> overall this blade was a great blade , stays sharp for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I figured it was normal</li>
            <li> This is not a complaint against the seller nor the blade.  </li>
            <li> I got a little anxious at first, but the blades are top shelf!!</li>
            <li> Being new to the DE world, I thought nothing of it.  </li>
            <li> The Feather New Hi-Stainless Platinum Coated and the Personna Platinums.  </li>
            <li> im new to shving with a safety razor..actually learend on one and</li>
            <li> I actually had to look a the razor to be sure there was a blade in there, a slight hyperbole but not by much.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t shave every day, and Monday I my whiskers weren&#x27;t noticeable enough to worry with saving), but I think they&#x27;ll be good for another shave or two, at the least.  </li>
            <li> The green pack blades are extremely smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> While looking to order some more blades, I ran across a sample pack of six different blades (actually  seven, but one was the same Sharks that came with the razor) that I decided to try just to see the difference between blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the first blade once, so</li>
            <li> No nicks, no pulling, and no excessive ex-foliation - thus no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that I received black-box (Indian made) blades and not blue box</li>
            <li> These blades last and stay sharp longer then most.  </li>
            <li> This blade is very very sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li> i have only used one blade so far and it worked better than any other so far.</li>
            <li> I quickly offered to get a different set off blades for him to try as the Derbys work well for me since I do not have a coarse beard, and he does.</li>
            <li> They are super sharp with no defects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too sharp or mild.</li>
            <li> Amazon should have made clear country of origin.</li>
            <li> (OMG, for you young&#x27;uns)  </li>
            <li> Not a big complaint since I love the Blacks but really wanted to try the Blues to compare.</li>
            <li> Have gone through 2 blades so far and will keep it in the rotation.</li>
            <li> And i have tried both Proraso and Musgo real shave creme with these blades tho the results seem about the same!.....  </li>
            <li> I gave up multi blades for the old style, and saving a lot of cash.</li>
            <li> When they came and I lathered up, put the blade in my forty five year old razor</li>
            <li> Sensitive neck issues disappeared for me using this blade.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is these came in paper that said not for resale and the packaging was kind of primitive.</li>
            <li> None of the ones available looked the same as the sample pack I had, nor did they even look like each other.  </li>
            <li> I also really liked the Gillette green pack blades, but having settled on Derby blades for such a long time, I decided to continue looking.</li>
            <li> and I think they might be the exact same blade but in different packaging...</li>
            <li> (i need to give three or four passes before hair gets removed), and they only last one shave as they won&#x27;t shave anything after first use.</li>
            <li> What I did received was the Gillette super platinum in the black packaging made in India.</li>
            <li> The black blades are fine, but they do have different characteristics.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, the Astras seem to be a little more of a comfortable shave and have at least the same level of sharpness.</li>
            <li> These were a bit rough, and I ended up nicking myself quite a bit at first.  </li>
            <li> No other blade company made anything to compare and I thought I would never get to use them again.</li>
            <li> Any blades&#x27; performance can vary based on many things individual to you and your setup; try them out on a small scale believing good or bad hype/reviews on any blade and buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> , it was like going back in time and stroking my 12 year old cheek.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of different blades going through all the sampler packs that I can find, but every time I try a new blade I go back to the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock.</li>
            <li> And as low as 30 cents/blade, I can live with only two shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving with a safety razor for the first time since I was a teenager took a little getting used to, but after about three shaves, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> These were sharp enough to shave without pulling, not too sharp that I&#x27;d nick myself too easily, and durable enough to last three or four shaves before changing out.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the vast price difference between the red ten pack and the blue five pack, both with the same name, I didn&#x27;t know if they were all the same or not, and really wanted the same blade that came in the sample pack.  </li>
            <li> 7 O&#x27;Clock blades apparently are made in different countries.</li>
            <li> I really like the blacks from previous experience</li>
            <li> The blades are not sharp, drag on my only one day growth beard, and require multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really expain it these blades left my neck feeling a little rough</li>
            <li> I have been needing these coming from the merkur blades these last just as long</li>
            <li> As sharp as Feathers but much smoother and with less irritation but as always YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave does not live up to the hype I have heard on overall quality.</li>
            <li> - sooo I shave my whole head and heavy beard about every other day.</li>
            <li> I will be trying other brands in the future but for now these are the standard to beat.</li>
            <li> The only problem is they are wrapped individually, but I guess this keeps them protected and sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the stereotypical sound.</li>
            <li> They have close to the long life of a Feather, with the user-friendliness of an Astra.</li>
            <li> This safety razor is a quality product, giving a smoother shave than the blades that came with the long handled razor that I bought.  </li>
            <li> I had been a long time user of Derby blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades looked fake ones because they not strong (very easy to bend) and build quality and packing</li>
            <li> The only reason for a 4 star instead of 5 was the long wait for shipping due to being overseas.</li>
            <li> I have not used any of the blades as yet, but I rated it the same as the other razor blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided to branch out and try other blades.</li>
            <li> while at the same time, they shave closer than any of the other blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> These will give you a great shave and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> is limited).  </li>
            <li> NEVER THOUGHT A SINGLE BLADE COULD DO THE TRICK.</li>
            <li> , what could I loose?  </li>
            <li> I received these blades sold loose tied with rubber bands.</li>
            <li> Received them in loose packaging which the package said not to sell loose</li>
            <li> this is only slightly less</li>
            <li> , you will receive the black box blades which are different.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say both he and I would recommend the blades to anyone looking for a sharper blade to get through a coarse fast growing beard.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are my second favorite DE blades, after Feather brand blades.  These seem like a compromise between Feathers and Astra Superior Platinum.  They have close to the long life of a Feather, with the user-friendliness of an Astra.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of different blades going through all the sampler packs that I can find, but every time I try a new blade I go back to the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a brush and soap for quite a while now, and just recently (three or four months or so) started using double-edge safety razors.  I started off with the Shark Super Chrome that came with the razor.  These were a bit rough, and I ended up nicking myself quite a bit at first.  Being new to the DE world, I thought nothing of it.  I figured it was normal and I&#x27;d get less nicks with practice.  While looking to order some more blades, I ran across a sample pack of six different blades (actually  seven, but one was the same Sharks that came with the razor) that I decided to try just to see the difference between blades.  Out of these, two stood out.  The Feather New Hi-Stainless Platinum Coated and the Personna Platinums.  The Feather blades are sharp.  A bit too sharp for my tastes.  They do give a good shave, but have a tendency to be easy to nick with - perhaps I&#x27;ll give them a try in a year or so after a bit more experience.  I really liked the Personna blades.  These were sharp enough to shave without pulling, not too sharp that I&#x27;d nick myself too easily, and durable enough to last three or four shaves before changing out.  As the 5 pack of Personnas started getting low, I came on Amazon to order a few packs (small town here, selection of anything, let alone DE blades, is limited).  Looking around, I got confused by the packaging of the Personna blades.  None of the ones available looked the same as the sample pack I had, nor did they even look like each other.  Not to mention the vast price difference between the red ten pack and the blue five pack, both with the same name, I didn&#x27;t know if they were all the same or not, and really wanted the same blade that came in the sample pack.  Looking around trying to find a pack that looked like the one I had, I found the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock blades.  Knowing that Gillette was probably what our founding fathers were using to shave with (OK kiddies, don&#x27;t quote that to your history teachers or anything!), i figured I\\&quot;d give them a try.  After all, at 53 cents a blade (38, if you buy the [[ASIN:B0059VTS58 25 7 O&#x27;clock Double Edge Safety Razor Blades SUPER PLATINUM]], or 30 with the [[ASIN:B0059VTCSG 50 7 O&#x27;clock Double Edge Safety Razor Blades SUPER PLATINUM]]), what could I loose?  They arrived Thursday and I gave them a shot Saturday.  Holy cow!  What a shave!  These things glided across my face like there was nothing there.I was getting no whisker pull, no skin scraping and no nicks.  Did I forget to put in a blade?  I couldn&#x27;t believe how good these things felt on my face, and the shave?  My face was so smooth, it was like going back in time and stroking my 12 year old cheek.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I&#x27;ve only used the first blade once, so I can&#x27;t comment no the durability (I don&#x27;t shave every day, and Monday I my whiskers weren&#x27;t noticeable enough to worry with saving), but I think they&#x27;ll be good for another shave or two, at the least.  And as low as 30 cents/blade, I can live with only two shaves per blade.  TL:DR - Oh My God! (OMG, for you young&#x27;uns)  These things give me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  No nicks, no pulling, and no excessive ex-foliation - thus no irritation.  Just pure, baby&#x27;s butt smoothness.  I think I&#x27;ve found MY blade.</li>
            <li> Started with Gillette \\&quot;Blue Blades\\&quot;.  I morphed to Gillette MACH 3. Just felt like going back to basics. Shave is just as close and much less expensive. I&#x27;m going on a month with my 1st blade.  I&#x27;m bald - sooo I shave my whole head and heavy beard about every other day. Keep up the great work Gillette.</li>
            <li> I understand these blades were shipped from India, but it was almost 2 months from order date to arrival in my mailbox.  Unacceptable no matter where it is being shipped from. The blades are not sharp, drag on my only one day growth beard, and require multiple passes. I will be sticking with my Personna blades or Feather blades. Luckily these only cost $5.82.  I&#x27;ll eat the cost and avoid the hassle of trying to return them.  These blades may work as paint scrapers but def not for shaving your face with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> As someone who has recently returned to a safety razor after many years of using cartridge$$ razors, I am very satisfied with these blades. They are super sharp with no defects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they best? That I don&#x27;t know - I will be trying other brands in the future but for now these are the standard to beat.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s an advertising clich&amp;eacute;, but these blades really do provide a close comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of paying increasingly higher prices for more and more blades per unit, I decided to try a simpler approach and return to the use of a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Shark, Feather, and Derby blades, but after shaving with the Super Platinum 7 O&#x27;clock Double Edge Safety Razor Blades, I stopped looking.  I can shave close with a minimum of nicks, and I get a closer, cleaner shave than the current four or five blade monstrosities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a safety razor for the first time since I was a teenager took a little getting used to, but after about three shaves, I was hooked.  Try the other blades, but I&#x27;m sure you will agree that these are the best in quality and price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna eat &#x27;em like a sideshow freak, you&#x27;re cheating if you don&#x27;t remove them from the wax packet first.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re gonna shave with &#x27;em, prepare to lose some hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;br /&gt;Break &#x27;em in half and you&#x27;ll have twice as many for a cutthroat razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is pretty sharp, it did a great job on my face today.  It will definitely be a razor I order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 5 o&#x27;clock blades but these work great too! Singe blade shavers will love this product. So cheap!!</li>
            <li> I ordered some of these to go along with double edge safety razor I purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The razor shipped with its own sample blade made by the same company but I prefer these.&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem to stay sharper longer with proper care.</li>
            <li> These are very similar to Astra blades and I think they might be the exact same blade but in different packaging... I could be wrong about that though. They provide a close shave and seem pretty sharp but not \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; sharp. For whatever reason, the Astras seem to be a little more of a comfortable shave and have at least the same level of sharpness. I can&#x27;t really expain it these blades left my neck feeling a little rough and I don&#x27;t have that with Astras. In any case, blades are a personal preference so all I can do is provide my experience with them.</li>
            <li> I recently tried a razor blade variety pack.  I ended up getting a box of Astra SPs, but I was also kind of liked the 7 O&#x27;clock greens and Goals from Gillette so I decided to try their higher end blades.  I am very happy with them.  They cause very little irritation and cut close to the face.  I like them better than the Astra SPs, which is to say also better than the couple of dozen other blades I&#x27;ve tried (mostly low - mid cost, but also including Feather).  They seem to last longer than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, YMMV greatly with razor blades.</li>
            <li> Ordered 15 and received 6 extra through the bonus pack. Can&#x27;t guarantee that this is standard for all orders but I fully appreciate it. The blades are new and clean and last a good bit before needing to be changed out. Worth trying a variety pack before you commit to one brand though.</li>
            <li> Great blades that perform almost as well as the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Blacks.  These will give you a great shave and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The blades advertised were Gillette Blue blades but the blades I actually got were Gillette Blacks.  Not a big complaint since I love the Blacks but really wanted to try the Blues to compare.</li>
            <li> This is a great blade. My only complaint is that on some blades, the glue extends on to the razor edge.</li>
            <li> It is not as sharp as it was in the past.  Since Gillette moved its manufacturing to overseas plants, it does not have the sharpness that I remember from years ago.</li>
            <li> Next time I will spend more money and buy betters ones .</li>
            <li> overall this blade was a great blade , stays sharp for a very long time. Have gone through 2 blades so far and will keep it in the rotation.</li>
            <li> Yes I agree with the earlier reviewer.  Out of all the 7 O Clock series blades the super platinum series (in the Blue Wrapper) are the best overall as they are not TOO sharp yet will last for a reasonable number of shaves.  P.S. And i have tried both Proraso and Musgo real shave creme with these blades tho the results seem about the same!.....  As i say a good blade...  Indiana ED</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations very uncomfortable to shave with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I don&#x27;t have much experience with blades.&lt;br /&gt;But, I have to say, in comparison to a Mercur blade that came with my razor, Gillette is much smoother, and more forgiving. I shave every other day, and I&#x27;ve used the same blade for weeks now with great results. I like them.</li>
            <li> So...one of my ancestors invented the safety razor.  I&#x27;ve always used Gillette products, not just because of that, but because they are made well and do a great job.  This safety razor is a quality product, giving a smoother shave than the blades that came with the long handled razor that I bought.  And I don&#x27;t have to worry about ingrown hairs that become infected when using this razors.  I&#x27;m getting the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years with no worries of razor burn or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 or 4 types, this is my preference and favorite. It&#x27;s forgiving and still makes a great shave.</li>
            <li> Double edged razor blades, sharp, close shave, good price.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I hate to admit that I am getting older.  My skin and beard are changing.  I wear a very thick Van Dyke.  I enjoy a clean smooth shave to frame my salt and pepper beard.  The multiple blade razors just weren&#x27;t working anymore because my skin is getting looser and my beard thicker.  I used a Gillette Safety Razor back in Viet Nam and enjoyed a close comfortable shave under adverse conditions.  Somewhere I forgot I guess caught up in the times.  So I invested in a precision shaving tool and the finest blades which are in my experience are Gillette.  Brother, am I glad I went back.  For me a great shave is like a deep tissue massage.  I feel great and my wife loves the smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re as good as the Gillette yellow box blades that cost less.  At least with my beard they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut the mustard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> these razors worked way better than the ones that came with my safety razor.they give you a much closer shave than I expected!also you get a bonus too!! instead of 5 razors a pack you get 7!!!!</li>
            <li> Really great blades.  My facial hair isn&#x27;t dense, but the follicles are quite thick.  Super sharp blades like this or Feather do a great job.  I think I prefer Feather though.</li>
            <li> These blades drag and pull. Go with the gillete blue if you must buy gillete.</li>
            <li> I have not used any of the blades as yet, but I rated it the same as the other razor blades.</li>
            <li> These blades give me a good shave. They&#x27;ll last about 1-2 weeks. I gave up multi blades for the old style, and saving a lot of cash.</li>
            <li> Same night they got  here,I used 1 no nicks ,perfect. I like them!! So 15 will last a good while , save money too!</li>
            <li> Really like these razors. Have tried derbys (bad) and a few others but these are very sharp and hold their edge 4-6 shaves. Going to stick with these for a while.</li>
            <li> I read reviews, and I wanted to give them a try. I have fair hair, and I don&#x27;t have a problem shaving with ANY blade or razor. These blades do not shave well (i need to give three or four passes before hair gets removed), and they only last one shave as they won&#x27;t shave anything after first use. What a waste of time, and landfill space. I am not sure if the quality is bad because where they are made, or they are just crappy blades. I used to have so much respect or Gillette, but this is total disappointment (unless these blades are knockoffs).</li>
            <li> i have only used one blade so far and it worked better than any other so far. I got 8 great shaves and 4 so so shaves before I quit using it. . I guess blades are an individual thing because razors and beards react differently with soaps and blades.I will definately be getting more of these blades</li>
            <li> Have been wet shaving/DE shaving for a couple of years.  This blade works best for me.  Nice shave without irritation or razor burn.  Try this blade.</li>
            <li> They were as expected.  I had looked for them locally, but most stores do not stock them as I could not find them.  I use them for a hair cutter tool I have.</li>
            <li> So for Christmas I recently bought my father-in-law an Edwin Jagger DE razor and picked up some Derby Blades for him. After just one shave he was discouraged as the blades were dull and were giving him a lot of pulling and tugging. It almost ruined his safety razor experience. I quickly offered to get a different set off blades for him to try as the Derbys work well for me since I do not have a coarse beard, and he does. The Black 7 O&#x27;clocks made a world of a difference. He said he is learning to let the blade do the work as they are extremely sharp and not as forgiving as the Derbys. However, he no longer has to change the blade every day. Needless to say both he and I would recommend the blades to anyone looking for a sharper blade to get through a coarse fast growing beard.</li>
            <li> While relatively new to DE shaving, these were by far my favorite blades followed closely by the feather blades. The reason that I like these blades over the feather is that I have very coarse beard hair and the feather blades will sometimes catch and knick me. These are great for beginners as they allow you to press ever so slightly (even though you aren&#x27;t supposed to press at all while DE shaving) so that it gets a better cut faster. I have not found a razor yet that will give me a smooth shave on the first pass, and it may be that I need to use a straight razor for that. That being said, these blades get me there faster than anything else.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite in my Edwin Jagger DE89.  Be aware that I received black-box (Indian made) blades and not blue box (Russian made) as shown in the picture.  However blacks can often difficult to find, but both are very good.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because the pics showed the RUSSIAN version of the &amp;#34;Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Platinum&amp;#34; blades.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I received the *INDIAN* version.&lt;br /&gt;NOT THE SAME!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the comment I posted:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;*NOT* the item &#x27;advertised&#x27; in the photos! Not &#x27;bad&#x27; blades, just not the same as the &amp;#34;Russian&amp;#34; blades&#x27; as advertised. *IF* you want the &amp;#34;Russian&amp;#34; blades, do not buy these, they are Indian. The seller did refund the purchase price, after I filed a complaint, because these are *NOT* the blades in the photos.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t really *bad* blades, just not really *good* blades, either.&lt;br /&gt;I can use them, but they aren&#x27;t as good as the &amp;#34;Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock SharpEdge&amp;#34; blades (in the YELLOW box).&lt;br /&gt;Which, BTW, cost only 0.2099Â¢ each, when bought in a lot of 100.&lt;br /&gt;So, the seller is good, even if the Indian blades are less so.</li>
            <li> I had been a long time user of Derby blades. I&#x27;ve recently decided to branch out and try other blades. I had noticed I was getting a lot of neck irritation with Derby blades. I ordered a sampler that included the Gillette green pack, Feather and Astra blades. I had read good things about all of them. Of course the Feather&#x27;s were the sharpest, but the blades only lasted two shaves. I also really liked the Gillette green pack blades, but having settled on Derby blades for such a long time, I decided to continue looking. I&#x27;m happy I did. These were comparable to the green pack, but have held up much nicer. The green pack blades are extremely smooth and gentle. These, not so gentle on the first shave (not rough either, but a noticeable difference). After the first shave, the blade mellowed out a bit. I&#x27;ve had had 4 three-pass shaves with these blades. Each shave was as good as the previous one except the last, when it was noticeably scratchy. It still did a fine job shaving, but I felt it a bit more. Either way, I&#x27;ve reduced my neck irritation to almost zero. So, for me, 3 three-pass shaves is what i can expect. I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these blades.  They are not as sharp as Feather blades but that isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.  These blades have great longevity and keep their edge for a long while.</li>
            <li> I started using a DE razor several months ago, and have used a couple of different brands of blades.  I&#x27;ve tried derby blades, and Feather blades in addition these 7 o&#x27;clocks.  The 7 o&#x27;clock blades are, by far the best blades I&#x27;ve used. I know that different faces respond differently to different blades; but, i have found these blades to be the most comfortable for me.  They don&#x27;t shave so aggressively that my face gets shaved raw - while at the same time, they shave closer than any of the other blades I&#x27;ve used. The Feather blades were too aggressive, the derby blades were not aggressive enough - but these blades were just right! Excellent value!</li>
            <li> These are my 3rd favorite. To me Astra Green&#x27;s are the best followed closely by Feather&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t great blades. I didn&#x27;t get a close shave. I like Feathers. Some find those too sharp, and maybe they&#x27;d benefit from something like 7 o&#x27;clock. We all respond differently. Still, these aren&#x27;t super-sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Way better than spending a bunch of money on electric blades. Also you feel like a real man shaving with these.</li>
            <li> I received these blades sold loose tied with rubber bands. (didnt come in any box or case )&lt;br /&gt;The blades looked fake ones because they not strong (very easy to bend) and build quality and packing didnt look authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is ok but the blades are very think and easy to bend with some fading on the surface, the paper covering is also funny and doesn&#x27;t look professional packing from gilette company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect these are some cheaper counterfeits.</li>
            <li> First time I have tried the Gillette black package blades, and I found them to be of excellent quality. I would recommend them to anybody.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with double edge blades for a number of years and have tried a varity of brands but, these Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades combined with Gillette Foamy Shave Cream gives me a super close shave without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> Great product! I had to wait a little while for it to ship from India, but I did not know up front that&#x27;s where the blades are made. I got a little anxious at first, but the blades are top shelf!!</li>
            <li> You get a lot better shave with this type of blade than the disposable razor blades and is more cost efficient.</li>
            <li> I usually get 2-3 shaves out of the walmart sword blades these I got 8 shaves out of with only 2 knicks. my only complaint is these came in paper that said not for resale and the packaging was kind of primitive. Other than that good blade.</li>
            <li> These were fulfilled by amazon, and thankfully so.  I had to return them.  I was hoping that they&#x27;d be the Russian-made blades, nope.  I think the product page has finally been updated to reflect that.</li>
            <li> Got the exact item and shipped on time.  Not a terrible price (~45Â¢ each) if you just want to try them out.  Any blades&#x27; performance can vary based on many things individual to you and your setup; try them out on a small scale believing good or bad hype/reviews on any blade and buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> Blades arrived individually wrapped instead of in a pack. The shave does not live up to the hype I have heard on overall quality. The 7 O&#x27; Yellows are a much better purchase. Buyer beware from this seller...</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and he was impressed the first time he used them. We have difficulty finding good safety razor blades in store around here and often end up buying whatever the store has. These were a huge step up!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband because he said Gillete blades where the best.  He used other brand name blades and always comes out looking like he was in a fight with all the nics on his face.  I don&#x27;t know if the reason they are bad is because they were made in another country.  Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> They do such a good job. They are so comfortable and give such a good shave. I grow thick facial hair and shave 2-3 times a week as I have a lighter hair color. I can make one blade last a month. No tugging, no pulling, no irritation! That is fantastic.</li>
            <li> These were smooth but cannot compare to the closeness and sharpness of the yellows in my edwin jagger kelvin.  The yellows are a whole new level of baby smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> I like the 7o&#x27;clock blades however these blades have been repackaged. IE they were removed from the original packaging.  You do not get what is in one of the pictures of a factory seals bar-coded product. Instead what arrives is 15 lose blades in a plastic taped container. Have they been used before? have they been tampered with? The Good news that I&#x27;m only out $5.</li>
            <li> not the sharpest blades around but good for someone with more sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really like this blade. Very sharp and well made. You get a great shave. The only reason for a 4 star instead of 5 was the long wait for shipping due to being overseas. Nothing you can do about that though.</li>
            <li> Could you spend more money on safety razors? Absolutely. But why? Give these a try before you try the more expensive blades and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving perfection! I get a clean shave without any burn. These blades are sharp, so good shave prep is recommended. I use the Proraso pre/post shave balm. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Husband liked the results he got from the shave. It&#x27;s hard to find the blades so he was happy I found them.</li>
            <li> Decent blade! It&#x27;s loud, but it cuts very effectively. Not too sharp or mild. Perfect \\&quot;standard\\&quot; go to DE blade. It&#x27;s the stereotypical sound. LOVE IT! But again can be very mild, so this is best paired with an aggressive blade such as a slant bar. I don&#x27;t think for a mild razor with a mild blade is a good combo if you have thicker facial hair like me. Mild razors with a sharp blade is much more effective. So it&#x27;s about finding that balance.</li>
            <li> I have never dealt with a company this bad in all my years. If you do not mind waiting two months for razor blades then this is where to buy.</li>
            <li> I liked the 7&#x27;oclock Super Stainless (Green Package).  Though I would give these a shot.  Couldnt be happier.  I ve tried other brands but Gilletes are my favorites</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good, sharp, smooth shave this blade delivers.&lt;br /&gt;If you like Feather blades this is only slightly less sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I get 4-6 shaves per blade and the price for these is very fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your shave!</li>
            <li> ...But not the best. Gillette silver blues are superior to these in my opinion. But overall these are good blades just not worthy of 5 stars. Pretty sharp blades but not as comfortable as I would like.</li>
            <li> I shave daily, so I have to switch blades weekly, I started using a safety razor six weeks ago, and still have a close shave with these blades.</li>
            <li> A nice solid product that does exactly what is designed to do! Maybe not the best shave ever, but a good blade for the price. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great shave. NEVER THOUGHT A SINGLE BLADE COULD DO THE TRICK. I was wrong. Stop wasting money on those multiple blade systems.</li>
            <li> I tried several different blades until i found what worked best for me. No razor burn, no ingrown hairs, and a BBS sface my wife loves. Try different blades, get a sampler pack but at approximately 3 cents a blade i will be DE shaving til i die.</li>
            <li> These blades work great and I get about 7-8 good shaves each. The only problem is they are wrapped individually, but I guess this keeps them protected and sharp. You cannot buy straight safety razor blades anymore at stores in the USA, therefore you must go online. I suspect more money can be made on the plastic handle models.</li>
            <li> Men! This is the real thing. Gillette Platinum blades have not been available in local stores for many years. These blades were the sharpest, smoothest blades ever made. No other blade company made anything to compare and I thought I would never get to use them again. I ordered one hundred blades just hoping they would be like the ones I used years ago. When they came and I lathered up, put the blade in my forty five year old razor, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I felt to shave with the blade that I remembered from years ago and thought would never get to use again. The blades I received were made in India and I am so pleased I will order some more just in case they become unavailable in the future. I will say again for the mature men that remember this blade, It&#x27;s The Real Thing!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! I have been needing these coming from the merkur blades these last just as long but I get a much closer shave with no side effects. Received them in loose packaging which the package said not to sell loose but oh well. Product is awesome and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Did not get a clean shave I might go back to those expensive razor blades.</li>
            <li> I gave this razor blade a try after using Derby blades and was very surprised at how much better they were.  This blade is very very sharp and smooth.  I get about 4-5 shaves out of a blade before they start to get too dull to use.  Overall I am very happy with this blade.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s nice to finally get a decent shave again.</li>
            <li> The blades were delivered within the time that was stated on the order confirmation, although, it did take about 2 weeks to arrive. Good thing I had other blades. The picture and description on the Amazon page shows 15 Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock SP (Blues) but I received 21 Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock SP (Blacks) (3 packs of 7 blades). I really like the blacks from previous experience so, it&#x27;s a win/win. They are my favorite of the 5 or 6 blades I have tried. I also like Astra SPs.</li>
            <li> Ordered these thinking to try the blues. The package arrived in good order but instead of the blues, they were the black box (5 + 2 bonus!). I was hoping to try a different blade than I had been using. Oh well, need more of the black box anyway. Three stars for fast shipping and getting a good blade instead of something cheap like Derby.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t received the Gillette super platinum in the blue packaging made in Russia as described and displayed UN the pictures. What I did received was the Gillette super platinum in the black packaging made in India. Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade however, are a good quality blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re good for some but I found them rough. Not as good as Astra and Feathers</li>
            <li> Tried a ton of different blades but bought 35 of these on a whim based on internet reviews.  Turns out that they&#x27;re the best blade I&#x27;ve used so far.  As sharp as Feathers but much smoother and with less irritation but as always YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest issue is the shipping rate being based on each individual pack of 15 rather than the lump amount of blades purchased.  I would like to buy more but after more than just a few boxes, the shipping completely outweighs the cost of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took about a month to receive as these shipped from India.</li>
            <li> not as shown received stainless steel instead of platinum</li>
            <li> This is not a complaint against the seller nor the blade.  But it should be noted for those who are specifically looking for the blue box Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock super platinums as is pictured, you will receive the black box blades which are different.  The black blades are fine, but they do have different characteristics.</li>
            <li> These are made by Gillette India, and that being said (not US made) they are amazing - for me.  My blade of choice used to be the Astras from Russia (yeah I know not US made), but the Gillette blades are even better.  I actually had to look a the razor to be sure there was a blade in there, a slight hyperbole but not by much.  Smooth shaving with no irritation, no nicks, nothing but clean shaving bliss.  It is true that everyone&#x27;s beard is different, but if you don&#x27;t have a thick/wiry beard, then these might be as good a choice for you as they have been for me.  Sensitive neck issues disappeared for me using this blade.  Gillette has been around since 1903, so they definitely know something about blade geometry - the proof is in my razor every day now.  Look sharp, feel sharp, be sharp! Addendum: I placed a second order from another vendor, and the blades came without the cellophane wrap.  The original Gillette (India) blades were cellophane wrapped, so perhaps these were seconds.  Be careful to read vendor feedback before ordering any product.</li>
            <li> These provide a great shave. I have these in my rotation along with Feathers. The Feathers seem to be a bit sharper but I prefer the glide of these.</li>
            <li> These blades last and stay sharp longer then most.  Also very sharp get a excellent shave with these</li>
            <li> The blades I received were made in India. 7 O&#x27;Clock blades apparently are made in different countries. Amazon should have made clear country of origin. Regardless very poor quality, do not even shave close on first day</li>
            <li> im new to shving with a safety razor..actually learend on one and now im back to using it...these are good solid blades...not too sharp, so teyar e a good choice if you are a returning safety razor shaver</li>
