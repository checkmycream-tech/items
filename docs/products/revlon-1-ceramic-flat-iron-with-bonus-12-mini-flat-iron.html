            <li>Ok ok</li>

            <li>adequate product.</li>
            <li>but no biggie I love my new strightners üòÅüëçüëå</li>
            <li>I returned product, bought a Conair tourmaline iron for less money and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I really like the ceramic straightener, they are easy to use</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for man or ladies, You don&#x27;t  worry if you have long or short hair!</li>
            <li>The little one is great for touch ups.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews of this one pinching, I decided to go for it anyway since I liked the idea of having an extra one for traveling, and I don&#x27;t use a straightener every day</li>
            <li>Just got it and used it warmed up fast straightened my hair and the little one is perfect for travel and also got hot fast no pinching here</li>
            <li>If the cord isnt just right</li>
            <li>right and not burn my hair off.</li>
            <li>But the mini on has no thing where you can set the tempurature, it made my hair so hot, after I touched my hair, I burned my finger.</li>
            <li>This was the right price, 2 different sizes and easy to use for a beginner.</li>
            <li>: warmed up quickly  Today, this straightener was replaced with a more expensive one, better design with auto-shut off.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it if your hair is not very, very thick.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re ACTUALLY purchasing two pieces of junk for the price of way too much (honestly, if I saw this item in the $5 bin, I would not purchase it again).&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; flat iron has no temperature control, and its&#x27; cord continually gets in the way.</li>
            <li>I am searching hard to find something nice to say about this product.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves her new straightner, she had it for 1 day</li>
            <li>Such a handy little straightener to go with it!</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t drop it, it gets placed in the same drawer consistently, so I have no clue how that developed), which then catches my hair ad pulls it out, while erratically frizzing the hair I&#x27;m trying to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this product.  </li>
            <li>Mine also developed a crack in the side</li>
            <li>naturally your fingers wrap around it.  </li>
            <li>had to come back and re review these flat irons I did give them a 5 star because my daughter loved them but later complained about it pulling her hair so this morning I had to try it for myself</li>
            <li>Three cons: no auto shut off, the chemical smell of the new iron never &#x27;burned&#x27; off, and finally product design.  </li>
            <li>would buy again, just as good as a lot of other ones but a little less money.</li>
            <li>The first problem I encountered was that I couldn&#x27;t set either iron down without them rolling over onto their heated side surfaces.  </li>
            <li>I have pinched my finger(s) 3-4 times in the past four months; more than on any previous curler or straightener.</li>
            <li>And last but not least, after 3 uses, the heating plate on the larger iron developed a chip in the black surface showing a silver material underneath.  </li>
            <li>The little iron works really well</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to an enemy, much less a friend.</li>
            <li> It has the same problem as the smaller version - it clamps on to the hair unevenly, so you get these weird crimp marks from the heat being applied irregularly.</li>
            <li> What a mess.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for 15 years now and have tried a variety of the cheaper models, hoping to find a product that can tame my Medusa mane without braking the bank.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to reconcile with that little brat a few times, and the frizzy, crimped result is just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The larger flat iron is also awful.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through my share of \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straighteners over the years, hoping to find one that works without having to spend all that money on a high end flat iron, but this one has got to be the worst one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> If you can think carefully enough to avoid this, you will be alright, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this product is poorly designed and annoying as a MFer.  </li>
            <li> The designers of this product must have all had fingers that were 3/4 of an inch long, because---just like another reviewer---I pinch the crap out of my fingers when I am using this.  </li>
            <li> Well, I ended up frustrated in the locker room while simultaneously trying to get it to clamp on my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s maddening not to mention painful.  </li>
            <li> Also, the heating plates are too close to the base --- Causing a guaranteed crease in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it has a temperature setting, but it&#x27;s basically worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product which I have owned (and now replaced after 4 months).  </li>
            <li> Terrible straightener!!  </li>
            <li> This item is another example of how something so incredibly awful can still get 5 stars out of some people.  </li>
            <li> worst straightener EVER!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have curled or straightened my hair daily for over 25 years-using a variety of products-all within this price range.  Very disappointed in this product which I have owned (and now replaced after 4 months).  Three cons: no auto shut off, the chemical smell of the new iron never &#x27;burned&#x27; off, and finally product design.  I have pinched my finger(s) 3-4 times in the past four months; more than on any previous curler or straightener. (the opening below the temperature dial has prongs)  Pro: warmed up quickly  Today, this straightener was replaced with a more expensive one, better design with auto-shut off.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new straightner, she had it for 1 day and now it is as if it has a wiring issue.   If the cord isnt just right it will not work we have to play with it so it will work.  We Love the Product and wish it would not have this wiring problem, It works GREAT when the wire is correctly lined up!</li>
            <li> adequate product. would buy again, just as good as a lot of other ones but a little less money.</li>
            <li> I really like the ceramic straightener, they are easy to use and I like using both sizes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it if your hair is not very, very thick. The gap between the irons is too wide and it pulled out my hair too.</li>
            <li> Just got it and used it warmed up fast straightened my hair and the little one is perfect for travel and also got hot fast no pinching here but my hair is thined on the bottom and did require me to pinch the strightner more twords the bottom but no biggie I love my new strightners üòÅüëçüëå</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend loved it :D&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift to her since she always complains about how big the previous straightener was and how difficult it was for her to carry it when we travel.</li>
            <li> Love love love these. Great buy for those with short hair,  Makes great curls, easy to handle and heats fast without burning.</li>
            <li> Was very good on vacation. Just what I needed</li>
            <li> Terrible straightener!!  It rips your hair out...  Also, the heating plates are too close to the base --- Causing a guaranteed crease in your hair.  I have returned this product after two attempts to use it.  Thankfully within the return period.</li>
            <li> Love it... Works great and is a very pretty color. Especially love the mini for my make up bag.</li>
            <li> This item is another example of how something so incredibly awful can still get 5 stars out of some people.  Do yourself (and your hair) a huge favor by avoiding this plastic POS.</li>
            <li> iI give this rating because they were delivwred on time they work excelent and for the price they are great and they heat well and do a good job</li>
            <li> If I could give this flat iron 0 stars I would.  To echo another reviewer....worst straightener EVER!  I&#x27;ve gone through my share of \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straighteners over the years, hoping to find one that works without having to spend all that money on a high end flat iron, but this one has got to be the worst one I have ever used.  When running through my hair it pulls and snags and makes my hair feel like straw.  Absolutely the worst flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for man or ladies, You don&#x27;t  worry if you have long or short hair! Ok ok</li>
            <li> GIFT  THEY LOVE THEM!!!!</li>
            <li> I didnt want to spend a lot of money on this because I have never been one to use a straightner but since moving to another state where the humidity is much different than back home I felt I had to.  This was the right price, 2 different sizes and easy to use for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this item is good or bad. But the mini on has no thing where you can set the tempurature, it made my hair so hot, after I touched my hair, I burned my finger.</li>
            <li> This item seems to be giving you a great deal, because you get a full size straightener and look! Such a handy little straightener to go with it! Do not be fooled. You&#x27;re ACTUALLY purchasing two pieces of junk for the price of way too much (honestly, if I saw this item in the $5 bin, I would not purchase it again).&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; flat iron has no temperature control, and its&#x27; cord continually gets in the way. I thought it would be a great addition to my gym bag. Well, I ended up frustrated in the locker room while simultaneously trying to get it to clamp on my hair right and not burn my hair off. I&#x27;ve tried to reconcile with that little brat a few times, and the frizzy, crimped result is just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The larger flat iron is also awful.

It has the same problem as the smaller version - it clamps on to the hair unevenly, so you get these weird crimp marks from the heat being applied irregularly. Mine also developed a crack in the side (I didn&#x27;t drop it, it gets placed in the same drawer consistently, so I have no clue how that developed), which then catches my hair ad pulls it out, while erratically frizzing the hair I&#x27;m trying to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for 15 years now and have tried a variety of the cheaper models, hoping to find a product that can tame my Medusa mane without braking the bank.

            <li> I am searching hard to find something nice to say about this product.  The designers of this product must have all had fingers that were 3/4 of an inch long, because---just like another reviewer---I pinch the crap out of my fingers when I am using this.  The part that you press together to make the plates contact each other is small and naturally your fingers wrap around it.  But when they do that they fall in between the crease and get caught in it!  It&#x27;s maddening not to mention painful.  What a mess.  If you can think carefully enough to avoid this, you will be alright, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this product is poorly designed and annoying as a MFer.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to an enemy, much less a friend.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new straightener for my hair since my old one died a painful death- for the straightener, not me. After reading reviews of this one pinching, I decided to go for it anyway since I liked the idea of having an extra one for traveling, and I don&#x27;t use a straightener every day so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a heck of a lot on one. Also, my last one pinched like crazy, so I&#x27;m used to it. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love both of them! The smaller one doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. No burning of fingers for me, and pinching hasn&#x27;t happened once. I use the big one with wet hair, dry hair, temperature turned up, and temperature low. The little one is great for touch ups. Love them both!</li>
            <li> It works Like a miracle...</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this product.  I purchased this to replace a Conair flat iron which worked well but gave out after a number of years. Because I have a hair style that is short in back I thought the 1/2\\&quot; iron would work well to straighten the back of my curly hair and the 1\\&quot; iron would work on my longer sides.  The first problem I encountered was that I couldn&#x27;t set either iron down without them rolling over onto their heated side surfaces.  Secondly, I noticed that the smaller iron had no on/off button but went on immediately when plugged in.  Furthermore, the outside of the small iron became so hot, I was afraid of burning my hand.  That would have been enough for me to downrate this product.  But additionally, these new irons left my hair dull and frizzy compared to my old flat iron. And last but not least, after 3 uses, the heating plate on the larger iron developed a chip in the black surface showing a silver material underneath.  I returned product, bought a Conair tourmaline iron for less money and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to come back and re review these flat irons I did give them a 5 star because my daughter loved them but later complained about it pulling her hair so this morning I had to try it for myself the big iron did in fact pull some strands of hair out not very pleasant. The little iron works really well so that&#x27;s why I gave it a 3 star the heat of both are really nice and for the price I guess I get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I like the product, and it arrived in My house in time! The principal for me it was to get two products at the same time! I can feel that I did a good choise!</li>
