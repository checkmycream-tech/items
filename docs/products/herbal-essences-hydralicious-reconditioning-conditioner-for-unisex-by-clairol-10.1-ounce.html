            <li>The smell is nice though.</li>
            <li>I liked this conditioner it leaves my hair with volume without making it frizzy</li>
            <li>I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and smells good, and works - what more could a girl need!</li>
            <li>I love their products for the smell more than anything!</li>

            <li>What more could you want?  </li>
            <li>This stuff is as close as one can get to the coveted 2 minute conditioner which is so famous from herbal essence men&#x27;s color.  </li>
            <li>Since we have tried so many</li>
            <li>I love herbal essences products.</li>
            <li>I love that I can just add it to my subscribe and save and have it delivered every month.  </li>

            <li>It is especially great for damaged or color treated hair, and I always get compliments on how healthy my long hair looks.  </li>
            <li>Tried other conditioners, but this works the best for me.</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells so good, also makes my hair really soft and shiny, scent lasts along time after shower!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner - it smells incredibly amazing and makes my hair feel very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Best drug store conditioner for the price HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li>This is one of those conditioners that you just try to use up because its nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>she has a good objective opinion of how well they have all performed and she recommends this product to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I Love it and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair manageable, soft, and refreshingly scented.</li>
            <li>nd looks shiny and feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this conditioner because I love the shampoo, but what a dissapointment this is.</li>
            <li>Shampoo smells nice and has a nice texture but the packaging was poor.</li>
            <li>IT not only leaves my hair very silky and shiny, but also has an AMAZING aroma.  </li>
            <li>, so I was hoping this would add some moisture back, but it was just okay, no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>and I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>People tell me everyday I smell good.</li>
            <li>34;add-on&amp;#34; item at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really hope it keeps working for me.</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner for dry, fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my long hair smooth and manageable too.</li>
            <li>I tried a half dozen conditioners before I settled on this one and I love it.</li>
            <li>Especially when I leave it on for a while :) would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>and it also has made my hair feel normal again.  </li>
            <li>Does not make your hair feel smooth like other conditioners, not even when you are putting it on the shower.</li>
            <li>and I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years young and</li>
            <li>and she just loves the shampoo and the conditioner as they make her hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Also makes my thick hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>(growing past the band of your bra) know that once hair grows that long it can start looking scraggly and tends to get split ends pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty dry hair because I color it frequently</li>
            <li>so far this is the only product that has made my hair is soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>My wife generally buys every shampoo and conditioner to try them all.</li>
            <li>really calms my hair down!</li>

            <li> And like the old Brylcreem commercials used to say, &amp;#34;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya!&amp;#34;  Don&#x27;t use too much or this is a bit hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> My one critique is that it&#x27;s definitely a feminine scent, not really unisex.</li>
            <li> Any of you with really long hair</li>
            <li> This is what you need for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry frizzy hair and this Hydralicious Reconditioner</li>
            <li> So I tried this Herbal Essences Hyddralicious Reconditioning last night and it worked extremely well!  </li>
            <li> I used this specific berry crush/shea butter in the past from a local store, but had not seen it stocked in years.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not secure enough and the product spilled out a lot.</li>
            <li> my blonde (and white around the temple) hair has been so dry lately that it&#x27;s begun to feel like straw!  </li>
            <li> This gives life to my hair and eliminates the need for other hair products.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, but unfortunately it also makes my eyes red and itchy.</li>
            <li> I am black and have very thick natural hair</li>
            <li> None the less it is being used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look dull or dry.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I have tight curly hair and its very hard to find products that moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> I do use hairspray around the sides of my face, and this residue it hard to wash out.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and try this conditioner at least once!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair softer than the expensive name brand conditioners.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good conditioner and smells great.</li>
            <li> Made my skin itch and I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Got it when I purchased the shampoo. I really had high hopes for this conditioner because I love the shampoo, but what a dissapointment this is. Does not make your hair feel smooth like other conditioners, not even when you are putting it on the shower. Made my hair frizzy and coarse. Will not repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner - it smells incredibly amazing and makes my hair feel very soft and silky. It&#x27;s cheap, and smells good, and works - what more could a girl need!</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner for dry, fine, thin hair.  Puts moisture back in. Tried other conditioners, but this works the best for me.</li>
            <li> This is what you need for dry hair. I get auto ship every six months. I mix this with one n only argon oil moisture repair conditioner and dilute. You&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful. Probably the best scented line of hair products I&#x27;ve found.  Also makes my thick hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product and it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell and smooth hair after the wash. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Best drug store conditioner for the price HANDS DOWN! I was a pantene girl for 15 years and then they changed formula and it started ruining my hair. I tried a half dozen conditioners before I settled on this one and I love it. I get it automatically sent to me every month. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, the way my hair feels after conditioning is how I dreamed of it.  I use it with the same type of shampoo.</li>
            <li> So, the first time I used this I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed. But, I&#x27;m so glad I gave it another try b/c this conditioner is so wonderful! My hair feels so silky smooth and the smell is so delicious! I love how I can smell it every time the wind blows my hair! Another winner from Herbal Essences!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. It leaves my hair softer than the expensive name brand conditioners.</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner because it was offered as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item at a reasonable price. It was okay. I have pretty dry hair because I color it frequently, so I was hoping this would add some moisture back, but it was just okay, no noticeable difference. I prefer Herbal Essences Hello Hydration, which leaves my hair feeling softer every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so good, also makes my hair really soft and shiny, scent lasts along time after shower! Would recommend to anyone who likes fruity scent!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I&#x27;m 50 years young and my blonde (and white around the temple) hair has been so dry lately that it&#x27;s begun to feel like straw!  I do use hairspray around the sides of my face, and this residue it hard to wash out.  So I tried this Herbal Essences Hyddralicious Reconditioning last night and it worked extremely well!  It got out all of the hairspray residue (and that&#x27;s saying something) and it also has made my hair feel normal again.  And like the old Brylcreem commercials used to say, &amp;#34;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya!&amp;#34;  Don&#x27;t use too much or this is a bit hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> Smells great. People tell me everyday I smell good. I wash my hair everyday. And it&#x27;s shine my hair. It doesn&#x27;t look dull or dry.</li>
            <li> The best pre-poo conditioner out there!! I am black and have very thick natural hair and I use this conditioner as a pre-poo, the best!! Instantly moisturizes and softens my hair!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Packaging was not secure enough and the product spilled out a lot. Shampoo smells nice and has a nice texture but the packaging was poor.</li>
            <li> Has an amazing texture and scent!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, leaves my hair soft and touchable, and was a great deal.  What more could you want?  My one critique is that it&#x27;s definitely a feminine scent, not really unisex.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner if you have hair that knots easily. It smells great as well. I wish they sold this in the big bottle.</li>
            <li> I remember buying this last year and I instantly fell in love with it. It is so hydrating and quenching! Loves it!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite conditioner.  It is especially great for damaged or color treated hair, and I always get compliments on how healthy my long hair looks.  Any of you with really long hair (growing past the band of your bra) know that once hair grows that long it can start looking scraggly and tends to get split ends pretty easily.  Do yourself a favor and try this conditioner at least once!  None of the stores in my area sell it anymore for some reason, but I can always trust good ole Amazon to carry what I need.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please click YES or HELPFUL below!</li>
            <li> This stuff is as close as one can get to the coveted 2 minute conditioner which is so famous from herbal essence men&#x27;s color.  This gives life to my hair and eliminates the need for other hair products.  I cannot say enough about this product.  You owe it to yourself to try this as it meets its claims.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, but unfortunately it also makes my eyes red and itchy. The smell is nice though.</li>
            <li> Anything Herbal Essence is awesome I love their products for the smell more than anything! This makes my hair feel so hydrated.</li>
            <li> My wife generally buys every shampoo and conditioner to try them all. The last time she purchased this brand and she just loves the shampoo and the conditioner as they make her hair feel soft and silky. Her hair is color treated and she feels that this shampoo and conditioner brand just have helped her hair a lot. Since we have tried so many she has a good objective opinion of how well they have all performed and she recommends this product to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have created a link to the shampoo so you can check them both out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001YTD36O Herbal Essences Hydralicious Reconditioning Shampoo By Clairol for Unisex Shampoo, 10.17 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I love herbal essences products. I could not resist the add on deal for this conditioner. I used this specific berry crush/shea butter in the past from a local store, but had not seen it stocked in years. It does what it was created to do. I use it as a daily moisturizer.
