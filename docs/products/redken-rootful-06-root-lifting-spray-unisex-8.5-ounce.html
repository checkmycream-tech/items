    <ol>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Works great for curl hold!</li>
            <li>Perfect, discontinued in salons and found it here.....</li>
            <li>Best thing to keep your hair uplifted and manageable.</li>
            <li>and I get some great volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smell isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I find that the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Root Booster works just as well, and has a much better shaped bottle (and it&#x27;s cheaper!).  </li>
            <li>Amazing styling  product for fine hair!  </li>
            <li>Ive used a redken root boosting product from yrs ago that I love but couldn&#x27;t locate it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and can&#x27;t understand why Redken discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>Love it and so pleased to find it available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>And now if you can even find it, have to pay three times or more what the original price was.  </li>
            <li>It is as if somebody replaced the original product with liquid hairspray and tried to pass it off as root lifting spray.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it!  </li>
            <li>This is the best root booster spray that I have found for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li>well worth the cost for the results.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and provides just the right amount of body for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used Redken products in the past and was always happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I have heavy hair and this doesn&#x27;t do a good job giving me any volume.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair, and it did next to nothing for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the reason it isn&#x27;t selling because it works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It gives the hair the lift really straight hair needs.</li>
            <li>This really does give the roots a lift.</li>
            <li>Tried many products for thin limp hair and this is by far the best i&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair that tends to be flat at the top when I grow it out past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I spray it at the roots section-by-section through the top third of my hair and then blow dry upside-down</li>
            <li>This must be the same updated version, it works great, you only need a few pumps and get tons of volume!</li>
            <li>New to me, anyway.</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair though so product is more likely to show, and shampooing each day is a small price to pay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This you spray on the roots directly after shampooing.</li>
            <li>Only thing that works for my fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>Difficult to rate as I have very fine hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Difficult to rate as I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Lifts hair at the roots - covers a lot of flat spots!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely NOT the same product I&#x27;ve purchased from my stylist&#x27;s shop.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, the tapered top of the bottle causes my hand to slide up when pressing down on the sprayer, so it is really awkward to use - even if my hands are absolutely dry.  </li>
            <li> complaints:&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t usually have to shampoo my hair every day, but this spray makes me look greasy the next day.</li>
            <li> lightweight, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and make my hair get dirty too fast.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy on the hair and doesn&#x27;t feel like you have products in your hair either.</li>
            <li> My beauty salon and Walmart&#x27;s beauty salons used to stock it, but have stopped because sales were slow.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but the texture is thin.  </li>
            <li> Sad that a redkin product failed to deliver.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!  </li>
            <li> I threw the product away because it was AWFUL!</li>

            <li> Ive used a redken root boosting product from yrs ago that I love but couldn&#x27;t locate it.  This must be the same updated version, it works great, you only need a few pumps and get tons of volume!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.  Arrived with some leakage...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about one year.  It is not sticky and provides just the right amount of body for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken products in the past and was always happy with them.  But this product leaves your hair sticky and gummy.  It does however hold a curl and uplift your hair so I am giving it 3 stars.  I just do not like the feel of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Redken discontinued this product.  Only thing that works for my fine limp hair.  And now if you can even find it, have to pay three times or more what the original price was.  Very frustrating!  Redken - please bring it back!!!!</li>
            <li> I would give this product no stars if I could. This is absolutely NOT the same product I&#x27;ve purchased from my stylist&#x27;s shop. It is as if somebody replaced the original product with liquid hairspray and tried to pass it off as root lifting spray. In addition, the package was not well sealed and leaked before it arrived. It doesn&#x27;t really matter. I threw the product away because it was AWFUL!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it!  Lifts hair at the roots - covers a lot of flat spots!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Not too heavy on the hair and doesn&#x27;t feel like you have products in your hair either. Works great for curl hold!</li>
            <li> This is the best root booster spray that I have found for my thin hair.  I have a lot of hair, but the texture is thin.  Amazon is the only place where I can find it.  My beauty salon and Walmart&#x27;s beauty salons used to stock it, but have stopped because sales were slow.  I don&#x27;t understand the reason it isn&#x27;t selling because it works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product, which works well for my hair.  However, the tapered top of the bottle causes my hand to slide up when pressing down on the sprayer, so it is really awkward to use - even if my hands are absolutely dry.  I find that the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Root Booster works just as well, and has a much better shaped bottle (and it&#x27;s cheaper!).  I have both products at this time and tend to reach for the John Frieda rather than the Redken.</li>
            <li> Amazing styling  product for fine hair!  Love it and so pleased to find it available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfect, discontinued in salons and found it here.....stocked up!</li>
            <li> lightweight, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> I have heavy hair and this doesn&#x27;t do a good job giving me any volume. Kind of disappointed. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Difficult to rate as I have very fine hair and it seems to work well.  I have to use quite a bit of it to give my hair body.  I do like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and make my hair get dirty too fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have been using it daily and It gives my hair fullness and shine. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> New to me, anyway. This you spray on the roots directly after shampooing. It gives the hair the lift really straight hair needs.</li>
            <li> This really does give the roots a lift.</li>
            <li> Best thing to keep your hair uplifted and manageable. This product gives you volume and control. I love it.</li>
            <li> Tried many products for thin limp hair and this is by far the best i&#x27;ve ever used.  A bit pricy but well worth the cost for the results.</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Supposed to create big hair from roots.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair that tends to be flat at the top when I grow it out past my shoulders. This spray definitely gives it a boost while not looking sticky or unnatural. I spray it at the roots section-by-section through the top third of my hair and then blow dry upside-down and I get some great volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complaints:&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t usually have to shampoo my hair every day, but this spray makes me look greasy the next day. I have light blonde hair though so product is more likely to show, and shampooing each day is a small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell isn&#x27;t great. But it goes away once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product. I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> Sad that a redkin product failed to deliver. I used it twice, and tossed the rest of the bottle. I have fine, straight hair, and it did next to nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t understand why Redken discontinued it.  Thank goodness, I could buy it on Amazon!</li>
