            <li>I love the way my skin feels after taking these phytoceramides.</li>
            <li>One more thing:  </li>
            <li>Yesterday I worked in the yard and garden with two males many years my junior, and ended my day when they did, after 6 and 1/2 hours.  </li>
            <li>and my hair even has more shine to</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this healthy- ever.</li>
            <li>After being on Phytoceramides for a couple of weeks, my skin felt so much better.</li>
            <li>Healthier, softer, and with more &#x27;depth&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I used to- after 3 weeks of taking this, she asked me where she could get more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that in another month or two, she will no longer have the break outs.</li>
            <li>skin just &#x27;feel&#x27;s better.....</li>
            <li>so I could be sure of its efficacy.  </li>
            <li>This supplement seems to have changes the texture of my skin for the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I added this to what I&#x27;m taking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding more and more that good nutrition helps my skin so much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The company&#x27;s customer service is excellent, providing fast delivery, and a very informative 6 page&lt;</li>
            <li>I just started this, and so far, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Phytoceramides users like me are enjoying fabulous looking skin from plant-based products rather than animal</li>
            <li>It is as if I had a special glow and looked healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Since using this product for about three weeks I have noticed my skin looking a bit more plump in my smile lines.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll look fabulous faster than you know</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll look fabulous faster than you know</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what the continued usage of the phytoceramides will do for my skin.</li>
            <li>so I am excited about the changes I hope i&#x27;ll see as I continue to use them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my skin will be beach ready by summer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Phytoceramides penetrate all the four layers of the skin and successfully lock in moisture deep in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this supplement has my skin looking and feeling fresh and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>have been taking these capsules now for about a month, and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;About two weeks after I started taking the capsules</li>
            <li>I am, therefore, pleased to share the good news with other readers and inquirers that the Sublime Beauty PHYTOCERAMIDES, Anti-Aging had no adverse affects in the intestinal area.  </li>
            <li>It’s a powerful antioxidant that slows the rate of free-radical damage, which causes skin’s dryness, fine lines, and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I became aware of Phytoceramides rather recently, and was really excited about all the great benefits&lt;br /&gt;attributed to taking them.</li>
            <li>I have been taking these for a year and if anyone wants to get a boost for your skin care you need this!!  </li>
            <li>I even tried taking hot showers- without consequence!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>that I felt that giving my skin cells the boost from the inside was worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>They have been producing such great results from the outside</li>
            <li>I received this phytoceramide complimentary to facilitate testing for this review, and positive ratings are never guaranteed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an FDA natural ingredient that works to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why it&#x27;s so effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin looked better after about ten days.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future and making this product a staple in my skincare regimine.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never been as soft as it is now, glowy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Phytoceramides is the key to maintaining healthy, youthful skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Scientists have proven phytoceramides work and my skin looks better now than it did when I was in my later 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I only wish I had been able to take this supplement when I was a teenager-</li>
            <li>most likely is smoother</li>
            <li>but anything that can revive the skin I am willing to try.  </li>
            <li>My neck is smoother, the skin looks younger, I am glad that I took the chance and purchased this item.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product on the recommendation and very much hoped for a positive outcome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sublime beauty and other phytoceramides are amazing, and they&#x27;ve received the FDA stamp of approval for the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has been looking great all winter due to Sublime Beauty products and w this product to add to my daily beauty regiment...</li>
            <li>just said I looked good but were not able to pinpoint why.</li>
            <li>I think you can really feel the difference pretty fast.....</li>
            <li>While it takes time to work, like anything realistic, phytoceramides are a life changer!</li>
            <li>Her skin, which also used to bruise and cut easily, now is healing much faster, and her flair ups are becoming less frequent.</li>
            <li>The goods is very good, I also appreciate the product, but the freight is too expensive, really can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li>My skin is really started to shape up from the inside out.</li>
            <li>So, while it&#x27;s admittedly anecdotal, I really feel my skin has improved since taking this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sublime Beauty.</li>
            <li>I have yet to post my results, but in very hopeful about the product</li>
            <li>She says it does the same thing as name brand products for cheap.</li>
            <li>I noticed my facial skin felt firmer and incredibly&lt;br /&gt;soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>BUT I do feel more energetic than for a long time past.  </li>
            <li>My smile lines are barely there.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this product and plan to order again.</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;two seem to work synergistically, resulting in a wonderfully clear, vibrant complextion.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Trusting that this Sublime Beauty product offering works its magic on the inside and in concert with the several external Sublime Beauty skin products that are part and parcel of my weekly facial and skin care routines, I feel as though I have a full-array of &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Hope in a jar usually refers to the latest beauty cream.</li>
            <li>am turning 35 in less than a month, but my skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I did the cool shower, not hot, and ate the diet that was supposed to help, and applied moisturizer 2-3 times per day-</li>
            <li>My fine lines are vanishing, everyday I can&#x27;t wait to look in the mirror and see the difference from the day before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 yrs old and for some reason my skin is under the impression  that I&#x27;m going through puberty.</li>
            <li>Actually I never had this much acne when I was going through puberty.</li>
            <li>My friends all ask me what I&#x27;ve changed in my diet to make my skin look so alive.</li>
            <li>she has the same (if not worse) issues</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if its just the phytoceramides or the combination of the other Sublime products but my skin looks better!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using different brands of phytoceramides for the past year, and I love the way they moisturize my face from the outside in.</li>
            <li>So far from what I am seeing, my 62 year old skin is looking a lot younger and people comment quite often that I look decades younger.  </li>
            <li>it may be coincidental with the true arrival of spring, seeing the sun after a long hard winter, or wishful thinking</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Since using this product for about three weeks I have noticed my skin looking a bit more plump in my smile lines. I also have energy when I take these phytoceramides. I&#x27;m excited to see what the continued usage of the phytoceramides will do for my skin.</li>
            <li> Am still trying it out.</li>
            <li> in just a week i can see deferent in my skin.</li>
            <li> I am happy to have found this product! I love the way my skin feels after taking these phytoceramides. It seems to look softer and brighter. After seeing this on Dr Oz, I wanted to give it a try, so when I found out I could receive this for my honest review, I jumped on the chance. I am just getting started with this product so I am excited about the changes I hope i&#x27;ll see as I continue to use them. My skin has been looking great all winter due to Sublime Beauty products and w this product to add to my daily beauty regiment... I&#x27;m sure my skin will be beach ready by summer!</li>
            <li> I just started this, and so far, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about these vitamins but decided to give them a try. I noticed that my skin looked better after about ten days. It is as if I had a special glow and looked healthy and hydrated. Some of my family members complimented my skin and others just said I looked good but were not able to pinpoint why. I would definitely recommend this product! Try them, I hope they work for you as they did for me.</li>
            <li> I saw improvement in my skin within days of taking this supplement. I will DEFINITELY reorder. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now.  My skin feels good.  It looks healthier and has a nice glow.  Good product and I feel like it has made a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for about a week now and my skin is glowing. My acne is even clearing up. I&#x27;m 40 yrs old and for some reason my skin is under the impression  that I&#x27;m going through puberty. Actually I never had this much acne when I was going through puberty. My skin is really started to shape up from the inside out. My fine lines are vanishing, everyday I can&#x27;t wait to look in the mirror and see the difference from the day before. My friends all ask me what I&#x27;ve changed in my diet to make my skin look so alive. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I will be buying more in the future and making this product a staple in my skincare regimine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months give or take and my skin has never been as soft as it is now, glowy and smooth.  Great product</li>
            <li> Having endured several episodes of intestinal distress in the past several years as a result of ingesting, per instructions, vitamin OTC supplements, I was somewhat leery of adding the Sublime Beauty PHYTOCERAMIDES Anti-Aging capsules to my daily diet regimen.  However, the word &amp;#34;rice&amp;#34; captured my attention as rice is a dietary staple to combat intestinal distress. I am, therefore, pleased to share the good news with other readers and inquirers that the Sublime Beauty PHYTOCERAMIDES, Anti-Aging had no adverse affects in the intestinal area.  Therefore, I shall continue to take this supplement on a regular basis.  Trusting that this Sublime Beauty product offering works its magic on the inside and in concert with the several external Sublime Beauty skin products that are part and parcel of my weekly facial and skin care routines, I feel as though I have a full-array of &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; warriors on my side.  One more thing:  it may be coincidental with the true arrival of spring, seeing the sun after a long hard winter, or wishful thinking BUT I do feel more energetic than for a long time past.  My age:  Eighty years and counting.  Yesterday I worked in the yard and garden with two males many years my junior, and ended my day when they did, after 6 and 1/2 hours.  Excuse me, now, I need to head outside to water yesterday&#x27;s new plants and transplants and do a little digging!  And, yes, I do wear a broad-brimmed hat and long sleeves, to protect my skin from harmful rays!</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I take these everyday! I have seen a huge difference in the texture of my skin! I have that glow again and my hair even has more shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Benefits of Phytoceramides&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phytoceramides is the key to maintaining healthy, youthful skin. It’s a powerful antioxidant that slows the rate of free-radical damage, which causes skin’s dryness, fine lines, and wrinkles. It helps combat and even reverse time&#x27;s effect on your skin, because it produces collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. Taking Phytoceramides orally is up to 20 times more effective than applying to the skin topically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an FDA natural ingredient that works to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why it&#x27;s so effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Hope in a jar usually refers to the latest beauty cream. This, however, is a bottled supplement that promises to have an impact on the skin. So, while it&#x27;s admittedly anecdotal, I really feel my skin has improved since taking this product. They sent along some research too and the promise appears to be there for phytoceramides. I will be continuing with this supplement.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE YET, BUT LIKE HOW IT MAKES ME FEEL, YOUNGER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different brands of phytoceramides for the past year, and I love the way they moisturize my face from the outside in. Ceramides lock in moisture, and they&#x27;ve been used for decades before today as ingredients for skin and hair products. The ability to lock in moisture helps skin look younger, plumper and healthier. Wrinkles appear less pronounced and the skin is rejuvenated to make you look younger. Phytoceramides users like me are enjoying fabulous looking skin from plant-based products rather than animal based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sublime beauty and other phytoceramides are amazing, and they&#x27;ve received the FDA stamp of approval for the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Phytoceramides have been found to contain lipids that exhibit the same properties as those naturally present in our skin. This lipids able act as substitutes for your own lipids and help plump and &amp;#34;dewrinkle&amp;#34; skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Phytoceramides penetrate all the four layers of the skin and successfully lock in moisture deep in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Phytoceramides act as a stimulant for collagen production increasing skin elasticity and plumping the skin to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* They encourage the development of a protective barrier that protects against inflammations, infections, sun damage and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* They keep your skin hydrated by retaining moisture which in effect reduces wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Phytoceramides have also been found to have the ability to slow down the skin’s aging process and even reverse existing signs of crow’s feet from deep within the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Scientists have proven phytoceramides work and my skin looks better now than it did when I was in my later 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am turning 35 in less than a month, but my skin looks fantastic. The only difference between the profile photo and now is I&#x27;ve gotten a bit of summer sun, but I&#x27;ve never used foundation, I see no crows feet even up close in the mirror, and the premature wrinkling from college partying and smelly, dreadful smoking days has disappeared. I feel wonderful. I know some people talk about 10 days and no difference, but be patient and give it time. You&#x27;ll look fabulous faster than you know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, phytoceramides aren&#x27;t a miracle--they have to continue to be used with your skin care and vitamin routine (if you take supplements, that is). I received this phytoceramide complimentary to facilitate testing for this review, and positive ratings are never guaranteed.rom college partying and smelly, dreadful smoking days has disappeared.

            <li> Taking this to help with anti-aging.  Will have to wait and see how well it works.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been taking these for a year and if anyone wants to get a boost for your skin care you need this!!  One pill in the morning is all it takes.  It makes since that you have to work on the inside out.  This is what this does.  Isn&#x27;t that how our bodies work? Take care of your insides and it will take care of you.  Thanks Sublime Beauty.</li>
            <li> I have yet to post my results, but in very hopeful about the product</li>
            <li> The goods is very good, I also appreciate the product, but the freight is too expensive, really can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation and very much hoped for a positive outcome. But now, a month after the start of vitamins, I still do not see any changes. It is unfortunate, but true ... And I think need I to spend another $ 20 to continue, or will it be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I started taking Phytoeramides about 6 months ago. My skin has never been this healthy- ever. I have always suffered from eczema, and during the dry winter months there was not a lotion, cream, or medication that could keep my break outs under control- let alone stop them from occuring! I did the cool shower, not hot, and ate the diet that was supposed to help, and applied moisturizer 2-3 times per day- and I would still get the itchy patches that took forever to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This winter I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the mundane routine for my skin. After being on Phytoceramides for a couple of weeks, my skin felt so much better. Healthier, softer, and with more &#x27;depth&#x27;. I even tried taking hot showers- without consequence! I got Sublime Beauty&#x27;s formula for my mother to try out- she has the same (if not worse) issues I used to- after 3 weeks of taking this, she asked me where she could get more. Her skin, which also used to bruise and cut easily, now is healing much faster, and her flair ups are becoming less frequent. I&#x27;m confident that in another month or two, she will no longer have the break outs. It only takes one small capsule a day- and it&#x27;s well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several months of taking this supplement I am an active preacher in the benefits and ease of taking phytoceramides. I only wish I had been able to take this supplement when I was a teenager- how I would have been spared all of the dermatologist appointments, medications, and skin samples I had to submit. While it takes time to work, like anything realistic, phytoceramides are a life changer!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product for too long, but either it&#x27;s my imagination or there is truly some improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using several of Sublime Beauty&#x27;s skincare lotions for months now...  the Oxygen day cream, the Face Whisperer night cream, and the SPF 30 Vitamin C day cream.  They have been producing such great results from the outside that I felt that giving my skin cells the boost from the inside was worth the effort.  So far from what I am seeing, my 62 year old skin is looking a lot younger and people comment quite often that I look decades younger.  That always makes me feel great and confirms that I must be doing something right!  Great products:-)</li>
            <li> This is the Best Brand! Won&#x27;t use another, Great Product - Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin very soft.  I think you can really feel the difference pretty fast.....skin just &#x27;feel&#x27;s better.....most likely is smoother but I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; person so use good stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product some time ago, but wanted to finish all the vitamins I was taking so I could be sure of its efficacy.  So far, I really like this product and plan to order again. Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> this supplement has my skin looking and feeling fresh and rejuvenated! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to pump some life back into their skin!</li>
            <li> I am taking these daily.  I con&#x27;t know the results yet but anything that can revive the skin I am willing to try.  Thank you for the download with the product order.</li>
            <li> love, love this product!!! will buy again</li>
            <li> Love these pills!! I noticed a big improvement with my skin and facial complexion. I will be watching for future deals on this item cuz it is a must have in the beauty sector. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Nice Product, has truly made a difference with the tone of my skin.  My neck is smoother, the skin looks younger, I am glad that I took the chance and purchased this item.  I will try the others in this line.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t finished a full bottle yet, but I did get a compliment that I had a glow!!  I&#x27;m not sure if its just the phytoceramides or the combination of the other Sublime products but my skin looks better!  Also my monthly breakouts seem to be less.</li>
            <li> Noticing a difference after only a week!</li>
            <li> My mom uses it in place of skin products. She says it does the same thing as name brand products for cheap.</li>
            <li> This supplement seems to have changes the texture of my skin for the better. I like and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I became aware of Phytoceramides rather recently, and was really excited about all the great benefits&lt;br /&gt;attributed to taking them. But, because I&#x27;m gluten senstive, I was disappointed to discover that most&lt;br /&gt;Phyceramides are wheat based, and therefore, I could not use them. I was delighted to find that&lt;br /&gt;Sublime Beauty Phytoceramides are rice based, and consequently a product I could use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking these capsules now for about a month, and so far I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;About two weeks after I started taking the capsules I noticed my facial skin felt firmer and incredibly&lt;br /&gt;soft and smooth. I have been using a topical Vitamin C serum as part of my daily beauty routine, and&lt;br /&gt;was happy to discover that it is recommended to use along with taking the Phytoceramide capsules. The&lt;br /&gt;two seem to work synergistically, resulting in a wonderfully clear, vibrant complextion. While the tiny&lt;br /&gt;fine lines have diminished, it&#x27;s too soon for the deeper lines on my forehead, but, I will continue&lt;br /&gt;taking the capsules, and hopefully, over time, they will diminish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company&#x27;s customer service is excellent, providing fast delivery, and a very informative 6 page&lt;br /&gt;report detailing all about Phytoceramides.  I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding more and more that good nutrition helps my skin so much.  I&#x27;m glad I added this to what I&#x27;m taking.</li>
            <li> Luv it! My smile lines are barely there. I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Skin does seem to be improving, less sagging and wrinkles.</li>
