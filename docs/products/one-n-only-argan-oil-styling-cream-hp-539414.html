            <li>Smells great and my hair is snooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Kind of a spicy vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels and smells and gives my hair nice shine.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product and I use it anytime</li>
            <li>After experimenting, I knew I liked argan oils for moisture and creams over gels.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It tames frizz, adds shine and keeps my hair nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have used the oil before and loved it - it does better keeping my frizz under control.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>Nice for hair but</li>
            <li>but boy does it smell,  a nice smell, but very strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a very strong floral smell.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and thought this would make it feel fuller, it does not.</li>
            <li>the best so far, I love it.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty strong but pleasant, kind of a spiced vanilla.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1) I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I like this one better for pre-flat ironing or braid-outs for waves or curling with an iron, and</li>
            <li>impressed and won&#x27;t switch back.</li>
            <li>and I love everything about it</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!!!</li>
            <li>My hair has never been this healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been using this product on my straightened hair for a week now, and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the Moroccan oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;LOVE, LOVE</li>
            <li>, Love it</li>
            <li>It is a potent smell.</li>
            <li>I think this smells floral and exotic.</li>
            <li>Love this smoothing product.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and so much more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My hair is a lot smoother, silkier, and more manageable bc of this product.</li>
            <li>And I always get compliments, about how my hair smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t look as damaged as I make it sound.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, when I apply to damp hair before I roller set it</li>
            <li>One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Styling Cream is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>i realy love this product</li>
            <li>Makes my hair more manageable and shines.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>My hair looks more polished and &#x27;finished&#x27; when I use this product than when I blow-dry without it.</li>
            <li>Love this styling cream.  </li>
            <li>I love putting on my hair after I wash and condition it.</li>
            <li>love this product and it was delivered asap</li>
            <li>My hair has never been better.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of hair products.</li>
            <li>Love this styling creme..</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a perfume.  </li>
            <li>Love it not greasy.</li>
            <li>The more I do this, the more I feel the need to add products in order to keep moisture and add to hair control.</li>
            <li>Very nutty and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Goes best in wet towel-dried hair, and be sure to rub the product over your palms and through your fingers so you don&#x27;t get globs of it in one spot when your hands touch the hair.  </li>
            <li>This product smells great, incorporates into hair nicely and provides good hold without any hard stiffness</li>
            <li>It is good if you have straight hair not curly.</li>
            <li>Great product super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>When I took them out I had fantastic bouncy curls and great volume, very soft.</li>
            <li>the smell is way too strong.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance as it is not overpowering and the rich cream leaves a sheen, yet is light in weight.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I works fine</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to put a huge amount of it in your hair to work.</li>
            <li>But I enjoy how this makes my hair looks and feels, so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll eventually overlook that.</li>
            <li>No frizzies and smooth to the touch without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>no greasy no oily really great product for daily use.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or heavy feeling,  not to mention it smells awesome.</li>
            <li>that keeps it smooth and under control.  </li>
            <li>Light styling cream, with a light hold.  </li>
            <li>When I style my hair it gives me light hold.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Probably good for any curly hair--leaves hair soft, but somewhat defined curls.</li>
            <li>I used a flexible hair spray for more hold because this doesn&#x27;t exactly hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth and then some!</li>
            <li>I also used it on dry hair looked great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>huge plus with this product is my hair doesn&#x27;t look super greasy after using it.</li>
            <li>Product is great and it smells amazing , it adds shine and protects the hair especially if you apply heat so I might order again in the future</li>
            <li>Honestly, the smell reminds me of old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and stays nice looking all day.</li>
            <li>I suppose most product performances are really going to vary from person to person based on hair types and what you&#x27;re trying to do with them/</li>
            <li>Better than much pricier products.</li>
            <li>This is ok, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the oil or the oil spray.  </li>
            <li>fragrance is a bit strong at first, but it fades as your hair dries.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is more damaged than the rest of you guys I always use a little more than the suggested amount which is ok.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly musky smelling, which is a scent I usually tend to avoid.</li>
            <li>I prefer a bit more hold to my styling cream (but not stiff or greasy looking-</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it reminded me of old ladies, but more like an incense shop.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own devices for anyone with similar hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it is not heavy on the hair nor does it have any build up like some products.</li>
            <li>my hair has never felt more soft or looked shinner.</li>
            <li>Plus I live in a humid climate, so most days my hair is pretty unruly.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try it on a day when I wear my hair au natural...but based on what how much smoother and softer and bouncy</li>
            <li>Shipped right away.  </li>
            <li>This keeps it smooth pretty much throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have used Bumble and Bumble cream in the past but now prefer this one - and Amazon has a great price.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, easily made frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much,</li>
            <li>Some people love it, but I find it is strong, long lasting, and it feels like I&#x27;m wearing cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the same - possibly better.</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;ve only used this one</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I got out of this</li>
            <li>The pump came off with the first use</li>
            <li>The price is great at Amazon and it came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>so I purchased this after researching several other products with great reviews.</li>
            <li>I have really been enjoying it and it makes my thick, wavy hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This hair product doesn&#x27;t smell like patchouli, but it has the same strong way of smelling that patchouli does.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended...but please buy the whole line because it all works together.</li>
            <li>It detangles really well.</li>
            <li>My hair gets greasy looking fast</li>
            <li>I like the cream very well</li>
            <li>My hair feels much softer and silky after use.</li>
            <li>this really softens my hair.</li>
            <li>So overall love love love and ill be buying again.</li>
            <li>and it gave it the perfect amount of weight without making it greasy or dirty feeling.</li>
            <li>The product really meets my expectation.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much to my hair.</li>
            <li>Wow, this whole line has changed my fine, limp and very damaged hair into a lovely and manageable new hair.</li>
            <li>and this one definitely has it&#x27;s upside and special needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first shampoo, conditioner and styling cream that has ever kept my wild hair from frizzing during our NJ summers.  </li>
            <li>is the only thing I have tried (plus very hot hairdrying)</li>
            <li>Unlike the straight Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried in the past this blends in smoothly with hair and is easy to wash out the next day.</li>
            <li>Finally I tried this product and it gives my hair enough texture without the top being flat, and my hair is super soft and wavy without feeling like it has any product in it whatsoever!</li>
            <li>Just use lightly, a dime size amount is all you need, and apply when wet.</li>
            <li>, you simply pump it out, rub it between your hands and put it into moist or freshly shampooed hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this everyday since my purchase and have yet to find a reason not to love it.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, you only need a little bit and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Bought this after a new haircut from a new hairdresser who used this.</li>
            <li>My long wet hair doesn&#x27;t have any tangles after putting this in that don&#x27;t smooth right out with a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to be careful with the oil to get the right amount as too much can make it look oily and</li>
            <li>It held for over 20hrs (12hr night shift plus all day errands the next day) on the first try out.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sometimes self conscious about using because of this reason.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and beacuse my individual hair strands are finer as opposed to coarse/thick, I&#x27;m prone to frizzies.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, silky and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>but it comes out soft</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>My hair is sleek, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I keep my hair natural never pressed.</li>
            <li>This makes your hair soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and silky and the scent is not over-powering.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Got the whole line of One N Only Argan Oil...</li>
            <li>I have thick, naturally wavy/curly (depending on its mood) hair that often ends up frizzy, even when I straighten it (which is most of the time).  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product and all of the One N Only argan oil products  </li>
            <li>Pros: one bottle lasts forever, affordable, applies well, light feeling, no residue, can be used on either dry or wet hair, noticeably smooths hair and fights the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>I shower every day but washing the natural oils out of your hair is bad and because of that I have great looking hair - anyway....)</li>
            <li>my hair is very soft and not as coarse.</li>
            <li>No other products used.</li>
            <li>I often flat iron it and occasionally have it blown straight.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and non-greasy and does not make my hair sticky or hard.</li>
            <li>The smell actually doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if you are sensitive to smell you may want to avoid this</li>
            <li>I received a small bottle of this as a sample and will be buying a full bottle when it runs out.</li>
            <li>You can smooth a little onto dry hair if you have curls to define.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I tried a few which did the trick for the most part of holding in the curl, but blow drying my hair upside down</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp, thin, coloured hair (how&#x27;d I get so lucky)?</li>
            <li>I use this sparingly, keeping it away from my roots, usually applying it from the ears down (which is where most of the damage occurs).</li>
            <li>It real helped to keep down my frizz and helped it have alot of body.</li>
            <li>These reviews really let my expectations down.</li>
            <li>I just wash it and put this in and let it dry naturally</li>
            <li>hair has a natural curl to it if left to dry on</li>
            <li>I have purchased many hair products in the past, mostly at my local Walgreens with a few more expensive exceptions.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>Just a little really makes a difference in my hair.</li>

            <li> Smells very nice as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a good example</li>
            <li> I might try the curl cream, but this is really good.</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of good times growing up</li>
            <li> The product is good but the packaging wasn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li> Smells delightful and works against humidity to smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, best for damaged and short curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been more satisfied with a hair product from all aspects, weight, texture, scent, its awesome.  </li>

            <li> This is an amazing styling cream.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair is snooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Kind of a spicy vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels and smells and gives my hair nice shine.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and I use it anytime</li>
            <li> After experimenting, I knew I liked argan oils for moisture and creams over gels.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> It tames frizz, adds shine and keeps my hair nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have used the oil before and loved it - it does better keeping my frizz under control.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Nice for hair but</li>
            <li> but boy does it smell,  a nice smell, but very strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a very strong floral smell.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and thought this would make it feel fuller, it does not.</li>
            <li> the best so far, I love it.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty strong but pleasant, kind of a spiced vanilla.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I like this one better for pre-flat ironing or braid-outs for waves or curling with an iron, and</li>
            <li> impressed and won&#x27;t switch back.</li>
            <li> and I love everything about it</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has never been this healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this product on my straightened hair for a week now, and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Moroccan oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;LOVE, LOVE</li>
            <li> , Love it</li>
            <li> It is a potent smell.</li>
            <li> I think this smells floral and exotic.</li>
            <li> Love this smoothing product.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and so much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My hair is a lot smoother, silkier, and more manageable bc of this product.</li>
            <li> And I always get compliments, about how my hair smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t look as damaged as I make it sound.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, when I apply to damp hair before I roller set it</li>
            <li> One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Styling Cream is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> i realy love this product</li>
            <li> Makes my hair more manageable and shines.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> My hair looks more polished and &#x27;finished&#x27; when I use this product than when I blow-dry without it.</li>
            <li> Love this styling cream.  </li>
            <li> I love putting on my hair after I wash and condition it.</li>
            <li> love this product and it was delivered asap</li>
            <li> My hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of hair products.</li>
            <li> Love this styling creme..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a perfume.  </li>
            <li> Love it not greasy.</li>
            <li> The more I do this, the more I feel the need to add products in order to keep moisture and add to hair control.</li>
            <li> Very nutty and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Goes best in wet towel-dried hair, and be sure to rub the product over your palms and through your fingers so you don&#x27;t get globs of it in one spot when your hands touch the hair.  </li>
            <li> This product smells great, incorporates into hair nicely and provides good hold without any hard stiffness</li>
            <li> It is good if you have straight hair not curly.</li>
            <li> Great product super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> When I took them out I had fantastic bouncy curls and great volume, very soft.</li>
            <li> the smell is way too strong.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance as it is not overpowering and the rich cream leaves a sheen, yet is light in weight.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I works fine</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to put a huge amount of it in your hair to work.</li>
            <li> But I enjoy how this makes my hair looks and feels, so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll eventually overlook that.</li>
            <li> No frizzies and smooth to the touch without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> no greasy no oily really great product for daily use.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or heavy feeling,  not to mention it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> that keeps it smooth and under control.  </li>
            <li> Light styling cream, with a light hold.  </li>
            <li> When I style my hair it gives me light hold.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Probably good for any curly hair--leaves hair soft, but somewhat defined curls.</li>
            <li> I used a flexible hair spray for more hold because this doesn&#x27;t exactly hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth and then some!</li>
            <li> I also used it on dry hair looked great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> huge plus with this product is my hair doesn&#x27;t look super greasy after using it.</li>
            <li> Product is great and it smells amazing , it adds shine and protects the hair especially if you apply heat so I might order again in the future</li>
            <li> Honestly, the smell reminds me of old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and stays nice looking all day.</li>
            <li> I suppose most product performances are really going to vary from person to person based on hair types and what you&#x27;re trying to do with them/</li>
            <li> Better than much pricier products.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the oil or the oil spray.  </li>
            <li> fragrance is a bit strong at first, but it fades as your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is more damaged than the rest of you guys I always use a little more than the suggested amount which is ok.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly musky smelling, which is a scent I usually tend to avoid.</li>
            <li> I prefer a bit more hold to my styling cream (but not stiff or greasy looking-</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it reminded me of old ladies, but more like an incense shop.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own devices for anyone with similar hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it is not heavy on the hair nor does it have any build up like some products.</li>
            <li> my hair has never felt more soft or looked shinner.</li>
            <li> Plus I live in a humid climate, so most days my hair is pretty unruly.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try it on a day when I wear my hair au natural...but based on what how much smoother and softer and bouncy</li>
            <li> Shipped right away.  </li>
            <li> This keeps it smooth pretty much throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have used Bumble and Bumble cream in the past but now prefer this one - and Amazon has a great price.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, easily made frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much,</li>
            <li> Some people love it, but I find it is strong, long lasting, and it feels like I&#x27;m wearing cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the same - possibly better.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve only used this one</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I got out of this</li>
            <li> The pump came off with the first use</li>
            <li> The price is great at Amazon and it came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this after researching several other products with great reviews.</li>
            <li> I have really been enjoying it and it makes my thick, wavy hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This hair product doesn&#x27;t smell like patchouli, but it has the same strong way of smelling that patchouli does.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended...but please buy the whole line because it all works together.</li>
            <li> It detangles really well.</li>
            <li> My hair gets greasy looking fast</li>
            <li> I like the cream very well</li>
            <li> My hair feels much softer and silky after use.</li>
            <li> this really softens my hair.</li>
            <li> So overall love love love and ill be buying again.</li>
            <li> and it gave it the perfect amount of weight without making it greasy or dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> The product really meets my expectation.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much to my hair.</li>
            <li> Wow, this whole line has changed my fine, limp and very damaged hair into a lovely and manageable new hair.</li>
            <li> and this one definitely has it&#x27;s upside and special needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first shampoo, conditioner and styling cream that has ever kept my wild hair from frizzing during our NJ summers.  </li>
            <li> is the only thing I have tried (plus very hot hairdrying)</li>
            <li> Unlike the straight Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried in the past this blends in smoothly with hair and is easy to wash out the next day.</li>
            <li> Finally I tried this product and it gives my hair enough texture without the top being flat, and my hair is super soft and wavy without feeling like it has any product in it whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Just use lightly, a dime size amount is all you need, and apply when wet.</li>
            <li> , you simply pump it out, rub it between your hands and put it into moist or freshly shampooed hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this everyday since my purchase and have yet to find a reason not to love it.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell, you only need a little bit and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this after a new haircut from a new hairdresser who used this.</li>
            <li> My long wet hair doesn&#x27;t have any tangles after putting this in that don&#x27;t smooth right out with a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with the oil to get the right amount as too much can make it look oily and</li>
            <li> It held for over 20hrs (12hr night shift plus all day errands the next day) on the first try out.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sometimes self conscious about using because of this reason.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and beacuse my individual hair strands are finer as opposed to coarse/thick, I&#x27;m prone to frizzies.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, silky and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> but it comes out soft</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> My hair is sleek, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I keep my hair natural never pressed.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and silky and the scent is not over-powering.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.  </li>
            <li> Got the whole line of One N Only Argan Oil...</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy/curly (depending on its mood) hair that often ends up frizzy, even when I straighten it (which is most of the time).  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product and all of the One N Only argan oil products  </li>
            <li> Pros: one bottle lasts forever, affordable, applies well, light feeling, no residue, can be used on either dry or wet hair, noticeably smooths hair and fights the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I shower every day but washing the natural oils out of your hair is bad and because of that I have great looking hair - anyway....)</li>
            <li> my hair is very soft and not as coarse.</li>
            <li> No other products used.</li>
            <li> I often flat iron it and occasionally have it blown straight.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and non-greasy and does not make my hair sticky or hard.</li>
            <li> The smell actually doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if you are sensitive to smell you may want to avoid this</li>
            <li> I received a small bottle of this as a sample and will be buying a full bottle when it runs out.</li>
            <li> You can smooth a little onto dry hair if you have curls to define.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I tried a few which did the trick for the most part of holding in the curl, but blow drying my hair upside down</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp, thin, coloured hair (how&#x27;d I get so lucky)?</li>
            <li> I use this sparingly, keeping it away from my roots, usually applying it from the ears down (which is where most of the damage occurs).</li>
            <li> It real helped to keep down my frizz and helped it have alot of body.</li>
            <li> These reviews really let my expectations down.</li>
            <li> I just wash it and put this in and let it dry naturally</li>
            <li> hair has a natural curl to it if left to dry on</li>
            <li> I have purchased many hair products in the past, mostly at my local Walgreens with a few more expensive exceptions.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Just a little really makes a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> and this really helps tame it, especially on humid &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> would look so flat while the bottom of my hair would get frizzy and bigger.</li>
            <li> only long enough until it dries on the hair.</li>
            <li> It takes very little, to much will make your hair feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I used to use gel and wash and blow dry daily, and the gel would help me get volume but left my hair looking and feeling crunchy.</li>
            <li> No doubt in my mind that this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> separate sections of very nearly dry hair, apply moderate amt of cream and roll into pillow or sponge rollers before bed and let set during sleep.</li>
            <li> It is good for curly hair because it does not have a lot of build up, which i HATE; This product is a definite buy.</li>
            <li> One reviewer said a little bit old ladyish.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is slightly wavy, but I blow it straight just about everyday.</li>
            <li> I put this product in my hair every day before I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> And then blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have what&#x27;s generalized as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair (silky texture, long, not thin or thick) and look for something that gives a little moisture and soft hold (nothing mega stiff).</li>
            <li> First off I have thick curly dry damaged hair because I had colored my hair the previous year and always used Gel and hairspray and other products that were high in alcohol, leaving my hair hard dry amd crunchy.</li>
            <li> I wanted flexible hold without that crunchy feel when you use gel on wet hair and don&#x27;t dry it with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair and this product has helped me cut down on my blow dry and flat ironing time!  </li>
            <li> I used this product, and it made my hair poofy-huge and very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, dry, thick hair, and was hoping for moisturizer that will define my curls and give them weight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier feeling than my lighter weight forumla version, but it also has a little bit of styling product in it which makes it work differently.</li>
            <li> (Not much hold, just tames frizz.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on wet hair and dryed</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time styling it.</li>
            <li> The cream itself moisturizes for a few minutes but then oddly enough my hair is frizzier/dryer than before I put it on.</li>
            <li> Wanted a moisturizer with sheen; it leaves a residue that dulls.</li>
            <li> Not really for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of their oil because it doesn&#x27;t have enough weight to tame my curly frizz, but this does the job.</li>
            <li> I have dry and fizzy hair, it doesn&#x27;t hold down my hair as i wish and not shine as they claim.</li>
            <li> I love this product line, but am disappointed with styling cream.</li>
            <li> It is not too oily, like other leave-in conditioning products, I even used it as hand moisturizer once while on vacation (forgot my hand cream).</li>
            <li> I even tried it with my usual product and still left it fuzzy.</li>
            <li> my hats a little dry</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is often hard to tame</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use and helps keep my thick, curly hair under control.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair</li>
            <li> My hair is above my shoulders and its thick and curly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, nor leaves a greasy feel too it.</li>
            <li> A very small pea size works wonders in my short length hair.</li>
            <li> After using another brand of Morracan hair cream I switched to Argan oil because it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, healthier, and yes, less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Does the job of keeping down frizz without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I live overseas and found the shipping fees plus pricey MO cream too expensive</li>
            <li> Does leave little build up, or just heaviness (from oil) after couple of days.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have naturally curly, dry, thick hair, and was hoping for moisturizer that will define my curls and give them weight. I used this product, and it made my hair poofy-huge and very dry. Not the outcome I was looking for.</li>
            <li> For anyone out there trying to get 360 waves this is a Excellent product for that and it also has a amazing smell best I ever smelt so now I&#x27;m looking for a body wash that smells like it lol I&#x27;m a guy btw so it smells kinda manly for anyone wonding</li>
            <li> I switch between this and another product of a similar type (L&#x27;oreal Everpure) and this one definitely has it&#x27;s upside and special needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I love the smell. Kind of a spicy vanilla scent. If it smells bad in another way, send it back; it&#x27;s gone rancid from age or heat. The oils in it will then be sticky and gross.  I had a bottle like that, and it was terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It detangles really well. My long wet hair doesn&#x27;t have any tangles after putting this in that don&#x27;t smooth right out with a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Goes best in wet towel-dried hair, and be sure to rub the product over your palms and through your fingers so you don&#x27;t get globs of it in one spot when your hands touch the hair.  You can smooth a little onto dry hair if you have curls to define.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It&#x27;s heavier feeling than my lighter weight forumla version, but it also has a little bit of styling product in it which makes it work differently. I like this one better for pre-flat ironing or braid-outs for waves or curling with an iron, and the lighter weight Everpure one for every-day air dried hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff-great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dedicated and obsessed with Moroccan Oil cream for years; but bc I live overseas and found the shipping fees plus pricey MO cream too expensive, I tried this cheaper product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally impressed and won&#x27;t switch back. It works exactly the same - possibly better.</li>
            <li> Probably good for any curly hair--leaves hair soft, but somewhat defined curls. (Not much hold, just tames frizz.) Does leave little build up, or just heaviness (from oil) after couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY thing I use now.</li>
            <li> Product is great and it smells amazing , it adds shine and protects the hair especially if you apply heat so I might order again in the future</li>
            <li> Pros: one bottle lasts forever, affordable, applies well, light feeling, no residue, can be used on either dry or wet hair, noticeably smooths hair and fights the frizzies.  Cons: It really only has one...the smell. Some people love it, but I find it is strong, long lasting, and it feels like I&#x27;m wearing cheap perfume. It is incredibly musky smelling, which is a scent I usually tend to avoid. Honestly, the smell reminds me of old lady perfume. But I enjoy how this makes my hair looks and feels, so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll eventually overlook that. I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> this stuff does a great job as a styling cream but boy does it smell,  a nice smell, but very strong. i&#x27;m sometimes self conscious about using because of this reason.</li>
            <li> I have been using the One N Only argan oil for about 6 months and I love everything about it so when I saw that they made a styling cream I had to buy it. I was not disappointed!!! I have long hair that is slightly wavy, but I blow it straight just about everyday. I put the cream in (1 pump)right before I blowdry it (after towel drying). My hair is soft, shiny and stays nice looking all day. FYI : I have not used regular shampoo for about 18 months - I use either Hair One or Lisa Rachel (both in the argan oil versions) My hair has never been this healthy and manageable. I HIGHLY recommend this product and all of the One N Only argan oil products  - the price is good and they do what they say!</li>
            <li> I put this product in my hair every day before I blow dry.  I like the way it feels and smells and gives my hair nice shine.</li>
            <li> After using another brand of Morracan hair cream I switched to Argan oil because it&#x27;s half the price. It&#x27;s really no different. I have very curly hair and beacuse my individual hair strands are finer as opposed to coarse/thick, I&#x27;m prone to frizzies. NOTHING has helped the issue. Save your money. You&#x27;re only paying for the smell of this stuff...</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this hair product to me...I have thick, naturally wavy/curly (depending on its mood) hair that often ends up frizzy, even when I straighten it (which is most of the time).  So, I&#x27;ve been using this product on my straightened hair for a week now, and I LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve even had multiple people both at work and out on a weekend tell me how great my hair looks.  I am excited to try it on a day when I wear my hair au natural...but based on what how much smoother and softer and bouncy it&#x27;s been since using it on my straightened hair, I&#x27;m sure it will work great.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, wavy hair. I used to use gel and wash and blow dry daily, and the gel would help me get volume but left my hair looking and feeling crunchy. Finally I decided to start using a curling cream instead of a gel and I tried a few which did the trick for the most part of holding in the curl, but blow drying my hair upside down did not give any lift and the roots of my hair would look so flat while the bottom of my hair would get frizzy and bigger. Finally I tried this product and it gives my hair enough texture without the top being flat, and my hair is super soft and wavy without feeling like it has any product in it whatsoever! My hair also has hardly any frizz at the end of the day. I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Moroccan oil so when I bought some on Amazon as a gift for a friend I thought I would try the Styling Cream for myself. I have really been enjoying it and it makes my thick, wavy hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair. With this stuff my hair looks fuller, darker, healthier. No fiscal frizz. Thank you very much,</li>
            <li> This product repairs and makes your hair smell great, feel great and look great. I swear by this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE, LOVE, Love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. It&#x27;s simple to use and helps keep my thick, curly hair under control. I would definitely recommend. I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: lacks control</li>
            <li> I love this styling cream!  It smells wonderful, so good you want to eat it!  Very nutty and pleasant.  It works wonders on my hair, even color treated hair.  It leaves my hair soft, silky and lightweight.  No frizzies and smooth to the touch without feeling greasy.  This is my &amp;#34;Go to&amp;#34; hair product, I will never be without!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended a styling cream for what I wanted to do with my hair. I wanted flexible hold without that crunchy feel when you use gel on wet hair and don&#x27;t dry it with a blow dryer. It smooths fly aways so your hair does look perfectly in place. I used a flexible hair spray for more hold because this doesn&#x27;t exactly hold the hair in place. I&#x27;ve used it on wet hair and dryed it looked great. I also used it on dry hair looked great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge plus with this product is my hair doesn&#x27;t look super greasy after using it. My hair gets greasy looking fast and I was afraid cream would make it greasier even faster. My hair didn&#x27;t look greasy at all so I was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very strong floral smell. One reviewer said a little bit old ladyish. I wouldn&#x27;t say it reminded me of old ladies, but more like an incense shop. Here&#x27;s a good example I hate the smell of patchouli and even the slightest hint of it makes my skin crawl. This hair product doesn&#x27;t smell like patchouli, but it has the same strong way of smelling that patchouli does. It is a potent smell. I think this smells floral and exotic. The smell actually doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if you are sensitive to smell you may want to avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after wearing it in my hair for a couple of hours I didn&#x27;t notice the smell anymore. You also don&#x27;t have to put a huge amount of it in your hair to work. I use a dime size and only on the ends of my hair not the roots. I really liked this product and I use it anytime I want my hair to look great!</li>
            <li> Love this smoothing product. This is a re buy for me. Does the job of keeping down frizz without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair which has turned to wavy with age and can be difficult to style on a guy. This product smells great, incorporates into hair nicely and provides good hold without any hard stiffness</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance as it is not overpowering and the rich cream leaves a sheen, yet is light in weight. Could not ask for more!</li>
            <li> the best so far, I love it.  no greasy no oily really great product for daily use. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Kimd of makeS my hats a little dry.. but it comes out soft</li>
            <li> I love this product line, but am disappointed with styling cream. It gives some shine, but doesn&#x27;t control frizz or add any manageability to hair. Have to apply often to get any benefit.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a reasonable price! Works well in moisturizing dull, processed hair! I use this product in my beauty salon and clients love it!</li>
            <li> I like the cream very well, you simply pump it out, rub it between your hands and put it into moist or freshly shampooed hair. It goes in well and just seems to melt into the hair giving it a great luster, softness and shine.</li>
            <li> Bought this after a new haircut from a new hairdresser who used this. I have naturally wavy hair but this put curls in it I didn&#x27;t even know I had. My hair is softer and so much more hydrated. I just wash it and put this in and let it dry naturally and it comes out looking like I spent a lot of time styling it. I will definitely be using this product from now on</li>
            <li> Just a little really makes a difference in my hair. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair and this really helps tame it, especially on humid &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; days. My hair feels much softer and silky after use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, best for damaged and short curly hair. I am alternating it with the oil from same manufacturer for daily use.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve only used this one and I have to say this is the best product ever.  I applied a small pump amount and finger combed through my washed and towel dried hair, before blow drying and then straightening.  My hair is sleek, soft and shiny.  On day two (because I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, yes I shower every day but washing the natural oils out of your hair is bad and because of that I have great looking hair - anyway....) my hair looks and feels as good as day one!  Love it, love it, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has a natural curl to it if left to dry on it&#x27;s own devices for anyone with similar hair.</li>
            <li> Great product super fast shipping. AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> this really softens my hair. I keep my hair natural never pressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first shampoo, conditioner and styling cream that has ever kept my wild hair from frizzing during our NJ summers.  I love it</li>
            <li> My stylist just turned me on to this product.  I love it it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or heavy feeling,  not to mention it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing styling cream.  I have curly/wavy hair and this product has helped me cut down on my blow dry and flat ironing time!  No more frizzy hair.  I use it in conjunction with the Argon Oil hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Great transaction. Great styling</li>
            <li> I ordered the styling cream for my wife and received the curling cream my wife said it too thick and it just sits on the hair she hates it Im returning it</li>
            <li> I use this as a hair mask once a week. I works fine but I wouldn&#x27;t reorder</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t horrible but wasn&#x27;t for me. It reminded me of my mother or grandmother. The cream itself moisturizes for a few minutes but then oddly enough my hair is frizzier/dryer than before I put it on. Not for me.</li>
            <li> So I actually started using this product in PR while on vacation. When I came back to NYC I looked everywhere but didn&#x27;t find it. So thank God I found it on amazon. First off I have thick curly dry damaged hair because I had colored my hair the previous year and always used Gel and hairspray and other products that were high in alcohol, leaving my hair hard dry amd crunchy. This product has giving my hair the break that it needs. My hair is a lot smoother, silkier, and more manageable bc of this product. Since my hair is more damaged than the rest of you guys I always use a little more than the suggested amount which is ok. And I always get compliments, about how my hair smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t look as damaged as I make it sound. And the hair last me for 3 days. All I have to do is re-apply my ends and I&#x27;m out the door. So overall love love love and ill be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and I use it daily...smells great and it works.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  This makes your hair soft and shiney.  It takes very little, to much will make your hair feel greasy.  My hair is above my shoulders and its thick and curly.  I use am amount about the size of a nickel.</li>
            <li> I suppose most product performances are really going to vary from person to person based on hair types and what you&#x27;re trying to do with them/your specific needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This styling cream worked perfectly for me. After experimenting, I knew I liked argan oils for moisture and creams over gels. I have what&#x27;s generalized as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair (silky texture, long, not thin or thick) and look for something that gives a little moisture and soft hold (nothing mega stiff). That&#x27;s exactly what I got out of this (the hold was pretty excellent, actually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My styling method is as follows: separate sections of very nearly dry hair, apply moderate amt of cream and roll into pillow or sponge rollers before bed and let set during sleep. When I took them out I had fantastic bouncy curls and great volume, very soft. It held for over 20hrs (12hr night shift plus all day errands the next day) on the first try out. No other products used.</li>
            <li> Smells like my grandma.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Not oily but moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that will work perfectly on over processed hair.  I used it to tame the frizz on my hair and it gave it the perfect amount of weight without making it greasy or dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> the consistency is great. and the hold is medium which is perfect for my use. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product from a great seller.</li>
            <li> I received a small bottle of this as a sample and will be buying a full bottle when it runs out. I&#x27;m not a fan of their oil because it doesn&#x27;t have enough weight to tame my curly frizz, but this does the job. It makes the curls firm without being crunchy: think al dente pasta as opposed to celery. I might try the curl cream, but this is really good. I like the scent, it&#x27;s pretty strong but pleasant, kind of a spiced vanilla.</li>
            <li> i have bought this product twice now. I love that it is not heavy on the hair nor does it have any build up like some products.</li>
            <li> I have dry and fizzy hair, it doesn&#x27;t hold down my hair as i wish and not shine as they claim.</li>
            <li> It is good for curly hair because it does not have a lot of build up, which i HATE; This product is a definite buy.</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have puffy frizzy hair and one n only oil and styling cream is the only thing I have tried (plus very hot hairdrying) that keeps it smooth and under control.  You have to be careful with the oil to get the right amount as too much can make it look oily and too little doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiona</li>
            <li> Wanted a moisturizer with sheen; it leaves a residue that dulls. It does moisturize,&lt;br /&gt;but only long enough until it dries on the hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, when I apply to damp hair before I roller set it And then blow dry my hair. It real helped to keep down my frizz and helped it have alot of body.</li>
            <li> One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Styling Cream is an excellent product. It&#x27;s non-greasy and has great hold. Provocatively scented as well.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is often hard to tame but this stuff is awesome. I mix one pump with one pump of mousse. It tames frizz, adds shine and keeps my hair nicely hydrated. Love it! Recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and every evening.  Smells great and my hair is snooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> my hair has never felt more soft or looked shinner. came on time and without issue.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was too heavy for my hair. It left my hair looking greasy.I do not like the smell of it either.It will probably work well with coarse, curly hair. Mine has thinned and is curly.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel great and easy to control</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple of years now daily.  I&#x27;ve never been more satisfied with a hair product from all aspects, weight, texture, scent, its awesome.  This gives you the feeling of the second day after you wash your hair, I have to wash mine daily so this product gives me the extra manageability I need, and seems to control frizz too (and hubby loves the smell).  It is not too oily, like other leave-in conditioning products, I even used it as hand moisturizer once while on vacation (forgot my hand cream).</li>
            <li> excellent product, I recommend it, it is good quality and it is observed that is orginal. I loved it</li>
            <li> It is good if you have straight hair not curly. i found for curly hair it did not give it any shine.</li>
            <li> i realy love this product</li>
            <li> Seems to do well with my hair.  Light styling cream, with a light hold.  Shipped right away.  I prefer the oil treatment spray though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this product is supposed to do....I have very fine hair and thought this would make it feel fuller, it does not. I have put it in the closet and won&#x27;t be using it so my guess is it destined for the trash.  sorry</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of good times growing up and i suspect that this is why I had to buy it. I have used the oil before and loved it - it does better keeping my frizz under control. However, although the scent is the same, the cream doesn&#x27;t seem to work to keep the frizz under control. As I said, I would continue to purchase Argan Oil even if it is for the scent alone.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my store. I have coarse / frizzy hair. This keeps it smooth pretty much throughout the day. It is lightweight and non-greasy. Unlike the straight Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried in the past this blends in smoothly with hair and is easy to wash out the next day. Smells very nice as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and I have lots of frizzy fly-aways. Plus I live in a humid climate, so most days my hair is pretty unruly. This product - coupled with a bit of gel - brings my hair under control. Instead of frizzy and bushy, my hair is curly and glossy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a bit strong at first, but it fades as your hair dries. You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth and then some!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  It smells great and adds a bit of control to my hair.  I have used Bumble and Bumble cream in the past but now prefer this one - and Amazon has a great price.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair.  After I wash it I put this on my damp hair to give it extra moisture.  Makes my hair more manageable and shines.  One of my stables.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the packaging wasn&#x27;t as good.  The pump came off with the first use</li>
            <li> I usually use Davines cream, but since the price skyrocketed, I thought I&#x27;d try this since I do like Argan oil. It&#x27;s ok. Nothing spectacular. I prefer a bit more hold to my styling cream (but not stiff or greasy looking- which this fits that bill).</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp, thin, coloured hair (how&#x27;d I get so lucky)? Lots of products make my hair greasy after just one day. I use this sparingly, keeping it away from my roots, usually applying it from the ears down (which is where most of the damage occurs). It makes my hair soft and silky and the scent is not over-powering. When I style my hair it gives me light hold. My hair looks more polished and &#x27;finished&#x27; when I use this product than when I blow-dry without it. This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Love this styling cream.  It is smooth and non-greasy and does not make my hair sticky or hard.</li>
            <li> i have thick course hair that used to be hard to manage. Since i started using this product i can comb with ease and style.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and is not harmful to my hair at all. I love putting on my hair after I wash and condition it.</li>
            <li> love this product and it was delivered asap</li>
            <li> The product really meets my expectation. The price is great at Amazon and it came earlier than I expected. My hair looks lovely because of Argan Oil Styling !!</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  Not heavy.  Smells delightful and works against humidity to smooth hair. Better than much pricier products.</li>
            <li> Left my curly hair fuzzy and thin.  I even tried it with my usual product and still left it fuzzy.</li>
            <li> Not really for me. Didn&#x27;t do much to my hair. These reviews really let my expectations down. It&#x27;s not all that great.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been better. I love this brand of hair products. Just use lightly, a dime size amount is all you need, and apply when wet.</li>
            <li> Got the whole line of One N Only Argan Oil...Wow, this whole line has changed my fine, limp and very damaged hair into a lovely and manageable new hair. Love this styling creme..gives my hair shine,smoothness and body....that is hard to get from any styling product. Very highly recommended...but please buy the whole line because it all works together. The color is awesome too. Just sorry I didn&#x27;t find it sooner :))</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream, it smells wonderful, it softens your skin and I even use it on my hair.  I am on my second bottle.  Wish they had in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Nice for hair but the smell is way too strong.  It&#x27;s more like a perfume.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love it not greasy. ..moisturizes my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many hair products in the past, mostly at my local Walgreens with a few more expensive exceptions. Since I paid for them, I felt the need to use them despite their lack of results. My hair is fine, easily made frizzy and dry. I often flat iron it and occasionally have it blown straight. The more I do this, the more I feel the need to add products in order to keep moisture and add to hair control. I purchased this product based on a friend&#x27;s suggestion to try an Argan oil product. I wanted something non oily so I purchased this after researching several other products with great reviews. I have used this everyday since my purchase and have yet to find a reason not to love it. I works well with my hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, nor leaves a greasy feel too it. My hair does not darken nor look exceptionally shiny as some products will cause. I am not concerned with product transferring to my face when I perspire nor have I had any acne outbreaks from the possibility that some product did. My hair is softer, healthier, and yes, less frizzy. A very small pea size works wonders in my short length hair. I apply daily and I haven&#x27;t noticed any residue or build up of product in hair, but I do wash my hair about every 2-3 days. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair is very coarse.  I apply Argan oil styling cream after I wash it and leave my hair in a towel until I put my makeup on. When I go to style it my hair is very soft and not as coarse. Have used it for awhile.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the oil or the oil spray.  I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again.  Plus it was open was I received it.</li>
            <li> No doubt in my mind that this will last me a long time. It has a great smell, you only need a little bit and it goes a long way. Will rebuy once I run out.</li>
