            <li>Amazing razor and customer service.</li>
            <li>I use shave oil along with this product, and got amazing results.</li>
            <li>Great looking razor,awesome smooth shaves,I don&#x27;t use the blades that came with it,I use feather blades which I used before with another razor</li>
            <li>Works amazing.</li>
            <li>experience I&#x27;d say is amazing.</li>
            <li>but after that it is amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The handle seems to be of plastic, but there are no seam lines like in cheap moulded plastic, so I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li>I can already say that for $30, this package is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>the quality is amazing and the shave too</li>
            <li>I am an experienced safety razor user, and thought he&#x27;d enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It delivers an amazing close shave that I just didn&#x27;t get before.</li>
            <li>After inspecting the razor and accessories (fit and finish were great), I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>Amazing Product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
            <li>For a while I had a cheap razor kit, and it worked great until the plastic bits started warping and everything went out of alignment.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s amazing when I use the blades I already have.</li>
            <li>nice kit, fancy box</li>
            <li>It also makes a nice gift set.</li>
            <li>The kit is wonderful and everything is very well made.</li>
            <li>Really liked this set.</li>
            <li>the kind our parents and grandparents used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount price for my honest review but all opinions are my own</li>
            <li>This kit came with directions to website for tips (use it)  , a box of blades, a really good quality, sexy, sleek razor, a leather blade guard and a polishing towel.</li>
            <li>Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>Good investment and a stylish piece, almost like a conversation starter in my bathroom</li>
            <li>Good quality materials, the video instructions are quite good, and once you get used to using a safety razor, the shave is close and smooth.</li>
            <li>We received this safety razor kit in exchange for an honest review so here</li>
            <li>Has a nice, quality weight to the razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and smooth and works great.</li>

            <li>Also, there are etchings on the razor which add a nice touch of style.&lt;br</li>

            <li>It is the perfect kit for those who really want to shave like they used to.  </li>
            <li>The best part is it is so gentle on my skin, my shaving rashes reduced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the quality of the razor</li>
            <li>My advice would be to keep both handy.</li>
            <li>My husband is a barber and owns his own shop.</li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s the absolute best shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li>, I finished off with Clubman Pinaud after shave and felt like I just built a log cabin in the Frozen North with my own hands.</li>
            <li>Nicely constructed.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to do something nice for him</li>
            <li>He told me after he used it that it was a very close shave, one of the best he&#x27;s ever gotten.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Product provided for testing and review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>This kit is absolutely the best!  </li>
            <li>But I decided to give them a try anyway ... and to my surprise, it really was the best!</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, blows the mach 3 away.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by how fast it arrived and</li>
            <li>very nice, light pressure does the job</li>
            <li>However, Great and Clean shave with out any cuts.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great shave!</li>
            <li>The shave is closer and more comfortable than I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>With this however because of how beautifully it is designed I no longer have this issue, effectively eliminating the need to use a electric shave for the first pass, and then using a razor for that</li>
            <li>phantom razor shaveology sells is very classy looking and perfectly weighted.</li>
            <li>amazing looks way better in person than it does in the picture</li>
            <li>I got this and it saved me a lot of money and it is worth the money and the quality is great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>wow, packaging is simplistically wonderful.</li>
            <li>Impressed by the quality and classy look of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor looks really nice and safe to use.</li>
            <li>By far the best safety razor I have had!&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>A lot of nice extras on their web site to help you get the most from your razor and shaving experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve very impressed so far.</li>
            <li>However the included blades are excellent so far.</li>
            <li>Nice, close shave and can get more shaves out of one blade than with multiple-blade razors.  </li>
            <li>The razor blades are easy to change, easy to use and looks very nice.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s really enjoying his new razor set and very happy to have found it.</li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the nice thing also, the company provide 365 days of money back, which I found really impressive</li>
            <li>Starts with very nice packaging that let&#x27;s you know right away that this is a premium razor.  </li>
            <li>whole set came in very nice packaging, including promotional pamphlets with discount vouchers and a handy shaving guide for those not used to shaving with this type of razor.</li>

            <li>It comes with it own case and its pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>First off, the presentation/packaging was VERY nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice set and the first DE razor I have used.</li>
            <li>I also am a huge fan that they thought of providing the leather cover to ensure a safe way of storing the head with the razor enclosed!</li>
            <li>I will tell you it is sturdy, handles well, looks great, and comes with a large amount of instructions and resorces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far just looking at the packaging makes me think it&#x27;s very good quality.</li>
            <li>Everything included is high quality and beautifully crafted.</li>

            <li>I am incredibly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have had better shaves from this razor than any in my life.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have found that some attention needs to be paid to making sure you have the blade seated evenly as you tighten the handle</li>
            <li>enjoying this transition from the Gilette Mach3 that I&#x27;ve used for so many years.</li>
            <li>This is how I started shaving many moons ago.</li>
            <li>Thanx to Kenny and the people at Shaveology for making this a truly enjoyable learning experience.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how well qualified, or confident you are.</li>
            <li>I seemed to remember my electric doing a much better job, but then I hadn&#x27;t used it for 3 years, so</li>
            <li>I was extremely satisfied with the performance, it truly delivers the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>The package its delivered in is top notch as well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing better than this razor.</li>
            <li>Love the sleeve and towel.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get a stand to hold it vertically as well as your brush.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to watch the videos, as it does require a change in shaving technique-you can slice your face up if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>Much better than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>I think my boyfriend will absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>leather pouch is more of a blade guard than anything else.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome double edged razor set.  </li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t a one-use gift.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free (or a discounted price, whichever is applicable) in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine who wouldn&#x27;t love this.</li>
            <li>I find that the kit has most of what you need to get going.</li>
            <li>Now I had never used a safety razor before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>(there are razors alone that are $10-15 more than this</li>
            <li>I am better able to navigate my face without all the superfluous blades and it feels smoother on my skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set and you can get a 60 day supply of free blades after you receive it.</li>
            <li>So when I Decided to give this a try i fell in love with this razor.</li>
            <li>Plus side I work with nothing but ladies so they enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I love DE shaving ...</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this kit...</li>
            <li>The blades that come with it are ok.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the closest shave I have gotten since I began shaving many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Besides that I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased with this razor, both in style and ease of use and cleaning.  </li>
            <li>For most razors like the Edwin Jagger or the Merkur I would say to throw away the included blades...but not so for the Shaveology razor.</li>
            <li>this is better than that.</li>
            <li>Much better shave than store bought razor.</li>
            <li>The packaging is so classy..when you open the box - you just KNOW that a great quality product is waiting for you inside!</li>
            <li>My husband tried it and fell in love immediately.  </li>
            <li>then I went online to learn more, watch videos, etc.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had discovered THIS package last year for him - it is a PERFECT GIFT!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why stylish counts when you are by yourself shaving in the bathroom, but it does.</li>
            <li>OK, so you know how Shaveology asks the question: &amp;</li>
            <li>I can tell you he is getting a much better shave now.  </li>
            <li>I just started using a safety razor and love it</li>
            <li>so I was able to switch over to one of those mid-shave and finish without shredding my face.</li>
            <li>Buy a couple of different brands of blades to see what works best for you.  </li>
            <li>Was really pleased with the shaving kit and prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>I love the shave it gives and</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to shave with a razor, always just trimmed because of razor burn.</li>
            <li>I would but more from them based on the style and execution of this razor set.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this razor and his face has never looked better.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I absolutely love this safety razor.</li>
            <li>&amp; I really enjoyed shaving with it.</li>
            <li>The handle did loosen a bit as I was shaving, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li>Feels good in the hand, nice weight, overall good experience.</li>
            <li>It came with very nice packaging with polishing cloth, leather protector and 5 blades to get you started, along with another 60 days worth of blades for free from their website.</li>

            <li>I did receive this item in exhange for an honest and unbiased review - and that is exactly what you are getting.  </li>
            <li>The Shaveology Phantom series razor is hands down the best razor I’ve ever used.</li>
            <li>After looking around on Amazon, I narrowed it down to the best &amp;#34;bang for the buck, so I went with Shaveology.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best shave I&#x27;ve had in my life.</li>
            <li>Good product once you get used to the new way of shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and cheap to swap blades.</li>
            <li>the blades are cheap and easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Got to my house quick, love the way it shaves but watch the video on how to shave with it its a bit tricky.</li>
            <li>And my hair seems to grow slower because of the super close shave!</li>
            <li>Good choice for anyone who is looking for a classic clean shave.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, easy to clean and the replacement razors are cheap.</li>
            <li>cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way to go, in my experience, though I keep looking for new tips, is to wash my beard area with a mild face soap (Aveno foaming cleanser is good) and warm water while I soak the brush in a separate cup of hot water.</li>
            <li>and I always end up with rash right after shaving but with this shaver it doesn&#x27;t happen, very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>You can buy 100 blades for $10 so the savings are huge</li>
            <li>Not only a great price for a safety razor, but they send 5 blades, and have a free offer for another 5 blades.</li>
            <li>The wet shave by Shaveology is a great solution and glad to be using it.</li>
            <li>but the sample blades feel cheap.</li>
            <li>addition of the leather head cover is fantastic and I&#x27;ll be holding on to it for use when I</li>

            <li>smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize a man&#x27;s face could get this smooth-</li>
            <li>After just two shaves I learned how to use it without getting cuts and the free e book that comes with this razor</li>
            <li>It would be a GREAT father&#x27;s day present.</li>
            <li>and it really is a nice break from the fast and furious shaving done in the shower.</li>
            <li>Came fast and nice packaging.</li>

            <li>I forgot to mention, Shaveology also offers tutorial videos online, but to be honest you could get better videos on Youtube.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on good razors and what sold on this old the guarantee</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>

            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>and hopefully it looks and performs nearly as well as this razor (the logo on top is beautiful and a very classy touch)</li>
            <li>With this razor it forces you to take your time, and make sure the job is done right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been completely happy so far and very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor is presented nice, but when I went to install a blade the top would barely unscrew.</li>
            <li>This shave is so smooth and clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any razor burn.</li>
            <li>I gotta say I&#x27;m pretty pleased, smooth as can be and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the concern Shaveology showed in making sure I was satisfied with my product and that I fully understood the technique and material used in a traditional wet shave.</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; look with new feel...this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Easy and quick to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and good quality overall.  </li>
            <li>The Shaveology Safety Razor was nothing short of providing an amazing shave!</li>
            <li>Definitely not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This is not my first safety razor but I will tell anyone who asks, you will not find a better razor at this price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stick to the original.</li>
            <li>When this kit arrived in the mail, he was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I purchase the Safety Razor set for about $30, which is 70% lower than what is listed at the original price.</li>
            <li>Strop from the top of the razor and forward as we don&#x27;t want to shave the denim ;)</li>
            <li>I am so excited</li>
            <li>And am completely sure that you will want to share your experience as soon as you used the first couple times, just like I did.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I was reminded to leave a review when signing up for a (free) 60-day supply of razor blades.</li>
            <li>My first safety razor and I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>i love this thing, takes a min to get used to the style and angle, and nicking yourself is invulnerable the first time when used to the cartridges, but it&#x27;s the closes</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Loving the product so far, and they&#x27;re even offering 60 days of free razors after a purchase.</li>
            <li>Inly design flaw is the completely smooth handle, it gets super slippery if your hands have soap on them.</li>
            <li>Simply put, the shave is close, the blades are cheap and the product is superior to cartridge shavers.</li>
            <li>Not only was it an awesome &amp; classy gift but</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used the razor once and it gave an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After considerable research, I purchased the Shaveology set hoping it would deliver a great shave at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Either way it was a super thoughtful gift idea.</li>
            <li>This razor has amazing build quality for a very modest price.</li>
            <li>It is nice looking, well thought out with the cloth and leather razor cover, and though I&#x27;ve just used it once, it performs even better than my old razor (one that was advertised by the pawn shop guy on tv and was my first safety razor).</li>
            <li>Best double edge razor i own, see since i am a barber i gone thru a lot of double edge razors and straight razors.</li>
            <li>he used it right away and loves it!</li>
            <li>My husband is hard to shop for, but I looked for the best product I could find.</li>
            <li>I would love to see this product manufactured here in the states, but I will admit this product is very high quality.</li>
            <li>It is a good solid razor.</li>
            <li>Very sleek and elegant.</li>
            <li>I suggest watching their videos as you will learn so much and get a much better shave, they explain how to angle it and all.</li>
            <li>It is such a good value for everything you get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice old school shave.</li>
            <li>I will be evaluating it very close from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>With the phantom, you unscrew the whole top to place in a rzor.</li>
            <li>Looks cool as well</li>
            <li>Thanks shaveology for making your product available!</li>
            <li>I have only used the razor for a couple of days but it already seems like a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels like a better shave, and the product is very quality</li>
            <li>just cause I love it so much, even though I doubt I would ever need it.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I&#x27;m really loving this razor.  </li>
            <li>Hope they come out with a matching stand because I think it would look cool in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that it came with extra blades and a leather cover to protect the head of the razor as well.</li>
            <li>The real bonus for me was the fact that the owner of the company called me two weeks after I bought this to make sure that the product arrived well and to get my feedback.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and smooth after each shave with Shaveology.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very durable and elegant looking razor.</li>
            <li>Which is never a bad thing.</li>
            <li>Takes more time, but a much more luxurious experience (and much cheaper!!!) than traditional blades and creams.  </li>
            <li>This also makes a great gift idea and with the holidays right around the corner, I&#x27;ll be picking up a few more.</li>
            <li>The razor has a nice chrome and black handle, and the head of the razor has a nice engraving with the mustache-and-crown logo of Shaveology.</li>
            <li>nervous to use at first but after awhile its easy to get the hang of</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a cool, unique but useful gift.</li>
            <li>seems fine so far, cheaper and better quality shave then the pop-off head or disposable types.</li>
            <li>Works great without clogging up and appears to be extremely well made.</li>
            <li>To achieve a great shave, you need a sharp blade.</li>
            <li>But for a few $$ more it is definitely a superior razor.</li>
            <li>Definitely worthy of gift</li>
            <li>It is extremely comfortable and provides a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Super fancy looking in the Shaveology box.  </li>
            <li>You get a closer, smoother shave, far fewer nicks and ingrown hairs, and shaving with it feels more precise.</li>
            <li>Works great, don&#x27;t plan to ever go back to modern fancy blades.</li>
            <li>I was not even able to open the top to place a razor in.  </li>
            <li>When he was at school I got a quick shave in with it to see what the fuss was all about.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Now, when you get ready to shave with this razor make sure you tighten it tight after you put the blade in, This is a great razor, Just be warned everybody gets cuts here and there, even with a non-aggressive razor</li>
            <li>The razor is presented in an elegant package that you&#x27;d see at a high end department store.  </li>
            <li>The razor really does provide a very good shave and the included blades are quite sharp.</li>
            <li>This provides a good shave and the blades are cheap and extremely sharp.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My wife even comments on how smooth my face has gotten thanks to this razor!</li>
            <li>This safety razor set makes such an amazing and unique gift for any man in your life.</li>
            <li>To that end, I first ordered an electric razor, primarily because my grandfather always used them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Build quality is good and I expect to use this razor for a long time.</li>
            <li>Well, after trying two electrics I came to the conclusion that they were more trouble than they were worth and didn&#x27;t leave me with good results.</li>
            <li>it feels very cheap and not anywhere NEAR the price it should be!</li>
            <li>I originally got this for my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day gift (such a unique gift!), but when it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t keep the surprise!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing this safety razor at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Very much enjoying the new razor</li>
            <li>I thought, I&#x27;d better buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I love my new razor.</li>
            <li>The blades that come with it are pretty good too, although i do prefer different ones.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and until using this razor I have never been able to shave against the grain without wicked razor burn and the bumps and ingrown hairs that come along with it.</li>
            <li>Started using this razor last week and man I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>The razor has an extremely nice and comfortable weight, I only nicked myself once out of my first time using a razor like this (i&#x27;m used to the crappy disposable gilette razor).</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m going to watch the videos that train on how to use it just because I&#x27;m so interested in learning now too after I read all these reviews!</li>
            <li>There was no irritation on my skin and after shaving a 3 day beard, which on this mug is a challenge for the Fusion, these Shaveology blades cut like a hot knife through butter - so keep your 30 degree angle integrity!  </li>
            <li>Opened it up, excited since its my first razor like this to find out it looks like it was used or already damaged with a razor already mounted.</li>
            <li>gift was very well received!!  </li>
            <li>I personally use the blades that came in the box but also bought some feather blades and those also work phenomenally!</li>
            <li>My legs are SMOOTH, not a single cut either :)</li>
            <li>It is heavy, solid, easy and does a great job on the shave!</li>
            <li>You get a sleek looking razor that is capable of giving a fine, close shave.  </li>
            <li>a great product so far, appreciate the extra mile with tutorials and free blades, and overall a very enjoyable shaving experience, much more so than a regular razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great advantage is if you are like me and don&#x27;t shave every day, your beard tends to grow out a little bit.</li>
            <li>They give a great shave, but do take a little getting used to to not cut yourself (although they are safety blades</li>
            <li>My husband is tough to buy for and this was perfect</li>
            <li>I really excited when the razor arrived, because all I had seen was positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I feel we have gotten to comfortable living with the mentality that everything needs to be fast and convenient.</li>
            <li>and I think being calm and patient helped as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve had more compliments on this set than anything else in my apt (no joke... or maybe that&#x27;s a sad statement on the rest of my apt, haha)&lt;br</li>
            <li>After much homework, I came across this beauty and saw the fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li>Works amazing, we will definitely be sticking with it.</li>
            <li>Good balance and easier to use than expected.</li>
            <li>but it is well built and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So Far I am satisfied with the product (I used it three</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growin a full beard for about four months and the blade went through it like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>Is worth it.</li>
            <li>Also I decided to give it a try on my legs more out of curiosity and WOW.</li>
            <li>The shave is excellent, I can actually hear it gliding across my face, but there is absolutely no discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed it so far</li>
            <li>and I rarely need aftershave when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Be sure to check out the materials Shaveology offers to help you get started.</li>
            <li>Had my doubts but thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>and you will get your $$ worth.</li>
            <li>It takes practice and patience, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Shaveology team.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver and it shaves better than my 5 blade shaver blade and much closer believe it or not this has been my experience with this shaver and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kids now have a nice present for their dad and it isn&#x27;t something he&#x27;ll like and use.  </li>
            <li>The closest shave .. Feels fresh out the barbershop</li>
            <li>but I have to say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny, thank you:-}</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>#34;&amp;#34;Are you ready for the best shave of your life?&amp;#34; - well, I thought for 29.95 that there had to be at least SOME marketing hype in that question.</li>
            <li>This is my first single blade razor and have to say it was a good choice</li>
            <li>First time user so watch quick video and use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used disposable razors, straight razors, and as of now safety razors and I can say I&#x27;ve never had a shave so effortless, clean (as far as residue and hairs sticking to the face) and confident then with this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used disposable razors, straight razors, and as of now safety razors and I can say I&#x27;ve never had a shave so effortless, clean (as far as residue and hairs sticking to the face) and confident then with this razor.</li>
            <li>Super classy and comfortable shave at a VERY reasonable price!</li>
            <li>if I made the right decision</li>
            <li>but after 2 or 3 times I realized I made the right decision.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working finding the right shaving soap to use and learning about how to not cut myself.</li>
            <li>The Razor has the right balance.</li>
            <li>The blade is nice and sharp too and he feels like he stepped out of the barber after using it, its a unique gift for a guy.</li>
            <li>Even after rinsing under the faucet, when I took it apart to clean ( like in their video ), I was amazed at how much of the soap was on the blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great shave, this product delivers the results of a straight edge razor, basically the modern version of a straight edge razor that reminds me of my grandpa shaving back in the day.</li>
            <li>His grandfather always used a safety razor so it gave him more than just a great shave, but also took him back to a great memory of watching his pappo&amp;uacute;s shave while trying to teach my husband how with his broken funny English.</li>
            <li>typically get 2 shaves out of each blade, but I am sure you could get a lot more, however in my opinion as inexpensive as blades are for these razors why not just change them each time you shave?</li>
            <li>the past I have had a great deal of skin irritation and razor bumps using electric and disposable razors...</li>
            <li>The packaging is pretty fun too.</li>
            <li>I somehow came across this, not really sure how, and it just looked great to me</li>
            <li>I am able to get precise and clean shaves in half the time.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is evident in its weight and construction right off the bat and this gift set includes 5 blades, a microfiber cloth and a case.</li>
            <li>It is really simple to use and the clean up is easy</li>
            <li>I love the old school styling with modern flair.</li>
            <li>Good deal for less than 35.00.&lt;br /&gt;Art of shaving razors start at 100.00</li>
            <li>/&gt;Razor fits snug and does not move&lt;br /&gt;Clean shave with minimal drag and perfect</li>
            <li>Nice looking product but single blade shaving just isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>His face is smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Got the razor very fast as promised.  </li>
            <li>The weight of the razor allows it to cut without applying a lot of pressure to the handle and this I found to be very very helpful to avoid cuts and bruises.&lt;br /&gt;User</li>
            <li>and it was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a safety razor for a long time now finally made the decision on buying the shavolgy razor based on reviews shipped fast came in a nice box set up very well nice weight</li>
            <li>It had a black, &amp;#34;fatter&amp;#34; design (which I&#x27;m sure my ex would like) and offered superior protection between my skin and the blade (like the protection I should&#x27;ve used with my ex), so I was able to glide past my Adam&#x27;s apple and chin with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Forget the cartridges, save money, pick up a new hobby and get excited about shaving again.</li>
            <li>Figured I would try something new and its been completely worth it!</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products that I get online because I am a very busy person, but I am so happy with my new razor that I got from shaveology and am glad I did this smart investment.</li>
            <li>The shave is VERY close, very comfortable, and I love the feel of the heavy duty metal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but there is a certain lustre that stainless steel has.</li>
            <li>I gotta say I was pretty excited to try new shaving system like this after years of using Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li>My first time using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>and I also just had my first shave....</li>
            <li>Today was my first shave using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>After opening the box up we were both pleased with the overall quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Shaveology really delivered!</li>
            <li>my belief is it can only get better.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it</li>
            <li>Make sure you watch the videos on how to use the razor properly, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li>HAHA!  </li>
            <li>This kit is a nice start for anyone interested in trying a safety razor, or a seasoned wet shaving pro.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for sending the 60 days complimentary blades.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor shaving experience.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a safety razor and chose this one based of the reviews.</li>
            <li>love the double edge!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using a safety blade</li>
            <li>I shaved with a Gillette safety razor from the first time I shaved till in my 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so I bought my first electric razor, a Norelco.</li>
            <li>First off this is Mr. Leah Montgomery</li>
            <li>Also, not going to lie, it feels pretty manly to use a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>First ever buying a razor like this.</li>
            <li>First couple shaves and I&#x27;m hooked, no razor burn and no paying out the ears for razors.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor</li>
            <li>I settled on this as my first razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first experience with a safety razor and will be my last.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have been shaving my head for 2.5 years now and have tried many different razors and soaps/cream/gels over that time.  </li>
            <li>This old school razor is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Using this razor not only makes it enjoyable but also gives me the closest shave I have ever achieved without irritation.</li>
            <li>Once you open the box, it gets even better.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this type of razor</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I received a reply within 15 min from a real person!</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t used this yet, however looking forward to the first shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It is chrome plated, and it&#x27;s noticeable when you first look at the finish.</li>
            <li>The product showed up liking exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My first shave was without any nicks, cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li>With the first couple of times taking a bit longer.</li>
            <li>Also my skin was irritated the first 2 times I used it.</li>
            <li>Like others, I struggled a bit with the safety razor at first.</li>
            <li>More people should take the plunge and do the same.</li>
            <li>I got the Shaveology Razor set about a week ago, and I just took my first shave with it tonight</li>
            <li>Thanks Shaveology!</li>
            <li>Just got it in the mail today, and tried it out for the first time.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks, I&#x27;m still on my first blade and haven&#x27;t had any razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for the son of a friend leaving the nest for the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally used this safety razor and wow felt so smooth that I asked every co-worker I saw to feel my face.</li>
            <li>It provides a close and consistent shave everytime.</li>
            <li>It has much more of a barbershop feel than the traditional plastic razor handles I was used to.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to seeing more products from this company in the future.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>the razor looks pretty.</li>
            <li>I bought this Shaveology razor for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>It definitely has given me one of the closest shaves, better than any of those 5 blade systems I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>the price I payed, I can&#x27;t imagine higher value.</li>
            <li>The future, no cuts or razor burns,  it made a fan of my husband for sure.</li>
            <li>Very well made!</li>
            <li>First: the shaver..</li>
            <li>Learn your form first, then upgrade, or you will slice your face off, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give a lot of first hand information because I bought this for my husband.  </li>
            <li>When I received it it was a pretty razor, but no matter what blade I put in it, it shaved like the handle of a butter knife.</li>
            <li>, this is the first razor that would not shave .</li>
            <li>Hot towl, shave balm, and some hand made shave soap; it&#x27;s truly the royal treatment.</li>
            <li>Get the best shave every time and you save money compared to those expensive replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>No razor burn, sharp razors, clean shave, does it get any better?</li>
            <li>If you really want to do it right, you will need to buy a shave brush and either shave soap or lather.</li>
            <li>If you want to shave and feel like a true gentleman than I definitely recommend Shavology as your first choice in keeping your looks clean.</li>
            <li>You can instantly tell if you have the angle right or not, and the shave was close and easy.</li>
            <li>You can instantly tell if you have the angle right or not, and the shave was close and easy.</li>
            <li>A good double edge blade is very sharp, so it requires caution, but gives the closest shave save for perhaps a straight edge (which I have yet to learn properly or purchase a good one).</li>
            <li>Again, this was my first experience with a DE safety razor, but it was extremely positive.</li>
            <li>The blades are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>My husband is extremely picky on what kind of product goes into his business for resale to his customers.  </li>
            <li>I rinse my face with warm water and lather my neck, shave across one way (ear to ear), then rinse, lather and repeat the other way.</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying it a few more times to get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>Really good service/delivery as well (received a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34;-guide almost instantly and the Shaveology-set followed within only a couple of days).</li>
            <li>shave is like no other shave I have ever had, my face is baby smooth when I am done shaving.</li>
            <li>is the first time I have ever used a single blade safety razor and with a little practice it soon became very easy to get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Less is more!</li>
            <li>Recommend buying one with a long handle if this applies to you, if not then you will love it.</li>
            <li>He used it for the first time last night after carefully watching the informative videos that Shaveology has posted, which is an important step to get the most optimal results as it tells you how to adjust the tension on the razor blades just right and how to use the razor itself.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why I was so scared of it because though there were couple of nicks, it was mostly drama free.</li>
            <li>I also thought the razor itself  black- looked really nice.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say that as a GIRL having spent most of my life shaving 2/3 of my body I know that which razor you choose makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Luckily, Shaveology.co offers instructional videos for safety-razor neophytes.</li>
            <li>Really solid and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a cool starter kit with AMAZING blades called Baili but there are two drawbacks for me which forced me to get another razor.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely fantastic to see that there are still genuinely good quality reliable American small businesses.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the feel of my fiance&#x27;s face after he shaves with his new Shaveology Double Edge Safety Razor Set!  </li>
            <li>Mine is built very well and came quick and professional.</li>
            <li>The razor cuts just fine through my facial hair.</li>
            <li>Very high quality shaving blades.</li>
            <li>Nice little starter kit.</li>
            <li>Then, I shake the brush a little to get it to stop dripping, and use it to get a nice soap lather in the cup.</li>
            <li>Just received my razor today, the packaging is first class I felt as if I was opening a high end razor.</li>
            <li>cloth was of the sort to which dust readily clings, meaning that you can use it not only for polishing and drying the safety razor, but for cleaning your glasses, or in fact any glass which must remain dust free.</li>

            <li>The short handle can be forgiven but the smooth coating on the handle was just too much.</li>
            <li>thanks shaveology.</li>
            <li>Very premium</li>
            <li>The video is very helpful</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but it really is effortless shaving.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>but they all seem to have really slender handles too.  </li>
            <li>Really like it, 5 star</li>
            <li>so well.. the blade is lose.. really lose.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a quality double-edge razor.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>absolutely looks</li>
            <li>It performs really well too.</li>
            <li>some people might like it... but not that much for me...</li>
            <li>and I believe she said it was really a gift for the women in their lives...</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone that wants to give safety razors a try.</li>
            <li>My husband often gets razor rash on his neck and switching the razor every week has really helped.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>cause his barber uses a straight blade to touch it all up</li>
            <li>Its very well balanced, fits and handles well in my hand.</li>
            <li>so it takes longer to shave than with a modern cartridge razor.</li>
            <li>It feels like I&#x27;m holding something solidly made, something of quality instead of a cheap piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>I used the provided shaveology blades and got a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I gotta say I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>Balanced very well.</li>
            <li>The blades are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>Very helpful and eager to please.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor,  </li>
            <li>Very close shave on beard and head.</li>
            <li>the middle part of the handle broke free and spun in place.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>But to start this off, the packaging and tools included in the kit are very well made.</li>
            <li>Again, I will write a follow up review once I get a chance to really use the razor.</li>
            <li>I really like that there is a video to watch that covers how to put together, use and how to maintain this razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Response to the comment was fast, but no email received.</li>
            <li>He used to shave with the store bought razors and compares this razor to shaving with a light saber and the store bought ones he used before to a wooden spoon!</li>
            <li>He said that he didn&#x27;t want a straight blade razor</li>
            <li>He really wanted the brush and shave soaps to use</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves them..</li>
            <li>HIGH quality!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razors I recieved were Baili &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; stainless steel blades, numbering 5 which came in a custom Shaveology bag.</li>
            <li>I think it is important for them to both know the importance of the holiday (his birthday and Christmas too) and not skip present giving just because we aren&#x27;t together.  </li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband as a gift and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I cant believe how much money I was wasting  on 3x blades</li>
            <li>He considered a straight edge but thought that jump was a bit much.</li>
            <li>so I will try to put a follow up review real soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a reason men used to shave with a straight razor...</li>
            <li>The razor provides a very close shave and has made it</li>
            <li>They were very helpful.</li>
            <li>Made very well</li>
            <li>While the razor is lighter the shaving experience has been much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you buy those fancy multi blade razors, ask you really get for your money</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really recommend using this razor and giving it as a gift since the kit is so aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this gift set by Shaveology.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will shave as expected.</li>
            <li>I like the Feather brand for a really smooth feel, but I&#x27;d suggest starting with the blades the kit comes with,</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave from it.  </li>
            <li>He emailed me today to let me know how much he likes the razor and suggested that I order another for our father&#x27;s upcoming 60th birthday...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone from disposable to dollar shave club to straight razors and now to the Shaveology safety razor</li>
            <li>I used to own a Merkur safety razor -- ended up losing it, and got the itch to go back to this style of shaving recently.</li>
            <li>The razor feels sturdy and solid, with just enough weight to be effective.</li>
            <li>Few employers are going to hire someone with the kind of beard I had (think Zack Galfanalkis in The Hangover).</li>
            <li>It was definitely heavier than my old Gillette (since it wasn&#x27;t mostly plastic).</li>
            <li>I cut myself more with a safety razor quite frequently because it&#x27;s only one blade.</li>
            <li>He is thrilled with it, and although I didn&#x27;t use it personally, I have examined it closely and it appears to be solid and as weighty as it should be.</li>
            <li>The included blades are very smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li>When I received my first razor from shaveology the head and handle did have some difficulty screwing together, however, when I contacted shaveology about the matter they responded very promptly, apologized for the inconvenience, and sent me an entirely new kit.</li>
            <li>I purchased for my husband and all I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Several weeks later and my legs look fantastic and I have also significantly reduced the amount of money I was spending.</li>
            <li>My first thought after shaving with my new Shaveology Razor, is don&#x27;t let her shave her legs with it, or it will be gone too.</li>
            <li>As good as any other razors that are double the cost.</li>
            <li>I settled with this one due to reviews and that it came with a razor guard which is good for travel, and that it came with extra razors.</li>
            <li>and I have a nice clean shaven look without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>and you have dedicate some time to it every morning, more so than other shaving  methods.</li>
            <li>Survived the first shave, and wow!</li>
            <li>Our other shavers would pull the hair and swipe many times.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many other things besides razor</li>
            <li>I have used it for many other things besides razor</li>
            <li>I would recommend reading the other reviews which give more details on how to shave with this type of razor either here on amazon or youtube.</li>
            <li>I am getting better shaves for a fraction of the cost of other multi blade cartrige razors.</li>
            <li>opening and closing heads on the razor (screw on design is MUCH better than other clamping safety razors.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on my technique (during my first shave with this razor, I actually had to shave three times to get a close shave, but my second shave went much better).  </li>
            <li>I think its a great system,  I am new to wet shaving or should I say returning to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to take it apart to clean / change</li>
            <li>I love this shaver, there was a bit of a learning curve when I first started using it, but after watching some of the tutorial videos and given myself a few shaves</li>
            <li>One blade that is angled properly, easy to keep dry and replace, and infinitely cheaper will serve you just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I always wanted to go back to the good old days of a single blade safety razor</li>
            <li>They do such a good job because they&#x27;re so sharp!</li>
            <li>He told me it was a double edge safety razor and that these old school razors really give an amazing close shave, especially these days and the way they are made.</li>
            <li>To a certain extent, any razor of this design with the right angles and ease of use will fit the bill, but shaveology has really stepped it up with extra quality blades, a drying cloth and simple, high quality, travel</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the high quality packaging that this razor arrives with.</li>
            <li>Shaving with this Shaveology was very new experience for my husband</li>
            <li>That being said, I have been using the razor for the past month, and the shave is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice for first time wet shaver or long time vet.</li>
            <li>It was a nice razor but too small for my hands.</li>
            <li>The first thing I have to say about this product is wow.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever safety razor and I was pleasantly surprised when I received this for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>What I found was a super clean, tight shave.</li>
            <li>On my first pass, this razor easily cuts through my stubble, but I find it more difficult to cut against the grain.</li>
            <li>I assumed it would be cheaply made possibly out of plastic or some other cheap material</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to clean as opposed to our other razors where you have to constantly apply water or hit it to get the clogged hair out.</li>
            <li>I love the weight of it and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to repeatedly go over areas that I&#x27;ve shaved, the blades are very sharp and efficient.</li>
            <li>Shaving with a double edge razor feels more simple.</li>
            <li>Luckily you can find quality blades at low prices if you do your research.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;d say it shaved better than those expensive 5-blade razors that are more lubed up than my ex bent over the bed.  </li>
            <li>This kit looks nice, but I&#x27;m afraid the micro touch is better bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>My husband was super nervous about trying this Double Edge safety razor set for his weekly shave, but he loves when he gets a hair cut</li>
            <li>Had it for only few days but works really good.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good wet to get you started into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>This set is classic masculinity in a box.</li>
            <li>I normally don’t write reviews, but I was over at my friend’s house last week when I saw this really cool looking box called Shaveology on his counter</li>
            <li>Instead of shaving cream, I used: &amp;#34;Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap &amp;#34; (read the reviews on it in Amazon and you&#x27;ll see why) and finished things off with Clubman Pinaud Classic Vanilla</li>
            <li>Too many people over tight and brake razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the razors that came with it, I bought a pack of 100 Personna razors and I highly recommend those as well.</li>
            <li>High quality materials and finish.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All of the parts seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>The razor is made out of truly high quality metal, and has a pristine leather handle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.uses before wearing out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone just getting started with safety</li>
            <li>You get everything you need for a double-edge razor shave that is high quality and will save you hundreds of dollars every year.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like feeling like a highly respected gangster from the 1920&#x27;s while your getting for the day or night.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for any man in your life.</li>
            <li>The razor seems to be a high quality razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>High quality razor.  </li>
            <li>My opinion is that  this is a high quality, nice safety razor kit for a fraction of the price of other kits in the same class quality!</li>
            <li>Assembling the razor was very easy and took no more than 30 seconds to figure out.</li>
            <li>Costs a little more than some others brands</li>
            <li>Wow is this a value!!</li>
            <li>Love the little towel they give you to lay out all your stuff on.</li>
            <li>Great razor, a little shorter than average though</li>
            <li>This razor seems very well made, and I&#x27;d be surprised if it ever broke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been spending far too much money on cartridge razors over the years.  </li>
            <li>I have had terribly sensitive skin my whole life.  </li>
            <li>It seems very well made it has that wow factor.</li>
            <li>I just bought this after my old safety razor broke, and I really like this kit.</li>
            <li>I got my blood work done and the doctor said my testosterone levels were 100,543 times the normal level.</li>
            <li>Plus being able to change the razor everyday for about $30 a year.</li>
            <li>Having used both for the past two years, I can&#x27;t really say which is better.</li>
            <li>Normally a cartridge razor guy, my preference was the Gillette Fusion multi-blade,</li>
            <li>its worth the short adjustment period.</li>
            <li>Normally that would cost some stars, but I already had a pack of &amp;#34;Astra&amp;#34; brand blades that I know work well</li>
            <li>After using the razor for a few months, I really love the shave and equipment.</li>
            <li>I was a little intimidated by the whole process, but the shaveology kit comes with easy instructions.</li>
            <li>But after several shaves, I have my routine down and am loving the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let it speak for itself, if you&#x27;re on the fence I strongly recommend giving it a try especially since it&#x27;s backed by a 100% satisfaction/money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the barber straight razor blade, normal gillette razors, and other similar razors for men, but this was the most sharp and smooth shave of them all.  </li>
            <li>Despite the loose handle making it a bit tedious to use, the shave is excellent.</li>
            <li>The razor provides a smooth, extremely close shave.  </li>
            <li>The razor&#x27;s sturdiness screams quality craftsmanship; the razor blades cut so sharply and smoothly</li>
            <li>After using multiple blades that are overly expensive for years I found this set to be very good.</li>
            <li>I like this new razor.  </li>
            <li>So I came home ,showered, oiled my face, creamed up using a brush and tried my new shaveology kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this type of shave.</li>
            <li>It brings a new level of sophistication to shaving.</li>
            <li>I just finished using my new shaveology razor</li>
            <li>Even getting used to the feel of a new razor, no nicks, yet.....</li>
            <li>After completing the new routine, I now know the reason for the dis-assembly of the razor.</li>
            <li>Look forward to the coming new products.</li>
            <li>I received my new kit within 4 days and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>New shaving technology doesn&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and if you are new to safety razors, don&#x27;t start with the feather blades.</li>
            <li>While poking around different websites and book (including Art of Manliness and Real Men for Real Style)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no secret that safety razors and straight razors are making a big comeback among hipsters and \\&quot;manly men\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I had been having trouble getting a nice close shave with regular disposable razors and, on the advice of a friend, decided to try a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Especially easy to get that straight line on my sideburns which is absolutely impossible with a multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and a friend recommended I try a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very close and clean shave with little to no irritation, every time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using Shaveology&#x27;s safety razor (with the exact same blades I&#x27;ve been using with the Merkur), it didn&#x27;t nick me once.  </li>
            <li>This is my second safety razor, the first one was the Razor One, I had for 11 months and it broke.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this Shaveology Saftey Razor and the breakouts went away COMPLETELY!</li>
            <li>but the handle is smaller than most other razors (gillete, etc.)</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>First the handle was too short for my tastes</li>
            <li>It is an extremely comfortable shave and I will not look to any other blade to get the job done!</li>
            <li>The actual razor is really sturdy and made of high quality materials.  </li>
            <li>He said the blades were very sharp and I can agree that the Shaveology combo provides a close smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be forewarned though, this is a new shaving experience and don&#x27;t be surprised when you cut yourself.</li>
            <li>Everything old becomes new again.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new razor since my old standby disposable manufacturer has changed their &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; which in turn meant they changed the razor.  </li>
            <li>With typical razors this poses a huge problem for me as the hair gets caught between the blades and no amount of rinsing helps.</li>
            <li>The second I was done shaving, I instantly sprouted a full beard.</li>
            <li>After dumping lots of money into Schick Quattro blades for several years and getting consistent razor burn, I recalled my vacation to India years ago where I&#x27;d get old school barber shaves without post blemishing.  </li>
            <li>The Shaveology Razor was much heavier than I expected it to be and of much higher quality.</li>
            <li>He has extremely thick hair and grows facial hair witching a couple days, this razor makes his skin very smooth and no cuts!</li>
            <li>In fact I sometimes bought the plastic throwaway single blade razors and was not unhappy with those.  </li>
            <li>Its a good solid instrument, sturdy should last to past along to my grandson.</li>
            <li>This safety razor saves a lot of money, but I have more control with a cartridge-based razor and am less likely to cut myself.</li>
            <li>If you believe certain corners of the internet, switching to a safety razor is nothing short of life-changing.</li>
            <li>The upfront cost is a little more but the replacement blades cost next to nothing.  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous because of the potential for more cuts.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a little bit of nostalgia when it comes to shaving back like they used to?  </li>
            <li>Shaving with the double edged safety razor is not complicated, at all, and my husband was extremely surprised he only had to make one pass with the razor, and said it was the closest shave he has ever achieved; he has used both high end disposable and electric razors.</li>
            <li>Looking toward to a complete kit from them.</li>
            <li>I have been battling my whole life to find and learn a solid shaving system and products.</li>
            <li>Plus I feel like an old school &amp;#34;Mans man&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>old blade was a Merkur.  </li>
            <li>I have been a member of Dollar Shave Club, used Gillette razors and everything far in between.</li>
            <li>he has sensitive skin and finds that these razor works well and does not leave his skin irritated.</li>
            <li>off, you can NOT use the same amount of force you do with those razors - this blade is much sharper and  you will cut yourself all over the place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the shave is so close and lasts longer than my old Harrys razor.</li>
            <li>My son being young couldn&#x27;t wait to give his gift to dad</li>
            <li>so we let him have it early.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a ready to give present.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to the a stand and brush for a complete set.</li>
            <li>To put it simply, classy set for the price.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Phantom set because it reminded me of my old Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>a couple days early, as Leah stole my old safety razor after shaving her legs with it.</li>
            <li>So far this one has held up well.</li>
            <li>They completely went away as soon as I started using quality products.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing like the old school way of shaving.</li>
            <li>To screw it back on I had to grip the razor on the very bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li>So, I dusted off my old norelco rotary electric shaver, and said goodbye to my furry friend.</li>
            <li>The Shaveology came very well package, with a head cover, polishing cloth and five individually wrapped blades.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Always wanted to try the old school shave.</li>
            <li>I can make several passes on the same spots and not worry at all about nicking myself like with disposables, and the shave is much faster then with straight razors.</li>
            <li>I can make several passes on the same spots and not worry at all about nicking myself like with disposables, and the shave is much faster then with straight razors.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how close of a shave I got and without the loss of blood.  </li>
            <li>and I no longer get the nicks/cuts and my sensitive skin is thankful for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still use cartridge razors, but I don&#x27;t have to buy them as frequently.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>so my eye naturally attracts to well-done packaging so I was intrigued.</li>
            <li>find that the shave I get from this is equal to that of my straight razor, but it also decreases the possibility of razor burn or cuts.  </li>
            <li>but once again, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The phantom is a classy razor, and the kit they you get for 29.95 is a steal!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I completely, without reservation, recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Far surpasses Gillette or Schick.</li>
            <li>Just threw away my old razor wont ever use it again.</li>
            <li>but after a few uses the finish on the top plate corner looks like it is starting to wear off.</li>
            <li>I would say about 75% just on the first shave and for the second shave I barely felt or noticed any discomfort from rashes or razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I always bought the Gillette fusion razors because of the extra blade on the back for right under my nose...</li>
            <li>Lifting this heavy razor out of the case feels right, and should raise your testosterone levels straight away.</li>
            <li>One tip that he said was helpful was to apply a really warm wash cloth to his face for a few minutes prior to shaving to open the pores up, which allows for the closest shave possible; you could also achieve this by taking a hot shower prior to shaving.</li>
            <li>I get a very close and clean shave, I never cut myself, and of all the razors I&#x27;ve ever used this combination irritates my skin the least.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for every man, especially those with particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Quality is decent and should last a while.</li>
            <li>I have fast growing man hair and it comes in full and thick like a man -  </li>
            <li>The razor looks really nice, not cheap or like it will wear down.</li>
            <li>I cut myself a few times (very minor) the first time I used it, the second time I got better, by the third shave I was a pro.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend watching the Shaveology safety razor video and following their advice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice and potentially useful thing to have though, especially if you&#x27;re travelling with your razor as it can keep it from cutting other things in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Support got back to me in a couple days and shipped me a brand new kit which had no issues.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a different type of Father&#x27;s Day gift for my hubby and after unproductively googling &amp;#34;gifts for men&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;unique gifts&amp;#34;, I remembered an episode of Live with Regis and Kelly</li>
            <li>Overall, if you were new to a product like this like I was, go to their website and watch some of the how-to videos.</li>
            <li>Definitely returning to try and get a NEW one.</li>
            <li>It comes with some very sharp razor blades that provide such a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>It would only go about half a turn, and even after using a towel it would not go nearly far enough to secure the blade -- let alone</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth the extra minutes spent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as two sided, single blade safety razors go, this one is of particularly high value for the money.</li>
            <li>That might be the biggest compliment a product like this can get, especially coming from a seasoned barber that knows good razors from bad ones.</li>
            <li>I had a little irritation, but I&#x27;m sure that was due to my technique, or lack thereof.</li>
            <li>I ended up replacing it with Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>I got this for a unique gift for my husband to try, who has a heavy and coarse beard.</li>
            <li>Next, I apply a nice lather to my still-wet face, set the brush back in the cup (it will be used again), and shave my cheeks down, then across (from ear to nose/mouth) then down my neck.</li>
            <li>My husband has always had a hard time with a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided to dive in headfirst with this specific razor because of the high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand to everyone, male or female.</li>
            <li>It cut the stubble with almost no pull left a smooth shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The results aren&#x27;t anything spectacular, and I&#x27;ve cut myself pretty badly each time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>, i had spent my whole life using the multi-blade gilette fusion  (or its predecessors) and therefore, had no clue</li>
            <li>talking barely a shadow at 5pm</li>
            <li>but i also feel i can go an extra day without shaving with this (as opposed to my old razor)</li>
            <li>razor burn (which happens to him no matter what because he has such sensitive skin) but</li>
            <li>3 peice safety razors are old school, but not everyone knows how to install properly.</li>
            <li>In fact, 24 hours later, is about the length I was at by 10AM with my old shave.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t spent much time shaving with this razor</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t go back to your old razor after you have tried this.</li>
            <li>this is still definitively the complete shaving set for any man with facial hair.</li>
            <li>this is still definitively the complete shaving set for any man with facial hair.</li>
            <li>i think ive ever had next to a professional barber.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, I was surprised by the weight and overall quality of the razor.</li>
            <li>I am naturally prone ingrown facial hairs and razor burn, but ended with neither after shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>But so far these last!</li>
            <li>He is old enough to remember learning how to shave on this type of razon &amp;#34;these</li>
            <li>, just know that the more aggressive the razor, the closer the shave, thus the worse the cuts.</li>
            <li>So I think if you are just starting out, or are just needing a new razor, this is a solid product</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, and I might later down the road when I have the money to invest in sharper blades, but the ones that come in the kit aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much on shavers from double bladed to five bladed shavers only to enjoy the shave for a few hours before the irritation would start to break out and would never get such close shave as I did with this shaver.</li>
            <li>There are so many advantages to buying a razor like this, for instance the blades are ridiculously inexpensive, I just ordered a pack of 100 blades for under $15!</li>
            <li>Be careful to not press hard like with cartridges, letting the weight of the razor do the work, and take short strokes when in tighter or more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>cannot really compare this razor to any other razors out there, but I can say that I did get a close shave and the razor</li>
            <li>Other than that i would  highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I started hearing about this via social media, the Art of Manliness blog, and friends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would say it took about three tries, to go gentle enough, but once i did...</li>
            <li>With the rising cost of traditional razors and their cartridge refills, my dad has recently expressed interest in trying an old fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old and have been using various (COSTLY) Electric razors and equally costly multi-blade cartridge razors all of my post adolescent life..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little lighter than his other razor, but the quality is still fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was new to the world of the art of traditional shaving when I made this purchase, it did not take me long to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I have medium sized hands and the razor handle is too short for comfortable use which caused my hand to cramp.</li>
            <li>used it at first few months...</li>
            <li>I have never been contacted before by a reseller on Amazon and the fact that I gave him my opinion on it, he offered me a coupon for half off on the stainless steel stand they are about to come out with.</li>
            <li>I have been using a straight razor that utilizes replaceable safety blades that you brake in half, but as the handle was wearing out, it was time to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I was always suspicious that I was not getting as close a shave with four (yikes!!) blades as opposed to the old single style I grew up with, but</li>
            <li>but I do wish it was just a little longer because I have large hands.  </li>
            <li>So anytime I was in a rush to shave, I was almost certain it would end with me having little trails of blood flowing around my Adam&#x27;s apple</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to, but I really like it now.  </li>

            <li> Amazing razor and customer service.</li>
            <li> I use shave oil along with this product, and got amazing results.</li>
            <li> Great looking razor,awesome smooth shaves,I don&#x27;t use the blades that came with it,I use feather blades which I used before with another razor</li>
            <li> Works amazing.</li>
            <li> experience I&#x27;d say is amazing.</li>
            <li> but after that it is amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The handle seems to be of plastic, but there are no seam lines like in cheap moulded plastic, so I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li> I can already say that for $30, this package is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> the quality is amazing and the shave too</li>
            <li> I am an experienced safety razor user, and thought he&#x27;d enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It delivers an amazing close shave that I just didn&#x27;t get before.</li>
            <li> After inspecting the razor and accessories (fit and finish were great), I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Amazing Product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
            <li> For a while I had a cheap razor kit, and it worked great until the plastic bits started warping and everything went out of alignment.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s amazing when I use the blades I already have.</li>
            <li> nice kit, fancy box</li>
            <li> It also makes a nice gift set.</li>
            <li> The kit is wonderful and everything is very well made.</li>
            <li> Really liked this set.</li>
            <li> the kind our parents and grandparents used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount price for my honest review but all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> This kit came with directions to website for tips (use it)  , a box of blades, a really good quality, sexy, sleek razor, a leather blade guard and a polishing towel.</li>
            <li> Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Good investment and a stylish piece, almost like a conversation starter in my bathroom</li>
            <li> Good quality materials, the video instructions are quite good, and once you get used to using a safety razor, the shave is close and smooth.</li>
            <li> We received this safety razor kit in exchange for an honest review so here</li>
            <li> Has a nice, quality weight to the razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and smooth and works great.</li>
            <li> liked the way the Gillette razor opened up when I turned the bottom.</li>
            <li> Nice build quality</li>
            <li> ITS REALLY EFFECTIVE PRODUCT.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Would Absolutely Recommend this Set to Anyone looking for a great product or gift!</li>
            <li> Also, there are etchings on the razor which add a nice touch of style.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve held off shaving for 3 days to see what kind of power this baby has.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect kit for those who really want to shave like they used to.  </li>
            <li> The best part is it is so gentle on my skin, my shaving rashes reduced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the quality of the razor</li>
            <li> My advice would be to keep both handy.</li>
            <li> My husband is a barber and owns his own shop.</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s the absolute best shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> , I finished off with Clubman Pinaud after shave and felt like I just built a log cabin in the Frozen North with my own hands.</li>
            <li> Nicely constructed.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to do something nice for him</li>
            <li> He told me after he used it that it was a very close shave, one of the best he&#x27;s ever gotten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Product provided for testing and review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> This kit is absolutely the best!  </li>
            <li> But I decided to give them a try anyway ... and to my surprise, it really was the best!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, blows the mach 3 away.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by how fast it arrived and</li>
            <li> very nice, light pressure does the job</li>
            <li> However, Great and Clean shave with out any cuts.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great shave!</li>
            <li> The shave is closer and more comfortable than I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> With this however because of how beautifully it is designed I no longer have this issue, effectively eliminating the need to use a electric shave for the first pass, and then using a razor for that</li>
            <li> phantom razor shaveology sells is very classy looking and perfectly weighted.</li>
            <li> amazing looks way better in person than it does in the picture</li>
            <li> I got this and it saved me a lot of money and it is worth the money and the quality is great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> wow, packaging is simplistically wonderful.</li>
            <li> Impressed by the quality and classy look of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor looks really nice and safe to use.</li>
            <li> By far the best safety razor I have had!&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> A lot of nice extras on their web site to help you get the most from your razor and shaving experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve very impressed so far.</li>
            <li> However the included blades are excellent so far.</li>
            <li> Nice, close shave and can get more shaves out of one blade than with multiple-blade razors.  </li>
            <li> The razor blades are easy to change, easy to use and looks very nice.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s really enjoying his new razor set and very happy to have found it.</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the nice thing also, the company provide 365 days of money back, which I found really impressive</li>
            <li> Starts with very nice packaging that let&#x27;s you know right away that this is a premium razor.  </li>
            <li> whole set came in very nice packaging, including promotional pamphlets with discount vouchers and a handy shaving guide for those not used to shaving with this type of razor.</li>

            <li> Nice weight allows for easy shaving</li>
            <li> It comes with it own case and its pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> First off, the presentation/packaging was VERY nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice set and the first DE razor I have used.</li>
            <li> I also am a huge fan that they thought of providing the leather cover to ensure a safe way of storing the head with the razor enclosed!</li>
            <li> I will tell you it is sturdy, handles well, looks great, and comes with a large amount of instructions and resorces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far just looking at the packaging makes me think it&#x27;s very good quality.</li>

            <li> I have found that some attention needs to be paid to making sure you have the blade seated evenly as you tighten the handle</li>
            <li> enjoying this transition from the Gilette Mach3 that I&#x27;ve used for so many years.</li>
            <li> This is how I started shaving many moons ago.</li>
            <li> Thanx to Kenny and the people at Shaveology for making this a truly enjoyable learning experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how well qualified, or confident you are.</li>
            <li> I seemed to remember my electric doing a much better job, but then I hadn&#x27;t used it for 3 years, so</li>
            <li> I was extremely satisfied with the performance, it truly delivers the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> The package its delivered in is top notch as well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s nothing better than this razor.</li>
            <li> Love the sleeve and towel.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get a stand to hold it vertically as well as your brush.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to watch the videos, as it does require a change in shaving technique-you can slice your face up if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Much better than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I think my boyfriend will absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> leather pouch is more of a blade guard than anything else.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome double edged razor set.  </li>
            <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t a one-use gift.  </li>
            <li> I received this product for free (or a discounted price, whichever is applicable) in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine who wouldn&#x27;t love this.</li>
            <li> I find that the kit has most of what you need to get going.</li>
            <li> Now I had never used a safety razor before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> (there are razors alone that are $10-15 more than this</li>
            <li> I am better able to navigate my face without all the superfluous blades and it feels smoother on my skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set and you can get a 60 day supply of free blades after you receive it.</li>
            <li> So when I Decided to give this a try i fell in love with this razor.</li>
            <li> Plus side I work with nothing but ladies so they enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I love DE shaving ...</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this kit...</li>
            <li> The blades that come with it are ok.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the closest shave I have gotten since I began shaving many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Besides that I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with this razor, both in style and ease of use and cleaning.  </li>
            <li> For most razors like the Edwin Jagger or the Merkur I would say to throw away the included blades...but not so for the Shaveology razor.</li>
            <li> this is better than that.</li>
            <li> Much better shave than store bought razor.</li>
            <li> The packaging is so classy..when you open the box - you just KNOW that a great quality product is waiting for you inside!</li>
            <li> My husband tried it and fell in love immediately.  </li>
            <li> then I went online to learn more, watch videos, etc.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered THIS package last year for him - it is a PERFECT GIFT!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why stylish counts when you are by yourself shaving in the bathroom, but it does.</li>
            <li> OK, so you know how Shaveology asks the question: &amp;</li>
            <li> I can tell you he is getting a much better shave now.  </li>
            <li> I just started using a safety razor and love it</li>
            <li> so I was able to switch over to one of those mid-shave and finish without shredding my face.</li>
            <li> Buy a couple of different brands of blades to see what works best for you.  </li>
            <li> Was really pleased with the shaving kit and prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li> I love the shave it gives and</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to shave with a razor, always just trimmed because of razor burn.</li>
            <li> I would but more from them based on the style and execution of this razor set.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor and his face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I absolutely love this safety razor.</li>
            <li> &amp; I really enjoyed shaving with it.</li>
            <li> The handle did loosen a bit as I was shaving, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> Feels good in the hand, nice weight, overall good experience.</li>
            <li> It came with very nice packaging with polishing cloth, leather protector and 5 blades to get you started, along with another 60 days worth of blades for free from their website.</li>
            <li> The razor is very well made and the packaging is very nice.</li>
            <li> For shaving large swaths of skin this type has no rival, and for this price this product has the greatest value unless you are looking for an exact style or product.</li>
            <li> For shaving large swaths of skin this type has no rival, and for this price this product has the greatest value unless you are looking for an exact style or product.</li>

            <li> I strongly recommend this excellent Shavelogy double edge safety razor!!</li>
            <li> This is a very clean cut shave.</li>

            <li> After looking around on Amazon, I narrowed it down to the best &amp;#34;bang for the buck, so I went with Shaveology.&amp;#34</li>

            <li> cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way to go, in my experience, though I keep looking for new tips, is to wash my beard area with a mild face soap (Aveno foaming cleanser is good) and warm water while I soak the brush in a separate cup of hot water.</li>
            <li> and I always end up with rash right after shaving but with this shaver it doesn&#x27;t happen, very smooth shave.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize a man&#x27;s face could get this smooth-</li>
            <li> After just two shaves I learned how to use it without getting cuts and the free e book that comes with this razor</li>
            <li> It would be a GREAT father&#x27;s day present.</li>

            <li> I forgot to mention, Shaveology also offers tutorial videos online, but to be honest you could get better videos on Youtube.</li>

            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it looks and performs nearly as well as this razor (the logo on top is beautiful and a very classy touch)</li>
            <li> With this razor it forces you to take your time, and make sure the job is done right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been completely happy so far and very much</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor is presented nice, but when I went to install a blade the top would barely unscrew.</li>
            <li> This shave is so smooth and clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any razor burn.</li>
            <li> I gotta say I&#x27;m pretty pleased, smooth as can be and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the concern Shaveology showed in making sure I was satisfied with my product and that I fully understood the technique and material used in a traditional wet shave.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; look with new feel...this product is fantastic!</li>

            <li> Easy to use and good quality overall.  </li>
            <li> The Shaveology Safety Razor was nothing short of providing an amazing shave!</li>
            <li> Definitely not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is not my first safety razor but I will tell anyone who asks, you will not find a better razor at this price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stick to the original.</li>
            <li> When this kit arrived in the mail, he was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchase the Safety Razor set for about $30, which is 70% lower than what is listed at the original price.</li>
            <li> Strop from the top of the razor and forward as we don&#x27;t want to shave the denim ;)</li>
            <li> I am so excited</li>
            <li> And am completely sure that you will want to share your experience as soon as you used the first couple times, just like I did.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I was reminded to leave a review when signing up for a (free) 60-day supply of razor blades.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor and I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> i love this thing, takes a min to get used to the style and angle, and nicking yourself is invulnerable the first time when used to the cartridges, but it&#x27;s the closes</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Loving the product so far, and they&#x27;re even offering 60 days of free razors after a purchase.</li>
            <li> Inly design flaw is the completely smooth handle, it gets super slippery if your hands have soap on them.</li>
            <li> Simply put, the shave is close, the blades are cheap and the product is superior to cartridge shavers.</li>
            <li> Not only was it an awesome &amp; classy gift but</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the razor once and it gave an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After considerable research, I purchased the Shaveology set hoping it would deliver a great shave at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Either way it was a super thoughtful gift idea.</li>
            <li> This razor has amazing build quality for a very modest price.</li>
            <li> It is nice looking, well thought out with the cloth and leather razor cover, and though I&#x27;ve just used it once, it performs even better than my old razor (one that was advertised by the pawn shop guy on tv and was my first safety razor).</li>
            <li> Best double edge razor i own, see since i am a barber i gone thru a lot of double edge razors and straight razors.</li>
            <li> he used it right away and loves it!</li>
            <li> My husband is hard to shop for, but I looked for the best product I could find.</li>
            <li> I would love to see this product manufactured here in the states, but I will admit this product is very high quality.</li>
            <li> It is a good solid razor.</li>
            <li> Very sleek and elegant.</li>
            <li> I suggest watching their videos as you will learn so much and get a much better shave, they explain how to angle it and all.</li>
            <li> It is such a good value for everything you get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice old school shave.</li>
            <li> I will be evaluating it very close from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> With the phantom, you unscrew the whole top to place in a rzor.</li>
            <li> Looks cool as well</li>
            <li> Thanks shaveology for making your product available!</li>
            <li> I have only used the razor for a couple of days but it already seems like a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels like a better shave, and the product is very quality</li>
            <li> just cause I love it so much, even though I doubt I would ever need it.</li>
            <li> Thus far, I&#x27;m really loving this razor.  </li>
            <li> Hope they come out with a matching stand because I think it would look cool in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that it came with extra blades and a leather cover to protect the head of the razor as well.</li>
            <li> The real bonus for me was the fact that the owner of the company called me two weeks after I bought this to make sure that the product arrived well and to get my feedback.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and smooth after each shave with Shaveology.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very durable and elegant looking razor.</li>
            <li> Which is never a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Takes more time, but a much more luxurious experience (and much cheaper!!!) than traditional blades and creams.  </li>
            <li> This also makes a great gift idea and with the holidays right around the corner, I&#x27;ll be picking up a few more.</li>
            <li> The razor has a nice chrome and black handle, and the head of the razor has a nice engraving with the mustache-and-crown logo of Shaveology.</li>
            <li> nervous to use at first but after awhile its easy to get the hang of</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a cool, unique but useful gift.</li>
            <li> seems fine so far, cheaper and better quality shave then the pop-off head or disposable types.</li>
            <li> Works great without clogging up and appears to be extremely well made.</li>
            <li> To achieve a great shave, you need a sharp blade.</li>
            <li> But for a few $$ more it is definitely a superior razor.</li>
            <li> Definitely worthy of gift</li>
            <li> It is extremely comfortable and provides a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Super fancy looking in the Shaveology box.  </li>
            <li> You get a closer, smoother shave, far fewer nicks and ingrown hairs, and shaving with it feels more precise.</li>
            <li> Works great, don&#x27;t plan to ever go back to modern fancy blades.</li>
            <li> I was not even able to open the top to place a razor in.  </li>
            <li> When he was at school I got a quick shave in with it to see what the fuss was all about.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Now, when you get ready to shave with this razor make sure you tighten it tight after you put the blade in, This is a great razor, Just be warned everybody gets cuts here and there, even with a non-aggressive razor</li>
            <li> The razor is presented in an elegant package that you&#x27;d see at a high end department store.  </li>
            <li> The razor really does provide a very good shave and the included blades are quite sharp.</li>
            <li> This provides a good shave and the blades are cheap and extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife even comments on how smooth my face has gotten thanks to this razor!</li>
            <li> This safety razor set makes such an amazing and unique gift for any man in your life.</li>
            <li> To that end, I first ordered an electric razor, primarily because my grandfather always used them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Build quality is good and I expect to use this razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> Well, after trying two electrics I came to the conclusion that they were more trouble than they were worth and didn&#x27;t leave me with good results.</li>
            <li> it feels very cheap and not anywhere NEAR the price it should be!</li>
            <li> I originally got this for my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day gift (such a unique gift!), but when it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t keep the surprise!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend purchasing this safety razor at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Very much enjoying the new razor</li>
            <li> I thought, I&#x27;d better buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I love my new razor.</li>
            <li> The blades that come with it are pretty good too, although i do prefer different ones.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and until using this razor I have never been able to shave against the grain without wicked razor burn and the bumps and ingrown hairs that come along with it.</li>
            <li> Started using this razor last week and man I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The razor has an extremely nice and comfortable weight, I only nicked myself once out of my first time using a razor like this (i&#x27;m used to the crappy disposable gilette razor).</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to watch the videos that train on how to use it just because I&#x27;m so interested in learning now too after I read all these reviews!</li>
            <li> There was no irritation on my skin and after shaving a 3 day beard, which on this mug is a challenge for the Fusion, these Shaveology blades cut like a hot knife through butter - so keep your 30 degree angle integrity!  </li>
            <li> Opened it up, excited since its my first razor like this to find out it looks like it was used or already damaged with a razor already mounted.</li>
            <li> gift was very well received!!  </li>
            <li> I personally use the blades that came in the box but also bought some feather blades and those also work phenomenally!</li>
            <li> My legs are SMOOTH, not a single cut either :)</li>
            <li> It is heavy, solid, easy and does a great job on the shave!</li>
            <li> You get a sleek looking razor that is capable of giving a fine, close shave.  </li>
            <li> a great product so far, appreciate the extra mile with tutorials and free blades, and overall a very enjoyable shaving experience, much more so than a regular razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great advantage is if you are like me and don&#x27;t shave every day, your beard tends to grow out a little bit.</li>
            <li> They give a great shave, but do take a little getting used to to not cut yourself (although they are safety blades</li>
            <li> My husband is tough to buy for and this was perfect</li>
            <li> I really excited when the razor arrived, because all I had seen was positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I feel we have gotten to comfortable living with the mentality that everything needs to be fast and convenient.</li>
            <li> and I think being calm and patient helped as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve had more compliments on this set than anything else in my apt (no joke... or maybe that&#x27;s a sad statement on the rest of my apt, haha)&lt;br</li>
            <li> After much homework, I came across this beauty and saw the fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li> Works amazing, we will definitely be sticking with it.</li>
            <li> Good balance and easier to use than expected.</li>
            <li> but it is well built and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So Far I am satisfied with the product (I used it three</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growin a full beard for about four months and the blade went through it like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> Is worth it.</li>
            <li> Also I decided to give it a try on my legs more out of curiosity and WOW.</li>
            <li> The shave is excellent, I can actually hear it gliding across my face, but there is absolutely no discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed it so far</li>
            <li> and I rarely need aftershave when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Be sure to check out the materials Shaveology offers to help you get started.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts but thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> and you will get your $$ worth.</li>
            <li> It takes practice and patience, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Shaveology team.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver and it shaves better than my 5 blade shaver blade and much closer believe it or not this has been my experience with this shaver and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kids now have a nice present for their dad and it isn&#x27;t something he&#x27;ll like and use.  </li>
            <li> The closest shave .. Feels fresh out the barbershop</li>
            <li> but I have to say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> worth every penny, thank you:-}</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> #34;&amp;#34;Are you ready for the best shave of your life?&amp;#34; - well, I thought for 29.95 that there had to be at least SOME marketing hype in that question.</li>
            <li> This is my first single blade razor and have to say it was a good choice</li>
            <li> First time user so watch quick video and use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used disposable razors, straight razors, and as of now safety razors and I can say I&#x27;ve never had a shave so effortless, clean (as far as residue and hairs sticking to the face) and confident then with this razor.</li>

            <li> Super classy and comfortable shave at a VERY reasonable price!</li>
            <li> if I made the right decision</li>
            <li> but after 2 or 3 times I realized I made the right decision.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working finding the right shaving soap to use and learning about how to not cut myself.</li>
            <li> The Razor has the right balance.</li>
            <li> The blade is nice and sharp too and he feels like he stepped out of the barber after using it, its a unique gift for a guy.</li>
            <li> Even after rinsing under the faucet, when I took it apart to clean ( like in their video ), I was amazed at how much of the soap was on the blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great shave, this product delivers the results of a straight edge razor, basically the modern version of a straight edge razor that reminds me of my grandpa shaving back in the day.</li>
            <li> His grandfather always used a safety razor so it gave him more than just a great shave, but also took him back to a great memory of watching his pappo&amp;uacute;s shave while trying to teach my husband how with his broken funny English.</li>
            <li> typically get 2 shaves out of each blade, but I am sure you could get a lot more, however in my opinion as inexpensive as blades are for these razors why not just change them each time you shave?</li>
            <li> the past I have had a great deal of skin irritation and razor bumps using electric and disposable razors...</li>
            <li> The packaging is pretty fun too.</li>
            <li> I somehow came across this, not really sure how, and it just looked great to me</li>
            <li> I am able to get precise and clean shaves in half the time.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is evident in its weight and construction right off the bat and this gift set includes 5 blades, a microfiber cloth and a case.</li>
            <li> It is really simple to use and the clean up is easy</li>
            <li> I love the old school styling with modern flair.</li>
            <li> Good deal for less than 35.00.&lt;br /&gt;Art of shaving razors start at 100.00</li>
            <li> /&gt;Razor fits snug and does not move&lt;br /&gt;Clean shave with minimal drag and perfect</li>
            <li> Nice looking product but single blade shaving just isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> His face is smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Got the razor very fast as promised.  </li>
            <li> The weight of the razor allows it to cut without applying a lot of pressure to the handle and this I found to be very very helpful to avoid cuts and bruises.&lt;br /&gt;User</li>
            <li> and it was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a safety razor for a long time now finally made the decision on buying the shavolgy razor based on reviews shipped fast came in a nice box set up very well nice weight</li>
            <li> It had a black, &amp;#34;fatter&amp;#34; design (which I&#x27;m sure my ex would like) and offered superior protection between my skin and the blade (like the protection I should&#x27;ve used with my ex), so I was able to glide past my Adam&#x27;s apple and chin with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Forget the cartridges, save money, pick up a new hobby and get excited about shaving again.</li>
            <li> Figured I would try something new and its been completely worth it!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products that I get online because I am a very busy person, but I am so happy with my new razor that I got from shaveology and am glad I did this smart investment.</li>
            <li> The shave is VERY close, very comfortable, and I love the feel of the heavy duty metal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but there is a certain lustre that stainless steel has.</li>
            <li> I gotta say I was pretty excited to try new shaving system like this after years of using Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li> My first time using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> and I also just had my first shave....</li>
            <li> Today was my first shave using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> After opening the box up we were both pleased with the overall quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Shaveology really delivered!</li>
            <li> my belief is it can only get better.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it</li>
            <li> Make sure you watch the videos on how to use the razor properly, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> HAHA!  </li>
            <li> This kit is a nice start for anyone interested in trying a safety razor, or a seasoned wet shaving pro.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for sending the 60 days complimentary blades.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a safety razor and chose this one based of the reviews.</li>
            <li> love the double edge!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a safety blade</li>
            <li> I shaved with a Gillette safety razor from the first time I shaved till in my 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so I bought my first electric razor, a Norelco.</li>
            <li> First off this is Mr. Leah Montgomery</li>
            <li> Also, not going to lie, it feels pretty manly to use a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> First ever buying a razor like this.</li>
            <li> First couple shaves and I&#x27;m hooked, no razor burn and no paying out the ears for razors.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor</li>
            <li> I settled on this as my first razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first experience with a safety razor and will be my last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have been shaving my head for 2.5 years now and have tried many different razors and soaps/cream/gels over that time.  </li>
            <li> This old school razor is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Using this razor not only makes it enjoyable but also gives me the closest shave I have ever achieved without irritation.</li>
            <li> Once you open the box, it gets even better.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this type of razor</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received a reply within 15 min from a real person!</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used this yet, however looking forward to the first shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> It is chrome plated, and it&#x27;s noticeable when you first look at the finish.</li>
            <li> The product showed up liking exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My first shave was without any nicks, cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li> With the first couple of times taking a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Also my skin was irritated the first 2 times I used it.</li>
            <li> Like others, I struggled a bit with the safety razor at first.</li>
            <li> More people should take the plunge and do the same.</li>
            <li> I got the Shaveology Razor set about a week ago, and I just took my first shave with it tonight</li>
            <li> Thanks Shaveology!</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail today, and tried it out for the first time.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks, I&#x27;m still on my first blade and haven&#x27;t had any razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for the son of a friend leaving the nest for the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally used this safety razor and wow felt so smooth that I asked every co-worker I saw to feel my face.</li>
            <li> It provides a close and consistent shave everytime.</li>
            <li> It has much more of a barbershop feel than the traditional plastic razor handles I was used to.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing more products from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> the razor looks pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shaveology razor for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> It definitely has given me one of the closest shaves, better than any of those 5 blade systems I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> the price I payed, I can&#x27;t imagine higher value.</li>
            <li> The future, no cuts or razor burns,  it made a fan of my husband for sure.</li>
            <li> Very well made!</li>
            <li> First: the shaver..</li>
            <li> Learn your form first, then upgrade, or you will slice your face off, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a lot of first hand information because I bought this for my husband.  </li>
            <li> When I received it it was a pretty razor, but no matter what blade I put in it, it shaved like the handle of a butter knife.</li>
            <li> , this is the first razor that would not shave .</li>
            <li> Hot towl, shave balm, and some hand made shave soap; it&#x27;s truly the royal treatment.</li>
            <li> Get the best shave every time and you save money compared to those expensive replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> No razor burn, sharp razors, clean shave, does it get any better?</li>
            <li> If you really want to do it right, you will need to buy a shave brush and either shave soap or lather.</li>
            <li> If you want to shave and feel like a true gentleman than I definitely recommend Shavology as your first choice in keeping your looks clean.</li>
            <li> You can instantly tell if you have the angle right or not, and the shave was close and easy.</li>
            <li> You can instantly tell if you have the angle right or not, and the shave was close and easy.</li>
            <li> A good double edge blade is very sharp, so it requires caution, but gives the closest shave save for perhaps a straight edge (which I have yet to learn properly or purchase a good one).</li>
            <li> Again, this was my first experience with a DE safety razor, but it was extremely positive.</li>
            <li> The blades are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> My husband is extremely picky on what kind of product goes into his business for resale to his customers.  </li>
            <li> I rinse my face with warm water and lather my neck, shave across one way (ear to ear), then rinse, lather and repeat the other way.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying it a few more times to get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> Really good service/delivery as well (received a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34;-guide almost instantly and the Shaveology-set followed within only a couple of days).</li>
            <li> shave is like no other shave I have ever had, my face is baby smooth when I am done shaving.</li>
            <li> is the first time I have ever used a single blade safety razor and with a little practice it soon became very easy to get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Less is more!</li>
            <li> Recommend buying one with a long handle if this applies to you, if not then you will love it.</li>
            <li> He used it for the first time last night after carefully watching the informative videos that Shaveology has posted, which is an important step to get the most optimal results as it tells you how to adjust the tension on the razor blades just right and how to use the razor itself.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I was so scared of it because though there were couple of nicks, it was mostly drama free.</li>
            <li> I also thought the razor itself  black- looked really nice.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that as a GIRL having spent most of my life shaving 2/3 of my body I know that which razor you choose makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Luckily, Shaveology.co offers instructional videos for safety-razor neophytes.</li>
            <li> Really solid and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a cool starter kit with AMAZING blades called Baili but there are two drawbacks for me which forced me to get another razor.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely fantastic to see that there are still genuinely good quality reliable American small businesses.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the feel of my fiance&#x27;s face after he shaves with his new Shaveology Double Edge Safety Razor Set!  </li>
            <li> Mine is built very well and came quick and professional.</li>
            <li> The razor cuts just fine through my facial hair.</li>
            <li> Very high quality shaving blades.</li>
            <li> Nice little starter kit.</li>
            <li> Then, I shake the brush a little to get it to stop dripping, and use it to get a nice soap lather in the cup.</li>
            <li> Just received my razor today, the packaging is first class I felt as if I was opening a high end razor.</li>
            <li> cloth was of the sort to which dust readily clings, meaning that you can use it not only for polishing and drying the safety razor, but for cleaning your glasses, or in fact any glass which must remain dust free.</li>

            <li> The short handle can be forgiven but the smooth coating on the handle was just too much.</li>
            <li> thanks shaveology.</li>
            <li> Very premium</li>
            <li> The video is very helpful</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but it really is effortless shaving.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> but they all seem to have really slender handles too.  </li>
            <li> Really like it, 5 star</li>
            <li> so well.. the blade is lose.. really lose.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a quality double-edge razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> absolutely looks</li>
            <li> It performs really well too.</li>
            <li> some people might like it... but not that much for me...</li>
            <li> and I believe she said it was really a gift for the women in their lives...</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that wants to give safety razors a try.</li>
            <li> My husband often gets razor rash on his neck and switching the razor every week has really helped.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> cause his barber uses a straight blade to touch it all up</li>
            <li> Its very well balanced, fits and handles well in my hand.</li>
            <li> so it takes longer to shave than with a modern cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m holding something solidly made, something of quality instead of a cheap piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> I used the provided shaveology blades and got a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I gotta say I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> Balanced very well.</li>
            <li> The blades are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> Very helpful and eager to please.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor,  </li>
            <li> Very close shave on beard and head.</li>
            <li> the middle part of the handle broke free and spun in place.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> But to start this off, the packaging and tools included in the kit are very well made.</li>
            <li> Again, I will write a follow up review once I get a chance to really use the razor.</li>
            <li> I really like that there is a video to watch that covers how to put together, use and how to maintain this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Response to the comment was fast, but no email received.</li>
            <li> He used to shave with the store bought razors and compares this razor to shaving with a light saber and the store bought ones he used before to a wooden spoon!</li>
            <li> He said that he didn&#x27;t want a straight blade razor</li>
            <li> He really wanted the brush and shave soaps to use</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves them..</li>
            <li> HIGH quality!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razors I recieved were Baili &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; stainless steel blades, numbering 5 which came in a custom Shaveology bag.</li>
            <li> I think it is important for them to both know the importance of the holiday (his birthday and Christmas too) and not skip present giving just because we aren&#x27;t together.  </li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a gift and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how much money I was wasting  on 3x blades</li>
            <li> He considered a straight edge but thought that jump was a bit much.</li>
            <li> so I will try to put a follow up review real soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a reason men used to shave with a straight razor...</li>
            <li> The razor provides a very close shave and has made it</li>
            <li> They were very helpful.</li>
            <li> Made very well</li>
            <li> While the razor is lighter the shaving experience has been much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you buy those fancy multi blade razors, ask you really get for your money</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really recommend using this razor and giving it as a gift since the kit is so aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this gift set by Shaveology.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will shave as expected.</li>
            <li> I like the Feather brand for a really smooth feel, but I&#x27;d suggest starting with the blades the kit comes with,</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave from it.  </li>
            <li> He emailed me today to let me know how much he likes the razor and suggested that I order another for our father&#x27;s upcoming 60th birthday...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from disposable to dollar shave club to straight razors and now to the Shaveology safety razor</li>
            <li> I used to own a Merkur safety razor -- ended up losing it, and got the itch to go back to this style of shaving recently.</li>
            <li> The razor feels sturdy and solid, with just enough weight to be effective.</li>
            <li> Few employers are going to hire someone with the kind of beard I had (think Zack Galfanalkis in The Hangover).</li>
            <li> It was definitely heavier than my old Gillette (since it wasn&#x27;t mostly plastic).</li>
            <li> I cut myself more with a safety razor quite frequently because it&#x27;s only one blade.</li>
            <li> He is thrilled with it, and although I didn&#x27;t use it personally, I have examined it closely and it appears to be solid and as weighty as it should be.</li>
            <li> The included blades are very smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li> When I received my first razor from shaveology the head and handle did have some difficulty screwing together, however, when I contacted shaveology about the matter they responded very promptly, apologized for the inconvenience, and sent me an entirely new kit.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my husband and all I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Several weeks later and my legs look fantastic and I have also significantly reduced the amount of money I was spending.</li>
            <li> My first thought after shaving with my new Shaveology Razor, is don&#x27;t let her shave her legs with it, or it will be gone too.</li>
            <li> As good as any other razors that are double the cost.</li>
            <li> I settled with this one due to reviews and that it came with a razor guard which is good for travel, and that it came with extra razors.</li>
            <li> and I have a nice clean shaven look without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> and you have dedicate some time to it every morning, more so than other shaving  methods.</li>
            <li> Survived the first shave, and wow!</li>
            <li> Our other shavers would pull the hair and swipe many times.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many other things besides razor</li>
            <li> I have used it for many other things besides razor</li>
            <li> I would recommend reading the other reviews which give more details on how to shave with this type of razor either here on amazon or youtube.</li>
            <li> I am getting better shaves for a fraction of the cost of other multi blade cartrige razors.</li>
            <li> opening and closing heads on the razor (screw on design is MUCH better than other clamping safety razors.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on my technique (during my first shave with this razor, I actually had to shave three times to get a close shave, but my second shave went much better).  </li>
            <li> I think its a great system,  I am new to wet shaving or should I say returning to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to take it apart to clean / change</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, there was a bit of a learning curve when I first started using it, but after watching some of the tutorial videos and given myself a few shaves</li>
            <li> One blade that is angled properly, easy to keep dry and replace, and infinitely cheaper will serve you just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I always wanted to go back to the good old days of a single blade safety razor</li>
            <li> They do such a good job because they&#x27;re so sharp!</li>
            <li> He told me it was a double edge safety razor and that these old school razors really give an amazing close shave, especially these days and the way they are made.</li>
            <li> To a certain extent, any razor of this design with the right angles and ease of use will fit the bill, but shaveology has really stepped it up with extra quality blades, a drying cloth and simple, high quality, travel</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the high quality packaging that this razor arrives with.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this Shaveology was very new experience for my husband</li>
            <li> That being said, I have been using the razor for the past month, and the shave is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice for first time wet shaver or long time vet.</li>
            <li> It was a nice razor but too small for my hands.</li>
            <li> The first thing I have to say about this product is wow.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever safety razor and I was pleasantly surprised when I received this for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> What I found was a super clean, tight shave.</li>
            <li> On my first pass, this razor easily cuts through my stubble, but I find it more difficult to cut against the grain.</li>
            <li> I assumed it would be cheaply made possibly out of plastic or some other cheap material</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to clean as opposed to our other razors where you have to constantly apply water or hit it to get the clogged hair out.</li>
            <li> I love the weight of it and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to repeatedly go over areas that I&#x27;ve shaved, the blades are very sharp and efficient.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a double edge razor feels more simple.</li>
            <li> Luckily you can find quality blades at low prices if you do your research.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d say it shaved better than those expensive 5-blade razors that are more lubed up than my ex bent over the bed.  </li>
            <li> This kit looks nice, but I&#x27;m afraid the micro touch is better bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> My husband was super nervous about trying this Double Edge safety razor set for his weekly shave, but he loves when he gets a hair cut</li>
            <li> Had it for only few days but works really good.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good wet to get you started into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> This set is classic masculinity in a box.</li>
            <li> I normally don’t write reviews, but I was over at my friend’s house last week when I saw this really cool looking box called Shaveology on his counter</li>
            <li> Instead of shaving cream, I used: &amp;#34;Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap &amp;#34; (read the reviews on it in Amazon and you&#x27;ll see why) and finished things off with Clubman Pinaud Classic Vanilla</li>
            <li> Too many people over tight and brake razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the razors that came with it, I bought a pack of 100 Personna razors and I highly recommend those as well.</li>
            <li> High quality materials and finish.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All of the parts seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> The razor is made out of truly high quality metal, and has a pristine leather handle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.uses before wearing out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone just getting started with safety</li>
            <li> You get everything you need for a double-edge razor shave that is high quality and will save you hundreds of dollars every year.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like feeling like a highly respected gangster from the 1920&#x27;s while your getting for the day or night.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for any man in your life.</li>
            <li> The razor seems to be a high quality razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> High quality razor.  </li>
            <li> My opinion is that  this is a high quality, nice safety razor kit for a fraction of the price of other kits in the same class quality!</li>
            <li> Assembling the razor was very easy and took no more than 30 seconds to figure out.</li>
            <li> Costs a little more than some others brands</li>
            <li> Wow is this a value!!</li>
            <li> Love the little towel they give you to lay out all your stuff on.</li>
            <li> Great razor, a little shorter than average though</li>
            <li> This razor seems very well made, and I&#x27;d be surprised if it ever broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending far too much money on cartridge razors over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have had terribly sensitive skin my whole life.  </li>
            <li> It seems very well made it has that wow factor.</li>
            <li> I just bought this after my old safety razor broke, and I really like this kit.</li>
            <li> I got my blood work done and the doctor said my testosterone levels were 100,543 times the normal level.</li>
            <li> Plus being able to change the razor everyday for about $30 a year.</li>
            <li> Having used both for the past two years, I can&#x27;t really say which is better.</li>
            <li> Normally a cartridge razor guy, my preference was the Gillette Fusion multi-blade,</li>
            <li> its worth the short adjustment period.</li>
            <li> Normally that would cost some stars, but I already had a pack of &amp;#34;Astra&amp;#34; brand blades that I know work well</li>
            <li> After using the razor for a few months, I really love the shave and equipment.</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated by the whole process, but the shaveology kit comes with easy instructions.</li>
            <li> But after several shaves, I have my routine down and am loving the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let it speak for itself, if you&#x27;re on the fence I strongly recommend giving it a try especially since it&#x27;s backed by a 100% satisfaction/money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the barber straight razor blade, normal gillette razors, and other similar razors for men, but this was the most sharp and smooth shave of them all.  </li>
            <li> Despite the loose handle making it a bit tedious to use, the shave is excellent.</li>
            <li> The razor provides a smooth, extremely close shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s sturdiness screams quality craftsmanship; the razor blades cut so sharply and smoothly</li>
            <li> After using multiple blades that are overly expensive for years I found this set to be very good.</li>
            <li> I like this new razor.  </li>
            <li> So I came home ,showered, oiled my face, creamed up using a brush and tried my new shaveology kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this type of shave.</li>
            <li> It brings a new level of sophistication to shaving.</li>
            <li> I just finished using my new shaveology razor</li>
            <li> Even getting used to the feel of a new razor, no nicks, yet.....</li>
            <li> After completing the new routine, I now know the reason for the dis-assembly of the razor.</li>
            <li> Look forward to the coming new products.</li>
            <li> I received my new kit within 4 days and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> New shaving technology doesn&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and if you are new to safety razors, don&#x27;t start with the feather blades.</li>
            <li> While poking around different websites and book (including Art of Manliness and Real Men for Real Style)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no secret that safety razors and straight razors are making a big comeback among hipsters and \\&quot;manly men\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble getting a nice close shave with regular disposable razors and, on the advice of a friend, decided to try a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Especially easy to get that straight line on my sideburns which is absolutely impossible with a multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and a friend recommended I try a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very close and clean shave with little to no irritation, every time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using Shaveology&#x27;s safety razor (with the exact same blades I&#x27;ve been using with the Merkur), it didn&#x27;t nick me once.  </li>
            <li> This is my second safety razor, the first one was the Razor One, I had for 11 months and it broke.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Shaveology Saftey Razor and the breakouts went away COMPLETELY!</li>
            <li> but the handle is smaller than most other razors (gillete, etc.)</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> First the handle was too short for my tastes</li>
            <li> It is an extremely comfortable shave and I will not look to any other blade to get the job done!</li>
            <li> The actual razor is really sturdy and made of high quality materials.  </li>
            <li> He said the blades were very sharp and I can agree that the Shaveology combo provides a close smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be forewarned though, this is a new shaving experience and don&#x27;t be surprised when you cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Everything old becomes new again.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new razor since my old standby disposable manufacturer has changed their &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; which in turn meant they changed the razor.  </li>
            <li> With typical razors this poses a huge problem for me as the hair gets caught between the blades and no amount of rinsing helps.</li>
            <li> The second I was done shaving, I instantly sprouted a full beard.</li>
            <li> After dumping lots of money into Schick Quattro blades for several years and getting consistent razor burn, I recalled my vacation to India years ago where I&#x27;d get old school barber shaves without post blemishing.  </li>
            <li> The Shaveology Razor was much heavier than I expected it to be and of much higher quality.</li>
            <li> He has extremely thick hair and grows facial hair witching a couple days, this razor makes his skin very smooth and no cuts!</li>
            <li> In fact I sometimes bought the plastic throwaway single blade razors and was not unhappy with those.  </li>
            <li> Its a good solid instrument, sturdy should last to past along to my grandson.</li>
            <li> This safety razor saves a lot of money, but I have more control with a cartridge-based razor and am less likely to cut myself.</li>
            <li> If you believe certain corners of the internet, switching to a safety razor is nothing short of life-changing.</li>
            <li> The upfront cost is a little more but the replacement blades cost next to nothing.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because of the potential for more cuts.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a little bit of nostalgia when it comes to shaving back like they used to?  </li>
            <li> Shaving with the double edged safety razor is not complicated, at all, and my husband was extremely surprised he only had to make one pass with the razor, and said it was the closest shave he has ever achieved; he has used both high end disposable and electric razors.</li>
            <li> Looking toward to a complete kit from them.</li>
            <li> I have been battling my whole life to find and learn a solid shaving system and products.</li>
            <li> Plus I feel like an old school &amp;#34;Mans man&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> old blade was a Merkur.  </li>
            <li> I have been a member of Dollar Shave Club, used Gillette razors and everything far in between.</li>
            <li> he has sensitive skin and finds that these razor works well and does not leave his skin irritated.</li>
            <li> off, you can NOT use the same amount of force you do with those razors - this blade is much sharper and  you will cut yourself all over the place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the shave is so close and lasts longer than my old Harrys razor.</li>
            <li> My son being young couldn&#x27;t wait to give his gift to dad</li>
            <li> so we let him have it early.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ready to give present.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to the a stand and brush for a complete set.</li>
            <li> To put it simply, classy set for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Phantom set because it reminded me of my old Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> a couple days early, as Leah stole my old safety razor after shaving her legs with it.</li>
            <li> So far this one has held up well.</li>
            <li> They completely went away as soon as I started using quality products.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing like the old school way of shaving.</li>
            <li> To screw it back on I had to grip the razor on the very bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li> So, I dusted off my old norelco rotary electric shaver, and said goodbye to my furry friend.</li>
            <li> The Shaveology came very well package, with a head cover, polishing cloth and five individually wrapped blades.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Always wanted to try the old school shave.</li>
            <li> I can make several passes on the same spots and not worry at all about nicking myself like with disposables, and the shave is much faster then with straight razors.</li>
            <li> I can make several passes on the same spots and not worry at all about nicking myself like with disposables, and the shave is much faster then with straight razors.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how close of a shave I got and without the loss of blood.  </li>
            <li> and I no longer get the nicks/cuts and my sensitive skin is thankful for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use cartridge razors, but I don&#x27;t have to buy them as frequently.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> so my eye naturally attracts to well-done packaging so I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> find that the shave I get from this is equal to that of my straight razor, but it also decreases the possibility of razor burn or cuts.  </li>
            <li> but once again, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The phantom is a classy razor, and the kit they you get for 29.95 is a steal!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I completely, without reservation, recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Far surpasses Gillette or Schick.</li>
            <li> Just threw away my old razor wont ever use it again.</li>
            <li> but after a few uses the finish on the top plate corner looks like it is starting to wear off.</li>
            <li> I would say about 75% just on the first shave and for the second shave I barely felt or noticed any discomfort from rashes or razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I always bought the Gillette fusion razors because of the extra blade on the back for right under my nose...</li>
            <li> Lifting this heavy razor out of the case feels right, and should raise your testosterone levels straight away.</li>
            <li> One tip that he said was helpful was to apply a really warm wash cloth to his face for a few minutes prior to shaving to open the pores up, which allows for the closest shave possible; you could also achieve this by taking a hot shower prior to shaving.</li>
            <li> I get a very close and clean shave, I never cut myself, and of all the razors I&#x27;ve ever used this combination irritates my skin the least.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for every man, especially those with particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Quality is decent and should last a while.</li>
            <li> I have fast growing man hair and it comes in full and thick like a man -  </li>
            <li> The razor looks really nice, not cheap or like it will wear down.</li>
            <li> I cut myself a few times (very minor) the first time I used it, the second time I got better, by the third shave I was a pro.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend watching the Shaveology safety razor video and following their advice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice and potentially useful thing to have though, especially if you&#x27;re travelling with your razor as it can keep it from cutting other things in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Support got back to me in a couple days and shipped me a brand new kit which had no issues.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a different type of Father&#x27;s Day gift for my hubby and after unproductively googling &amp;#34;gifts for men&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;unique gifts&amp;#34;, I remembered an episode of Live with Regis and Kelly</li>
            <li> Overall, if you were new to a product like this like I was, go to their website and watch some of the how-to videos.</li>
            <li> Definitely returning to try and get a NEW one.</li>
            <li> It comes with some very sharp razor blades that provide such a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> It would only go about half a turn, and even after using a towel it would not go nearly far enough to secure the blade -- let alone</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth the extra minutes spent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as two sided, single blade safety razors go, this one is of particularly high value for the money.</li>
            <li> That might be the biggest compliment a product like this can get, especially coming from a seasoned barber that knows good razors from bad ones.</li>
            <li> I had a little irritation, but I&#x27;m sure that was due to my technique, or lack thereof.</li>
            <li> I ended up replacing it with Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> I got this for a unique gift for my husband to try, who has a heavy and coarse beard.</li>
            <li> Next, I apply a nice lather to my still-wet face, set the brush back in the cup (it will be used again), and shave my cheeks down, then across (from ear to nose/mouth) then down my neck.</li>
            <li> My husband has always had a hard time with a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to dive in headfirst with this specific razor because of the high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand to everyone, male or female.</li>
            <li> It cut the stubble with almost no pull left a smooth shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The results aren&#x27;t anything spectacular, and I&#x27;ve cut myself pretty badly each time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> , i had spent my whole life using the multi-blade gilette fusion  (or its predecessors) and therefore, had no clue</li>
            <li> talking barely a shadow at 5pm</li>
            <li> but i also feel i can go an extra day without shaving with this (as opposed to my old razor)</li>
            <li> razor burn (which happens to him no matter what because he has such sensitive skin) but</li>
            <li> 3 peice safety razors are old school, but not everyone knows how to install properly.</li>
            <li> In fact, 24 hours later, is about the length I was at by 10AM with my old shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t spent much time shaving with this razor</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go back to your old razor after you have tried this.</li>
            <li> this is still definitively the complete shaving set for any man with facial hair.</li>
            <li> this is still definitively the complete shaving set for any man with facial hair.</li>
            <li> i think ive ever had next to a professional barber.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I was surprised by the weight and overall quality of the razor.</li>
            <li> I am naturally prone ingrown facial hairs and razor burn, but ended with neither after shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> But so far these last!</li>
            <li> He is old enough to remember learning how to shave on this type of razon &amp;#34;these</li>
            <li> , just know that the more aggressive the razor, the closer the shave, thus the worse the cuts.</li>
            <li> So I think if you are just starting out, or are just needing a new razor, this is a solid product</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, and I might later down the road when I have the money to invest in sharper blades, but the ones that come in the kit aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much on shavers from double bladed to five bladed shavers only to enjoy the shave for a few hours before the irritation would start to break out and would never get such close shave as I did with this shaver.</li>
            <li> There are so many advantages to buying a razor like this, for instance the blades are ridiculously inexpensive, I just ordered a pack of 100 blades for under $15!</li>
            <li> Be careful to not press hard like with cartridges, letting the weight of the razor do the work, and take short strokes when in tighter or more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> cannot really compare this razor to any other razors out there, but I can say that I did get a close shave and the razor</li>
            <li> Other than that i would  highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I started hearing about this via social media, the Art of Manliness blog, and friends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would say it took about three tries, to go gentle enough, but once i did...</li>
            <li> With the rising cost of traditional razors and their cartridge refills, my dad has recently expressed interest in trying an old fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old and have been using various (COSTLY) Electric razors and equally costly multi-blade cartridge razors all of my post adolescent life..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little lighter than his other razor, but the quality is still fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was new to the world of the art of traditional shaving when I made this purchase, it did not take me long to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have medium sized hands and the razor handle is too short for comfortable use which caused my hand to cramp.</li>
            <li> used it at first few months...</li>
            <li> I have never been contacted before by a reseller on Amazon and the fact that I gave him my opinion on it, he offered me a coupon for half off on the stainless steel stand they are about to come out with.</li>
            <li> I have been using a straight razor that utilizes replaceable safety blades that you brake in half, but as the handle was wearing out, it was time to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I was always suspicious that I was not getting as close a shave with four (yikes!!) blades as opposed to the old single style I grew up with, but</li>
            <li> but I do wish it was just a little longer because I have large hands.  </li>
            <li> So anytime I was in a rush to shave, I was almost certain it would end with me having little trails of blood flowing around my Adam&#x27;s apple</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to, but I really like it now.  </li>
            <li> (normally had a shadow much earlier with my previous razor)&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my previous safety razor head threads broke off from the head piece I had to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I immediately went into the kitchen and ate 12 eggs raw and a package of bacon, and drank a whole bottle of Jack Daniels.</li>
            <li> His other razor is grooved to provide a little more grip, but he&#x27;s already adjusted to the small difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it for a few shaves, I had to travel and went to my disposable gillette mach 3&#x27;s and having used this safety razor, my beard was gracefully taking the old typical razor I would use much smoother.</li>
            <li> anyone clumsy and handle with caution- especially on your first shave.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much talk of safety razors and my husband wanted for a long time to get away from both the waste and expense of disposables.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head almost everyday so he need a high quality safety razor and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m Hungarian, therefor I basically grow facial hair that is thick, full, coarse, and dark.</li>
            <li> Now it seems the general consensus in the wet shaver community is to start with an Edwin Jagger, or a Merkur.</li>
            <li> The only downside, one which accompanys not just this product, but all safety razors, is edging facial hair is a delicate and imprecise task, for which I prefer a straight razor.</li>
            <li> The only downside, one which accompanys not just this product, but all safety razors, is edging facial hair is a delicate and imprecise task, for which I prefer a straight razor.</li>
            <li> even though this razor didn&#x27;t come in as fast as my past products, my son loves it.</li>
            <li> But hey we are men, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it wont bleed for long, but this is definitely a mans razor</li>
            <li> go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get skin irritation too, hasn&#x27;t been an issue with this as long as I take my time and pay attention to what I&#x27;m doing and use proper technique.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are way cheaper and as time passes I will update on how long they last.</li>
            <li> I get don&#x27;t last too long (in terms of numbers of shaves).</li>
            <li> i.e. badger hair brush, nice thick later from shaving soap, and shaving oil and have been shaving against the grain experiencing the closest shave I have ever achieved without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Not the bad kind, more like the old reliable type that will last forever and doesn&#x27;t have to rely on crazy other add ons.</li>
            <li> As a military man shaving daily is obviously a requirement.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on shavers last year to give a gift to my 30 year old son who has a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I ended up getting to replace this, it just constantly slipped through my hand, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> Women looking for a single blade razor, look no further.</li>
            <li> After trying several other disposable razors, I decided to give a double edge safety razor a try.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a house warming gift from my dad and boy was I surprised at the heft of this little razor.</li>
            <li> the blades are so cheap that you&#x27;d be wondering why you ever used those expensive &amp;#34;quad&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it gives me the same if not better than my old Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I switched to a multiblade cartridge for some unknown reason and never looked back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a razor that can deal with my curly, bent-on-ingrowning neck hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am buying a Merkur long handle razor</li>
            <li> Everything about this kit is correct, I will be using this safety razor for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So long story short, I did a lot of research that led me to sites like badger &amp; blade, and the art of manliness, and I decided to take the plunge into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> far less than he expected.  </li>
            <li> It has much less drag and razor burn than my old fusion.</li>
            <li> Once I actually got the top off and placed a razor on the knobs, it was impossible to get the thing screwed back together due to the thread issue.</li>
            <li> He shaves in the shower and when wet the smooth black handle can be a little slick.</li>
            <li> Not very high quality.</li>
            <li> my last foray into single-blade safety razors (about 10yrs ago) was not pretty...</li>
            <li> so I only have to do it every other day.</li>
            <li> I will be using this razor and purchasing blades from Shaveology for as long as this safety razor lasts, and when it wears out (if it ever wears out), I&#x27;ll buy another!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend checking it out if you&#x27;ve been using other disposable razors for years.</li>
            <li> and I will never go back to the Gillette Fusion or any other razor.</li>
            <li> Anyone out here looking for a quality razor should really give this one a serious consideration.</li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> He had been going through a lot of razors for a number of months, and seemed unable to get a clean shave from any, so I saw this and got it for him.  </li>
            <li> , it felt like I was shaving dry.</li>
            <li> just to get used to the feel, raking angle and pressure you should use.&lt;br /&gt;Expect a few small nicks the first time experimenting with one of these.</li>
            <li> For years I have used the 4 and 5 bladed Gillette type razors and for years, my neck has been irritated after every single shave.</li>
            <li> so going to a single blade was a snap.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> that and the idea of having a single blade pressed against your face..... ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is such a better option than spending stupid amounts of money on razors that have like ten blades in the razor head.</li>
            <li> This razor gives an unbelievable soft shave.</li>
            <li> Customer service is also above average.</li>
            <li> I tend not to use it as slipping the razor into it requires you to either hold the blade guard open with your fingers or working the razor in, and I tend to be a bit nervous around extremely sharp metal, regardless of precautions.</li>
            <li> Razor handle is loose, spins when detaching the head.</li>
            <li> I figured out I put safety on upside down, not letting bade bend properly.</li>
            <li> The only complaint so far is that it doesn&#x27;t have any instructions in the box other than how to load your blade, but they do have tips and tricks on their website.</li>
            <li> After about 3 years of being well bearded, circumstances changed that forced me to seek new employment.</li>
            <li> This razor came in a black box that had 5 Derby Extra blades.</li>
            <li> , I think it is less of a pain to shave with this than making multiple passes with electric - this does provide a close shave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moved away from super expensive six blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> The only reason I docked a point was that it tends to loosen up now and again which is a little troublesome.  </li>
            <li> It slips over the head of the razor and keeps it clean, dry, and eliminates risk of cutting oneself when handling the razor.</li>
            <li> I decided to try what my late Father used, an old fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li> Very well made product built to last,  wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> The only thing negative I will say about this one is if you have big hands</li>
            <li> I had just used a trimer and looked rough.</li>
            <li> The blade mount is not straight and aligned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received the product faster than expected.</li>
            <li> have always wanted to go to a safety razor wet shave and since doing</li>
            <li> The product is for a gift but arrived on time as expected</li>
            <li> Only used once, but will updat after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s harder to do that).</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> He has suffered from razor burn on his neck for years and started using the wet shaving method with a safety razor after doing some research on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how carefully I shaved, I invariable cut myself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to jump start my wet shave journey.</li>
            <li> Shipping was way faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have thick facial hair, these should last 2-3 weeks or more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless you have thick facial hair, these should last 2-3 weeks or more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The threads when screwing it on and off was a little stiff, but I would call that normal with anything that is new and needs to be broken in.  </li>
            <li> Handle is lightweight which is a slight down side but not enough to not recommend.</li>
            <li> what a pansy - I was skeptical about the entire double-edge safety razor shave and a little reluctant to start that first pass on my mug.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a ton of money trying to find a razor to give me a close, clean shave without cutting my skin.</li>
            <li> Unless I was extremely careful, it usually nicked me in the same places on my throat.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used shaving at the specific angles but after a couple weeks I have no complaints and much less</li>
            <li> The razor is such a heavy, quality, and durable piece of equipment you won&#x27;t want to put it down.</li>
            <li> My husband prefers this as he swears it is less irritating and a much smoother</li>
            <li> waste another penny with expensive disposable razors, I shave just as quickly with this razor</li>
            <li> One must be careful replacing the razor head on the handle as the risk of cutting oneself is present; also, I have heard tightening the head too much will cause the razor to crack or shatter.</li>
            <li> Due to my education I have a semi educated mind on how materials are processed and how they are put together.</li>
            <li> Recommended to my brother and would recommend Shaveology products to other friends who are looking to move away from multi-bladed disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I had other safety razors before, but this one tops them all.</li>
            <li> All other safety razors I have seen have a butterfly opening.  </li>
            <li> and I am hooked, I don&#x27;t even touch my other razors anymore.</li>
            <li> After reading all the other reviews, I believe that he is going to be ecstatic about it</li>
            <li> and you always have a sharp razor.</li>
            <li> Even without the usual accouterments such as a stand, a badger hair brush, or shaving cream (all of which enhance the shaving experience)</li>
            <li> Even without the usual accouterments such as a stand, a badger hair brush, or shaving cream (all of which enhance the shaving experience)</li>
            <li> All in due time...</li>
            <li> (I had to acquire all the other hardware that comes with a safety-blade shave).</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A bit difficult to learn how to use for the first time, and&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-No manual on how to shave&lt;br /&gt;-Does not include soap, mug, aftershave, or other accessories&lt;</li>
            <li> This has sentimental value for me as my grandfather taught me to shave with a similar style of razor.</li>
            <li> the shave you get is like none other.  </li>
            <li> I never really write reviews but just had to about this razor!</li>
            <li> I shave every three days and the blade is is still sharp.</li>
            <li> I was a tad skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> No texturized grip makes it extremely slippery.</li>
            <li> All other blades cause irritation bumps...</li>
            <li> I did not get that result with my two other safety.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any mechanical problems with it like some other people describe in their review.  </li>
            <li> AND he&#x27;s a big Greek guy with thick hair strands!</li>
            <li> The shave is closer (with less razor burn) and there is something to be said for being forced to slow down and do things right.</li>
            <li> , there are no hinges, or shafts running through the handle to open and close as you change blades, less stuff to fail over time, I can see this lasting for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of the progressive growth of the new blades going from 2 - ??</li>
            <li> If you have never experienced old fashioned wet shaving, there is a reason it&#x27;s still around today, and that&#x27;s because it has stood the test of time.</li>
            <li> I do not normally shave everyday</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Hard to beat this deal if you&#x27;re thinking about getting into the double edge/safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> I went to the mall - a special (very expensive) shaving store.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was entirely shocked at how smooth the shave was with this product.</li>
            <li> Cut to a few weeks later, and I am not enjoying the quality of</li>
            <li> It felt like the threads were too big, and was probably forced on by a machine.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair and it did not like the shaver at all.</li>
            <li> Probably like once every 12 shaves (my facial hair isn&#x27;t as thick</li>
            <li> but once you have that down, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> It gets some getting used to (nicks and cuts), but after a couple shaves, you&#x27;ll have it down in no time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks like I bought a silly little &amp;#34;polishing cloth&amp;#34; along with some blades and a leather travel cover for my money because I certainly didn&#x27;t buy a razor.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, one is not superior to the other, it&#x27;s just different.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little slick when wet, so be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> Just a side note: the blades are very SHARP, so keep away from children/animals/</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less then $5 bucks a month, shoot</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less then $5 bucks a month, shoot</li>
            <li> As a professional, I am required to shave everyday for my job, and there is nothing worse than having cuts or spots on your skin where you have missed.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a replacement for one I just previously received that was garbage.  </li>
            <li> Less ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The support that comes from the website is unparalleled to anything I&#x27;ve seen previous.</li>
            <li> It is black with the Shaveology logo and phrase on one side, the other being plain.</li>
            <li> It is black with the Shaveology logo and phrase on one side, the other being plain.</li>
            <li> I found that little or no pressure is needed and slowing down solved that issue.</li>
            <li> This has been difficult due to the fact that I inherited my fathers sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It took a little time to get the angle correct</li>
            <li> It took a little getting  </li>
            <li> Just took a little practice.</li>
            <li> Its a little shorter than the murker but has a heavier feel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too soon to tell if it helps with skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The video is a must see, everyone has probably done it 2-4 times a week throughout their lifetime shaving but their are little details that will help with obtaining a closer shave and smoother and healthier skin.</li>
            <li> If you follow the video on the website for shaveology it works kust as well if not better than other razors.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was a little nervous to try it, but when I was done, I literally tossed out my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> this helps someone as much as other reviews in the past have helped me.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> this helps someone as much as other reviews in the past have helped me.</li>
            <li> it is a little gard to contol.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble figuring out how to use it and cut myself a few times in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Grate razor, is nice to say Good-bye to the expensive and bad quality plastic razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through a re-learning curve and have nicked myself a few times.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my use.</li>
            <li> It does take a few shaves to get used to the razor and how to shave with it</li>
            <li> I tried shaving with it and nicked myself a few times as I&#x27;ve never used a razor like this.</li>
            <li> In fact, I will be purchasing a few as gifts for my friends for the holidays.</li>
            <li> I watched the video on the site and was shaving with the razor a few minutes</li>
            <li> I decided to try it after a friend telling me that cutting back to a single blade razor would possibly improve or eliminate the constant razor burn that I would get with those past expensive razors.</li>
            <li> (and you can buy a box of 100 for ten bucks, it&#x27;s ridiculous!)</li>
            <li> The first swipe is very alarming because it gets to the base of the hair.</li>
            <li> It would have gotten 5 starts, but the razor head is a bit loose unless I overtighten it (which is not a great idea).</li>
            <li> He said he has never gotten a closer shave and very little  </li>
            <li> A little expensive upfront, but in the long run, the replacement blades are a lot cheaper and you can store them in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I followed the instructions on the box attaching the razor blade, I found that the threads on the handle were too small for the screw in the blade assembly.</li>
            <li> Anyway, Kelly Rippa said that she gave all the men in her life (including all the past guests on the Regis and Kelly show)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use if you have big hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I could describe how or why</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It appears I was unfortunate enough to receive a razor with a manufacturing defect.</li>
            <li> I have been using a safety razor for the past five years.</li>
            <li> It is honestly unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I was really sick of spending way too much money on name brand shavers only to get a mediocre shave.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a smoother and less painful experience than using a typical 5-blade razor.</li>
            <li> In the past I never looked forward to shaving, I hate facial hair except for my mustache especially because of the irritated skin and razor bumps I would get from shaving.</li>
            <li> The quality is not good and overall this is not a good product!</li>
            <li> The blades are thin and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Moved across the country and left my old razor behind like an idiot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really close shave, but I am disappointed that I have to take it apart in three pieces to change a blade.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard and usually clog the multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> so well I could hardly feel it working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is thick</li>
            <li> AND it comes with a thick leather cover for the head of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> No more whisker-city-kisses for this girl!  </li>
            <li> I believe they really mean customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> There are some serious quality issues that need to be addressed with this product.</li>
            <li> My path to this razor came out of a desire to stop paying ridiculous prices for disposable razors.</li>
            <li> No visible signs of wear on the threads, so possibly just &#x27;bad luck&#x27;.</li>
            <li> He can dull a blade in a couple of uses!</li>
            <li> No more complaints about buying stupidly expensive disposable razors at the store.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I prefer the shorter thicker handle to the longer thin</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor because I was tired of paying 30 bucks for replacement disposable blades.</li>
            <li> the safety issue of trying to tighten something with a thin blade sticking</li>
            <li> I have to shave every day for work and have had issues with irritation and poor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying tons of cash for disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of the Gillette throw away razors.</li>
            <li> It changes the shaving game from a chore to a hobby.</li>
            <li> the shipping took forever, and the customer support is not good at all!</li>
            <li> This was by far the worst in terms of burn and skin irritation that I have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chose the Shavology over the previous brand and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was unable to detach the head of the safety razor and insert a blade as the threads were damaged.</li>
            <li> The shafts difficult to screw off/on.  </li>
            <li> needless to say</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from the HIGHLY expensive disposible razors from Target and Walmart.</li>
            <li> It seems unnecessarily complicated (not to mention, easier to cut one&#x27;s self).  </li>
            <li> I used to shave with a Gillette Fusion razor blade until I realized how expensive the blades were.</li>
            <li> I had seen ads for this product and was skeptical of their claims.  </li>
            <li> I randomly chose this kit, after looking at some Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> I could never get that with expensive disposable razors.</li>
            <li> When I got this razor for Christmas (from my wife -- see disclaimer), all of the horrible slasher stories I&#x27;d heard about safety razors came back to me.</li>
            <li> There are tons of reviews of people cutting up their faces.</li>
            <li> It appears to be dangerous at this step and I need to remember to change blades when I am fully awake and have my glasses on.</li>
            <li> Now I just have to figure out how to shave with this crazy thing without nicking my face, as I am a newbie to safety razors😄.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I had to go through the others to find Shaveology!.</li>
            <li> Decided to switch over to the DE razor after years of razor bumps and bad shaves.</li>
            <li> bad buy.</li>
            <li> I had razor burn really bad on my neck for years.</li>
            <li> u wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Stick with it, and be patient, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed if you purchase it.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed!!!  </li>
            <li> This razor has horrible craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li> im not too picky when it comes to them, but this razor is horrible!</li>
            <li> When I try and shave it cuts my skin horribly!</li>
            <li> The shaver arrived in horrible condition.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Would give 5 stars... I got this for Christmas, it was supposed to come with a supply of razor blades. Never heard back from Shaveology, even after numerous attempts at contacting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is awesome</li>
            <li> nice kit, fancy box the blade holder feels sturdy. would of given it 5/5 but the sample blades feel cheap. its okay though, they were free. thanks shaveology.</li>
            <li> Moved across the country and left my old razor behind like an idiot. Decided to step it up and got a safety razor after hearing good things about them. Loving the product so far, and they&#x27;re even offering 60 days of free razors after a purchase. Razor works great, and comes with great instructions on how to maintain the razor, as well as tips for shaving, which is great for newcomers like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product so far, appreciate the extra mile with tutorials and free blades, and overall a very enjoyable shaving experience, much more so than a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Great shave compared to the disposable Fusion blades. Good balance and easier to use than expected. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;3G</li>
            <li> Best shave ever and way cheaper in the long run.  fantastic!</li>
            <li> Grate razor, is nice to say Good-bye to the expensive and bad quality plastic razors. Now I actually look forward to shave in the morning. It also makes a nice gift set. Very premium feel.&lt;br /&gt;Shaveology customer service is superb!! Looking toward to a complete kit from them.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Works great!</li>
            <li> Love it. Great product</li>
            <li> The best shave you have ever had!  The video is very helpful a nd I did not cut myself at all. The first swipe is very alarming because it gets to the base of the hair. My wife noticed the difference immediately. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Just got my Shaveology DE safety razor. My first time using a safety razor. Great shave for my first time I must say very comfortable shave I love it!</li>
            <li> I really excited when the razor arrived, because all I had seen was positive reviews. When I followed the instructions on the box attaching the razor blade, I found that the threads on the handle were too small for the screw in the blade assembly. I had to use a bench clamp and vice grips to remove it. There are some serious quality issues that need to be addressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Costs a little more than some others brands but it is well built and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love shaving with this razor. I was a little skeptical at first but it really is effortless shaving. It took a little time to get the angle correct but once you have that down, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  The handle is thick so it feels good in the hand, but I do wish it was just a little longer because I have large hands.  There are longer handle razors out there but they all seem to have really slender handles too.  Of the two options I prefer the shorter thicker handle to the longer thin one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of the leather head cover is fantastic and I&#x27;ll be holding on to it for use when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is good and I expect to use this razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> Really like it, 5 star</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this razor set.  High quality, great value, and engaged vendor.</li>
            <li> For years I have used the 4 and 5 bladed Gillette type razors and for years, my neck has been irritated after every single shave. I finally decided to try something different and went with this Shaveology Safety razor. let me just tell you it was one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve ever made. It took a little getting  used to but after watching the instructional videos on their site, I will never look back. My neck is no longer irritated and I get a great shave every time. I Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The razor really does provide a very good shave and the included blades are quite sharp.</li>
            <li> seems fine so far, cheaper and better quality shave then the pop-off head or disposable types.</li>
            <li> I have been battling my whole life to find and learn a solid shaving system and products. This has been difficult due to the fact that I inherited my fathers sensitive skin. While poking around different websites and book (including Art of Manliness and Real Men for Real Style) I found this kit. Bought it tried it out. Love the packaging love the product. Due to my education I have a semi educated mind on how materials are processed and how they are put together. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I like how the razor feels in my hand, its performance is awesome and my fiance has no complaints about how smooth my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is such a better option than spending stupid amounts of money on razors that have like ten blades in the razor head. I feel we have gotten to comfortable living with the mentality that everything needs to be fast and convenient. With this razor it forces you to take your time, and make sure the job is done right. Some of my best mornings have happened after shaving with this razor. It is surprisingly calming making the rest of my day convenient and efficient. Plus I feel like an old school &amp;#34;Mans man&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m finished. Which is never a bad thing.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:99393e4f427170cd053600b2b482bf2f]]I&#x27;m a startup guy, more specifically an entrepreneur from California. It&#x27;s no secret that safety razors and straight razors are making a big comeback among hipsters and \\&quot;manly men\\&quot;. I started hearing about this via social media, the Art of Manliness blog, and friends. I finally decided to dive in headfirst with this specific razor because of the high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;In my accompanying video, you will see my unboxing and I also just had my first shave....&lt;br /&gt;I know that I am not going back to Gillette or even the electric razors I used. The shave is VERY close, very comfortable, and I love the feel of the heavy duty metal. Quality-wise I would say 9/10 (not a perfect 10 yet because I have to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break or malfunction). Looking at the branding aspect of this company? WOW. Even more impressive how well they deliver their brand via their packaging (10/10), the accompanying items like the leather cover, the cleaning cloth, the 5 extra blades, and the awesome instructions and Free 60 Day blade supply (also 10/10). I love the logo, I love this product so far, and I am a very happy customer. 10/10 would buy again for myself or my pals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;ve been using the razor for over a month now. I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed. The blades are great and the razor itself is still working at 100%. No problems. I also uploaded the unboxing video so that you guys and gals can know what to expect when you order.</li>
            <li> used it at first few months... now it dosent screw on so well.. the blade is lose.. really lose. OH well. thought i was buying quality stuff.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a double edge razor feels more simple. Not the bad kind, more like the old reliable type that will last forever and doesn&#x27;t have to rely on crazy other add ons. Sort of like ol&#x27; Tim Duncan.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved with a razor in about 3 years because of the irritation it caused.  I had just used a trimer and looked rough. I got this razor a day earlier than the estimated date. It has a good feel its well constructed. It cut the stubble with almost no pull left a smooth shave with very little irritation. Great razor for the price I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The weight, feel, and craftwork are second to none.  I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a quality double-edge razor.</li>
            <li> My beard is one of the toughest and this razor works great! Good choice for anyone who is looking for a classic clean shave.</li>
            <li> Great safety razor, is durable and does what its supposed to.  I will say however that the blades that it comes with are not so reliable.  They seem to be low in quality.  Luckily you can find quality blades at low prices if you do your research.  I would highly recommend purchasing this safety razor at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Better than i spected!!! Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> absolutely looks amazing looks way better in person than it does in the picture I love how shave it is worth every penny😀👌👍</li>
            <li> I was unable to detach the head of the safety razor and insert a blade as the threads were damaged. Not very high quality. Emailed their support but have yet to hear back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Support got back to me in a couple days and shipped me a brand new kit which had no issues. I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product now that I have a working model.</li>
            <li> Today was my first shave using a safety razor. I am not sure why I was so scared of it because though there were couple of nicks, it was mostly drama free. I have been seeing videos and they helped and I think being calm and patient helped as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot really compare this razor to any other razors out there, but I can say that I did get a close shave and the razor was fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> A great shave for sensitive skin. Professional package with great tips on a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my son. He loves it!! It feels great in his hand and gives a very close shave. The kit is wonderful and everything is very well made. I strongly recommend this excellent Shavelogy double edge safety razor!!</li>
            <li> So Far I am satisfied with the product (I used it three times)&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered my 60 day free supply&lt;br /&gt;the nice thing also, the company provide 365 days of money back, which I found really impressive and they do stand out for their brand.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that people try it</li>
            <li> Shave like a pro or not at all.  Great shaving kit.  Great instructions.</li>
            <li> This is a well made, quality product. It performs really well too.</li>
            <li> This gives you the closest shave imaginable. I highly recommend this brand to everyone, male or female.</li>
            <li> I cannot give this razor a perfect 5... the reason being... it does give you a close shave... but it&#x27;s no different than a mach 3...its not aggressive enough to get that close shave that I want... some people might like it... but not that much for me... the Parker A1R did the job... and did it well.. and the Parker is portable... the reason I cannot give this razor a 5...</li>
            <li> ust tried it and it&#x27;s a very good shave. I look forward to trying it a few more times to get comfortable with it. After using it for a few shaves, I had to travel and went to my disposable gillette mach 3&#x27;s and having used this safety razor, my beard was gracefully taking the old typical razor I would use much smoother. I think the safety razor is great to get your beard growing in uniform direction. AND A GREAT SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li> This razor has horrible craftsmanship.  The shafts difficult to screw off/on.  The blade mount is not straight and aligned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent an email and filled out their contact form on the shaveology.co website and have received no response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I bought a silly little &amp;#34;polishing cloth&amp;#34; along with some blades and a leather travel cover for my money because I certainly didn&#x27;t buy a razor.  I bought JUNK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and put your money into a Merkur.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my BF. He has sensitive skin and he loved this razor!</li>
            <li> Just received my razor today, the packaging is first class I felt as if I was opening a high end razor. I will use this razor in the morning, so just judging off looks and feel I give this razor 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Quality Razor..As good as any other razors that are double the cost.</li>
            <li> After researching safety razors as a gift idea for my husband I came across Shaveology and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did. The look on my husband&#x27;s face was priceless! After opening the box up we were both pleased with the overall quality of the product. Shaveology really delivered! Best Christmas gift ever!</li>
            <li> Really liked this set. I bought it for a friend of mine on his hired a rather then going to the art of shaving and blowing two hundred dollar. I got this and it saved me a lot of money and it is worth the money and the quality is great</li>
            <li> I went back and forth on shaving sets for my husbands Christmas gift. I settled with this one due to reviews and that it came with a razor guard which is good for travel, and that it came with extra razors. I also thought the razor itself  black- looked really nice. My husband used  it for the first time and absolutely loved the set. The razor looks really nice, not cheap or like it will wear down. It is a good solid razor. No more complaints about buying stupidly expensive disposable razors at the store. Yayy!</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price</li>
            <li> A great product. Saves money and very elegant design.</li>
            <li> I like this new razor.  I have yet to watch the video and read the tips, so my belief is it can only get better.  I am also exited to receive a 60 day supply of blades!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do this often, but I gotta give this one 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old blade was a Merkur.  Unless I was extremely careful, it usually nicked me in the same places on my throat.  So anytime I was in a rush to shave, I was almost certain it would end with me having little trails of blood flowing around my Adam&#x27;s apple and/or chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Shaveology&#x27;s safety razor (with the exact same blades I&#x27;ve been using with the Merkur), it didn&#x27;t nick me once.  In fact, I&#x27;d say it shaved better than those expensive 5-blade razors that are more lubed up than my ex bent over the bed.  It had a black, &amp;#34;fatter&amp;#34; design (which I&#x27;m sure my ex would like) and offered superior protection between my skin and the blade (like the protection I should&#x27;ve used with my ex), so I was able to glide past my Adam&#x27;s apple and chin with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack was about 3 or 5 dollars cheaper than the lone Merkur that I bought (at the time) , and it came with some snazzy shaving accessories as well.  The design looks better and it feels better and it just is better.</li>
            <li> Used it once and gave a great shave.  Thank too my son how got it for me for Xmas</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, and I was skeptical at first.  That being said, I have been using the razor for the past month, and the shave is amazing.  It took about three shaves to get the technique correct, and then it has been perfect ever since.  I have never looked forward to shaving, like I do with my Shaveology safety razor.</li>
            <li> This safety razer is great. The blades are nice and sharp. I&#x27;ve been growin a full beard for about four months and the blade went through it like a hot knife through butter. Best shave I have ever had. Has a great feel and balance to it.</li>
            <li> Got the razor very fast as promised.  When I was in my twenties I used safety razor that the top opened up from the bottom of the handle.  Cant afford one of those now.  I&#x27;ve checked.  Saw Shaveology great price so thought I would give it a try.  First time I used it I wasnt quite sure if I made the right decision but after 2 or 3 times I realized I made the right decision.  Just took a little practice. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Since I never write reviews, I have to say... This is one of the best shaves I have ever had. I am able to get precise and clean shaves in half the time. I have been a member of Dollar Shave Club, used Gillette razors and everything far in between. This beats everything else.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Great shave. They even sent me free blades! Awesome product. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a house warming gift from my dad and boy was I surprised at the heft of this little razor. I assumed it would be cheaply made possibly out of plastic or some other cheap material but I was happy to pick it up and feel the metal. It came with a pack of 10 blades, and also came with a mail-in rebate for 10 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have ever used a single blade safety razor and with a little practice it soon became very easy to get a nice close shave. There are so many advantages to buying a razor like this, for instance the blades are ridiculously inexpensive, I just ordered a pack of 100 blades for under $15! (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0077LAJT2?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00) and will be reviewing those shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is like no other shave I have ever had, my face is baby smooth when I am done shaving. The Shaveology kit comes with a cleaning cloth, blade guard, the razor itself, and razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great advantage is if you are like me and don&#x27;t shave every day, your beard tends to grow out a little bit. With typical razors this poses a huge problem for me as the hair gets caught between the blades and no amount of rinsing helps. With this however because of how beautifully it is designed I no longer have this issue, effectively eliminating the need to use a electric shave for the first pass, and then using a razor for that smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned though, this is a new shaving experience and don&#x27;t be surprised when you cut yourself. Notice how I said when, it is not an if statement it is definitely a when statement. But hey we are men, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it wont bleed for long, but this is definitely a mans razor the kind our parents and grandparents used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically get 2 shaves out of each blade, but I am sure you could get a lot more, however in my opinion as inexpensive as blades are for these razors why not just change them each time you shave? Even if you shave every day a 100 pack will last you 3 months! That&#x27;s less then $5 bucks a month, shoot I don&#x27;t know about you but I may more then that a month for shaving cream :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure though that after each use you take the time to take the razor apart, rinse it and use the included cleaning cloth to keep the razor looking beautiful and it will last you a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh I forgot to mention, Shaveology also offers tutorial videos online, but to be honest you could get better videos on Youtube.h time you shave? Even if you shave every day a 100 pack will last you 3 months! That&#x27;s less then $5 bucks a month, shoot I don&#x27;t know about you but I may more then that a month for shaving cream :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure though that after each use you take the time to take the razor apart, rinse it and use the included cleaning cloth to keep the razor looking beautiful and it will last you a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh I forgot to mention, Shaveology also offers tutorial videos online, but to be honest you could get better videos on Youtube.</li>
            <li> Best razor ever! Starts with very nice packaging that let&#x27;s you know right away that this is a premium razor.  If your thinking of buying it then quit reading this and order now!  The upfront cost is a little more but the replacement blades cost next to nothing.  This razor will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I gotta say I was pretty excited to try new shaving system like this after years of using Mach 3 blades. So I came home ,showered, oiled my face, creamed up using a brush and tried my new shaveology kit. I gotta say I&#x27;m pretty pleased, smooth as can be and no nicks or cuts. I think I found what I&#x27;ve been looking for</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that as a GIRL having spent most of my life shaving 2/3 of my body I know that which razor you choose makes a difference. I was looking for a different type of Father&#x27;s Day gift for my hubby and after unproductively googling &amp;#34;gifts for men&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;unique gifts&amp;#34;, I remembered an episode of Live with Regis and Kelly (yes, it was a while ago- lol). Anyway, Kelly Rippa said that she gave all the men in her life (including all the past guests on the Regis and Kelly show) the Shaveology safety razor kit for Christmas. She raved about it and I believe she said it was really a gift for the women in their lives... so when I saw it on Amazon- I jumped at it.  No more whisker-city-kisses for this girl!  Let me start by saying- I didn&#x27;t realize a man&#x27;s face could get this smooth- my hubby has used the MACH-whatever for years and I always loved feeling his face--- now--- I don&#x27;t just love it- I am obsessed!!!  It is an amazing difference and totally worth it. The quality of the product is evident in its weight and construction right off the bat and this gift set includes 5 blades, a microfiber cloth and a case.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this Shaveology was very new experience for my husband he loved it very much. he has sensitive skin and finds that these razor works well and does not leave his skin irritated. This shaver seem to work better than those marketed one&#x27;s, and don&#x27;t have a strong scent. This razor came in a black box that had 5 Derby Extra blades. Now, when you get ready to shave with this razor make sure you tighten it tight after you put the blade in, This is a great razor, Just be warned everybody gets cuts here and there, even with a non-aggressive razor, just know that the more aggressive the razor, the closer the shave, thus the worse the cuts. my husband just got cut one&#x27;s he took it well&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a discount price for my honest review but all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Shaving with the Shaveology razor has been a life changing experience. Never have I had a closer shave. Sure, I cut myself a couple of times, but after watching the video and learning some techniques it has been smooth shaving. Now I shave the same way the Greatest Genneration did.</li>
            <li> Works great and the website was pretty neat. Buyer beware tho it is made in China.</li>
            <li> my last foray into single-blade safety razors (about 10yrs ago) was not pretty... needless to say, i had spent my whole life using the multi-blade gilette fusion  (or its predecessors) and therefore, had no clue what i was doing&lt;br /&gt;first off, you can NOT use the same amount of force you do with those razors - this blade is much sharper and  you will cut yourself all over the place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would say it took about three tries, to go gentle enough, but once i did... oh man... closest shave ever (outside of a barber shop)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m talking barely a shadow at 5pm (normally had a shadow much earlier with my previous razor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i already had a brush, and a stand - but if you don&#x27;t i would think that&#x27;s something they will be selling soon and hopefully it looks and performs nearly as well as this razor (the logo on top is beautiful and a very classy touch)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had more compliments on this set than anything else in my apt (no joke... or maybe that&#x27;s a sad statement on the rest of my apt, haha)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a blade lasts me about a month, but i shave every 3-4 days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the blades are so cheap that you&#x27;d be wondering why you ever used those expensive &amp;#34;quad&amp;#34; razors from those big guys anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use shaving cream and a badger brush - i feel the prep time is longer and overall shaving time is longer as well (as I need to go slower) - but i also feel i can go an extra day without shaving with this (as opposed to my old razor)</li>
            <li> Out standing product. Better than the originals I learned to shave on. A must have especially for those with baby faces</li>
            <li> Wow is this a value!! I&#x27;m new to this type of shave. The razor very nice looking and does a great job. The video is vary good on there site and helps a lot.  I&#x27;m still working finding the right shaving soap to use and learning about how to not cut myself.( in the same spots I aways cut myself with any razor). But the shave is so close and lasts longer than my old Harrys razor. Is worth it. I like that I can pamper myself with my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> Switched to this razor from a four bladed and haven&#x27;t looked back. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the included blades.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Amazing razor and customer service.</li>
            <li> Very good razor. Best close shave I&#x27;ve had yet. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Quality razor for this price. Definitely not disappointed. The kit would make a great gift as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a month now and I love it. It&#x27;s by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. This is my second safety razor, the first one was the Razor One, I had for 11 months and it broke. This razor seems very well made, and I&#x27;d be surprised if it ever broke. I haven&#x27;t tried the razors that came with it, I bought a pack of 100 Personna razors and I highly recommend those as well.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend. Nothing but compliments from him and his wife on the gift.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor because I was tired of paying 30 bucks for replacement disposable blades. I was a little nervous because of the potential for more cuts. After just two shaves I learned how to use it without getting cuts and the free e book that comes with this razor helped a lot. I will never go back to disposable again. This provides a good shave and the blades are cheap and extremely sharp. And shaveology made the transition very easy with their guide and great quality razor</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and a friend recommended I try a safety razor. This kit was on sale, so I make the purchase.  On my first pass, this razor easily cuts through my stubble, but I find it more difficult to cut against the grain. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and each time I have an easier time shaving. Despite this, I still draw blood on my neck and cause noticeable razor burn each shave. Overall, it is a smoother and less painful experience than using a typical 5-blade razor.</li>
            <li> Great! Make sure you watch the videos on how to use the razor properly, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> Great shave but it takes a bit to get it figured out if you are used to the cartridge razor.  Mine is built very well and came quick and professional.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor. High quality materials and finish. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than cartridges and shave nicer too.</li>
            <li> This is not my first safety razor but I will tell anyone who asks, you will not find a better razor at this price. The craftsmanship is outstanding and the shave is fantastic. My wife couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> I used to own a Merkur safety razor -- ended up losing it, and got the itch to go back to this style of shaving recently. After searching in Amazon, I came across Shaveology and took a chance ordering from the upstart. Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is presented nice, but when I went to install a blade the top would barely unscrew. It felt like the threads were too big, and was probably forced on by a machine. Once I actually got the top off and placed a razor on the knobs, it was impossible to get the thing screwed back together due to the thread issue. It would only go about half a turn, and even after using a towel it would not go nearly far enough to secure the blade -- let alone the safety issue of trying to tighten something with a thin blade sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick to the original. Go Merkur.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband.  I have purchased the barber straight razor blade, normal gillette razors, and other similar razors for men, but this was the most sharp and smooth shave of them all.  My husband prefers this as he swears it is less irritating and a much smoother experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement blades are not costly, a good deal and good quality product.</li>
            <li> We got this for my husband for fathers day. I spend a ton of money on razors because my husband shaves is head, his facial hair AND he&#x27;s a big Greek guy with thick hair strands! He can dull a blade in a couple of uses! I thought this would be a cool, unique but useful gift. It was a HIT!! My son being young couldn&#x27;t wait to give his gift to dad so we let him have it early. HE LOVES IT! He was so pleased with it that he even mentioned it on FB! HAHA!  He said he has never gotten a closer shave and very little  razor burn (which happens to him no matter what because he has such sensitive skin) but far less than he expected.  His grandfather always used a safety razor so it gave him more than just a great shave, but also took him back to a great memory of watching his pappo&amp;uacute;s shave while trying to teach my husband how with his broken funny English. Best gift we could have gotten him.  Also I decided to give it a try on my legs more out of curiosity and WOW. My legs are SMOOTH, not a single cut either :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This kit came with directions to website for tips (use it)  , a box of blades, a really good quality, sexy, sleek razor, a leather blade guard and a polishing towel. All packaged in a really nice box to keep it in good shape.  My opinion is that  this is a high quality, nice safety razor kit for a fraction of the price of other kits in the same class quality! I am getting one more as a gift for my dad for fathers day. Shipping was fast so I know i&#x27;ll get it in time.</li>
            <li> I received the product faster than expected. I am impressed with the quality abd the performance of the razor. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> 1st time I used it, it didn&#x27;t shave nothing. I read reviews of people having this problem and figured I must have done same mistake as they did. Further research I figured out I put safety on upside down, not letting bade bend properly. And for god sake people, lather your face with correct shaving soap! Or you will look like you just came out a prison fight. There are tons of reviews of people cutting up their faces. Please watch a YouTube video before using this shaver. It cuts a damn close shave! I would have gave 5 stars, but directions in kit are for experienced users, not novice. 3 peice safety razors are old school, but not everyone knows how to install properly. Too many people over tight and brake razor. This kit looks nice, but I&#x27;m afraid the micro touch is better bang for your buck. Quality is decent and should last a while. I give creator lots of credit on presentation, that&#x27;s what sold Me. Bottom line $30 is a good price for what you get here.</li>
            <li> Started using this razor last week and man I LOVE IT! Buy this!</li>
            <li> Best shave i have ever had..better than any other razor blades that have 3 to 5 blades..1 blade with this safety razor is the way to go..u wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> With the rising cost of traditional razors and their cartridge refills, my dad has recently expressed interest in trying an old fashioned safety razor. When this kit arrived in the mail, he was not disappointed. This safety razor set makes a great gift! It includes the razor, five blades, a leather blade cover, and a polishing rag. The razor feels sturdy and solid, with just enough weight to be effective. The leather blade cover will really come in handy, keeping the razor head and blade safe between uses. This kit is a nice start for anyone interested in trying a safety razor, or a seasoned wet shaving pro. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Beautiful design! Very sleek and elegant. The razor is top quality and works great it&#x27;s the closest shave my husband has ever gotten! It all comes in a beautiful gift set. It&#x27;s a ready to give present. Comes with everything you need to get started! I suggest watching their videos as you will learn so much and get a much better shave, they explain how to angle it and all. Don&#x27;t forget to watch those! He&#x27;s really enjoying his new razor set and very happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head almost everyday so he need a high quality safety razor and this set is awesome! It would be a GREAT father&#x27;s day present. It is such a good value for everything you get. We will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I used the Gilette 3 blade razor and my neck always broke out for some reason. It did not matter which direction I shaved, my neck always broke out. I decided to try this Shaveology Saftey Razor and the breakouts went away COMPLETELY! Could not be more happy with this razor. If you have a problem with breakouts after shaving, give this razor a try.</li>
            <li> Got the product before the delivery time. Great customer services with super quick and friendly responses. Came in great package with &amp;#34;keep looking finish&amp;#34; with great detail. First time user so watch quick video and use it. I was nervous. However, Great and Clean shave with out any cuts. The Razor has the right balance. The leather cover is so nicely done including gold print and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;Seller should consider complimentary engraving  on the shaft (just an idea :-))!!!!. I have already recomended it to my friends and family for the great product you get for the great price range. Thank you so much for sending the 60 days complimentary blades.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; look with new feel...this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the feel of my fiance&#x27;s face after he shaves with his new Shaveology Double Edge Safety Razor Set!  I keep teasing him that I am going to start using it.  Hopefully there will be some eye catching Shaveology sets for women around Christmas time!!</li>
            <li> Recently, my wife purchased this razor for me and I am very happy with the results. I was getting tired of the progressive growth of the new blades going from 2 - ??, I should have listened to my father. The one blade concept is still the best, I will continue to stock my drawer with the single blades and forget the rest. In addition to the razor she bought me a brush and the shave soap, great stuff!</li>
            <li> Perfect shave and the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.. not to mention replacement &amp;#34;safety blades&amp;#34; are beyond cheap $15 for 50 or so, making shaving one of the cheapest things you can do to maintain your appearance.</li>
            <li> This is better than any Gillette or Schick razors. I use shave oil along with this product, and got amazing results. It would have gotten 5 starts, but the razor head is a bit loose unless I overtighten it (which is not a great idea).</li>
            <li> Great looking razor,awesome smooth shaves,I don&#x27;t use the blades that came with it,I use feather blades which I used before with another razor&lt;br /&gt;and totally different results,great razor with a great price! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> very nice, light pressure does the job</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been waiting for! The best part of my morning is having an awesome shave and enjoying my espresso. The only thing is I&#x27;m an Airline Pilot so I can&#x27;t travel with the razor. So I&#x27;m hoping shaveology can design a cartridge razor that beats the prices and having to stick with a Mach 3 blade on the road.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, shaves better than my merkur.  Its a little shorter than the murker but has a heavier feel.  The shave is excellent, I can actually hear it gliding across my face, but there is absolutely no discomfort.  Wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor shaving experience. The shaveology razor is awesome. I have been using it for a week now and I am no longer having issues with ingrown hairs or rashy neck. The razor has a great weight to it. I can&#x27;t wait to the a stand and brush for a complete set.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a safety razor and chose this one based of the reviews. Definitely easier than I thought it would be and it was probably the smoothest shave of my life.</li>
            <li> I originally got this for my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day gift (such a unique gift!), but when it arrived, I couldn&#x27;t keep the surprise!  I gave it to him right away, and he is in love!  He actually said, &amp;#34;where has this been all my life?!&amp;#34;  He hates shaving, so that&#x27;s saying a lot!  I&#x27;m debating buying another one for myself, to use on my legs!!!!  Who cares that it&#x27;s a razor for men!</li>
            <li> just got it today. wow, packaging is simplistically wonderful. The razor is beautiful. Works amazing. love the double edge! mass market doesn&#x27;t make anything this elegant anymore. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered one. This would make a great father&#x27;s day/ birthday/ Christmas/ anniversary gift.</li>
            <li> Great weight, very balanced, easy to use and clean. Would be nice for first time wet shaver or long time vet. Good investment and a stylish piece, almost like a conversation starter in my bathroom lol.</li>
            <li> The kit is everything advertised and more. Good quality materials, the video instructions are quite good, and once you get used to using a safety razor, the shave is close and smooth.</li>
            <li> Women looking for a single blade razor, look no further. I had suffered from shaving irritation and ingrown hairs on my legs for years. After consulting a dermatologist about this I was told that the exorbitantly priced, multi blade razors I was using were the problem. After reading about several products and their reviews I decided to give Shaveology a shot and I&#x27;m so glad I did. The package came attractively boxed and the razor itself is beautiful. It has a nice weight to it and is easy to handle. This being said there was a learning curve, during which I nicked myself a lot. I found that little or no pressure is needed and slowing down solved that issue. Several weeks later and my legs look fantastic and I have also significantly reduced the amount of money I was spending. Thank you Shaveology!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a safety razor since I started shaving (a hundred years ago!) and it really is a nice break from the fast and furious shaving done in the shower. This allows me to relax and take my time in the bath .. suggestion: watch the video! There are great tips to avoid nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product. Got a discounted cost for this so i decided to buy it for father&#x27;s day, my husband loved. He said he never had a smoother shave. A must buy for the men in your lives. Quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> whenever I shave, I have series of issues with bumps and cuts. I recently purchased Shaveology double edged safety Razor and used it twice. its has been two days since and I&#x27;ve not had any issues. The weight of the razor allows it to cut without applying a lot of pressure to the handle and this I found to be very very helpful to avoid cuts and bruises.&lt;br /&gt;User experience I&#x27;d say is amazing. I have enjoyed it so far and I look forward to enjoying more of it.</li>
            <li> Razor is well balanced, provides excellent closeness of shave without scraping the skin off your neck. Good product. Recommended to my brother and would recommend Shaveology products to other friends who are looking to move away from multi-bladed disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to get into double edge shaving. I was a little intimidated by the whole process, but the shaveology kit comes with easy instructions. It brings a new level of sophistication to shaving. I&#x27;m very happy with my shaveology razor. All of the parts seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from the HIGHLY expensive disposible razors from Target and Walmart. I decided to give a Safety Razor a try. After much homework, I came across this beauty and saw the fantastic reviews. I decided to give it a try and was very impressed. A little expensive upfront, but in the long run, the replacement blades are a lot cheaper and you can store them in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;I used my razor this morning and was sold. I am glad that I made a great investment for my shaving needs. I recommend this product to anyone that wants to give safety razors a try.</li>
            <li> This product, like advertised, gave me the best shave of my life. Product is very attractive and does the job. Love the little towel they give you to lay out all your stuff on. Highly recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> It was a nice razor but too small for my hands. I ended up replacing it with Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor. The new razor fits my hand perfectly and feels like a better quality product.</li>
            <li> Came fast and nice packaging. It&#x27;s a nice old school shave. The replacement blades are really cheap. It&#x27;s a little too soon to tell if it helps with skin irritation. My husband often gets razor rash on his neck and switching the razor every week has really helped. Hopefully this razor will make it even better. This safety razor was a great unique gift for my husband!</li>
            <li> fast delivery. quality product. easy to use. good weight.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9abe32e575f561a99633760644141da8]]Great product!  My husband has always had a hard time with a comfortable shave.  He would always get blotchy and irritated whether he used a standard disposable razor head or an electric razor.  This lead to him sometimes going a week in between shaves!  When this product came up for review I was SOOO excited because I had already heard good things.  We received this safety razor kit in exchange for an honest review so here it is- this product is totally worth the money!!  Works amazing, we will definitely be sticking with it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he absolutely loved it. He loved the sleep design and the packaging it came in. He said it works great and he plans on using it often!</li>
            <li> My husband was super nervous about trying this Double Edge safety razor set for his weekly shave, but he loves when he gets a hair cut cause his barber uses a straight blade to touch it all up and he loves it. So after he tried this he loved it. The safety razor gets a nice close shave and his skin feels so smooth afterwards. The blade is nice and sharp too and he feels like he stepped out of the barber after using it, its a unique gift for a guy. It makes a great &amp;#34;mens gift&amp;#34; for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Great entry level Safety Razor. My boyfriend has been using this for almost 8 months now and he loves it. He used to use Shick Quatro razors but wanted to try a safety razor. He enjoys this razor better than the cartridge razors now. He read the guide on safety razors at artofmanliness.com before getting this and it helped a lot. It also came with an offer for some more free razor blades.</li>
            <li> I just finished using my new shaveology razor I got to say I am impressed with it! Its very well balanced, fits and handles well in my hand. The blades seems up to speed also. I think its a great system,  I am new to wet shaving or should I say returning to wet shaving.  I did a lot of research on good razors and what sold on this old the guarantee that I totally satisfied or full refund,  no questions asked. That speaks volumes in my book. Its a good solid instrument, sturdy should last to past along to my grandson. I do know I will be buying 2 more for nephews.  Would I recommend this razor?  Without question! ! I will be evaluating it very close from top to bottom. I believe they really mean customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for about a month and it is far and away the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. My wife bought the razor along with Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set and I have been blown away. Keep in mind that you must take your time with a safety razor so it takes longer to shave than with a modern cartridge razor. I use a pre-shave wash when I shave with the razor and I rarely need aftershave when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the weight of the razor. It feels like I&#x27;m holding something solidly made, something of quality instead of a cheap piece of plastic. Be sure to check out the materials Shaveology offers to help you get started. I will definitely be using this company in the future for my grooming needs.</li>
            <li> Very much enjoying the new razor</li>
            <li> I bought this because I could not stand the price of regular razor blades. This type of shaving, though, is sort of a ritual and you have dedicate some time to it every morning, more so than other shaving  methods. The shave itself, though, is closer than disposables. If that is important to you, and you have the time, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed. I wanted to love this, and I might later down the road when I have the money to invest in sharper blades, but the ones that come in the kit aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut my hair. I have thick facial hair and it did not like the shaver at all. It might be a bit &amp;#34;too beginner&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Has a nice, quality weight to the razor. Easy and quick to clean. Any blades will fit. I used the provided shaveology blades and got a very close shave. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who would listen.</li>
            <li> I gotta say I really like this razor. It&#x27;s nice and smooth and works great. Anyone out here looking for a quality razor should really give this one a serious consideration.</li>
            <li> I had other safety razors before, but this one tops them all. I got this kit as a birthday present from my wife this year. The shave is so smooth that you will love it.</li>
            <li> The double edge safety razor is definitely the way to go.  Shaveology makes a great razor that&#x27;s very easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Surpassed my expectations. As a professional, I am required to shave everyday for my job, and there is nothing worse than having cuts or spots on your skin where you have missed. I have tried every razor, gimmick, etc. that is offered on the market. I have spent a ton of money trying to find a razor to give me a close, clean shave without cutting my skin. The Shaveology Safety Razor was nothing short of providing an amazing shave! I have already told several friends and family about this product. Its easy to use, easy to clean and the replacement razors are cheap. Make sure to take it apart and clean the blade to keep the razor in good condition. Overall, if you were new to a product like this like I was, go to their website and watch some of the how-to videos.</li>
            <li> Im going to make this short and to the point.&lt;br /&gt;I have always wanted to go to a safety razor wet shave and since doing so I wonder why did I wait so long.&lt;br /&gt;Jump in order the correct product from SHAVOLOGY watch the videos to get a idea and run with it.&lt;br /&gt;Now I only used sensor 2 blade forever so going to a single blade was a snap.&lt;br /&gt;Now I look forward to how relaxing taking a shave could be.&lt;br /&gt;Michael P</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with the purchase, quality, and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Hungarian, therefor I basically grow facial hair that is thick, full, coarse, and dark. With cartridge or electric razors I basically had a 10AM shadow, 5 o&#x27;clock is a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a good lather, and a good 40 minutes of my morning. The shave is closer and more comfortable than I&#x27;ve ever experienced. In fact, 24 hours later, is about the length I was at by 10AM with my old shave. Impressed by the quality and classy look of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife approves this message.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the product. Has totally transformed the way I shave. Moved away from super expensive six blade cartridges. Have saved a ton of money. It took awhile for my beard to adapt but I just can&#x27;t see myself ever going back.</li>
            <li> To put it simply, classy set for the price. The razor is very well made and the packaging is very nice. The blades that come with it are pretty good too, although i do prefer different ones.</li>
            <li> Survived the first shave, and wow! I&#x27;m impressed!  Had my doubts but thought it was worth a try.  No question, I am staying away from those 5 blade monstrosities!</li>
            <li> Everything from the packaging to the razor itself was top notch. The razor looks great and has a very nice weight to it. Overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a safety blade and I think this is a very good starter pack</li>
            <li> I have to shave every day for work and have had issues with irritation and poor shaves so I decided to make the jump to a safety razor and give it a try. So far I have had great results. This razor has some weight and seems to be good quality and it was very reasonably priced. It came with very nice packaging with polishing cloth, leather protector and 5 blades to get you started, along with another 60 days worth of blades for free from their website. The only complaint so far is that it doesn&#x27;t have any instructions in the box other than how to load your blade, but they do have tips and tricks on their website. I would suggest this as a great choice for anyone getting started with safety razors.</li>
            <li> The single blade razor is perfect for the shave I desire. My wife even comments on how smooth my face has gotten thanks to this razor! Plus after you receive the package you can sign up to receive a free 60 day blade set!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really close shave, but I am disappointed that I have to take it apart in three pieces to change a blade.  It seems unnecessarily complicated (not to mention, easier to cut one&#x27;s self).  All other safety razors I have seen have a butterfly opening.  I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this type if I had known.</li>
            <li> The razor has an extremely nice and comfortable weight, I only nicked myself once out of my first time using a razor like this (i&#x27;m used to the crappy disposable gilette razor). The razor is made out of truly high quality metal, and has a pristine leather handle. It also comes with great razors for starting, and it comes with a membership so you can get free great razors for a month.</li>
            <li> So far so good. This razor looks really nice and safe to use. Had it for only few days but works really good. Hope it stays the same!</li>
            <li> Feels good not heavy. Balanced very well.</li>
            <li> I shaved with a Gillette safety razor from the first time I shaved till in my 40&#x27;s. I switched to a multiblade cartridge for some unknown reason and never looked back. Guess I felt &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34;. About a year ago I got fed up with the BS you have to go through at the store to get blades so I bought my first electric razor, a Norelco. I never was happy with the electric shaving experience and was happy when the damn thing broke.&lt;br /&gt;Back to cartirdges, I noticed a lot of TV ads for safety razors. Everything old becomes new again. I ordered the Phantom set because it reminded me of my old Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;It works. My face feels smoother. I&#x27;m going through a re-learning curve and have nicked myself a few times. Not the razors fault.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going the brush and mug routine, still using Gilllette foamy shave crem.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way the Gillette razor opened up when I turned the bottom. The Phantom does not open that way. With the phantom, you unscrew the whole top to place in a rzor. It appears to be dangerous at this step and I need to remember to change blades when I am fully awake and have my glasses on. There are no instructions on how the razor works included with the kit.</li>
            <li> First off this is Mr. Leah Montgomery, we don&#x27;t have a bearded lady situation happening here, but I received this as a fathers day present a couple days early, as Leah stole my old safety razor after shaving her legs with it. My first thought after shaving with my new Shaveology Razor, is don&#x27;t let her shave her legs with it, or it will be gone too. I was expecting a razor like I had purchased before, as this one wasn&#x27;t that much more expensive, especially with the extras that came with it. But for a few $$ more it is definitely a superior razor. I especially like the construction of it, there are no hinges, or shafts running through the handle to open and close as you change blades, less stuff to fail over time, I can see this lasting for a long long time. I found it gave me a better shave as well, and I wasn&#x27;t aware that I wasn&#x27;t happy with my old razor, so a pleasant surprise. So I think if you are just starting out, or are just needing a new razor, this is a solid product and you will get your $$ worth.</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble getting a nice close shave with regular disposable razors and, on the advice of a friend, decided to try a safety razor. I&#x27;m glad I did. While it does take longer to shave everything else is superior. The blades are much cheaper. The shave is closer (with less razor burn) and there is something to be said for being forced to slow down and do things right. Also, not going to lie, it feels pretty manly to use a safety razor. So far this one has held up well. I like the weight and handle and the construction feels solid. Recommended.</li>
            <li> okay starter kit for a newbie</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time. I can honestly say that this is the best shave I have ever had and Shaveology seems like a great company. Along with the five razors included in this set I was able to get a 60 day supply free. I am incredibly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> First ever buying a razor like this. This razor gives an unbelievable soft shave. I would recommend this product to any guy who shaves.</li>
            <li> I have had better shaves from this razor than any in my life. It takes practice and patience, but it is absolutely worth it. Great purchase. Great service from Shaveology. Great experience overall.</li>
            <li> Decided to switch over to the DE razor after years of razor bumps and bad shaves. First couple shaves and I&#x27;m hooked, no razor burn and no paying out the ears for razors. Will be telling the guys at the firehouse about this.</li>
            <li> By far the best safety razor I have had!&lt;br /&gt;On top of it being an axing product this company truely supports its servicemen! Thank guys!</li>
            <li> Good product once you get used to the new way of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I grew up on disposables and there is no way to compare the two. So this is my advice... go find your disposables and dispose of them. Plus the razors for the safety razor are way cheaper. I highly recommend this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also... I always bought the Gillette fusion razors because of the extra blade on the back for right under my nose... This saftey razor takes care of that too. No nicks, no cuts, no turning back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funniest part is after shaving with this razor... I look forward to shaving now.</li>
            <li> There is nothing that I don&#x27;t like about this razor.  It has a great weight, fantastic gift box, and is truly a joy to shave with.  Keep it I Shaveology</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  Too heavy for my use. Double-blade throw aways do a better/faster job.</li>
            <li> So far I love this razor.  This is my first safety razor and I did a ton of research...handle lengths, weight, aggressiveness, quality, precision position of blade, etc etc.  I settled on this as my first razor and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I feel this isn&#x27;t probably an overly aggressive blade, but since I don&#x27;t have a comparison I could be off on that.  I have found that some attention needs to be paid to making sure you have the blade seated evenly as you tighten the handle but I think I&#x27;d find myself doing this with any razor.  I&#x27;ve been completely happy so far and very much enjoying this transition from the Gilette Mach3 that I&#x27;ve used for so many years.</li>
            <li> Shaved my balls with this and they&#x27;re smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass great product! Nice build quality</li>
            <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE . ITS REALLY EFFECTIVE PRODUCT. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL.</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a while.  Take the time to learn how to do this properly (YouTube) with a brush, shaving bowl, and all the (pre/post-shave oils).  It takes longer, and is more expensive, but I&#x27;ve never had a cleaner shave - WITHOUT ANY irritation or bumps afterward.  They completely went away as soon as I started using quality products.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. I have recently returned to using a double edge razor. Purchased the one on TV, was looking to up-grade. This is how I started shaving many moons ago. Very nice packaging. Definitely worthy of gift giving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice feel in your hands and seems well balanced. Get a nice close shave. I would have to say that it is a medium aggressive razor. Even getting used to the feel of a new razor, no nicks, yet.....lol and knock on wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to take it apart to clean / change blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service. I have communicated via e-mail with Kenny, a co-owner. Very helpful and eager to please. To me that speaks volumes about the company I am doing business with.. A lot of nice extras on their web site to help you get the most from your razor and shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/7/15 - Up-dated......Changed to 5 stars. After completing the new routine, I now know the reason for the dis-assembly of the razor. Even after rinsing under the faucet, when I took it apart to clean ( like in their video ), I was amazed at how much of the soap was on the blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Thanx to Kenny and the people at Shaveology for making this a truly enjoyable learning experience. Look forward to the coming new products.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price! Very close and clean shave with little to no irritation, every time. Looks cool as well</li>
            <li> Provided a good shave but the handle is smaller than most other razors (gillete, etc.) so it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use if you have big hands.</li>
            <li> I got this for a unique gift for my husband to try, who has a heavy and coarse beard. He used it for the first time last night after carefully watching the informative videos that Shaveology has posted, which is an important step to get the most optimal results as it tells you how to adjust the tension on the razor blades just right and how to use the razor itself. Shaving with the double edged safety razor is not complicated, at all, and my husband was extremely surprised he only had to make one pass with the razor, and said it was the closest shave he has ever achieved; he has used both high end disposable and electric razors. One tip that he said was helpful was to apply a really warm wash cloth to his face for a few minutes prior to shaving to open the pores up, which allows for the closest shave possible; you could also achieve this by taking a hot shower prior to shaving. The razors themselves are very good quality with weight to them - not the cheapy throw away type. I don&#x27;t think my hubby will ever use anything different! Great product and would make a great men&#x27;s gift (or women&#x27;s gift) for that guy who has everything - the packaging is so nice all you&#x27;d have to do is put a bow on it!</li>
            <li> This safety razor set makes such an amazing and unique gift for any man in your life. If you&#x27;re looking for men&#x27;s gifts, please don&#x27;t look any further. The razor is such a heavy, quality, and durable piece of equipment you won&#x27;t want to put it down. It&#x27;s incredible and gives you a feel of the old traditional barbershops with the beautiful leather towel and case. It comes with some very sharp razor blades that provide such a clean and close shave. Our other shavers would pull the hair and swipe many times. One swipe with this one and you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s extremely easy to clean as opposed to our other razors where you have to constantly apply water or hit it to get the clogged hair out. Highly recommend and it will NOT disappoint!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://youtu.be/TCQ82GyfKcc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite of brands of razors before. But none of them can hold a candle to Shaveology. There is nothing like the old school way of shaving.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THE PRODUCT ON TIME. It is as good as they say. So, my opinion to everyone, buy it! Worth your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Shaveology team.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband for our anniversary. It&#x27;s been a couple months and he LOVES it!!</li>
            <li> I really like this razor,  the weight is good,  the grip is nice,  I like that it has the cover.  The only reason I docked a point was that it tends to loosen up now and again which is a little troublesome.  Otherwise I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li> Excellent ! Very close shave on beard and head. As good as a barbershop.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first experience with a safety razor and will be my last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving my head for 2.5 years now and have tried many different razors and soaps/cream/gels over that time.  This was by far the worst in terms of burn and skin irritation that I have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition as I was packing up the razor the middle part of the handle broke free and spun in place.  To screw it back on I had to grip the razor on the very bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li> This old school razor is fantastic. As a military man shaving daily is obviously a requirement. Using this razor not only makes it enjoyable but also gives me the closest shave I have ever achieved without irritation. I have very sensitive skin and until using this razor I have never been able to shave against the grain without wicked razor burn and the bumps and ingrown hairs that come along with it. I have been using this razor for about a week now coupled with the shaving methods of 1940 i.e. badger hair brush, nice thick later from shaving soap, and shaving oil and have been shaving against the grain experiencing the closest shave I have ever achieved without irritating my skin. I highly recommend this product for every man, especially those with particularly sensitive skin. It does take a few shaves to get used to the razor and how to shave with it but after that it is amazing.</li>
            <li> After about 3 years of being well bearded, circumstances changed that forced me to seek new employment. I don&#x27;t care how well qualified, or confident you are. Few employers are going to hire someone with the kind of beard I had (think Zack Galfanalkis in The Hangover). So, I dusted off my old norelco rotary electric shaver, and said goodbye to my furry friend. Cut to a few weeks later, and I am not enjoying the quality of my shaves at all. I seemed to remember my electric doing a much better job, but then I hadn&#x27;t used it for 3 years, so I thought, I&#x27;d better buy a new one. So here I am about to drop $80 on a newer norelco, shaver 8100 or some such thing like that, when it occurred to me that maybe I should try a blade, see I&#x27;d always used an electric since I was 16 or so. So long story short, I did a lot of research that led me to sites like badger &amp; blade, and the art of manliness, and I decided to take the plunge into wet shaving. Now it seems the general consensus in the wet shaver community is to start with an Edwin Jagger, or a Merkur. I went with this here shaveology phantom because it was cheaper, and in my opinion, looks just as sleek. Again, this was my first experience with a DE safety razor, but it was extremely positive. I had a little irritation, but I&#x27;m sure that was due to my technique, or lack thereof. I was extremely satisfied with the performance, it truly delivers the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I like it so much, I threw my electric in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Works great without clogging up and appears to be extremely well made.</li>
            <li> The packaging is superb for this product. Once you open the box, it gets even better. You get a razor, towel, and extra blades in a neat display. I tried shaving with it and nicked myself a few times as I&#x27;ve never used a razor like this. My wife tried it on her legs and loved it though. I will stick to the safety multi-blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love the Shaveology razor! It is really simple to use and the clean up is easy as well This is my first time trying this type of razor and I am hooked, I don&#x27;t even touch my other razors anymore.</li>
            <li> I have no words for the aftermath of what this razor has done to me. The second I was done shaving, I instantly sprouted a full beard. I immediately went into the kitchen and ate 12 eggs raw and a package of bacon, and drank a whole bottle of Jack Daniels. I impregnated my wife simply by staring at her. I then went to work and demanded a salary increase and promotion. When I was denied, I then took over the company. I got my blood work done and the doctor said my testosterone levels were 100,543 times the normal level. This razor ruined my life.</li>
            <li> This is a good for a beginner. I used to shave with a Gillette Fusion razor blade until I realized how expensive the blades were. I decided to order this since I&#x27;ve seen so many articles and posts that swore shaving with a Safety razor was the best. I threw away my Gillette when I got this kit in the mail. The blade has a nice weight to it. It was definitely heavier than my old Gillette (since it wasn&#x27;t mostly plastic). The razor cuts just fine through my facial hair. I don&#x27;t replace the blades that often. Probably like once every 12 shaves (my facial hair isn&#x27;t as thick and I shave around 1-2 times a week). There are instructions for 5 additional blades (60 day supply) that comes with this kit!!! It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> Love it first time user but the razor works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a replacement for one I just previously received that was garbage.  This razor is identical to one I purchased from &#x27;Re Art of Shaving&#x27; for twice the price.  The Shaveology came very well package, with a head cover, polishing cloth and five individually wrapped blades. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the quality and value.  I&#x27;m sticking with Shaveology for all of my shaving equipment.  I&#x27;m sorry I had to go through the others to find Shaveology!.</li>
            <li> Inly design flaw is the completely smooth handle, it gets super slippery if your hands have soap on them. Other than that i would  highly recommend! It is extremely comfortable and provides a very close and smooth shave. The package its delivered in is top notch as well.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Feels good in the hand, nice weight, overall good experience. Provided a good shave. I have a fairly thick beard and usually clog the multi blade razors. A couple of passess with this and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get skin irritation too, hasn&#x27;t been an issue with this as long as I take my time and pay attention to what I&#x27;m doing and use proper technique.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s got a good heft to it.</li>
            <li> Great company. Awesome shave.</li>
            <li> Nice looking product but single blade shaving just isn&#x27;t for me.  Gave it a week and just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> My husband says this is a very good razor.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of getting started with a double-edge razor (after an almost-subscription to the Dollar Shave Club - whew!) and found this. I&#x27;m glad I did. I haven&#x27;t spent much time shaving with this razor but I&#x27;ve very impressed so far. It is heavy, solid, easy and does a great job on the shave!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product.  Great shave.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He&#x27;s been using it for over 6 months and loves it. It took some practice and getting used to but he says he&#x27;s never going back to a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; razor.</li>
            <li> It was my first with this kind of razor. I have sensitive skin and I decided to give it a try. Well, let me tell you that&#x27;s there&#x27;s nothing better than this razor. Shaves wonderful and leaves my skin very smooth. Wonderful razor</li>
            <li> Excellent shave kit for the price!</li>
            <li> One of the best shaves I have ever had. It took a few weeks for my skin to really get used to it. Very high quality shaving blades. You won&#x27;t go back to your old razor after you have tried this.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good wet to get you started into wet shaving. The razor is a nice build quality. I would say it&#x27;s semi aggressive. Good buy</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he loves it! It works well, is easy to use, and a sturdy product. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll ever go back to standard razors again!</li>
            <li> I received my Shaveology kit for Christmas and I am so excited! I will be writing a followup review as I use the product. But to start this off, the packaging and tools included in the kit are very well made. Nothing seems cheep or of inferior make. Of further interest was the level of support and information provided by the manufacturer Shaveology. I was very impressed with the concern Shaveology showed in making sure I was satisfied with my product and that I fully understood the technique and material used in a traditional wet shave. All of their information was located on there well made website. I even sent off a request for information (on Christmas) on any Shaveology lather, brushes, and aftershave. I received a reply within 15 min from a real person! Very impressive. Again, I will write a follow up review once I get a chance to really use the razor.</li>
            <li> I only shaved with it once but it is the closes shave i have gotten.</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas this year. Always wanted to try the old school shave. I&#x27;m tired of paying tons of cash for disposable razors. i haven&#x27;t used this yet, however looking forward to the first shave. Product comes in a really nice package. I really like that there is a video to watch that covers how to put together, use and how to maintain this razor. Plus they give you an additional 60 day supply of free blades. Will post a follow on posting after I&#x27;ve had the chance to use this razor.</li>
            <li> Razor handle is loose, spins when detaching the head. Contacted shaveology  through their site regarding the issue 3 days ago requesting an exchange, no response.&lt;br /&gt;**update**&lt;br /&gt;Response to the comment was fast, but no email received. Will attempt to resolve by phone. Despite the loose handle making it a bit tedious to use, the shave is excellent. Love the sleeve and towel. Hope to say the same of the razor once I can exchange.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat this deal if you&#x27;re thinking about getting into the double edge/safety razor shaving.  Be sure to get a stand to hold it vertically as well as your brush.  Takes more time, but a much more luxurious experience (and much cheaper!!!) than traditional blades and creams.  Just make sure to watch the videos, as it does require a change in shaving technique-you can slice your face up if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! He used to shave with the store bought razors and compares this razor to shaving with a light saber and the store bought ones he used before to a wooden spoon! That should tell you a lot lol, he said it takes him longer to shave but it is definitely worth the extra minutes spent. His face looks so smooth and clean! Both he and I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price. Good quality, good design, elegant.</li>
            <li> Good weight to it. Not too big. Much better than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Best double edge razor i own, see since i am a barber i gone thru a lot of double edge razors and straight razors. I rated this five star because of the kit and best quality replacement blades. Shaveology is best for new users and experienced users who use a double edged razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and just received the package. I haven&#x27;t opened it but so far just looking at the packaging makes me think it&#x27;s very good quality. I think my boyfriend will absolutely love it. He said that he didn&#x27;t want a straight blade razor but I think this one is different enough to as what he would want. He really wanted the brush and shave soaps to use so I think this will be an excellent addition to the set I got him for Christmas. After reading all the other reviews, I believe that he is going to be ecstatic about it and so thankful that I got it for him. Now I&#x27;m going to watch the videos that train on how to use it just because I&#x27;m so interested in learning now too after I read all these reviews! Thanks shaveology for making your product available!</li>
            <li> Great Customer Service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing gift for my boyfriend he loved it and even came with a promotional 60 days of free razor blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came with very detailed instructions e-book for a perfect shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would Absolutely Recommend this Set to Anyone looking for a great product or gift!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband. He absolutely loves them.. + so do I, a very smooth shave. He has never looked better! Just a side note: the blades are very SHARP, so keep away from children/animals/anyone clumsy and handle with caution- especially on your first shave. They do such a good job because they&#x27;re so sharp! HIGH quality! + Family owned, the customer service is seriously incomparable to any. AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Super classy and comfortable shave at a VERY reasonable price! Really good service/delivery as well (received a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34;-guide almost instantly and the Shaveology-set followed within only a couple of days). I look forward to seeing what else they come out with!!</li>
            <li> I have only used the razor for a couple of days but it already seems like a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have had a great deal of skin irritation and razor bumps using electric and disposable razors... Using this razor my skin is already starting to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I think it is less of a pain to shave with this than making multiple passes with electric - this does provide a close shave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cap it all off, this company is providing a product that looks and feels good, with nice touches like a blade guard, up to 60 days of blades and information on using the razor properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this buy.</li>
            <li> I love this razor! I&#x27;ve been spending far too much money on cartridge razors over the years.  I get a great shave with the double edge safety razor and don&#x27;t get the razor bumps I used to. It gets some getting used to (nicks and cuts), but after a couple shaves, you&#x27;ll have it down in no time.  In addition, replacement blades are so inexpensive, I can change them every 2-3 shaves. You can buy 100 blades for $10 so the savings are huge and you always have a sharp razor.</li>
            <li> Great example of craftsmanship,  balanced to give a close shave, great look and feel. Customer service is also above average.</li>
            <li> Great razor, but after a few uses the finish on the top plate corner looks like it is starting to wear off.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor and it has been an amazing shave every time. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Amazing razor! Very comfortable to use. Nice weight allows for easy shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a safety razor for a long time now finally made the decision on buying the shavolgy razor based on reviews shipped fast came in a nice box set up very well nice weight I absolutely love it best decision I have made to switching over closer shave in my opinion</li>
            <li> The first thing I have to say about this product is wow. I purchase the Safety Razor set for about $30, which is 70% lower than what is listed at the original price. The set consists of a chrome plated razor, a leather &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; of sorts, the razors, and a cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the razor: It is chrome plated, and it&#x27;s noticeable when you first look at the finish. It&#x27;s not bad, but there is a certain lustre that stainless steel has. In my opinion, one is not superior to the other, it&#x27;s just different. The razor handle unscrews which separates the head into two pieces which need to be sandwiched around the blade. This is not a butterfly opening razor, so if you&#x27;re looking for that in this razor, it&#x27;s not it. One must be careful replacing the razor head on the handle as the risk of cutting oneself is present; also, I have heard tightening the head too much will cause the razor to crack or shatter. The handle seems to be of plastic, but there are no seam lines like in cheap moulded plastic, so I&#x27;m happy with that. Also, there are etchings on the razor which add a nice touch of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather pouch is more of a blade guard than anything else. It slips over the head of the razor and keeps it clean, dry, and eliminates risk of cutting oneself when handling the razor. I tend not to use it as slipping the razor into it requires you to either hold the blade guard open with your fingers or working the razor in, and I tend to be a bit nervous around extremely sharp metal, regardless of precautions. It&#x27;s a very nice and potentially useful thing to have though, especially if you&#x27;re travelling with your razor as it can keep it from cutting other things in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors I recieved were Baili &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; stainless steel blades, numbering 5 which came in a custom Shaveology bag. The suggestion made to me was to use each side of the razor once (meaning one blade gets 2 uses) then discard it, but I find they can withstand multiple uses before wearing out. Unless you have thick facial hair, these should last 2-3 weeks or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloth was of the sort to which dust readily clings, meaning that you can use it not only for polishing and drying the safety razor, but for cleaning your glasses, or in fact any glass which must remain dust free. It is black with the Shaveology logo and phrase on one side, the other being plain. I have used it for many other things besides razor care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole set came in very nice packaging, including promotional pamphlets with discount vouchers and a handy shaving guide for those not used to shaving with this type of razor. As for the shave, it was immediately intuitive. You can instantly tell if you have the angle right or not, and the shave was close and easy. I&#x27;ve used disposable razors, straight razors, and as of now safety razors and I can say I&#x27;ve never had a shave so effortless, clean (as far as residue and hairs sticking to the face) and confident then with this razor. I can make several passes on the same spots and not worry at all about nicking myself like with disposables, and the shave is much faster then with straight razors. The only downside, one which accompanys not just this product, but all safety razors, is edging facial hair is a delicate and imprecise task, for which I prefer a straight razor. For shaving large swaths of skin this type has no rival, and for this price this product has the greatest value unless you are looking for an exact style or product. Even without the usual accouterments such as a stand, a badger hair brush, or shaving cream (all of which enhance the shaving experience) this is still definitively the complete shaving set for any man with facial hair. I highly recommend it.uses before wearing out.

            <li> With this, shaving is faster and you are left with smoother skin. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This unique gift is awesome. My husband loved the safety razor set. I&#x27;m always looking great gifts for men and this is a perfect one for Fathers Day.</li>
            <li> Starting at 4 stars. The product showed up liking exactly as described. Everything is in working order and looks great. I&#x27;ve held off shaving for 3 days to see what kind of power this baby has. The bonus free blades for buying this was a great surprise!!</li>
            <li> I love that this bring good shaving back! It is the perfect kit for those who really want to shave like they used to.  It is so much more economical and the package is just fabulous for a gift! If you are looking for the perfect gift for those who don&#x27;t have a beard this season, this is it!</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver and it shaves better than my 5 blade shaver blade and much closer believe it or not this has been my experience with this shaver and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again to my Son who bought it for my Father&#x27;s Day gift</li>
            <li> Got this for my ex-husband, from the kids for Father&#x27;s Day.  I think it is important for them to both know the importance of the holiday (his birthday and Christmas too) and not skip present giving just because we aren&#x27;t together.  This is an awesome double edged razor set.  Super fancy looking in the Shaveology box.  It comes with everything needed to shave except shaving cream and some water.  I love that it isn&#x27;t a one-use gift.  Additional razors can be purchased when these ones run out.  It is a great men&#x27;s gift for any man in the family (or not in the family).  The whole set comes in a nice box and it can be given as is without additional wrapping paper. My kids now have a nice present for their dad and it isn&#x27;t something he&#x27;ll like and use.  I received this product for free (or a discounted price, whichever is applicable) in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love my new razor. When I received my first razor from shaveology the head and handle did have some difficulty screwing together, however, when I contacted shaveology about the matter they responded very promptly, apologized for the inconvenience, and sent me an entirely new kit. They also let me keep the kit that I already had. I received my new kit within 4 days and it worked like a charm. Now I just have to figure out how to shave with this crazy thing without nicking my face, as I am a newbie to safety razors😄. All in due time...</li>
            <li> My wife bought all the men of our family a Double Edge Safety Razor as a gift for Christmas.  I had seen ads for this product and was skeptical of their claims.  I have used disposable razors for many years and was happy with the quality of the shave but out of respect for my wife I gave the new razor a chance.  I was surprised by how close of a shave I got and without the loss of blood.  I am a convert.</li>
            <li> My husband is hard to shop for, but I looked for the best product I could find. This was a great product, the razor is very good shave tool. The razorblades them selves are the best you can buy, super shaver!!! A must buy for the man in your life!</li>
            <li> Great high quality product.</li>
            <li> A truly great razor, so impressed! Got this as a gift after thinking about getting a safety razor for a while. I now know I&#x27;ll shave with one the rest of my life. You get a closer, smoother shave, far fewer nicks and ingrown hairs, and shaving with it feels more precise. It has a great weight and design. It&#x27;s easy and cheap to swap blades. I can&#x27;t imagine who wouldn&#x27;t love this.</li>
            <li> Just received this yesterday. I&#x27;m 61 years old and have been using various (COSTLY) Electric razors and equally costly multi-blade cartridge razors all of my post adolescent life.. I decided to try what my late Father used, an old fashioned safety razor. My first shave was without any nicks, cuts or razor burn. The replacement blades are way cheaper and as time passes I will update on how long they last. When done shaving I recommend rinsing and drying the razor and when it&#x27;s dry I&#x27;m stropping it in a forward motion with some denim cloth. Strop from the top of the razor and forward as we don&#x27;t want to shave the denim ;)</li>
            <li> The best and closest shave I ever had, period! In the past I never looked forward to shaving, I hate facial hair except for my mustache especially because of the irritated skin and razor bumps I would get from shaving. This is my second time shaving with this product and I&#x27;m so impressed with the quality of the shave and the precision of the shaver. I have spent so much on shavers from double bladed to five bladed shavers only to enjoy the shave for a few hours before the irritation would start to break out and would never get such close shave as I did with this shaver. The best part is it is so gentle on my skin, my shaving rashes reduced I would say about 75% just on the first shave and for the second shave I barely felt or noticed any discomfort from rashes or razor bumps. The video is a must see, everyone has probably done it 2-4 times a week throughout their lifetime shaving but their are little details that will help with obtaining a closer shave and smoother and healthier skin.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve owned.  You can&#x27;t beat this package with the leather case/blade guard, towel, and free blades.  The razor provides a smooth, extremely close shave.  The weight of the razor is substantial, and you can just let it do the work for you.  The razor is presented in an elegant package that you&#x27;d see at a high end department store.  They add a touch of class by etching their shaveology logo on the razor head.  This also makes a great gift idea and with the holidays right around the corner, I&#x27;ll be picking up a few more.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products that I get online because I am a very busy person, but I am so happy with my new razor that I got from shaveology and am glad I did this smart investment. I am so excited and I feel like had to share my experience with everyone out there. I promise you won&#x27;t regret buying it. And am completely sure that you will want to share your experience as soon as you used the first couple times, just like I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Gillete razors. Going on 20 years. I decided to try a safety razor after hearing good things. I randomly chose this kit, after looking at some Amazon reviews. I find that the kit has most of what you need to get going. If you really want to do it right, you will need to buy a shave brush and either shave soap or lather. I wouldn&#x27;t use regular shave gel or cream, although you could. Also a pre-shave oil is recommended but not required.&lt;br /&gt;  Now I had never used a safety razor before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. What I found was a super clean, tight shave. Much more attractive than the multi-blade disposables. It felt good too. I&#x27;m not sure if I could describe how or why but it did. There was almost something coded in my DNA telling me this is the proper way to be doing this.&lt;br /&gt;  On the con side. It takes quite a bit longer to shave. 10 min or so in my case. With the first couple of times taking a bit longer. Also my skin was irritated the first 2 times I used it. After that I was fine.&lt;br /&gt;  Since this was my first time using a safety razor, I can&#x27;t tell you if this brand is good or just okay. I will tell you it is sturdy, handles well, looks great, and comes with a large amount of instructions and resorces.&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Like others, I struggled a bit with the safety razor at first. But after several shaves, I have my routine down and am loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the key is the routine. Shower before shave, shave oil after (this has been the biggest key for me), badger brush and shaving soap. This works really well and I no longer get the nicks/cuts and my sensitive skin is thankful for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for one will not be going back to the cartridge razors as I am so happy with the results of this one. More people should take the plunge and do the same. Stick with it, and be patient, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not only a great price for a safety razor, but they send 5 blades, and have a free offer for another 5 blades. What a great deal! I&#x27;m loving the quality of the razor so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was really nice - and this makes it a great gift for someone!</li>
            <li> Get your man card punched as soon as this arrives. This set is classic masculinity in a box. The packaging and presentation is superb. This is a well constructed tool for grooming like your grandpappy did. Lifting this heavy razor out of the case feels right, and should raise your testosterone levels straight away. Buy this kit. Your Manhood will thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought your product and I&#x27;ve read, the better you interesting and useful, I recommend this product to my friend, the friend said I liked the product, this paam very useful, thank Thanks manufacturers product, great product.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I was reminded to leave a review when signing up for a (free) 60-day supply of razor blades. This could sway my opinion, but I don&#x27;t think it has. I was just reminded to write this when signing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Review: I got the Shaveology Razor set about a week ago, and I just took my first shave with it tonight (I had to acquire all the other hardware that comes with a safety-blade shave). I can already say that for $30, this package is an amazing deal. The razor has a nice chrome and black handle, and the head of the razor has a nice engraving with the mustache-and-crown logo of Shaveology. The blades included are top-notch as far as I know, and they provide a nice smooth shave. Highly recommend this to anyone just getting started with safety razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Comes with a razor, blades, leather &amp;#34;scabbard&amp;#34;, cleaning cloth&lt;br /&gt;+Includes 60-day free resupply of blades (actually free, no S&amp;H fee)&lt;br /&gt;+Leaves a great-feeling shave&lt;br /&gt;+Low price (there are razors alone that are $10-15 more than this kit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-A bit difficult to learn how to use for the first time, and&lt;br /&gt;-No manual on how to shave&lt;br /&gt;-Does not include soap, mug, aftershave, or other accessories&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great starter kit, and would recommend it to all my friends looking to get away from multi-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. For anyone else just getting started, I use Arko soap, Astra blades, and Nivea shave balm in addition to this razor</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about this shaver, but let me tell you after using it after one shave I was impressed. I have very sensitive skin and I always end up with rash right after shaving but with this shaver it doesn&#x27;t happen, very smooth shave. I will never use another shaver again. Thanks Shaveology!</li>
            <li> Fantastic set. My first safety razor and I am extremely satisfied. Feels like a better shave, and the product is very quality</li>
            <li> I like a good razor im not too picky when it comes to them, but this razor is horrible! When I try and shave it cuts my skin horribly! The quality is not good and overall this is not a good product! it feels very cheap and not anywhere NEAR the price it should be! the shipping took forever, and the customer support is not good at all! bad buy.</li>
            <li> i love this thing, takes a min to get used to the style and angle, and nicking yourself is invulnerable the first time when used to the cartridges, but it&#x27;s the closes shave i think ive ever had next to a professional barber. that and the idea of having a single blade pressed against your face..... ..</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail today, and tried it out for the first time.  Its my first time using a safety razor, and this one was amazing.  One of the best shaves I&#x27;ve had in a while.  I recommend it to all</li>
            <li> awesome blades just received them yesterday and couldnt be more satisfied. definitely a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a gift and he absolutely loves it. Smooth shave and excellent quality product. The blades are easy to change out as well. I will be giving these as gifts from now on, especially during the holidays and Christmas.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!!! It was my first time with a DE safety razor (only one small nick user error  lol)  I&#x27;m considering ordering another one from shaveology just cause I love it so much, even though I doubt I would ever need it. It will last me a life time</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> I have had terribly sensitive skin my whole life.  After dumping lots of money into Schick Quattro blades for several years and getting consistent razor burn, I recalled my vacation to India years ago where I&#x27;d get old school barber shaves without post blemishing.  These factors and a touch of research led me to this product.  Thus far, I&#x27;m really loving this razor.  I am better able to navigate my face without all the superfluous blades and it feels smoother on my skin.  After two weeks, I&#x27;m still on my first blade and haven&#x27;t had any razor burn.  The actual razor is really sturdy and made of high quality materials.  Simply put, the shave is close, the blades are cheap and the product is superior to cartridge shavers.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. If you follow the video on the website for shaveology it works kust as well if not better than other razors. Plus being able to change the razor everyday for about $30 a year.</li>
            <li> Good Kit.  Great starter kit for safety razors. I cant believe how much money I was wasting  on 3x blades</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years! Very precise. Especially easy to get that straight line on my sideburns which is absolutely impossible with a multi-blade razor. Has a quality feel to it. Looks very cool. This has sentimental value for me as my grandfather taught me to shave with a similar style of razor. I anticipate this being my go to razor for the foreseeable future. Hope they come out with a matching stand because I think it would look cool in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Going from cartridges to this has saved me a lot of money. If you&#x27;ve never used a safety razor before, it does take some time getting used to. I still use cartridge razors, but I don&#x27;t have to buy them as frequently. Having used both for the past two years, I can&#x27;t really say which is better. This safety razor saves a lot of money, but I have more control with a cartridge-based razor and am less likely to cut myself. I cut myself more with a safety razor quite frequently because it&#x27;s only one blade. My advice would be to keep both handy.</li>
            <li> the quality is amazing and the shave too</li>
            <li> This is the best value you will get for a shave!! You get everything you need for a double-edge razor shave that is high quality and will save you hundreds of dollars every year.</li>
            <li> Great razor, superior shave, never going to purchase a cartridge razor again.</li>
            <li> I had razor burn really bad on my neck for years. I read online about using a safety razor would alleviate it. I had a little trouble figuring out how to use it and cut myself a few times in the beginning. But once I figured it out man it&#x27;s so much better. My razor burn is gone. This is a nice set and you can get a 60 day supply of free blades after you receive it. I would recommend this set</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for the son of a friend leaving the nest for the first time. I am an experienced safety razor user, and thought he&#x27;d enjoy it. He is thrilled with it, and although I didn&#x27;t use it personally, I have examined it closely and it appears to be solid and as weighty as it should be. Some may prefer different lengths or whatever, but the razor does what it is meant to do. The packaging is pretty fun too. Five stars based on my examination and the owner&#x27;s joyful reports with it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a learning curve but it&#x27;s a great change to make. There&#x27;s so much talk of safety razors and my husband wanted for a long time to get away from both the waste and expense of disposables. He considered a straight edge but thought that jump was a bit much. This is what he settled on and he&#x27;s been happy with it. It will take practice before he can get a shave that is as close as his prior disposables but he&#x27;ll get there. He watched the videos before he started and thought they were helpful.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of the Gillette throw away razors. So when I Decided to give this a try i fell in love with this razor. It delivers an amazing close shave that I just didn&#x27;t get before. Easy to get the hang of. I would definitely recommend it if your looking for a great shave.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet but it looks great. It seems very well made it has that wow factor. I am just starting off shaving with a safety razor so I will try to put a follow up review real soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally used this safety razor and wow felt so smooth that I asked every co-worker I saw to feel my face. Plus side I work with nothing but ladies so they enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I love DE shaving ... So glad I purchased this kit... The closest shave .. Feels fresh out the barbershop</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Less ingrown hairs.  Easy to use and good quality overall.  Switched from Dollar Shave Club and happy I did.</li>
            <li> really good quality. very satisfied with equipment and shave!</li>
            <li> Nothing but great things to say about this product!  The design, the packaging it comes in, the actual shave... this product well exceeded my expectations.  Who doesn&#x27;t love a little bit of nostalgia when it comes to shaving back like they used to?  There was a reason men used to shave with a straight razor... closest/cleanest shave you&#x27;ll ever get.  New shaving technology doesn&#x27;t compare.  Less is more!</li>
            <li> The Shaveology Phantom series razor is hands down the best razor I’ve ever used. It provides a close and consistent shave everytime. This product is as close as you can get to a barber shop shave at home.</li>
            <li> I just bought this razor for my husband as a sweetest day gift.  My husband is a barber and owns his own shop. After trying this razor, he has now decided to look into buying the Shaveology razor in bulk and is going to see about offering this product for sale at his barbershop. My husband is extremely picky on what kind of product goes into his business for resale to his customers.  He will only offer the best, and reiterated to me that this razor is better than a straight razor shave.  That might be the biggest compliment a product like this can get, especially coming from a seasoned barber that knows good razors from bad ones.</li>
            <li> Wow.  That&#x27;s the closest shave I have ever had!  This is a throw back to the time when shaving was an art.  It takes a little getting used to but I have to say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  I may purchase some of these for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Very nice handle. Great weight.</li>
            <li> I was recently in a wedding and the groom bought all of us guys who stood up in the wedding this kit as Thank You gift.  Not only was it an awesome &amp; classy gift but the shave you get is like none other.  I only wish I had been turned onto something like this years ago.  Never will I ever buy another disposable razor from Walgreens again.  Plus with Christmas around the corner this will be an awesome gift for all the guys in my family.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend. I did a lot of research and was lead to this product. He loves it. In fact he has not shut up about it. Says it&#x27;s the absolute best shave he&#x27;s ever had. He did not have to go through 3 disposable razors. One blade did the job. He has a goatee but also did no shave November. He really gave this a test.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is for a gift but arrived on time as expected</li>
            <li> even though this razor didn&#x27;t come in as fast as my past products, my son loves it. worth every penny, thank you:-}</li>
            <li> I never really write reviews but just had to about this razor! I purchased for my husband and all I can say is WOW!!! The packaging is awesome and the razor is even better! His face is smooth and soft! We won&#x27;t ever purchase a razor from anywhere else again! Also, great customer service! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Mach3 user for years, but after going through the last cartridge in a 12 pack I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to purchase another $45 Gillette 12 pack razor kit. A friend suggested that I try the Shaveology razor so I ordered one though Amazon. The package arrived at my doorstep two days later. When I opened it, I was surprised by the weight and overall quality of the razor. The Shaveology Razor was much heavier than I expected it to be and of much higher quality. It has much more of a barbershop feel than the traditional plastic razor handles I was used to. Assembling the razor was very easy and took no more than 30 seconds to figure out. So far I&#x27;ve only used the razor once and it gave an excellent shave. I am naturally prone ingrown facial hairs and razor burn, but ended with neither after shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> I would love to see this product manufactured here in the states, but I will admit this product is very high quality. you will not be disappointed if you purchase it. Looking forward to seeing more products from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> First off, the presentation/packaging was VERY nice. It would make a fantastic gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a newbie to the safety razor experience, I definitely had some learning to do. Luckily, Shaveology.co offers instructional videos for safety-razor neophytes. The razor provides a very close shave and has made it so I only have to do it every other day. I am looking forward to ridding myself of the $4/cartridge retailer razor systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Shaveology!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. Nothing compares to the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment you get as a man shaving with this double edge safety blade. Forget the cartridges, save money, pick up a new hobby and get excited about shaving again. I can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of this product or the results it delivers. Let it speak for itself, if you&#x27;re on the fence I strongly recommend giving it a try especially since it&#x27;s backed by a 100% satisfaction/money back guarantee. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this,  it is a excellent quality. Would recommend got best shave ever.</li>
            <li> The blades that come with it are ok. Handle is lightweight which is a slight down side but not enough to not recommend.</li>
            <li> Got to my house quick, love the way it shaves but watch the video on how to shave with it its a bit tricky. Great product</li>
            <li> Normally a cartridge razor guy, my preference was the Gillette Fusion multi-blade, what a pansy - I was skeptical about the entire double-edge safety razor shave and a little reluctant to start that first pass on my mug.  I have fast growing man hair and it comes in full and thick like a man -  so I was worried about the Shaveology razors pulling on my beard like a pack of hungry rats.  Well, my rating tells the rest of the story and this is the same razor used by men who conquer big things, trust me I know.  There was no irritation on my skin and after shaving a 3 day beard, which on this mug is a challenge for the Fusion, these Shaveology blades cut like a hot knife through butter - so keep your 30 degree angle integrity!  No razor burn and my face felt like heaven, I finished off with Clubman Pinaud after shave and felt like I just built a log cabin in the Frozen North with my own hands. Do yourself a favor and build a log cabin but until then - shave with one of these!</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to, but I really like it now.  It has much less drag and razor burn than my old fusion.</li>
            <li> My path to this razor came out of a desire to stop paying ridiculous prices for disposable razors. To that end, I first ordered an electric razor, primarily because my grandfather always used them. Well, after trying two electrics I came to the conclusion that they were more trouble than they were worth and didn&#x27;t leave me with good results. It was time to consider something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After considerable research, I purchased the Shaveology set hoping it would deliver a great shave at a reasonable cost. After three weeks of use, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor. It delivers the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in decades. It takes a few shaves to find the best way to hold the razor and for your skin to become accustomed to the closer shave but its worth the short adjustment period. I shave every three days and the blade is is still sharp. I could never get that with expensive disposable razors. You&#x27;ll be pleased from the very first shave! Stop searching and place your order today!</li>
            <li> Works great, don&#x27;t plan to ever go back to modern fancy blades.</li>
            <li> So far so good. After using multiple blades that are overly expensive for years I found this set to be very good. I decided to try it after a friend telling me that cutting back to a single blade razor would possibly improve or eliminate the constant razor burn that I would get with those past expensive razors. Takes a little getting used shaving at the specific angles but after a couple weeks I have no complaints and much less burn/rash afterwards. I do not normally shave everyday so I haven&#x27;t run out of the blades that came with this set either. I would recommend reading the other reviews which give more details on how to shave with this type of razor either here on amazon or youtube. They were very helpful.</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor. I was new to the world of the art of traditional shaving when I made this purchase, it did not take me long to learn how to use it. I cut myself a few times (very minor) the first time I used it, the second time I got better, by the third shave I was a pro. I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to a cartridge razor after using this. I will be using this razor and purchasing blades from Shaveology for as long as this safety razor lasts, and when it wears out (if it ever wears out), I&#x27;ll buy another! Thank you, Shaveology!</li>
            <li> If you believe certain corners of the internet, switching to a safety razor is nothing short of life-changing. I&#x27;m not convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results aren&#x27;t anything spectacular, and I&#x27;ve cut myself pretty badly each time I&#x27;ve used it. Maybe there&#x27;s a learning curve?</li>
            <li> I normally don’t write reviews, but I was over at my friend’s house last week when I saw this really cool looking box called Shaveology on his counter and I asked him what it was. I personally do marketing for a living so my eye naturally attracts to well-done packaging so I was intrigued. He told me it was a double edge safety razor and that these old school razors really give an amazing close shave, especially these days and the way they are made. I asked him how it compared to my Mach 3 razor and he basically told me there is no comparison. So, I decided to look online for it and found it on Amazon on sale, which was a bonus all together. The box arrived to my house in 2 days and couldn’t wait to give it a shot. I will admit, I was a little nervous to try it, but when I was done, I literally tossed out my Mach 3. I loved the fact that it came with extra blades and a leather cover to protect the head of the razor as well. The real bonus for me was the fact that the owner of the company called me two weeks after I bought this to make sure that the product arrived well and to get my feedback. I have never been contacted before by a reseller on Amazon and the fact that I gave him my opinion on it, he offered me a coupon for half off on the stainless steel stand they are about to come out with. Awesome product, awesome service.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new razor since my old standby disposable manufacturer has changed their &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; which in turn meant they changed the razor.  After trying several other disposable razors, I decided to give a double edge safety razor a try.  After looking around on Amazon, I narrowed it down to the best &amp;#34;bang for the buck, so I went with Shaveology.&amp;#34;  I received the razor in the mail and was quite impressed with the packaging.  After inspecting the razor and accessories (fit and finish were great), I decided to give it a shot.  I have to say, it&#x27;s the closest shave I have gotten since I began shaving many years ago.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone.  In fact, I will be purchasing a few as gifts for my friends for the holidays.</li>
            <li> Nicely constructed. Really solid and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My husband is tough to buy for and this was perfect he used it right away and loves it! Thank you for a perfect Christmas gift!!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  You get a sleek looking razor that is capable of giving a fine, close shave.  I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Great razor! One of the closest shaves i have ever had. The only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is that it is not a butterfly open razor. You have to take it apart to do maintenance on it. Besides that I love it. I also bought one of these for my dad and best friend and they both love them as well.</li>
            <li> Great product!  This is my first single blade razor and have to say it was a good choice</li>
            <li> This is my first ever safety razor and I was pleasantly surprised when I received this for Christmas.  I managed to try it out as soon as I could. The threads when screwing it on and off was a little stiff, but I would call that normal with anything that is new and needs to be broken in.  Overall it&#x27;s a good safety razor and would be a very good buy for a beginner.  Also,  watch some YouTube videos on &amp;#34;How to shave with a safety razor&amp;#34; before trying it out.</li>
            <li> I have been using a straight razor that utilizes replaceable safety blades that you brake in half, but as the handle was wearing out, it was time to replace it.  I somehow came across this, not really sure how, and it just looked great to me so I decided that I would give it a shot, and I was not let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the shave I get from this is equal to that of my straight razor, but it also decreases the possibility of razor burn or cuts.  I have been extremely pleased with this razor, both in style and ease of use and cleaning.  I also am a huge fan that they thought of providing the leather cover to ensure a safe way of storing the head with the razor enclosed!</li>
            <li> Beautiful razor. Made very well and it shaves great too. Very smooth. For most razors like the Edwin Jagger or the Merkur I would say to throw away the included blades...but not so for the Shaveology razor. The included blades are very smooth and sharp. Will see if I can get 4 to 5 shaves with it. Will test later how it works with the Gillette Silver Blue blades. However the included blades are excellent so far. No tugging or pulling at all.</li>
            <li> Just received this for Christmas as I was gone. Opened it up, excited since its my first razor like this to find out it looks like it was used or already damaged with a razor already mounted. Definitely returning to try and get a NEW one.</li>
            <li> The shaver arrived in horrible condition.  It looked like it had been used before.  I was not even able to open the top to place a razor in.  I did however like the feel of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: This is my wife&#x27;s account. She bought the razor, so her account reviews the razor. But she doesn&#x27;t use the razor, so I review the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a razor that can deal with my curly, bent-on-ingrowning neck hair for a long time. When I got this razor for Christmas (from my wife -- see disclaimer), all of the horrible slasher stories I&#x27;d heard about safety razors came back to me. But it turns out I don&#x27;t cut myself often with this razor, about the same as standard razor cartridges (and for similar reasons: hastiness and lack of attention). What is different is that now I&#x27;m actually shaving the hair off my neck without the uniform sea of razor bumps and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the razor looks pretty. In a man way.</li>
            <li> Love it so far. Only used once, but will updat after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Nice little starter kit.</li>
            <li> Very well made product built to last,  wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> My son has just started shaving and I wanted to do something nice for him so, I bought him this razor. He was very excited and it will be something he will never forget. When he was at school I got a quick shave in with it to see what the fuss was all about. I just ordered one for me 2…</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift from my girlfriend, perhaps she didn&#x27;t like my stubble! Either way it was a super thoughtful gift idea. I love the old school styling with modern flair. I watched the video on the site and was shaving with the razor a few minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is tight and clean, the handle has a perfect weight and most importantly my girlfriend was happy with my smooth cheeks! I guess I shouldn&#x27;t tell her for Movember, I am growing a mustache...</li>
            <li> Hi there. My name is Jay however I am writing this on my wife&#x27;s amazon account. I truly believe this is the nicest razor to have hit the market. I cannot remember the last time I had this close of a shave. And to add to the coolness factor of seeing yourself in the mirror shaving with this razor is awesome as well. There&#x27;s nothing like feeling like a highly respected gangster from the 1920&#x27;s while your getting for the day or night. If you want to shave and feel like a true gentleman than I definitely recommend Shavology as your first choice in keeping your looks clean.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. It was a perfect gift for a guy. It&#x27;s a great safety razor and my husband loves the quality. Highly recommend this for any man in your life.</li>
            <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve used for the price :D</li>
            <li> I bought this Shaveology razor for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he just used it for the first time. He thought it was a very unique gift and was impressed by how the product was put together in the package. He told me after he used it that it was a very close shave, one of the best he&#x27;s ever gotten. He is used to drug store razors so of course this is better than that. No knicks or cuts. He is a very pleased dad on Father&#x27;s Day. Would recommend to anyone as a great men&#x27;s gift or to use personally.</li>
            <li> This great double edge razor is really great and superb. It gives a smooth shave. I&#x27;m loving it. Great for gifts and personal use.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever owned</li>
            <li> These are great! I was a tad skeptical at first. I don&#x27;t shave every day, and it seems like the regular &#x27;5 blade&#x27; blades I get don&#x27;t last too long (in terms of numbers of shaves). But so far these last! They give a great shave, but do take a little getting used to to not cut yourself (although they are safety blades you can still nick yourself but it&#x27;s harder to do that). It definitely has given me one of the closest shaves, better than any of those 5 blade systems I&#x27;ve used before. No need to think about it, just get one!</li>
            <li> Much better shave than store bought razor. I really enjoy shaving now!!!!</li>
            <li> It shaved well during the time it could hold a blade but after three weeks the handle would no longer screw on. No visible signs of wear on the threads, so possibly just &#x27;bad luck&#x27;. Switched to a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 01/18/2015&lt;br /&gt;It appears I was unfortunate enough to receive a razor with a manufacturing defect. The company sent a replacement. It&#x27;s like night and day, everything works quite well. The only criticism I&#x27;d have is that the handle seems a bit short, but being that this is the only safety razor I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s possible it was designed that way for function.</li>
            <li> As described....gift was very well received!!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great shave, this product delivers the results of a straight edge razor, basically the modern version of a straight edge razor that reminds me of my grandpa shaving back in the day.</li>
            <li> Great product! I gave this to my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. The packagin was awesome made the product even more luxurious.  The razor blades are easy to change, easy to use and looks very nice. Great gift!</li>
            <li> Great razor, a little shorter than average though</li>
            <li> I have been using a safety razor for the past five years. When my previous safety razor head threads broke off from the head piece I had to get a new one. I chose the Shavology over the previous brand and have not been disappointed. While the razor is lighter the shaving experience has been much better.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a safety razor.</li>
            <li> enjoy the shave it gives. nervous to use at first but after awhile its easy to get the hang of</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing!  Everything included is high quality and beautifully crafted.</li>
            <li> Good looking razor, didn&#x27;t try them.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, there was a bit of a learning curve when I first started using it, but after watching some of the tutorial videos and given myself a few shaves I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of using the blade.  I love the weight of it and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to repeatedly go over areas that I&#x27;ve shaved, the blades are very sharp and efficient. I used to have pretty extreme razor burn from other razors that I used, but I&#x27;ve found that I can use this razor every day to shave and I have a nice clean shaven look without irritating my skin. I&#x27;d definitely recommend checking it out if you&#x27;ve been using other disposable razors for years. This one works great!</li>
            <li> Husband got this as a gift from me and he loves it! He uses only this now. He has extremely thick hair and grows facial hair witching a couple days, this razor makes his skin very smooth and no cuts!</li>
            <li> First of all, this style of razor is superior and highly cost effective. To achieve a great shave, you need a sharp blade. All 5 blades does is spread out the contract area, it does not increase shave quality. One blade that is angled properly, easy to keep dry and replace, and infinitely cheaper will serve you just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you buy those fancy multi blade razors, ask you really get for your money is that fancy snap on ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as two sided, single blade safety razors go, this one is of particularly high value for the money. To a certain extent, any razor of this design with the right angles and ease of use will fit the bill, but shaveology has really stepped it up with extra quality blades, a drying cloth and simple, high quality, travel sheath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price I payed, I can&#x27;t imagine higher value.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit as a gift for my dad. It arrived quickly and appears to be high quality, and a very good value for the price. Plus, the company has provided excellent follow up customer service to make sure I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> WOW! What a difference! I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a month now and I will never go back to the Gillette Fusion or any other razor. I&#x27;ve never had a closer, smoother shave. Such a quality product overall. The razor&#x27;s sturdiness screams quality craftsmanship; the razor blades cut so sharply and smoothly it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m sitting in a barber&#x27;s chair. I&#x27;ve said goodbye to irritated skin and razor bumps. My skin feels fresh and smooth after each shave with Shaveology. I really recommend using this razor and giving it as a gift since the kit is so aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I am getting better shaves for a fraction of the cost of other multi blade cartrige razors.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this gift set by Shaveology. It is his second safety razor. It&#x27;s a little lighter than his other razor, but the quality is still fantastic. He has suffered from razor burn on his neck for years and started using the wet shaving method with a safety razor after doing some research on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor also looks fantastic. He travels a lot for work so he&#x27;s especially excited about the slide on cover. He said the blades were very sharp and I can agree that the Shaveology combo provides a close smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had only one drawback to the razor. He shaves in the shower and when wet the smooth black handle can be a little slick. His other razor is grooved to provide a little more grip, but he&#x27;s already adjusted to the small difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, he is very pleased and said that he had no problem recommending this gift for men of any experience level with safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for testing and review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> We received this Shaveology razors today! My husband couldn&#x27;t wait to try it after he got home from work! He loves the close shave of this timeless razor. His face felt so smooth with the closeness of this shave. I know we will be ordering this I&lt;br /&gt;In The future, no cuts or razor burns,  it made a fan of my husband for sure. He also loved the quality of the Shaveology kit! Very well made!</li>
            <li> Nice shave set, BUT no blades were shipped in the box! They were supposed to be included and the box is sealed with plastic so I guess mine slipped through quality control. The razor seems to be a high quality razor. I have yet to use it but I&#x27;m sure it will shave as expected.</li>
            <li> This kit is absolutely the best!  The packaging is so classy..when you open the box - you just KNOW that a great quality product is waiting for you inside! First: the shaver..the heft and length of the handle is perfect; the blade holder is sturdy and durable.  The blades are thin and sharp.  AND it comes with a thick leather cover for the head of the shaver.  My husband tried it and fell in love immediately.  He is old enough to remember learning how to shave on this type of razon &amp;#34;these are the best&amp;#34; he said!  I did a lot of research on shavers last year to give a gift to my 30 year old son who has a heavy beard.  I went to the mall - a special (very expensive) shaving store.  then I went online to learn more, watch videos, etc.  So I feel that I know what I am talking about.  I wish I had discovered THIS package last year for him - it is a PERFECT GIFT! I did receive this item in exhange for an honest and unbiased review - and that is exactly what you are getting.  I would highly recommend this to anyone - you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I hope this review is helpful for your buying decision.</li>
            <li> This is a great package for the guy who is just starting &#x27;shave like your Grandfather did&#x27;!  I am totally happy with the product and the box it all comes in could make it an excellent choice for a gift. I was really sick of spending way too much money on name brand shavers only to get a mediocre shave.  This thing shaves awesome!  It took me a few times to get the hang of it, but now I look forward to the whole shaving process.  If you are just starting out, I would recommend pairing it with the &#x27;Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave Set&#x27; and the &#x27;Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion&#x27;.  Awesome combination!!</li>
            <li> Very nice set and the first DE razor I have used. My only complaint is that I have medium sized hands and the razor handle is too short for comfortable use which caused my hand to cramp. I am buying a Merkur long handle razor so this razor will be a backup. Very good quality and a nice starter kit. Update: I signed up to receive the 60 day supply of free razors but never received them. Oh well, I switched to a Merkur razor anyway.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my hubs. He loved this starter kit. Sleek and good quality product. He said best and closest shave of his life and it&#x27;s affordable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally received my item and I&#x27;m so excited to try it. I can&#x27;t wait to shave with it</li>
            <li> I am 65 and only shave now on days when I want to.  But I always wanted to go back to the good old days of a single blade safety razor and now I have done so.  I was always suspicious that I was not getting as close a shave with four (yikes!!) blades as opposed to the old single style I grew up with, but heck it&#x27;s shaving, after your done, you towel off and forget about it until the next shave. In fact I sometimes bought the plastic throwaway single blade razors and was not unhappy with those.  This is better, easy to clean and very stylish.  I don&#x27;t know why stylish counts when you are by yourself shaving in the bathroom, but it does.</li>
            <li> I just bought this after my old safety razor broke, and I really like this kit. It is nice looking, well thought out with the cloth and leather razor cover, and though I&#x27;ve just used it once, it performs even better than my old razor (one that was advertised by the pawn shop guy on tv and was my first safety razor). Must be a better angle or tighter fit or something. Oh, and it does come with instructions unlike another review said.  I should note that I use feather blades, a badger silvertip brush, COL Conk shave soap, and a Shaving Company apothecary shave cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way to go, in my experience, though I keep looking for new tips, is to wash my beard area with a mild face soap (Aveno foaming cleanser is good) and warm water while I soak the brush in a separate cup of hot water. Then, I shake the brush a little to get it to stop dripping, and use it to get a nice soap lather in the cup. Get a really good lather in the cup the first time and you don&#x27;t have to do it again, saving soap. Next, I apply a nice lather to my still-wet face, set the brush back in the cup (it will be used again), and shave my cheeks down, then across (from ear to nose/mouth) then down my neck. With a thicker cream you may not have to lather your face again, but I do with my soap. I rinse my face with warm water and lather my neck, shave across one way (ear to ear), then rinse, lather and repeat the other way. Then I rinse my whole face again with warm water, lather it all, and shave up. Be careful to not press hard like with cartridges, letting the weight of the razor do the work, and take short strokes when in tighter or more sensitive areas. A good double edge blade is very sharp, so it requires caution, but gives the closest shave save for perhaps a straight edge (which I have yet to learn properly or purchase a good one). Oh, and if you are new to safety razors, don&#x27;t start with the feather blades. Learn your form first, then upgrade, or you will slice your face off, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone as much as other reviews in the past have helped me.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone as much as other reviews in the past have helped me.</li>
            <li> OK, so you know how Shaveology asks the question: &amp;#34;&amp;#34;Are you ready for the best shave of your life?&amp;#34; - well, I thought for 29.95 that there had to be at least SOME marketing hype in that question. But I decided to give them a try anyway ... and to my surprise, it really was the best! In fact, it worked so well I could hardly feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, zero razor burn and perfect smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The phantom razor shaveology sells is very classy looking and perfectly weighted. I didn&#x27;t expect the blades that came with it to do that good of job but once again, I was pleasantly surprised. Instead of shaving cream, I used: &amp;#34;Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap &amp;#34; (read the reviews on it in Amazon and you&#x27;ll see why) and finished things off with Clubman Pinaud Classic Vanilla After Shave Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic experience. The phantom is a classy razor, and the kit they you get for 29.95 is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY Recommended!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a lot of first hand information because I bought this for my husband.  He, probably like most men, does not get too excited about shaving.  He had been going through a lot of razors for a number of months, and seemed unable to get a clean shave from any, so I saw this and got it for him.  I can tell you he is getting a much better shave now.  Don&#x27;t know what else to say!</li>
            <li> I just started using a safety razor and love it and it gives me the same if not better than my old Gillette.  Good deal for less than 35.00.&lt;br /&gt;Art of shaving razors start at 100.00</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of razors, but none have compare to this safety razor, have no hair pull or cuts and very smooth passes over my skin</li>
            <li> No texturized grip makes it extremely slippery.</li>
            <li> All other blades cause irritation bumps...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was entirely shocked at how smooth the shave was with this product. I&#x27;m 100% sold!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing set for an amazing deal! Great shave and a well balanced handle. My husband couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Amazing Product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor, and it seems to be great for beginners. It is of good quality and was promptly shipped. I have not use it yet (that&#x27;s the reason it is only 4 stars), but I look forward to using it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Works really great. Clean shave and easy as well . overall great product to invest into</li>
            <li> This product does all it says it will. It is hands down the best shave I&#x27;ve had in my life. Granted I&#x27;ve only been shaving for about five years. However that said I have had and currently own, a 350$ norelco electric razor and a whal elec foil shaver and neither come close! This shave is so smooth and clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any razor burn. It&#x27;s affordable and blades are cheap. I personally use the blades that came in the box but also bought some feather blades and those also work phenomenally! It&#x27;s all about personal preference though. If you have never experienced old fashioned wet shaving, there is a reason it&#x27;s still around today, and that&#x27;s because it has stood the test of time. It works and works well. It changes the shaving game from a chore to a hobby. It is honestly unbelievable. If you are even considering this purchase act on it. You will not be upset. And customer support and service from this company are unheard of. It is absolutely fantastic to see that there are still genuinely good quality reliable American small businesses. Thank you shaveology!</li>
            <li> Solid design, great shave, and my wife complimented the packaging. Well done.</li>
            <li> For a while I had a cheap razor kit, and it worked great until the plastic bits started warping and everything went out of alignment. I got this kit and I think it&#x27;s amazing when I use the blades I already have. The razor is great; the solid metal construction makes it durable, and adds heft so I find it easier to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is the included &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; blades. I gave one a shot, and even with water and shaving cream, it felt like I was shaving dry. Normally that would cost some stars, but I already had a pack of &amp;#34;Astra&amp;#34; brand blades that I know work well (and you can buy a box of 100 for ten bucks, it&#x27;s ridiculous!) so I was able to switch over to one of those mid-shave and finish without shredding my face.</li>
            <li> I immediately tossed a butterfly style safety razor I had when I used this one! Once you open the box you notice the quality and attention to detail the Shaveology set has.&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself feels incredibly sturdy and is the perfect size and weight in my hand. It is an extremely comfortable shave and I will not look to any other blade to get the job done!</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Quick shipping. Will keep coming back for replacement blades</li>
            <li> Awesome shave for the price.  Buy a couple of different brands of blades to see what works best for you.  I like the Feather brand for a really smooth feel, but I&#x27;d suggest starting with the blades the kit comes with, just to get used to the feel, raking angle and pressure you should use.&lt;br /&gt;Expect a few small nicks the first time experimenting with one of these.</li>
            <li> This is a cool starter kit with AMAZING blades called Baili but there are two drawbacks for me which forced me to get another razor. First the handle was too short for my tastes and if you&#x27;re used to the longer handle of a disposable razor, you&#x27;ll find it rather short. This and the fact that the handle is smooth and not ridged like the Merkur razor I ended up getting to replace this, it just constantly slipped through my hand, especially when wet. The short handle can be forgiven but the smooth coating on the handle was just too much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, blows the mach 3 away. Blades last too, great razor. Hell yeah!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome razor. Easy to use. Way cheaper and way more precise than the disposable razors. This is a very clean cut shave. And my hair seems to grow slower because of the super close shave!</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail, everything looks good and seems well built. Now I just have to shave!</li>
            <li> Was really pleased with the shaving kit and prompt delivery.  The wet shave by Shaveology is a great solution and glad to be using it. V</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!! I love the shave it gives and the blades are cheap and easy to replace. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Very nice razor.  This is my first safety razor and I am impressed.  I get a very close shave from it.  The handle is a little slick when wet, so be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor, because it sounded fantastic . When I received it it was a pretty razor, but no matter what blade I put in it, it shaved like the handle of a butter knife. I have been shaving for 50 years with a safety razor, this is the first razor that would not shave . Returned it.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about the quality or the razor. But once I got it in hand I was extremely pleased. It&#x27;s a very durable and elegant looking razor. The shave is second to none. Hot towl, shave balm, and some hand made shave soap; it&#x27;s truly the royal treatment.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my brother who is in the armed forces overseas as a birthday gift. He emailed me today to let me know how much he likes the razor and suggested that I order another for our father&#x27;s upcoming 60th birthday... Great product, excellent packaging and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing this razor out. No matter how carefully I shaved, I invariable cut myself. I did not get that result with my two other safety.</li>
            <li> This razor has amazing build quality for a very modest price. The support that comes from the website is unparalleled to anything I&#x27;ve seen previous. I completely, without reservation, recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Love it! I have never been able to shave with a razor, always just trimmed because of razor burn. Figured I would try something new and its been completely worth it!</li>
            <li> Amazing Shave! Far surpasses Gillette or Schick. I will not be going back to disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to jump start my wet shave journey. I was impressed by how fast it arrived and the presentation of the packaging. After using the razor for a few months, I really love the shave and equipment. I purchased another handle from a different seller and it didn&#x27;t even compare to the quality of Shaveology. I would but more from them based on the style and execution of this razor set.</li>
            <li> High quality razor.  This is the best razor and shave I have had in my life.</li>
            <li> Nice, close shave and can get more shaves out of one blade than with multiple-blade razors.  Replacement blades are also a heck of a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Shipping was way faster than expected.  My husband loves this razor and his face has never looked better. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for myself and absolutely love it! Besides being absolutely beautiful in appearance it gives a great, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great shave!</li>
            <li> Great kit and a great price! Get the best shave every time and you save money compared to those expensive replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used. It is very quick to put together and use. For first-time users like me takes a bit to get used to.  Once you get the hang of it, it will give you a closer shave then thoes five blade jobbers. The only thing negative I will say about this one is if you have big hands it is a little gard to contol. Recommend buying one with a long handle if this applies to you, if not then you will love it. Just threw away my old razor wont ever use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from disposable to dollar shave club to straight razors and now to the Shaveology safety razor and I have to say I absolutely love this safety razor. I get a very close and clean shave, I never cut myself, and of all the razors I&#x27;ve ever used this combination irritates my skin the least. No razor burn, sharp razors, clean shave, does it get any better? Not to mention the attention to detail is just awesome. I really appreciate the high quality packaging that this razor arrives with. You don&#x27;t want to throw this in your travel bag and you don&#x27;t have too! It comes with it own case and its pretty good quality. Everything about this kit is correct, I will be using this safety razor for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste another penny with expensive disposable razors, I shave just as quickly with this razor and I&#x27;ve already saved a ton of money since the blades are very cheap!! Shaveology is a family company and their attention to detail has my business. I would pay $70 for this razor and still feel like I got a deal. Quality Quality Quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging&lt;br /&gt;Tank like sturdy design&lt;br /&gt;No opening and closing heads on the razor (screw on design is MUCH better than other clamping safety razors.)&lt;br /&gt;Razor fits snug and does not move&lt;br /&gt;Clean shave with minimal drag and perfect pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Overall just outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase blades a bit sharper than the ones that come with the razor</li>
            <li> The razor is well constructed.  I haven&#x27;t had any mechanical problems with it like some other people describe in their review.  I&#x27;m still working on my technique (during my first shave with this razor, I actually had to shave three times to get a close shave, but my second shave went much better).  I highly recommend watching the Shaveology safety razor video and following their advice.</li>
            <li> Just got my safety razor today &amp; I really enjoyed shaving with it. Very straight forward &amp; easy to use, very good shave. The handle did loosen a bit as I was shaving, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve.</li>
