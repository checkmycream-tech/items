    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have used this product for years - best on the market.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the best creams to keep my skin in its condition.</li>
            <li>and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This cream is great.</li>
            <li>I like them, some are great</li>
            <li>Feels great when put on and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The slightest hint of scent, but most delightful.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Beautiful texture, bright and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>The best face cream ever, not cause it smells good or looks pretty</li>
            <li>The effects to one&#x27;s skin are amazing.</li>
            <li>After two days of using the product, my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, nice slip.</li>
            <li>(Rose&#x27;s Day Cream, for instance)</li>
            <li>You will look better, and feel better about yourself!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>The Best for mature skin</li>
            <li>Lovely ingredients</li>
            <li>This is OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li>As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the oil to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love every product I&#x27;v tried in this line..</li>
            <li>My doctor strongly recommended me to use Dr. Hauschka creams, lotions, and gels.</li>
            <li>(I guess that means it can go to movies on its own ;)  </li>
            <li>It felt nice on the skin, not oily, but I honestly cannot say that my skin felt any different after using it-</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that is gentle and rich and smells terrific.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t post before and after pix (!), but this is a really nice cream - even for the cost, w hich is higher than most</li>
            <li>I have been a hairdresser for 25 years so believe me when I say I have tried many, many facial products.</li>
            <li>It is nicer than most - nicer pretty much than ALL.</li>
            <li>Ok, stop beating yourself up about looking old and do something to minimize it!</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin but thought that because I was fine with the neck cream, I would be fine with the day cream too.  </li>
            <li>Their philosophy (see website) is to avoid heavier products and application of oils to the face, as such may prevent the production of one&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife when she was pregnant, as apparently many face creams have ingredients that are not approved or outright discouraged for use during pregnancy, but the hauschka website (drhauschka.co.uk/skincare/lifestyle/mother-and-baby)  said that there were no contraindications for their product during pregnancy (yay finally!).</li>
            <li>I think there are products out there that do as good a job for much less $$.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this one</li>
            <li>but because with regular use nothing else leaves skin so healthy</li>
            <li>Very well packed and just what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it - well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Not sure about that - but the product is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I typically use the rose moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Love Haushka products in general as my skin has always been sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it provides a lot more moisture and dry spots around my nose</li>
            <li>and it is really  overpriced.</li>
            <li>I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line.</li>
            <li>but some really are just way too over-priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, but its good enough, and the natural product ingredients make this a winner for me</li>
            <li>So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using it for a while, I can&#x27;t really say if there have been long term benefits, but her skin and face definitely glow and look more moisturized when using this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, which is a good thing, because this cream is not inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this the other day and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the smell after I read some of the reviews, because I prefer no smell  or very little in most of my products.</li>
            <li>The Rolls Royce of the natural skin care!</li>
            <li>My skin is improving and the price is way better than another organic product that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>have completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine</li>
            <li>I am 37 with mature skin.  </li>
            <li>and she was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Hauschka products have to be so great and so expensive?!</li>
            <li>and I believe it will last for at least 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and have been using Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s almost daily.  </li>
            <li>The price was much lower than expected.</li>
            <li>Seems to make pores look smaller but allows skin to breathe and feel natural.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I got a sample of this the other day and it is fantastic. Nice scent, nice slip. A little goes a long way, which is a good thing, because this cream is not inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Except, it is expensive.</li>
            <li> This cream is great. Reduces lines and wrinkles. Lightweight.</li>
            <li> This stuff has nothing at all objectionable in it. No thing. No dyes, perfumes, harsh anything. Lovely ingredients - I guess you could eat it if you wanted. The slightest hint of scent, but most delightful. Fades immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t post before and after pix (!), but this is a really nice cream - even for the cost, w hich is higher than most It is nicer than most - nicer pretty much than ALL. NOthing in the commercial market that I have seen/tried. Just READ the labels of the stuff on the shelves folks.&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice sheer, thin cream - no hint of oil or heavy (so if you are looking for heavy-duty moisturizer, this is not it). Their philosophy (see website) is to avoid heavier products and application of oils to the face, as such may prevent the production of one&#x27;s own. Not sure about that - but the product is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Regenerating Day Cream after using the Neck and Decollette Cream for a few months.  Unlike the neck cream, the day cream has a strong, unpleasant smell that lingers.  My face also turned very red immediately after using and a got a number of red, pimple like bumps (they went away in a few days).  I do have sensitive skin but thought that because I was fine with the neck cream, I would be fine with the day cream too.  The two products are very different.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife when she was pregnant, as apparently many face creams have ingredients that are not approved or outright discouraged for use during pregnancy, but the hauschka website (drhauschka.co.uk/skincare/lifestyle/mother-and-baby)  said that there were no contraindications for their product during pregnancy (yay finally!). My wife has been using it for a while, I can&#x27;t really say if there have been long term benefits, but her skin and face definitely glow and look more moisturized when using this. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, but its good enough, and the natural product ingredients make this a winner for me</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that is gentle and rich and smells terrific.  My face glows with it in.  I have sensitive skin and this calms and moisturizes without being to heavy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years - best on the market. I highly recommend it - well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been a hairdresser for 25 years so believe me when I say I have tried many, many facial products. This is OUTSTANDING.

            <li> The Rolls Royce of the natural skin care!</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Ah why do do Hr. Hauschka products have to be so great and so expensive?! I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> Love Haushka products in general as my skin has always been sensitive.  Have used the normalizing day cream for years.  An esthetician suggested using the day cream for my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin.  (I guess that means it can go to movies on its own ;)  Anyway, it provides a lot more moisture and dry spots around my nose have completely cleared up. I know the little tube is expensive but you only need a little bit and I believe it will last for at least 6 months or more.  Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I realize that any cream cannot make wonders but I prefer the best creams to keep my skin in its condition. My doctor strongly recommended me to use Dr. Hauschka creams, lotions, and gels.</li>
            <li> I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line. So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF. As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the oil to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  Then cleaned with the cream in the morning, the milk at night.  At night, per her instructions, I only applied the Facial Toner and patted that in. In the morning, I applied the Toner, then squirted a bit of Moisturizing Cream into palm and mixed that with 2 drops of the Normalizing Oil.  Within a week, people were complimenting me on my skin. I could see that it looked brighter, healthier, younger. But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine (I&#x27;m 59) should be treated with the Regenerating Serum and Cream, I plunked down the big bucks for those items.  My skin immediately went back to looking dull and older.  The serum leaves the skin feeling sticky; the cream reeks of mocha and doesn&#x27;t seem to add any moisture.  As soon as I use them up, I&#x27;m going back to the other products.  And my daughter, who is 25 and battling some acne, is now using the other products, too.  Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
            <li> Mixed feelings about Dr. H products. I like them, some are great (Rose&#x27;s Day Cream, for instance) but some really are just way too over-priced. This is one of them. I think there are products out there that do as good a job for much less $$.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and have been using Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s almost daily.  People always remark at my skin.  Soft and velvety with few wrinkles.  I switched from the regular face cream to the Regenerating Cream when I hit 60 or so and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Dr. Hauschka is the lightest, nicest thing anyone can put on her face.</li>
            <li> After two days of using the product, my skin looks amazing. Beautiful texture, bright and healthy looking. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 stars is because I do not like the smell. It stinks and it doesn&#x27;t go away. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was using Obagi and got tired of all of the chemicals I was putting on my face.  I switched to this product and I love it.  I am 37 with mature skin.  This works wonders.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and swears by it.  Item arrived ahead of schedule and she was pleasantly surprised.  The price was much lower than expected.</li>
            <li> The best face cream ever, not cause it smells good or looks pretty but because with regular use nothing else leaves skin so healthy</li>
            <li> Feels great when put on and lasts all day. Seems to make pores look smaller but allows skin to breathe and feel natural. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I love every product I&#x27;v tried in this line.. My skin is improving and the price is way better than another organic product that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Very well packed and just what I wanted!</li>
