            <li>Great, high-gloss results.  </li>
            <li>Oh what great hair you have.</li>
            <li>Her hair was noticeably glossier with fewer errant fly away hairs.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give the great reviews a try and have to say the smell of this shampoo and conditior is amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps my color looking great as well.</li>
            <li>hair got amazing and shining and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shinier, and the smell is great</li>
            <li>This kit is a great way to try all three products without sending a ton of money.</li>
            <li>very nice and not too</li>
            <li>Did I mention how nice it smells!</li>
            <li>paying more is not always hte best case..</li>
            <li>This 3 piece set is meant to bring a glossed, shiny look to your hair and comes with a pleasant smelling shampoo, conditioner and a tube of styling cream.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a pleasant citrus like aroma that lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Easily one of the best hair products I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo, like all shampoos, did a good job of cleaning my hair, and the conditioner was a good</li>
            <li>Good luck.  </li>
            <li>Nothing worked as good as this does.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I do have to say that the shampoo lathered up really good,</li>
            <li>I think this shampoo cleans fair to good</li>
            <li>I gave the rest to my wife who loved it.</li>
            <li>To be fair, this does include shampoo, conditioner, and a shining cream.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of the shampoo and conditioner from CVS, tried it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have used the glossing cream successfully on my already-DRY hair; that seems to just leave it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>While all products offer exceptional quality, as they should for the price which is on the upper-end - the \\&quot;Glossing Cr&amp;egrave;me\\&quot; is the must have.  </li>
            <li>While all products offer exceptional quality, as they should for the price which is on the upper-end -</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably a great product....</li>
            <li>The products had a nice scent and good texture.  </li>
            <li>This starter set is nice because it gives you really good tips on how to wash and condition your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;i was so excited and anticipated a brilliant outcome...</li>
            <li>The smell was real nice, like a clean floral smell and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>product is probably better for drier/frizzier hair, which mine is not!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and was extremely impressed with the results  --</li>
            <li>I love the Glossing Set!</li>
            <li>I do have these products and find that they lather, clean, and condition beautifully</li>
            <li>Let me state that I did not have amazing body to begin with</li>
            <li>and they are amazing.</li>
            <li>length brown hair a nice feel and shine...</li>
            <li>this kit is a nice way to do so.  </li>
            <li>The shining creme is nice and seemed to help control flyaways.  </li>
            <li>over, this was a nice product.  </li>
            <li>This waa nice product</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey for my wallet.</li>
            <li>I had some kind of reaction to the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too, it lasts.  </li>
            <li>It works wonders for taming and creating shine but is very strongly scented.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love this Product!</li>
            <li>but I love the improved texture, appearance and that great refreshing scent that fortunately lingers in the hair so pleasantly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, though, and not too overpowering like many shampoos can be.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance, is light and feels nice.</li>
            <li>Very light feel and scent.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s not marketed for volume, this glossing shampoo and conditioner gave my fine hair really nice body.</li>
            <li>I have relied on another name brand&#x27;s products for years and was satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this starter size just to try out Fekkai products after hearing so many people rave about them, esp the Glossing cream.  </li>
            <li>Healthy, shiny, manageable, no frizz or fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Fekkai hair products are my favorite</li>
            <li>sure to notice that these are travel sizes, probably about 4 oz.</li>
            <li>She states that this is professional grade name makes her hair incredibly manageable.  </li>
            <li>I was eager to give these products and was particularly pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love these products.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tested many shampoos over the years...</li>
            <li>Mostly used as floor cleaners and truck engine cleaners.</li>
            <li>It is much more manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of giving my hair a healthy glow, I ended up with frizzier hair.</li>
            <li>I did love the citrus (lemon/lime) smell but</li>
            <li>that was about all I enjoyed about the product.</li>
            <li>I would expect to get more product for almost thirty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this line of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Lovely refreshing scent that&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
            <li>More like a relaxation oil for the scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the glossing cream, too; it smooths the split ends, softens the ends of my hair, and makes it so shiny.  </li>
            <li>I get much better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the glossy line I also did not see an overwhelming \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; or shine added to my hair, considering the hefty price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>way better then</li>
            <li>Love the Fekkai Glossing shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>There did seem to be more shine.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a nicer gift for most anyone.  </li>
            <li>As with anything at Costco, you get a better value because you are buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>No frizziness, and even the thickness is more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to get more for the holidays!</li>
            <li>I have not tried the glossing cream yet, but I can&#x27;t imagine it getting any better.</li>
            <li>You can keep the full-size products at home and save this nicely compact bagged trio for your travel use as it really gives you everything you could ask for in a highly portable perfect sized package.  </li>
            <li>You can keep the full-size products at home and save this nicely compact bagged trio for your travel use as it really gives you everything you could ask for in a highly portable perfect sized package.  </li>
            <li>It feels rich with a nice viscosity helping it absorb.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is nice, with a pleasant scent, and it got my hair pretty clean.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a very clean smelling, citrus lime/lemon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so excited to find this product, I want to tell everyone about it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost!!  </li>
            <li>This is light years away from what you might find in a drugstore or supermarket,and probably better than most mass-market salon brands.  </li>
            <li>product smells nice and my hair feels nice after using it, but I can&#x27;t give it a high rating, because it just didn&#x27;t add any shine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use shine spray afterwards and my hair felt great- soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>We both recognized right away the lack of suds and gleefully liked it.</li>
            <li>My hair also gets oily very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but I felt really strongly about this product.  </li>
            <li>But, if used sparingly, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quick and love this product.</li>
            <li>I can only assume that it works best on certain hair types.</li>
            <li>(2) huge 30oz bottles of shampoo and cond..</li>
            <li>So for all of you that enjoy poisoning your brains with toxic chemicals, continue to use shampoo with sulfates.</li>
            <li>also like the light herbal scent.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and found that the shampoo and conditioner left my hair looking great without any oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Overall if money is no object than the Fekkai glossing starter kit is a great product.  </li>
            <li>but it was light and had a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo was okay, but I immediately loved the Glossing conditioner and the Glossing cream was terrific.</li>
            <li>I am lucky to have reasonably good hair, but it can look a bit frizzy , particularly in humid conditions.</li>
            <li>It dissipates nicely and allows good coverage with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>So, given that...if you are considering switching to these products - I highly recommend going with the sample size to start - just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make YOUR hair fall out too!</li>
            <li>The glossing cream is nice; it leaves your hair soft and bouncy, but it&#x27;s really easy to overdose if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if the fact that Amazon is not selling the latest version, Brilliant Glossing, made a difference.</li>
            <li>I have long blond , highlighted hair, which is in great condition and well taken care off.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit out.</li>
            <li>so it lasts a long time, great size bottles for travel.  </li>
            <li>I thought ok, first time use is blowing me away</li>
            <li>The smell is a very agreeable kind of herbal, flowery, smell that I cannot imagine anyone having a conflict with as it is neither feminine nor masculine; it&#x27;s a nice and clean nature-inspired...pleasantly non-synthetic.  </li>
            <li>Hair didnt feel clean after using.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the whole experience of using the products as the smell left me feeling like I was in a nice spa.  </li>
            <li>Love the large travel size bottles.</li>
            <li>However, I did &#x27;t notice anything special.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely AMAZING and it leaves my hair SO soft without any residue.  </li>
            <li>Very comparable results to what I get from Moroccan Oil products, but at a slightly better price point.</li>
            <li>really makes my processed hair feel so healthy and bouncy and</li>
            <li>When I shampoo and condition with these products my hair is softer and shinier when straight and softer and slightly more manageable when curly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, if they could keep the scent and change the formula up a bit I would have loved it, but as it is I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li>just enough I imagine to get good gloss results.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve tried the cr&amp;egrave;me you will likely be upset when you run out unless you have planned ahead and reordered - it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve tried the crème you will likely be upset when you run out unless you have planned ahead and reordered - it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>I found the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit to overall be a good product.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you really DO get what you pay for - and this is one slam-bang, top of the line hair system.  </li>
            <li>the overwhelming result was my hair looking very greasy,&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works alright.. not my favorite Fekkai shampoo, doesn&#x27;t really lather up well</li>
            <li>The shampoo did a good job of leaving my hair clean and shiny, but the conditioner and glosser made it feel strange and crackly.</li>
            <li>Glossing Cream has a stronger scent that is irresistibly fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>They also perform and semll both clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some,I did not find it overpowering- really fresh and clean.    </li>
            <li>Perhaps it works for more normal hair types</li>
            <li>**    - Works as advertised by leaving hair clean and shiny  - Light fragrance that does not overpower but lasts for some time  - Gentle cleaning that won&#x27;t leave your tub with lots of fallen hair    </li>
            <li>The conditioner does a good job of conditioning my hair without adding too much buildup - a major plus.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTE PERFECTION IN A BOTTLE!!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight and fine.  </li>
            <li>have tried all sorts of shampoos and conditioners to calm the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>but I can rarely afford them.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are good products; they rinse cleanly and don&#x27;t leave an odd residue on your skin, as some&lt;br /&gt;moisture-heavy hair products do.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that over all the years and all the shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried...this one is the only one that makes my hair fall out ...by the handful!</li>
            <li>The Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit is definitely not that spectacular.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Getting the sample kit might definitely be worth a try.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice product</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily just to get a nice style.  </li>
            <li>but to me, worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The conditioner, on the other hand, is more potent.  </li>
            <li>You WILL notice improvement, right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>And this is the first shampoo/conditioner that gives me the exact results I&#x27;ve always wished and hoped for!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about having to go to the salon two weeks early to fix my highlights, but that&#x27;s the risk one takes when using shampoo that&#x27;s not specifically marked \\&quot;color safe\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It seems to replicate getting a clear &#x27;glaze&#x27; at a salon which would easily be triple the price.</li>
            <li>Great hair starts with a great haircut, but upkeep is key - and the dramatic results with the Fekkai system give you a best-in-class feeling that might just give you an edge!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, decent products, but nothing special in my book...</li>
            <li>I did start ordering the full sizes of this particular set.</li>
            <li>Summer humidity turns my hair into a Brillo pad, only not quite so cute.  </li>
            <li>I know from my dad, who was a long-time barber/hairstylist, that most commercial hair products are like \\&quot;using dish detergent on your hair\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>From the first week I could tell there was a difference</li>
            <li>When it says pea-sized bit, that&#x27;s really all you need!</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I try Fekkai&#x27;s glossing products.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased the starter kit instead of the larger size bottles.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in my hair after the first use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first exposure to Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li>Have used this several times and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the products.</li>
            <li>In this economy, many are looking for job&#x27;s and 1st impressions can really be critical.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to treat myself and get a higher up shampoo, but never again.</li>
            <li>Check to see if Costco is selling this first, then turn to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Seriously, my whole life!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Also I came off a really rough time with stress and lost a ton of weight, kind of malnourished myself.  </li>
            <li>I decided to stop trying full sizes of new products, so I ordered this starter set.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner have a light fresh scent that most anyone would like, male or female.</li>
            <li>I have bleached hair, very dry and brittle, ends break off very easily and it had stopped growing so it seemed.  </li>
            <li>Soft clean hair with an observable shine.  </li>
            <li>That would imply a certain higher quality, to me, as opposed to something of a \\&quot;watered-down\\&quot; nature.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever been curious about Fekkai hair care products, this particular glossing starter kit is a more than adequate way to give these high-end hair products a try.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Wen for the past 8 years or so and loved it</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li>- I wash and condition it every day, blow dry and then on most days I also use a ceramic curling iron on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put too much on the first time and my hair felt ick - oily-like or too much product on it.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is extremely dry, it may work out better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li>Fekkai products seem to be of a certain concentration whereby you do not have to use a large amount of product.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to try before investing in large bottles.  </li>
            <li>It is TOTALLY worth the money, and you shouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this if you want soft and shiny hair!</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair that is kind of wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>If you are familiar with Vaseline&#x27;s line of body lotions, this kit smells exactly like Vaseline&#x27;s Total Moisture Conditioning body lotion.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t add as much shine as silicone serums, but it does improve shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>mission accomplished.  </li>
            <li>so I really couldn&#x27;t afford to lose any.  </li>
            <li>I gave this to my wife, she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Come on, does it really cost $20+ to produce one bottle of this stuff?  </li>
            <li>But curly girls might find that these products relax their curls too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It adds shine and manageability which is always appreciated.</li>
            <li>Without having read the ingredients, she guessed at the olive oil component, not because her hair was greasy but because it seemed so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>wanted to like this product so much</li>
            <li>so I went to my local ulta store and tried the color technician version, and I do have to say the shampoo I believe it was left the highlights, which are in need to be redone in great condition and color, but same thing, my hair got very frizzy as the day went on,</li>
            <li>Flyaways are a real problem for me, so I thought I&#x27;d give this kit a try.  </li>
            <li>The name says it all as it truly makes even my brittle hair shine and feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Pricey, but a reasonable luxury indulgence for some.</li>
            <li>Much has been made over the cost of the products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that this set works better for me when I&#x27;m in the drier place with the harder water.</li>
            <li>The Fekkai glossing starter kit is a bit pricey but it lives up to its promise of providing gentle cleansing along shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product, will definitely buy the larger bottles next time.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>I have been searching my whole life for a shampoo/conditioner that would help manage the frizziness without making my hair oily and greasy.  </li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of results.</li>
            <li>To add insult to injury you only get about 4 oz worth of product for the $20 plus dollars you spend!  </li>
            <li>The finishing cream in particular really enhances the look throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I found these products to be acceptable, but nothing special, and ended up purposely leaving them in a hotel after using them for several days.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I am a guy in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I bought the full size bottle at Nordstroms paid over $80 for a size that could last maybe 1 1/2 months..</li>
            <li>The hair gloss will last for 6 mths or more, doesn&#x27;t take much at all, dime size or smaller.</li>
            <li>I know other reviewers have commented that they love that the most out of this kit, but then we all probably have different hair and live in different climates.  </li>
            <li>I frequently travel between a place where the environment is much dryer/water harder and where I live where the water is softer and there&#x27;s more moisture in the air.</li>
            <li>for most guy&#x27;s even half the suggested amount (a pea size) will do the trick.</li>
            <li>As a disclaimer, I do warn that this product&#x27;s a bit pricier than your average products, but I&#x27;ve long since learned that for good hair, you have to pay the price.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything particular to my hair and it smelled like citrucy sweat.</li>
            <li>The main drawback was the price.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a great product for women with long, straight, thick hair who want to increase shine and manageability without feeling like they have loads of goop on their hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly reocmmend.</li>
            <li>high quality hair care product.  </li>
            <li>So although I liked the products individually, I did not feel that they were appreciably better than your average brands and definitely not worth</li>
            <li>I tried lots of high end salon brands but nothing comes close to this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for my hair type ladies out there.  </li>
            <li>The glossing creme works like a Gel - ultra light and there is absolutely zero residue, unlike all the other gel products.</li>
            <li>So in other words, I&#x27;ve spent my fair share on great-quality products.</li>
            <li>You know how we all search for the product that will really make our hair soft and shiny?  </li>
            <li>clean dry hair, and</li>
            <li>I have long hair that gets the frizzies more often than not and is starting to show some \\&quot;grays\\&quot; as well.  </li>
            <li>So, with that in mind it would be a nice kit for those with thick, unruly hair that could use a bit of taming.</li>
            <li>shampoo is a high quality product with a rich lather and a pleasing fragrance, herbal remotely \\&quot;apple-like\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>When working on a soundstage, hair can be exposed to many elements, not the least of which are hot lights, which tend to dry out hair, along with the use of flat irons blow dryers and more.</li>
            <li>the price there is no different than you can buy right here through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Oh, did I mention that I also live in they climate around Phoenix Arizona?&lt;br</li>
            <li>Time will tell if I can&#x27;t live without this now that I&#x27;ve tried it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also use the subscribe and save method, so it sends me a new set every 1-3 months.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner came brand new in a box.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner made my hair dry and brittle not to mention super frizzy..</li>
            <li>It was adequate for washing and cleaning hair, but did not live up to its description of \\&quot;glossing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Fekkai products keep my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The shampoo, conditioner and cream do leave my hair feeling very soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>I have found that using the products over the past few weeks has REALLY improved the texture and most importantly the shine of the hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a combination hair, being that it&#x27;s colored (most of the time), long, wavy, dry at the ends, etc.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a change the first time I used the products, and after using it multiple times I can assure you that the results are continuing,and build upon each use.    </li>
            <li>The same is true at home ( minus the hot lights, I HOPE).      </li>
            <li>This product makes your hair soft and the glossing cream makes your hair shine!</li>
            <li>Every time I use it (only need to use every other day), I get many compliments on how shiny my hair is.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could afford the full sizes, but I&#x27;m being careful with the starter sizes</li>
            <li>It did turn my subtle salon highlights into a shockingly bright blonde -</li>
            <li>Though this is a \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; it really lasts a long time, because you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The glossing cream is nice, but believe me, a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying a smaller starter kit to try out the products before investing in full size bottles that may or may not meet one&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>I love to put it on my wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I did and so did a friend who has fine, blonde and very dry hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For now, I&#x27;ll start using the full sized shampoo and conditioner but skip the cream until they make a new version with less or no fragrance.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, fine and color-treated and it is gentle on the hair and yet delivers control and shine.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leave your hair wonderfully soft and silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>makes your hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>the condition is not heavy or greasey .</li>
            <li>I have used different brands of hair products (both cheap and expensive) for so many years and have not found one that suits my hair until now.</li>
            <li>The scent reminded me of Prell shampoo from the old days (do they still make that?) and seemed sort of \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; based vs herbal based.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciated the travel-bag that these products come encased in - have already used it on several weekend trips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I used all three products exactly as directed over a period of 2 weeks - which is about as long as the product lasted.</li>
            <li>Still, I did not see any improvement to my hair as far as a \\&quot;shiny, healthy\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li>Also, my sensitive scalp and skin didn&#x27;t break out at all with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used Fekkai&#x27;s Protein Rx and was amazed by how soft was hair felt.</li>
            <li>like I said especially the smell of the glossy line, makes it very tempting to purchase it.</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and shiny with no frizz.</li>
            <li>Even my natural waves started to form in a prettier way.</li>
            <li>This kit comes with what must be considered the complete Fekkai \\&quot;Glossing\\</li>
            <li>Since I do not at this time buy highend haircare products, I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it with, but I would definitely not be buying it for myself at this price.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair, so i rub a quarter size in my palms then apply to the ends first and work my way up the shaft of my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky after using it.  </li>
            <li>I had originally rated this as a 4 star package after using it for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to people who are sensitive to detergents, shampoo, etc... or who overwork their hair on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>My hair is lately dull and dry thanks to over-processing, so when I saw the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit, I thought I found the answer to shiny, healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>For guys with thin or fine hair, it is really essential, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My wife has long, thick dark hair and used this set of Fekkai products with great results.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo gives a decent lather, not ridiculous, and it covers well as long as you use enough.  </li>
            <li>naturally nonplussed and pretty without setting off a sensitive scalp that is constantly dry and ends that split and break all the time because of the constant, necessary brushing.</li>
            <li>I usually do not take the time to write reviews especially if I havent purchased the item from Amazon</li>
            <li>I also found you tend to use LESS of this product than traditional brands, it is super concentrated.      </li>
            <li>Based on the other positive reviews</li>
            <li>Yeah, if you like doing your hair every day, as in blowdrying it, glossing it with tons of hair products and generally spending beacoups of time making it look ala</li>
            <li>The next time I had my hair professionally colored</li>
            <li>Used it only once so far.  </li>
            <li>hair was very soft (my hair is long , straight and thick) and bouncy the first day, or should I say first half of the day, I used the shampoo, conditioner and the glossing creme, and in the later afternoon my hair started getting frizzy, given I do live in the south, but when i compare it with my regular l;oreal moisturizer conditioner and the leave in spray conditioner</li>
            <li>It leaves less of a residue and my hair feels light, not bogged down.</li>
            <li>After the first 3 days I could tell that my hair was less frizzy, but there was also buildup.</li>
            <li>She has tried other similar products in the past, and does not consider it superior to other products tried, but it is not inferior</li>
            <li>My hair is much easier to manage, and it stays in place longer than with other products.</li>
            <li>However I never got my hair to a really glossy shine, but that may be just due to the texture of my hair and not to a problem with the product.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are like me and already require more expensive products to get the job done than you might find these unexpectedly helpful.</li>
            <li>Recommended, in spite of being expensive (on the up-side, the products are nicely concentrated), especially the \\&quot;Glossing Cr&amp;egrave;me\\&quot;.e way to do so.  </li>
            <li>Recommended, in spite of being expensive (on the up-side, the products are nicely concentrated), especially the \\&quot;Glossing Crème\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The formula is slightly scented and the Glossing Cream works really well.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine blond hair</li>

            <li> very nice and not too</li>
            <li> Did I mention how nice it smells!</li>
            <li> paying more is not always hte best case..</li>
            <li> This 3 piece set is meant to bring a glossed, shiny look to your hair and comes with a pleasant smelling shampoo, conditioner and a tube of styling cream.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is a pleasant citrus like aroma that lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Easily one of the best hair products I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo, like all shampoos, did a good job of cleaning my hair, and the conditioner was a good</li>
            <li> Good luck.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worked as good as this does.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I do have to say that the shampoo lathered up really good,</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo cleans fair to good</li>
            <li> I gave the rest to my wife who loved it.</li>
            <li> To be fair, this does include shampoo, conditioner, and a shining cream.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample of the shampoo and conditioner from CVS, tried it and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have used the glossing cream successfully on my already-DRY hair; that seems to just leave it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> While all products offer exceptional quality, as they should for the price which is on the upper-end - the \\&quot;Glossing Cr&amp;egrave;me\\&quot; is the must have.  </li>
            <li> While all products offer exceptional quality, as they should for the price which is on the upper-end -</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably a great product....</li>
            <li> The products had a nice scent and good texture.  </li>
            <li> This starter set is nice because it gives you really good tips on how to wash and condition your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was so excited and anticipated a brilliant outcome...</li>
            <li> The smell was real nice, like a clean floral smell and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> product is probably better for drier/frizzier hair, which mine is not!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and was extremely impressed with the results  --</li>
            <li> I love the Glossing Set!</li>
            <li> I do have these products and find that they lather, clean, and condition beautifully</li>
            <li> Let me state that I did not have amazing body to begin with</li>
            <li> and they are amazing.</li>
            <li> length brown hair a nice feel and shine...</li>
            <li> this kit is a nice way to do so.  </li>
            <li> The shining creme is nice and seemed to help control flyaways.  </li>
            <li> over, this was a nice product.  </li>
            <li> This waa nice product</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey for my wallet.</li>
            <li> I had some kind of reaction to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too, it lasts.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders for taming and creating shine but is very strongly scented.  </li>
            <li> Love, Love this Product!</li>
            <li> but I love the improved texture, appearance and that great refreshing scent that fortunately lingers in the hair so pleasantly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, though, and not too overpowering like many shampoos can be.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance, is light and feels nice.</li>
            <li> Very light feel and scent.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not marketed for volume, this glossing shampoo and conditioner gave my fine hair really nice body.</li>
            <li> I have relied on another name brand&#x27;s products for years and was satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this starter size just to try out Fekkai products after hearing so many people rave about them, esp the Glossing cream.  </li>
            <li> Healthy, shiny, manageable, no frizz or fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Fekkai hair products are my favorite</li>
            <li> sure to notice that these are travel sizes, probably about 4 oz.</li>
            <li> She states that this is professional grade name makes her hair incredibly manageable.  </li>
            <li> I was eager to give these products and was particularly pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I love these products.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve tested many shampoos over the years...</li>
            <li> Mostly used as floor cleaners and truck engine cleaners.</li>
            <li> It is much more manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of giving my hair a healthy glow, I ended up with frizzier hair.</li>
            <li> I did love the citrus (lemon/lime) smell but</li>
            <li> that was about all I enjoyed about the product.</li>
            <li> I would expect to get more product for almost thirty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this line of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Lovely refreshing scent that&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
            <li> More like a relaxation oil for the scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the glossing cream, too; it smooths the split ends, softens the ends of my hair, and makes it so shiny.  </li>
            <li> I get much better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the glossy line I also did not see an overwhelming \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; or shine added to my hair, considering the hefty price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> way better then</li>
            <li> Love the Fekkai Glossing shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> There did seem to be more shine.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a nicer gift for most anyone.  </li>
            <li> As with anything at Costco, you get a better value because you are buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> No frizziness, and even the thickness is more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to get more for the holidays!</li>
            <li> I have not tried the glossing cream yet, but I can&#x27;t imagine it getting any better.</li>
            <li> You can keep the full-size products at home and save this nicely compact bagged trio for your travel use as it really gives you everything you could ask for in a highly portable perfect sized package.  </li>
            <li> You can keep the full-size products at home and save this nicely compact bagged trio for your travel use as it really gives you everything you could ask for in a highly portable perfect sized package.  </li>
            <li> It feels rich with a nice viscosity helping it absorb.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is nice, with a pleasant scent, and it got my hair pretty clean.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is a very clean smelling, citrus lime/lemon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so excited to find this product, I want to tell everyone about it!</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost!!  </li>
            <li> This is light years away from what you might find in a drugstore or supermarket,and probably better than most mass-market salon brands.  </li>
            <li> product smells nice and my hair feels nice after using it, but I can&#x27;t give it a high rating, because it just didn&#x27;t add any shine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use shine spray afterwards and my hair felt great- soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> We both recognized right away the lack of suds and gleefully liked it.</li>
            <li> My hair also gets oily very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but I felt really strongly about this product.  </li>
            <li> But, if used sparingly, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quick and love this product.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that it works best on certain hair types.</li>
            <li> (2) huge 30oz bottles of shampoo and cond..</li>
            <li> So for all of you that enjoy poisoning your brains with toxic chemicals, continue to use shampoo with sulfates.</li>
            <li> also like the light herbal scent.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and found that the shampoo and conditioner left my hair looking great without any oily residue.  </li>
            <li> Overall if money is no object than the Fekkai glossing starter kit is a great product.  </li>
            <li> but it was light and had a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo was okay, but I immediately loved the Glossing conditioner and the Glossing cream was terrific.</li>
            <li> I am lucky to have reasonably good hair, but it can look a bit frizzy , particularly in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> It dissipates nicely and allows good coverage with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> So, given that...if you are considering switching to these products - I highly recommend going with the sample size to start - just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make YOUR hair fall out too!</li>
            <li> The glossing cream is nice; it leaves your hair soft and bouncy, but it&#x27;s really easy to overdose if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if the fact that Amazon is not selling the latest version, Brilliant Glossing, made a difference.</li>
            <li> I have long blond , highlighted hair, which is in great condition and well taken care off.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit out.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time, great size bottles for travel.  </li>
            <li> I thought ok, first time use is blowing me away</li>
            <li> The smell is a very agreeable kind of herbal, flowery, smell that I cannot imagine anyone having a conflict with as it is neither feminine nor masculine; it&#x27;s a nice and clean nature-inspired...pleasantly non-synthetic.  </li>
            <li> Hair didnt feel clean after using.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the whole experience of using the products as the smell left me feeling like I was in a nice spa.  </li>
            <li> Love the large travel size bottles.</li>
            <li> However, I did &#x27;t notice anything special.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely AMAZING and it leaves my hair SO soft without any residue.  </li>
            <li> Very comparable results to what I get from Moroccan Oil products, but at a slightly better price point.</li>
            <li> really makes my processed hair feel so healthy and bouncy and</li>
            <li> When I shampoo and condition with these products my hair is softer and shinier when straight and softer and slightly more manageable when curly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, if they could keep the scent and change the formula up a bit I would have loved it, but as it is I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> just enough I imagine to get good gloss results.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve tried the cr&amp;egrave;me you will likely be upset when you run out unless you have planned ahead and reordered - it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve tried the crème you will likely be upset when you run out unless you have planned ahead and reordered - it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> I found the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit to overall be a good product.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you really DO get what you pay for - and this is one slam-bang, top of the line hair system.  </li>
            <li> the overwhelming result was my hair looking very greasy,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works alright.. not my favorite Fekkai shampoo, doesn&#x27;t really lather up well</li>
            <li> The shampoo did a good job of leaving my hair clean and shiny, but the conditioner and glosser made it feel strange and crackly.</li>
            <li> Glossing Cream has a stronger scent that is irresistibly fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> They also perform and semll both clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some,I did not find it overpowering- really fresh and clean.    </li>
            <li> Perhaps it works for more normal hair types</li>
            <li> **    - Works as advertised by leaving hair clean and shiny  - Light fragrance that does not overpower but lasts for some time  - Gentle cleaning that won&#x27;t leave your tub with lots of fallen hair    </li>
            <li> The conditioner does a good job of conditioning my hair without adding too much buildup - a major plus.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE PERFECTION IN A BOTTLE!!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight and fine.  </li>
            <li> have tried all sorts of shampoos and conditioners to calm the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> but I can rarely afford them.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are good products; they rinse cleanly and don&#x27;t leave an odd residue on your skin, as some&lt;br /&gt;moisture-heavy hair products do.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that over all the years and all the shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried...this one is the only one that makes my hair fall out ...by the handful!</li>
            <li> The Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit is definitely not that spectacular.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting the sample kit might definitely be worth a try.</li>
            <li> Overall a nice product</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily just to get a nice style.  </li>
            <li> but to me, worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The conditioner, on the other hand, is more potent.  </li>
            <li> You WILL notice improvement, right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> And this is the first shampoo/conditioner that gives me the exact results I&#x27;ve always wished and hoped for!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about having to go to the salon two weeks early to fix my highlights, but that&#x27;s the risk one takes when using shampoo that&#x27;s not specifically marked \\&quot;color safe\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It seems to replicate getting a clear &#x27;glaze&#x27; at a salon which would easily be triple the price.</li>
            <li> Great hair starts with a great haircut, but upkeep is key - and the dramatic results with the Fekkai system give you a best-in-class feeling that might just give you an edge!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, decent products, but nothing special in my book...</li>
            <li> I did start ordering the full sizes of this particular set.</li>
            <li> Summer humidity turns my hair into a Brillo pad, only not quite so cute.  </li>
            <li> I know from my dad, who was a long-time barber/hairstylist, that most commercial hair products are like \\&quot;using dish detergent on your hair\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li> From the first week I could tell there was a difference</li>
            <li> When it says pea-sized bit, that&#x27;s really all you need!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I try Fekkai&#x27;s glossing products.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased the starter kit instead of the larger size bottles.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my hair after the first use.  </li>
            <li> This is my first exposure to Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li> Have used this several times and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the products.</li>
            <li> In this economy, many are looking for job&#x27;s and 1st impressions can really be critical.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to treat myself and get a higher up shampoo, but never again.</li>
            <li> Check to see if Costco is selling this first, then turn to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my whole life!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Also I came off a really rough time with stress and lost a ton of weight, kind of malnourished myself.  </li>
            <li> I decided to stop trying full sizes of new products, so I ordered this starter set.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner have a light fresh scent that most anyone would like, male or female.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair, very dry and brittle, ends break off very easily and it had stopped growing so it seemed.  </li>
            <li> Soft clean hair with an observable shine.  </li>
            <li> That would imply a certain higher quality, to me, as opposed to something of a \\&quot;watered-down\\&quot; nature.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever been curious about Fekkai hair care products, this particular glossing starter kit is a more than adequate way to give these high-end hair products a try.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for the past 8 years or so and loved it</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li> - I wash and condition it every day, blow dry and then on most days I also use a ceramic curling iron on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put too much on the first time and my hair felt ick - oily-like or too much product on it.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is extremely dry, it may work out better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li> Fekkai products seem to be of a certain concentration whereby you do not have to use a large amount of product.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to try before investing in large bottles.  </li>
            <li> It is TOTALLY worth the money, and you shouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this if you want soft and shiny hair!</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that is kind of wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> If you are familiar with Vaseline&#x27;s line of body lotions, this kit smells exactly like Vaseline&#x27;s Total Moisture Conditioning body lotion.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add as much shine as silicone serums, but it does improve shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> mission accomplished.  </li>
            <li> so I really couldn&#x27;t afford to lose any.  </li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife, she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Come on, does it really cost $20+ to produce one bottle of this stuff?  </li>
            <li> But curly girls might find that these products relax their curls too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It adds shine and manageability which is always appreciated.</li>
            <li> Without having read the ingredients, she guessed at the olive oil component, not because her hair was greasy but because it seemed so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> wanted to like this product so much</li>
            <li> so I went to my local ulta store and tried the color technician version, and I do have to say the shampoo I believe it was left the highlights, which are in need to be redone in great condition and color, but same thing, my hair got very frizzy as the day went on,</li>
            <li> Flyaways are a real problem for me, so I thought I&#x27;d give this kit a try.  </li>
            <li> The name says it all as it truly makes even my brittle hair shine and feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li> Pricey, but a reasonable luxury indulgence for some.</li>
            <li> Much has been made over the cost of the products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that this set works better for me when I&#x27;m in the drier place with the harder water.</li>
            <li> The Fekkai glossing starter kit is a bit pricey but it lives up to its promise of providing gentle cleansing along shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely buy the larger bottles next time.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li> I have been searching my whole life for a shampoo/conditioner that would help manage the frizziness without making my hair oily and greasy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> To add insult to injury you only get about 4 oz worth of product for the $20 plus dollars you spend!  </li>
            <li> The finishing cream in particular really enhances the look throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I found these products to be acceptable, but nothing special, and ended up purposely leaving them in a hotel after using them for several days.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I am a guy in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I bought the full size bottle at Nordstroms paid over $80 for a size that could last maybe 1 1/2 months..</li>
            <li> The hair gloss will last for 6 mths or more, doesn&#x27;t take much at all, dime size or smaller.</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers have commented that they love that the most out of this kit, but then we all probably have different hair and live in different climates.  </li>
            <li> I frequently travel between a place where the environment is much dryer/water harder and where I live where the water is softer and there&#x27;s more moisture in the air.</li>
            <li> for most guy&#x27;s even half the suggested amount (a pea size) will do the trick.</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I do warn that this product&#x27;s a bit pricier than your average products, but I&#x27;ve long since learned that for good hair, you have to pay the price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything particular to my hair and it smelled like citrucy sweat.</li>
            <li> The main drawback was the price.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a great product for women with long, straight, thick hair who want to increase shine and manageability without feeling like they have loads of goop on their hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly reocmmend.</li>
            <li> high quality hair care product.  </li>
            <li> So although I liked the products individually, I did not feel that they were appreciably better than your average brands and definitely not worth</li>
            <li> I tried lots of high end salon brands but nothing comes close to this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for my hair type ladies out there.  </li>
            <li> The glossing creme works like a Gel - ultra light and there is absolutely zero residue, unlike all the other gel products.</li>
            <li> So in other words, I&#x27;ve spent my fair share on great-quality products.</li>
            <li> You know how we all search for the product that will really make our hair soft and shiny?  </li>
            <li> clean dry hair, and</li>
            <li> I have long hair that gets the frizzies more often than not and is starting to show some \\&quot;grays\\&quot; as well.  </li>
            <li> So, with that in mind it would be a nice kit for those with thick, unruly hair that could use a bit of taming.</li>
            <li> shampoo is a high quality product with a rich lather and a pleasing fragrance, herbal remotely \\&quot;apple-like\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> When working on a soundstage, hair can be exposed to many elements, not the least of which are hot lights, which tend to dry out hair, along with the use of flat irons blow dryers and more.</li>
            <li> the price there is no different than you can buy right here through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Oh, did I mention that I also live in they climate around Phoenix Arizona?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Time will tell if I can&#x27;t live without this now that I&#x27;ve tried it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also use the subscribe and save method, so it sends me a new set every 1-3 months.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner came brand new in a box.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner made my hair dry and brittle not to mention super frizzy..</li>
            <li> It was adequate for washing and cleaning hair, but did not live up to its description of \\&quot;glossing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Fekkai products keep my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The shampoo, conditioner and cream do leave my hair feeling very soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> I have found that using the products over the past few weeks has REALLY improved the texture and most importantly the shine of the hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a combination hair, being that it&#x27;s colored (most of the time), long, wavy, dry at the ends, etc.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a change the first time I used the products, and after using it multiple times I can assure you that the results are continuing,and build upon each use.    </li>
            <li> The same is true at home ( minus the hot lights, I HOPE).      </li>
            <li> This product makes your hair soft and the glossing cream makes your hair shine!</li>
            <li> Every time I use it (only need to use every other day), I get many compliments on how shiny my hair is.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could afford the full sizes, but I&#x27;m being careful with the starter sizes</li>
            <li> It did turn my subtle salon highlights into a shockingly bright blonde -</li>
            <li> Though this is a \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; it really lasts a long time, because you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The glossing cream is nice, but believe me, a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying a smaller starter kit to try out the products before investing in full size bottles that may or may not meet one&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> I love to put it on my wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I did and so did a friend who has fine, blonde and very dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For now, I&#x27;ll start using the full sized shampoo and conditioner but skip the cream until they make a new version with less or no fragrance.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, fine and color-treated and it is gentle on the hair and yet delivers control and shine.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leave your hair wonderfully soft and silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> makes your hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> the condition is not heavy or greasey .</li>
            <li> I have used different brands of hair products (both cheap and expensive) for so many years and have not found one that suits my hair until now.</li>
            <li> The scent reminded me of Prell shampoo from the old days (do they still make that?) and seemed sort of \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; based vs herbal based.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciated the travel-bag that these products come encased in - have already used it on several weekend trips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I used all three products exactly as directed over a period of 2 weeks - which is about as long as the product lasted.</li>
            <li> Still, I did not see any improvement to my hair as far as a \\&quot;shiny, healthy\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li> Also, my sensitive scalp and skin didn&#x27;t break out at all with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used Fekkai&#x27;s Protein Rx and was amazed by how soft was hair felt.</li>
            <li> like I said especially the smell of the glossy line, makes it very tempting to purchase it.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and shiny with no frizz.</li>
            <li> Even my natural waves started to form in a prettier way.</li>
            <li> This kit comes with what must be considered the complete Fekkai \\&quot;Glossing\\</li>
            <li> Since I do not at this time buy highend haircare products, I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it with, but I would definitely not be buying it for myself at this price.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, so i rub a quarter size in my palms then apply to the ends first and work my way up the shaft of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky after using it.  </li>
            <li> I had originally rated this as a 4 star package after using it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to people who are sensitive to detergents, shampoo, etc... or who overwork their hair on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> My hair is lately dull and dry thanks to over-processing, so when I saw the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit, I thought I found the answer to shiny, healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> For guys with thin or fine hair, it is really essential, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My wife has long, thick dark hair and used this set of Fekkai products with great results.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo gives a decent lather, not ridiculous, and it covers well as long as you use enough.  </li>
            <li> naturally nonplussed and pretty without setting off a sensitive scalp that is constantly dry and ends that split and break all the time because of the constant, necessary brushing.</li>
            <li> I usually do not take the time to write reviews especially if I havent purchased the item from Amazon</li>
            <li> I also found you tend to use LESS of this product than traditional brands, it is super concentrated.      </li>
            <li> Based on the other positive reviews</li>
            <li> Yeah, if you like doing your hair every day, as in blowdrying it, glossing it with tons of hair products and generally spending beacoups of time making it look ala</li>
            <li> The next time I had my hair professionally colored</li>
            <li> Used it only once so far.  </li>
            <li> hair was very soft (my hair is long , straight and thick) and bouncy the first day, or should I say first half of the day, I used the shampoo, conditioner and the glossing creme, and in the later afternoon my hair started getting frizzy, given I do live in the south, but when i compare it with my regular l;oreal moisturizer conditioner and the leave in spray conditioner</li>
            <li> It leaves less of a residue and my hair feels light, not bogged down.</li>
            <li> After the first 3 days I could tell that my hair was less frizzy, but there was also buildup.</li>
            <li> She has tried other similar products in the past, and does not consider it superior to other products tried, but it is not inferior</li>
            <li> My hair is much easier to manage, and it stays in place longer than with other products.</li>
            <li> However I never got my hair to a really glossy shine, but that may be just due to the texture of my hair and not to a problem with the product.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are like me and already require more expensive products to get the job done than you might find these unexpectedly helpful.</li>
            <li> Recommended, in spite of being expensive (on the up-side, the products are nicely concentrated), especially the \\&quot;Glossing Cr&amp;egrave;me\\&quot;.e way to do so.  </li>
            <li> Recommended, in spite of being expensive (on the up-side, the products are nicely concentrated), especially the \\&quot;Glossing Crème\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The formula is slightly scented and the Glossing Cream works really well.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine blond hair</li>
            <li> but it did leave my hair fealling rather heavy and limp, almost like it wasn&#x27;t clean.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product although a bit expensive but it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> Having short-medium length hair, I can probably use the Glossing cream for a long time as it only takes a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> All of the products go a long way because it only takes a very tiny bit.  </li>
            <li> Putting aside the smell, my main problem with this product is that it did not smooth away frizz and flyaways</li>
            <li> do believe, that if your hair is in bad condition, this line will probably help you with the overall condition of the hair, it might also work better if you do not live in the south with high humidity.</li>
            <li> but it did not last to long.</li>
            <li> It really is a miracle cure for my dry stiff hair.  </li>
            <li> Also worth noting is that it seems like you need less of the Fekkai shampoo to get your hair clean, though this may be a subconscious attempt at trying to use less of this stuff because it so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Fekkai leaves my hair soft, for sure--but I notice that it weighs down my curls and transforms them into waves by day&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li> Also, just a tiny bit went a very long way.</li>
            <li> my medium-length male hair with a tendency to look dry during the winter</li>
            <li> And here&#x27;s my only complaint, if you do accidentally get too much, your hair might feel oily even after blowdrying it out.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost embarrassed to say I like the product since I usually just stick with cheap shampoos and usually won&#x27;t use any conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The workhorse of the system has to be the Glossing Cream,and a VERY little bit will go a VERY long way- with or without a flat iron, this really amp&#x27;s up the shine-</li>
            <li> I know it is more expensive than other hair care products</li>
            <li> The glossing gel, even used in a very small amount, left my hair feeling sticky and didn&#x27;t leave it looking very glossy.</li>
            <li> no different than suave - or any other drug store generic brand.</li>
            <li> smell is very delicate but fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> After using this set of products for a few weeks, my hair transformed into soft, shiny, and touchable.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive for the small sizes.  </li>
            <li> My thick mane of hair, always looks like nothing much until it&#x27;s blown dry or</li>
            <li> A VERY LONG WAY.  </li>
            <li> it is more expensive than my previous products, but what a difference it has made!</li>
            <li> and I use very very little and WOW ...</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, coarse, and dark colored hair.</li>
            <li> Although you get three separate, although somewhat small, products in the box, $25 seems like an awfully high price for hair cair products for the average consumer.  </li>
            <li> She mentioned that her hair had previously become damaged from some prior products, and that the Fekkai items helped repair her hair.  </li>
            <li> They seem too big for airline travel and too small for regular use, even though it&#x27;s a starter kit.</li>
            <li> the leave in treatment left my hair oily and I only put a small dime size amount...</li>
            <li> Overall, my hair felt slightly brittle if I didn&#x27;t use a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> It does have a down-side if you have thin hair as it certainly removes a bit of body by the glossing and smoothing effect it gives.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair which fortunately is very manageable and forgiving.</li>
            <li> She has medium body, long, black hair.</li>
            <li> Not only did it tame my hair</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t make my hair noticeably shinier than other</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps it was due to hormonal changes (menopause....)</li>
            <li> But i need something to protect my highlights from fading and changing colors, so I might consider re purchasing the shampoo only and using my usual L;oreal Conditioner with it.</li>
            <li> weighed my hair down and did not perform the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it is kinda try and hard.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is quite average at three stars.  </li>
            <li> 3X the cost of the average brands.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was thick as well but not sticky, however it didn&#x27;t wash out well and left my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> As for me, Ill use all organic plant based poos for alot less money, and much healthier.</li>
            <li> I tend to have a lot of frizz and this cuts down on that too.  </li>
            <li> Any way, if the less costlier products work for you than I suggest you not bother.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of wax or soap fuss which means less deposit buildup on our scalps.</li>
            <li> some shine, yes, but the hugest result was a&lt;br /&gt;slick greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t quite live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> , A LITTLE BIT GOES</li>
            <li> **    - Expensive  - Small quantity despite the high price</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The collection lasted a few days longer than 5 1/2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m a little hard on my hair</li>
            <li> I will go back to the way it was .. limp and thin and dull!  </li>
            <li> I bought the small bottles of this at cvs at 9.99 a pop</li>
            <li> my hair is silky without the dull oily look...</li>
            <li> I would buy this product, but as I said, I do recommend using a clarifing shampoo at least once a week.</li>
            <li> * Negative Points:</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thick and somewhat sticky.</li>
            <li> It was frizzy, dull, unmanageable, and just difficult to deal with all around.</li>
            <li> These are not great products at all..</li>
            <li> , i didn&#x27;t think anything of it until it just got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> My scalp was red and bloody with bumps everywhere, and a lot of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I was just shocked to find this high end hair product work like crap...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not terribly impressed with the Fekkai Glosing Starter Kit.</li>
            <li> The downside to this product is that it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> For the rest of us it may be too expensive despite how well it works.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not have the results promoted with the product.</li>
            <li> to expensive for &amp;#34;no</li>
            <li> Me and my three girls all have curly, difficult to manage hair.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> I tried 3 other brands but hated the way they made my papered hair feel.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked how this product tamed my thin frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li> Yes it is very expensive ..</li>
            <li> Very expensive product line,</li>
            <li> They might not notice, but if you get the one TSA person having a bad day, they might make you throw it away because it&#x27;s 4 oz containers, not 3.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t bad for a lotion</li>
            <li> I was not at all disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li> work... :-(</li>
            <li> this crap they are selling.</li>
            <li> 7 days and haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day yet!  </li>
            <li> Got this because i saw a youtuber recommend it, its awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not marketed for volume, this glossing shampoo and conditioner gave my fine hair really nice body. The fragrance is a very clean smelling, citrus lime/lemon.  The shine you get is incredible! I didn&#x27;t need to use shine spray afterwards and my hair felt great- soft and manageable. Very comparable results to what I get from Moroccan Oil products, but at a slightly better price point. Love the large travel size bottles.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leave your hair wonderfully soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very delicate but fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The Glossing Cream has a stronger scent that is irresistibly fresh and clean smelling. It doesn&#x27;t add as much shine as silicone serums, but it does improve shine.&lt;br /&gt;It really makes my processed hair feel so healthy and bouncy and alive.&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked. I know it is more expensive than other hair care products but I love the improved texture, appearance and that great refreshing scent that fortunately lingers in the hair so pleasantly.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> Though this is a \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; it really lasts a long time, because you don&#x27;t have to use much.  It&#x27;s quite concentrated.  Nice fresh fragrance.  Because of the size, I actually use them for travel.</li>
            <li> Summer humidity turns my hair into a Brillo pad, only not quite so cute.  I have relied on another name brand&#x27;s products for years and was satisfied with the results.  I purchased this starter size just to try out Fekkai products after hearing so many people rave about them, esp the Glossing cream.  The shampoo was okay, but I immediately loved the Glossing conditioner and the Glossing cream was terrific. Having short-medium length hair, I can probably use the Glossing cream for a long time as it only takes a tiny amount. The next time I had my hair professionally colored I tried the [[ASIN:B000PI101K Frederic Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo (8 oz)]] instead of the Glossing Shampoo while still combining it with the Glossing Conditioner and Glossing Cream.  Wonderful results!  Healthy, shiny, manageable, no frizz or fly-aways. I can&#x27;t believe I finally truly tamed the Brillo pad!  Granted it is more expensive than my previous products, but what a difference it has made!</li>
            <li> The shampoo did a good job of leaving my hair clean and shiny, but the conditioner and glosser made it feel strange and crackly. I tried it several times with varying amounts of product, but was left unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> excellent product. makes your hair soft and shinny. i would recommend this product to everyone. the condition is not heavy or greasey . whewn you put it on it feels like its not working, but is works great.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am a guy in my early 40&#x27;s. I have used different brands of hair products (both cheap and expensive) for so many years and have not found one that suits my hair until now. The fekkai shampoo and ocnditioner are the perfect combination for a shiny/glossy hair. The glossing creme works like a Gel - ultra light and there is absolutely zero residue, unlike all the other gel products. This leaves my hair shiny all day. I have never been so happy with any hair products until I started using Fekkai. I just ordered the regular sizes (8 ounces). I have short hair and it is kinda try and hard. Fekkai products keep my hair very soft and manageable. I highly recommend this product although a bit expensive but it&#x27;s worth it... if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> Seems like I&#x27;m in the minority among the reviewers...I found these products to be acceptable, but nothing special, and ended up purposely leaving them in a hotel after using them for several days.  The scent reminded me of Prell shampoo from the old days (do they still make that?) and seemed sort of \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; based vs herbal based.  The shampoo, like all shampoos, did a good job of cleaning my hair, and the conditioner was a good consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, decent products, but nothing special in my book...</li>
            <li> I did think that this kit gave my just above the shoulders length brown hair a nice feel and shine...mission accomplished.  But, my hair did lack body after using the products.  Let me state that I did not have amazing body to begin with so I really couldn&#x27;t afford to lose any.  I was very pleased with the whole experience of using the products as the smell left me feeling like I was in a nice spa.  So, with that in mind it would be a nice kit for those with thick, unruly hair that could use a bit of taming.</li>
            <li> Fekkai hair products are my favorite but I can rarely afford them.  I do have these products and find that they lather, clean, and condition beautifully but they don&#x27;t make my hair noticeably shinier than other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to notice that these are travel sizes, probably about 4 oz. per bottle.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife, she absolutely loves it.  She states that this is professional grade name makes her hair incredibly manageable.  She mentioned that her hair had previously become damaged from some prior products, and that the Fekkai items helped repair her hair.  She will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever been curious about Fekkai hair care products, this particular glossing starter kit is a more than adequate way to give these high-end hair products a try.  This 3 piece set is meant to bring a glossed, shiny look to your hair and comes with a pleasant smelling shampoo, conditioner and a tube of styling cream.  Note that the shampoo/conditioner come in 4 ounce bottles while the cream is 2 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my medium-length male hair with a tendency to look dry during the winter I was eager to give these products and was particularly pleased with the results.  The finishing cream in particular really enhances the look throughout the day.  I also appreciated the travel-bag that these products come encased in - have already used it on several weekend trips.</li>
            <li> Four stars each for shampoo and glossing cream.  The conditioner is quite average at three stars.  The shampoo and conditioner are good products; they rinse cleanly and don&#x27;t leave an odd residue on your skin, as some&lt;br /&gt;moisture-heavy hair products do.  The glossing cream is nice; it leaves your hair soft and bouncy, but it&#x27;s really easy to overdose if you have fine hair.  With only a tiny bit used at a time, the glossing cream might last about half-year.  Didn&#x27;t get any added bonus for my hair by using all three products together.  The products work well separately.</li>
            <li> I love these products.  Wish I could afford the full sizes, but I&#x27;m being careful with the starter sizes so they&#x27;ll last.  Very light feel and scent.  Great, high-gloss results.  I know from my dad, who was a long-time barber/hairstylist, that most commercial hair products are like \\&quot;using dish detergent on your hair\\&quot;!  Yuck!!  Not so with these.  You can see, smell, feel the difference!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair which fortunately is very manageable and forgiving. I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s so I&#x27;ve tested many shampoos over the years...and I purchase products based on reviews - not on price. So in other words, I&#x27;ve spent my fair share on great-quality products. I can honestly say that over all the years and all the shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried...this one is the only one that makes my hair fall out ...by the handful! I thought perhaps it was due to hormonal changes (menopause....) but I&#x27;ve tried it before, during and after....and my hair still falls out - every time. I&#x27;ve never read any reviews similar to this so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably a great product....just not for me. So, given that...if you are considering switching to these products - I highly recommend going with the sample size to start - just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make YOUR hair fall out too!</li>
            <li> Except it is rather pricey.  Wish they would have a  big sale sometime !!</li>
            <li> Just another poo that is loaded with sulfates. In case you dont know what that is. They are toxins...chemicals.  Mostly used as floor cleaners and truck engine cleaners. It just stumps me on how people will rush out to buy designer poos and not check the ingredients list. So for all of you that enjoy poisoning your brains with toxic chemicals, continue to use shampoo with sulfates. Good luck.  As for me, Ill use all organic plant based poos for alot less money, and much healthier.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner my hair has had in a loooong time!  I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and my hair is starting to show it.  I have long hair that gets the frizzies more often than not and is starting to show some \\&quot;grays\\&quot; as well.  I guess I&#x27;m a little hard on my hair - I wash and condition it every day, blow dry and then on most days I also use a ceramic curling iron on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all sorts of shampoos and conditioners to calm the frizzies.  Everything from Pantene, Biolage, Suave, and several different brands I got from the beauty salon and beauty supply places.  Nothing worked as good as this does.  From the first week I could tell there was a difference and my family also commented that they noticed the difference.  It is much more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the light herbal scent. very nice and not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glossing cream is nice, but believe me, a little bit goes a long way!  I put too much on the first time and my hair felt ick - oily-like or too much product on it.  So I only use that every once in a while.  I know other reviewers have commented that they love that the most out of this kit, but then we all probably have different hair and live in different climates.  Oh, did I mention that I also live in they climate around Phoenix Arizona?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now and have to decide if I go back to what I was using or fork out $20+ a bottle for a fullsize shampoo and another $20+ for the conditioner.  I found this product, believe it or not, on the shelf at Walmart but the price there is no different than you can buy right here through Amazon.  Come on, does it really cost $20+ to produce one bottle of this stuff?  Time will tell if I can&#x27;t live without this now that I&#x27;ve tried it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have unmanageable hair, I suggest trying out the starter kit.</li>
            <li> My hair is lately dull and dry thanks to over-processing, so when I saw the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit, I thought I found the answer to shiny, healthy looking hair. Instead of giving my hair a healthy glow, I ended up with frizzier hair. I used all three products exactly as directed over a period of 2 weeks - which is about as long as the product lasted. Still, I did not see any improvement to my hair as far as a \\&quot;shiny, healthy\\&quot; look.  I did love the citrus (lemon/lime) smell but that was about all I enjoyed about the product.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t get these if you want them to get through TSA at the airport - they&#x27;re too big! They might not notice, but if you get the one TSA person having a bad day, they might make you throw it away because it&#x27;s 4 oz containers, not 3. They seem too big for airline travel and too small for regular use, even though it&#x27;s a starter kit. I would expect to get more product for almost thirty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is probably better for drier/frizzier hair, which mine is not! The smell is nice, though, and not too overpowering like many shampoos can be.</li>
            <li> I love this line of shampoo and conditioner.  My mother has been using the cream for years and I finally decided to try out the product line.  I was not at all disappointed with the results.  When I shampoo and condition with these products my hair is softer and shinier when straight and softer and slightly more manageable when curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the one thing I am not a fan of is the glossing cream.  It works wonders for taming and creating shine but is very strongly scented.  If I put it on in the morning I can smell it well into the afternoon and it can aggravate my migraines.  I can only use it on days when I plan on wearing my hair pulled back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;ll start using the full sized shampoo and conditioner but skip the cream until they make a new version with less or no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Time has made me a skeptic of all hair products. My thick mane of hair, always looks like nothing much until it&#x27;s blown dry or the hair stylist attempts pulling a brush through it. Then the exclamations begin. Oh what great hair you have. Yeah, if you like doing your hair every day, as in blowdrying it, glossing it with tons of hair products and generally spending beacoups of time making it look ala naturally nonplussed and pretty without setting off a sensitive scalp that is constantly dry and ends that split and break all the time because of the constant, necessary brushing. So when I saw this product advertised, and the amount of reviews praising its wonderfulness, I couldn&#x27;t resist.    As a disclaimer, I do warn that this product&#x27;s a bit pricier than your average products, but I&#x27;ve long since learned that for good hair, you have to pay the price. Any way, if the less costlier products work for you than I suggest you not bother. The Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit is definitely not that spectacular.    However, if you are like me and already require more expensive products to get the job done than you might find these unexpectedly helpful. I did and so did a friend who has fine, blonde and very dry hair. We both recognized right away the lack of suds and gleefully liked it. Not a lot of wax or soap fuss which means less deposit buildup on our scalps. Also, just a tiny bit went a very long way. When it says pea-sized bit, that&#x27;s really all you need! And here&#x27;s my only complaint, if you do accidentally get too much, your hair might feel oily even after blowdrying it out.     Did I mention how nice it smells! Lovely refreshing scent that&#x27;s not overbearing. More like a relaxation oil for the scalp. Also, my sensitive scalp and skin didn&#x27;t break out at all with this shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to people who are sensitive to detergents, shampoo, etc... or who overwork their hair on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I try Fekkai&#x27;s glossing products. I have used Fekkai&#x27;s Protein Rx and was amazed by how soft was hair felt. I was hoping to get the same results with the glossing products. However, I did &#x27;t notice anything special. I am so glad I purchased the starter kit instead of the larger size bottles. I am not sure if the fact that Amazon is not selling the latest version, Brilliant Glossing, made a difference.</li>
            <li> Fekkai leaves my hair soft, for sure--but I notice that it weighs down my curls and transforms them into waves by day&#x27;s end. I have used the glossing cream successfully on my already-DRY hair; that seems to just leave it nice and shiny. But curly girls might find that these products relax their curls too much.</li>
            <li> This review is based on my wife&#x27;s experience. She has medium body, long, black hair. The product does what it is supposed to do. She had no complaints. She has tried other similar products in the past, and does not consider it superior to other products tried, but it is not inferior either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds shine and manageability which is always appreciated.</li>
            <li> My wife has long, thick dark hair and used this set of Fekkai products with great results.  Her hair was noticeably glossier with fewer errant fly away hairs.  Without having read the ingredients, she guessed at the olive oil component, not because her hair was greasy but because it seemed so much healthier.  It didn&#x27;t cause her any difficulties with complexion or anything like that.  All in all, a great product for women with long, straight, thick hair who want to increase shine and manageability without feeling like they have loads of goop on their hair.</li>
            <li> I saw this on TV and wanted to try it out.  Kind of expensive for the small sizes.  Used it only once so far.  Keeping it for travel.</li>
            <li> My hair is a combination hair, being that it&#x27;s colored (most of the time), long, wavy, dry at the ends, etc.  I have NEVER found any hair care system as good as this!!!  The smell is absolutely AMAZING and it leaves my hair SO soft without any residue.  I love the glossing cream, too; it smooths the split ends, softens the ends of my hair, and makes it so shiny.  ABSOLUTE PERFECTION IN A BOTTLE!!</li>
            <li> I have long blond , highlighted hair, which is in great condition and well taken care off. I decided to give the great reviews a try and have to say the smell of this shampoo and conditior is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was very soft (my hair is long , straight and thick) and bouncy the first day, or should I say first half of the day, I used the shampoo, conditioner and the glossing creme, and in the later afternoon my hair started getting frizzy, given I do live in the south, but when i compare it with my regular l;oreal moisturizer conditioner and the leave in spray conditioner I get much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it out again, and as the days continoued, I was my hair about every 3 days, the condition got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this product so much so I went to my local ulta store and tried the color technician version, and I do have to say the shampoo I believe it was left the highlights, which are in need to be redone in great condition and color, but same thing, my hair got very frizzy as the day went on, next 2 days same issue? i smoothened it out with the glossy cream but it did not last to long. With the glossy line I also did not see an overwhelming \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; or shine added to my hair, considering the hefty price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do have to say that the shampoo lathered up really good, like I said especially the smell of the glossy line, makes it very tempting to purchase it. But i need something to protect my highlights from fading and changing colors, so I might consider re purchasing the shampoo only and using my usual L;oreal Conditioner with it. I will then update accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe, that if your hair is in bad condition, this line will probably help you with the overall condition of the hair, it might also work better if you do not live in the south with high humidity. Again also just stating what worked for me , as everyones hairtype is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the sample kit might definitely be worth a try.For now I am sticking with the L;oreal Color Care Line.</li>
            <li> My sister raved about the Fekkai products so one day while purchasing some travel size items at my local Walgreens, I saw this travel kit.  For $26 I thought I would give it a try.  My hair is curly and highlighted, and I blow it out every day.  I followed the directions exactly and was extremely impressed with the results  -- my hair is soft and shiny with no frizz. It keeps my color looking great as well. I just recently purchased larger sizes of each product and will definately continue using it.</li>
            <li> This hair product is great!  My hair is much easier to manage, and it stays in place longer than with other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for the past 8 years or so and loved it but my hair was needing a change. I tried 3 other brands but hated the way they made my papered hair feel. I decided to stop trying full sizes of new products, so I ordered this starter set. I love the Glossing Set! The formula is slightly scented and the Glossing Cream works really well. I love to put it on my wet or dry hair. I did start ordering the full sizes of this particular set.</li>
            <li> These are not great products at all.. I bought the full size bottle at Nordstroms paid over $80 for a size that could last maybe 1 1/2 months.. The shampoo and conditioner made my hair dry and brittle not to mention super frizzy.. the leave in treatment left my hair oily and I only put a small dime size amount... I was just shocked to find this high end hair product work like crap... dont buy... I use Matrix sleek look.. along with neutrogena once a week cleansing shampoo treatment and they are amazing. my hair is silky without the dull oily look... paying more is not always hte best case.. I spend $30 for (2) huge 30oz bottles of shampoo and cond.. and than only $6 for the cleansing treatment.. try them.. way better then this crap they are selling.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t do anything particular to my hair and it smelled like citrucy sweat.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit out. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t quite live up to my expectations. The shampoo is thick and somewhat sticky. The conditioner was thick as well but not sticky, however it didn&#x27;t wash out well and left my hair feeling greasy. The glossing gel, even used in a very small amount, left my hair feeling sticky and didn&#x27;t leave it looking very glossy. The smell was real nice, like a clean floral smell and not overpowering at all. If your hair is extremely dry, it may work out better for you than it did for me. Overall, if they could keep the scent and change the formula up a bit I would have loved it, but as it is I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner totally changed my hair. It was frizzy, dull, unmanageable, and just difficult to deal with all around. After using this set of products for a few weeks, my hair transformed into soft, shiny, and touchable. Even my natural waves started to form in a prettier way. I can&#x27;t rave about this stuff enough. It is TOTALLY worth the money, and you shouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this if you want soft and shiny hair!</li>
            <li> I loved this product! I received it in time and of course I&#x27;ll recommend this product for my friends!&lt;br /&gt;My hair got amazing and shining and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love the Fekkai Glossing shampoo.  Leaves my hair shinier, and the smell is great (cucumber/melon/aloe).  This kit is a great way to try all three products without sending a ton of money.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I could tell a difference in my hair after the first use.  My hair is soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li> What can you say about Fekkai products?  They also perform and semll both clean and fresh.  I would highly reocmmend.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight and fine.  Flyaways are a real problem for me, so I thought I&#x27;d give this kit a try.  To begin with, I don&#x27;t care for the scent.  If you are familiar with Vaseline&#x27;s line of body lotions, this kit smells exactly like Vaseline&#x27;s Total Moisture Conditioning body lotion.  The scent isn&#x27;t bad for a lotion but I did not like it in my hair.  Putting aside the smell, my main problem with this product is that it did not smooth away frizz and flyaways but it did leave my hair fealling rather heavy and limp, almost like it wasn&#x27;t clean.  Perhaps it works for more normal hair types but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not terribly impressed with the Fekkai Glosing Starter Kit. The shampoo, conditioner and cream do leave my hair feeling very soft and touchable. The styling cream is heavy and using too much leaves the hair looking unwashed and greasy.  But, if used sparingly, it&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;m not seeing any difference in the glossiness of my hair.  It did turn my subtle salon highlights into a shockingly bright blonde - but I don&#x27;t think that counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells nice and my hair feels nice after using it, but I can&#x27;t give it a high rating, because it just didn&#x27;t add any shine. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about having to go to the salon two weeks early to fix my highlights, but that&#x27;s the risk one takes when using shampoo that&#x27;s not specifically marked \\&quot;color safe\\&quot;. My stylist suggested that I stick with my regular shampoo and use Moroccan Oil instead.</li>
            <li> This is my first exposure to Fekkai products.  I am reviewing the \\&quot;Glossing Starter Kit\\&quot;.  This kit comes with what must be considered the complete Fekkai \\&quot;Glossing\\&quot; protocol as it contains 4oz. shampoo, 4oz. conditioner, and 2oz. glossing cr&amp;egrave;me (a leave-in last step).  There is a plastic carry tote provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fekkai products seem to be of a certain concentration whereby you do not have to use a large amount of product.  That would imply a certain higher quality, to me, as opposed to something of a \\&quot;watered-down\\&quot; nature.  The smell is a very agreeable kind of herbal, flowery, smell that I cannot imagine anyone having a conflict with as it is neither feminine nor masculine; it&#x27;s a nice and clean nature-inspired...pleasantly non-synthetic.  The shampoo gives a decent lather, not ridiculous, and it covers well as long as you use enough.  I think this shampoo cleans fair to good, it&#x27;s not astringent...just enough I imagine to get good gloss results.  The conditioner, on the other hand, is more potent.  It dissipates nicely and allows good coverage with minimal effort.  It feels rich with a nice viscosity helping it absorb.  A minute or two is all you need and rinse.  I could tell my hair would be easier to manage before exiting the shower as it had a smoother feel even if I am prone to tangles.  Finally, the last step before drying - The Fekkai \\&quot;Glossing Cr&amp;egrave;me\\&quot;.  I must say that if any one product was the \\&quot;killer app\\&quot; this is it.  This is the factor that separates this system.  It makes the hair so silky that I recommend judicious use...A little goes a long way.  The name says it all as it truly makes even my brittle hair shine and feel much smoother.  It does have a down-side if you have thin hair as it certainly removes a bit of body by the glossing and smoothing effect it gives.  It doesn&#x27;t, in my opinion, make hair look oily and the term \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; is entirely truth in advertising here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to explore the Fekkai Glossing System this kit is a nice way to do so.  You will, perhaps, want to buy full-size versions of the products.  You can keep the full-size products at home and save this nicely compact bagged trio for your travel use as it really gives you everything you could ask for in a highly portable perfect sized package.  While all products offer exceptional quality, as they should for the price which is on the upper-end - the \\&quot;Glossing Cr&amp;egrave;me\\&quot; is the must have.  Once you&#x27;ve tried the cr&amp;egrave;me you will likely be upset when you run out unless you have planned ahead and reordered - it&#x27;s that good.  Recommended, in spite of being expensive (on the up-side, the products are nicely concentrated), especially the \\&quot;Glossing Cr&amp;egrave;me\\&quot;.e way to do so.

            <li> I had originally rated this as a 4 star package after using it for a few days.  I felt that it didn&#x27;t deliver on the \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; promise.  But . . . after a week of use I changed my mind.  Soft clean hair with an observable shine.  Holds its style throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is a high quality product with a rich lather and a pleasing fragrance, herbal remotely \\&quot;apple-like\\&quot;.  Ditto for the conditioner, which seems to have a volumizing effect.  The styling cream seems to be inadequate in the \\&quot;pea-size\\&quot; dose prescribed, however, increasing the dose to \\&quot;2 or 3 peas\\&quot; delivered the desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A high quality hair care product.  Pricey, but a reasonable luxury indulgence for some.</li>
            <li> The Fekkai Glossing starter kit contains shampoo, conditioner and creme. The shampoo and conditioner are both excellent, and the glossing creme does a very nice job of making hair feel silky and shiny without leaving an overload of product. Have used this several times and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the products. My hair is thick, fine and color-treated and it is gentle on the hair and yet delivers control and shine. I&#x27;m not surprised--Fekkai has an excellent product line for hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost embarrassed to say I like the product since I usually just stick with cheap shampoos and usually won&#x27;t use any conditioner.  My hair felt.. separate?  and not so ..clumpy?  There did seem to be more shine.  I gave the rest to my wife who loved it.</li>
            <li> I found the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit to overall be a good product.  The shampoo is nice, with a pleasant scent, and it got my hair pretty clean.  The conditioner does a good job of conditioning my hair without adding too much buildup - a major plus.  The shining creme is nice and seemed to help control flyaways.  However I never got my hair to a really glossy shine, but that may be just due to the texture of my hair and not to a problem with the product.  However, as this is the many basis of the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit - to get a glossy shine - I obviously felt that product failed at it&#x27;s mission.  Again, nothing can be all things to all people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All over, this was a nice product.  The main drawback was the price.  Although you get three separate, although somewhat small, products in the box, $25 seems like an awfully high price for hair cair products for the average consumer.  Since I do not at this time buy highend haircare products, I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it with, but I would definitely not be buying it for myself at this price.  So although I liked the products individually, I did not feel that they were appreciably better than your average brands and definitely not worth 3X the cost of the average brands.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, coarse, and dark colored hair. I washed my hair daily and used all three of the products. The collection lasted a few days longer than 5 1/2 weeks.  The products had a nice scent and good texture.  It did not fade the color on my hair.  After the first 3 days I could tell that my hair was less frizzy, but there was also buildup. I had to use a clarifying shampoo about once a week. Overall, my hair felt slightly brittle if I didn&#x27;t use a clarifying shampoo. So if you have coarse hair I recommend doing this as well. I would buy this product, but as I said, I do recommend using a clarifing shampoo at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you really DO get what you pay for - and this is one slam-bang, top of the line hair system.  I have found that using the products over the past few weeks has REALLY improved the texture and most importantly the shine of the hair.  I noticed a change the first time I used the products, and after using it multiple times I can assure you that the results are continuing,and build upon each use.    I am lucky to have reasonably good hair, but it can look a bit frizzy , particularly in humid conditions. The Fekkai system solves this problem!  When working on a soundstage, hair can be exposed to many elements, not the least of which are hot lights, which tend to dry out hair, along with the use of flat irons blow dryers and more. The same is true at home ( minus the hot lights, I HOPE).      The shampoo and conditioner have a light fresh scent that most anyone would like, male or female. Unlike some,I did not find it overpowering- really fresh and clean.    The workhorse of the system has to be the Glossing Cream,and a VERY little bit will go a VERY long way- with or without a flat iron, this really amp&#x27;s up the shine- for most guy&#x27;s even half the suggested amount (a pea size) will do the trick. Of course if you have longer hair use the suggested amount.      Much has been made over the cost of the products.  This is light years away from what you might find in a drugstore or supermarket,and probably better than most mass-market salon brands.  It seems to replicate getting a clear &#x27;glaze&#x27; at a salon which would easily be triple the price. ( And does not last, I might add!)    For guys with thin or fine hair, it is really essential, and well worth the price. You WILL notice improvement, right out of the bottle. I also found you tend to use LESS of this product than traditional brands, it is super concentrated.      To me, the results justify the price - great results are priceless.  In this economy, many are looking for job&#x27;s and 1st impressions can really be critical.  Great hair starts with a great haircut, but upkeep is key - and the dramatic results with the Fekkai system give you a best-in-class feeling that might just give you an edge!    I can&#x27;t think of a nicer gift for most anyone.  Easily one of the best hair products I have ever used.  A keeper!</li>
            <li> This waa nice product but I can&#x27;t say it was  anything too different than what is already out there. It has a nice fragrance, is light and feels nice. My short hair had a silky feel to it after using.  Kind of pricey for my wallet. Overall a nice product</li>
            <li> Got this because i saw a youtuber recommend it, its awful. I wanted to treat myself and get a higher up shampoo, but never again. As soon as i started using it i noticed my head began to itch, i didn&#x27;t think anything of it until it just got worse and worse. I&#x27;d wake up every night at 3 and itch it for about an hour. About a week goes by and i start thinking i might have lice or something, so i have multiple people check and no lice. My scalp was red and bloody with bumps everywhere, and a lot of dandruff. I had some kind of reaction to the shampoo. I know everyones scalp/hair is different but this isn&#x27;t something anyone should go through, so just thought i&#x27;d share my review.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine blond hair so it&#x27;s a struggle to find something that brings shine that doesn&#x27;t also make my hair greasy or lank. I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I frequently travel between a place where the environment is much dryer/water harder and where I live where the water is softer and there&#x27;s more moisture in the air. I&#x27;ve noticed that this set works better for me when I&#x27;m in the drier place with the harder water. It leaves less of a residue and my hair feels light, not bogged down. I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying a smaller starter kit to try out the products before investing in full size bottles that may or may not meet one&#x27;s needs. Shampoo and conditioner is a rather personal decision, but I&#x27;d definitely give this product a second look.</li>
            <li> The Fekkai glossing starter kit is a bit pricey but it lives up to its promise of providing gentle cleansing along shiny hair.  I have wavy hair and found that the shampoo and conditioner left my hair looking great without any oily residue.  The fragrance is a pleasant citrus like aroma that lasts throughout the day.  The downside to this product is that it is expensive.  To add insult to injury you only get about 4 oz worth of product for the $20 plus dollars you spend!  To be fair, this does include shampoo, conditioner, and a shining cream.  Also worth noting is that it seems like you need less of the Fekkai shampoo to get your hair clean, though this may be a subconscious attempt at trying to use less of this stuff because it so expensive.  Overall if money is no object than the Fekkai glossing starter kit is a great product.  For the rest of us it may be too expensive despite how well it works.    *** Plus Points: ***    - Works as advertised by leaving hair clean and shiny  - Light fragrance that does not overpower but lasts for some time  - Gentle cleaning that won&#x27;t leave your tub with lots of fallen hair    *** Negative Points: ***    - Expensive  - Small quantity despite the high price</li>
            <li> You know how we all search for the product that will really make our hair soft and shiny?  Well search no further.  This is it. I tend to have a lot of frizz and this cuts down on that too.  It really is a miracle cure for my dry stiff hair.  Thank you Mr. Fekkai!</li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely buy the larger bottles next time.  Wanted to try before investing in large bottles.  Makes hair feel soft and full of body.  Doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a long time, great size bottles for travel.  They lasted me over a month.  The hair gloss will last for 6 mths or more, doesn&#x27;t take much at all, dime size or smaller.</li>
            <li> i bought the leave in cream at a local beauty store, and because of the name&lt;br /&gt;i was so excited and anticipated a brilliant outcome...not so...applied it to&lt;br /&gt;my clean dry hair, and the overwhelming result was my hair looking very greasy,&lt;br /&gt;like i haven&#x27;t washed it in 7 days...some shine, yes, but the hugest result was a&lt;br /&gt;slick greasy mess.  i ordered the gloss conditioner earlier today for $25,&lt;br /&gt;wonder how that&#x27;s going&lt;br /&gt;to work... :-(</li>
            <li> Fekkai is great!! I actually started buying the shampoo/conditioner/glossing cream at Costco. Then they stopped selling it for a while, which is why I turned to Amazon. As with anything at Costco, you get a better value because you are buying in bulk. Check to see if Costco is selling this first, then turn to Amazon. This shampoo/conditioner smells wonderful and the glossing cream is so great for your hair. I have really long hair, so i rub a quarter size in my palms then apply to the ends first and work my way up the shaft of my hair. This starter set is nice because it gives you really good tips on how to wash and condition your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the subscribe and save method, so it sends me a new set every 1-3 months. I bought a set for my mother-in-law and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that is kind of wavy and frizzy.  My hair also gets oily very quickly.  I have been searching my whole life for a shampoo/conditioner that would help manage the frizziness without making my hair oily and greasy.  Seriously, my whole life!  And this is the first shampoo/conditioner that gives me the exact results I&#x27;ve always wished and hoped for!  My hair feels soft and silky after using it.  No frizziness, and even the thickness is more manageable.  It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to find this product, I want to tell everyone about it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner came brand new in a box. It is exactly as described.  Shipped quick and love this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this out. The word \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; implies glossy hair. Unfortunately I did not have the results promoted with the product. It was adequate for washing and cleaning hair, but did not live up to its description of \\&quot;glossing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It works alright.. not my favorite Fekkai shampoo, doesn&#x27;t really lather up well but I just wanted to text it out. I prefer the moisturizing one or the protein rx reparative!</li>
            <li> I received a sample in the mail and I was shocked how this product tamed my thin frizzy hair!  Not only did it tame my hair but it was light and had a lot of volume.  Love, Love this Product!</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything.  Based on the other positive reviews I can only assume that it works best on certain hair types.</li>
            <li> Hair didnt feel clean after using. to expensive for &amp;#34;no visible results&amp;#34;.did not like the smell. that is all I have to say</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair soft and the glossing cream makes your hair shine! I am excited to get more for the holidays!</li>
            <li> Me and my three girls all have curly, difficult to manage hair.  I remembered a friend telling me about Fredrick fekkai salon gloss, so I thought I would give this a try.  Well worth the cost!!  I used the shampoo and conditioner. My girls and I used the glossing.  All of the products go a long way because it only takes a very tiny bit.  Especially the glossing, A LITTLE BIT GOES A VERY LONG WAY.  Every time I use it (only need to use every other day), I get many compliments on how shiny my hair is.  You&#x27;ve gotta try this product!!</li>
            <li> no different than suave - or any other drug store generic brand. save your money. dont fall for the hype.</li>
            <li> did not like product for my hair but no problems with seller and did not return. weighed my hair down and did not perform the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Good gift, excellent product.l</li>
            <li> I usually do not take the time to write reviews especially if I havent purchased the item from Amazon but I felt really strongly about this product.  I got a sample of the shampoo and conditioner from CVS, tried it and loved it.  I have bleached hair, very dry and brittle, ends break off very easily and it had stopped growing so it seemed.  Also I came off a really rough time with stress and lost a ton of weight, kind of malnourished myself.  Combine that with hormonal issues and my hair has thinned quite a bit.  I tried lots of high end salon brands but nothing comes close to this.  It made my hair thicker, smoother and so manageable!  I thought ok, first time use is blowing me away but I bet if I keep using it I will go back to the way it was .. limp and thin and dull!  Nope .. I bought the small bottles of this at cvs at 9.99 a pop and I use very very little and WOW ... 7 days and haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day yet!  The smell is nice too, it lasts.  And I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily just to get a nice style.  I highly recommend this for my hair type ladies out there.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  Yes it is very expensive .. but to me, worth every penny.  Watch for sales and discounts!!  I will be buying the next size up next time I buy.  A little goes a long way.  I have not tried the glossing cream yet, but I can&#x27;t imagine it getting any better.</li>
            <li> Very expensive product line, but I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of results. I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
