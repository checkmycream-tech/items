            <li> I had never seen Nivea Smooth Soufflé, but had used Nivea Smooth and loved it. I would highly recommend this product. Fresh, delicate scent, moisturizes thoroughly, texture is light and absorbs well. It&#x27;s like a spa cream without the price tag.</li>
            <li> Love the texture, smell and coverage.</li>
            <li> It literally makes your skin feel like silk. The only thing i would change about it is the smell. It doesnt smell bad but it has that smell that all Nivea lotions have. Kind of reminds me of an old lady but its not a strong smell at all. Still worth getting just for the silk and shine of your skin!</li>
            <li> love the smoothness of it and the creaminess of it. wish the scent was a little less strong</li>

            <li> Absorbs quickly and helps keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. Thick but not too thick.</li>
            <li> Only if you have a sexy-oriental wife who uses it when she massages you. . and... do ... notnotnotnotnotnotnotNOT+++***!!! buy the jar that&#x27;s Hecho in MEXICO... . ONLY the one that is made in Germany...or...  . You&#x27;ll be soooorrrry...If your store doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;Made in Germany&amp;#34;... go elsewhere to buy it...</li>
            <li> Nice texture but did not care for the scent.</li>
            <li> I usually like Nivea products; however, the scent of this is so powerful, it sent my two cats upstairs.  I smell like a perfume factory.  I find it offensive, it&#x27;s that strong.</li>
            <li> Best body cream ever!!  Great price/value</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Love Nivea products. One of the BEST body miosturizers I have! Oh.. smells great also.</li>

            <li> I used it as hand cream and it is very good. It helps with my dry skin hand a lot over the winter. It is not too greasy and gives the moisture my skin need. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream with a nice, light scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> good stuff makes your skin very smooth</li>
