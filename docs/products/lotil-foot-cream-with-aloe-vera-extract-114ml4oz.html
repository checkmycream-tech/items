    <ol>
            <li>and it is the best i have ever come across</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe this cream is good for burning feet.</li>
            <li>excellent product and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>A friend of mine bought this lotion for me as a bday present and it has been wonderful</li>
            <li>As superb as regular Lotil Cream, but with a scent.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Love this foot cream.</li>
            <li>Glad to have this to help  my feet.</li>
            <li>Best product to heal dry calloused feet!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THE BEST product we&#x27;ve ever used, and we&#x27;ve tried all of them from &#x27;butt paste&#x27; to &#x27;udder&#x27; something or other - and all the things in between.</li>
            <li>Easily works as well as the hand cream, which I have used for years to heal cracks in my fingers during the winter.</li>
            <li>When it came to Mother&#x27;s Day this year it was one of the first things to pop in my head, I was so glad it had made its way to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great for dry calloused feet.</li>
            <li>This cream absorbs quickly into the skin, is non greasy &amp; light in texture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy and is absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>and although it states it&#x27;s made in England by Fenton, I wonder how true that is?</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad.  </li>
            <li>Aloe Vera does great things at different times for skin but has not done much as a softening agent for my feet.  </li>
            <li>keep my sole and foot moist and soft, able to tolerate the smell at night , nice smell, not too strong</li>
            <li>This is amazing - my heels are smooth and no longer dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li>It works very very well.</li>
            <li>After the first year, he never had another split.</li>
            <li>The one I have (original) was creamy, soft and I would use it on my hands and it would leave my hands very soft and supple!</li>
            <li>It really dries fast when you put it on, if you don&#x27;t put cotton socks on</li>
            <li>Great product for feet and other areas of dry skin, heals almost overnight!</li>
            <li>I chose to give this a rating of one star because it doesn&#x27;t live up to their words!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>A doctor advised him to try this - we used to get it elswehere for more money and not free shipping - after using this for a season, his splits healed.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick texture without being greasy.</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li>prevent because there&#x27;s so much hand washing going on, especially in colds and flu weather.</li>
            <li>It lasts the day &amp; barely has a detectable scent!</li>
            <li>My hands are in water all day and there has been nothing on the market since around the mid 1990&#x27;s that I have found that worked once the old stuff was not made anymore.  </li>

            <li> After a couple of days, my heals were soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It is not particularly a fragrant odor, but that is not its purpose!</li>
            <li> This one left my hand very dry, it might be because they say its for your &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34;???</li>
            <li> I use it all year long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very long</li>
            <li> Heaven for my dry feet.</li>
            <li> I used it every night, now my feet are just dry in the winter, so using this I thought with the aloe would help.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be helping my dry skin, which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the very dry skin on my heals, and it does an excellent&lt;br /&gt;job of rehydrating the skin.  </li>
            <li> He also uses it on his hands and it works just as well for that - although the splits on the hand are harder to heal/</li>
            <li> It is heavy duty enough to stop my hands from bleeding and cracking, not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually do not purchase from here, this one arrived broken and dried out but the seller returned the money.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I have bean using it at least once a day</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been trying foot creams to help with an area on my heal.  I found out about Lotil grim a country catalog and decided to try it. I have bean using it at least once a day and it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine bought this lotion for me as a bday present and it has been wonderful, she had to go through a lot of hoops to get it for me. When it came to Mother&#x27;s Day this year it was one of the first things to pop in my head, I was so glad it had made its way to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great for dry calloused feet.</li>
            <li> Will NEVER be without this product for the winter time....life-saver!</li>
            <li> excellent product and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> used it for yrs and it is the best i have ever come across</li>
            <li> As superb as regular Lotil Cream, but with a scent.</li>
            <li> This cream absorbs quickly into the skin, is non greasy &amp; light in texture.  Aloe Vera does great things at different times for skin but has not done much as a softening agent for my feet.  Maybe this cream is good for burning feet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. My heels of both feet start to crack every year as soon as the cold weather sets in. I sometimes have cracks in my skin so bad that they bleed. This is the only cream that works. I use it all year long.</li>
            <li> Does wonders on my feet.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Will be purchasing more. Heaven for my dry feet.</li>
            <li> Great product for feet and other areas of dry skin, heals almost overnight! Nice and thick texture without being greasy.</li>

It really dries fast when you put it on, if you don&#x27;t put cotton socks on it&#x27;s really a waste of time and money! I had the regular LOTIL from years back and although it states it&#x27;s made in England by Fenton, I wonder how true that is?

This one left my hand very dry, it might be because they say its for your &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34;???</li>
            <li> I usually do not purchase from here, this one arrived broken and dried out but the seller returned the money.  My hands are in water all day and there has been nothing on the market since around the mid 1990&#x27;s that I have found that worked once the old stuff was not made anymore.  I thought why not try it on my hands which will bleed by the end of the day and I cannot wear gloves.  It is heavy duty enough to stop my hands from bleeding and cracking, not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> keep my sole and foot moist and soft, able to tolerate the smell at night , nice smell, not too strong</li>
            <li> Love this foot cream.</li>

            <li> Best product to heal dry calloused feet!</li>
            <li> This is amazing - my heels are smooth and no longer dry and cracked.  I use it every night and every morning in the summer; every night in the winter.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad.  I use it at nights &amp; wear socks to sleep in and this lotion is softening my feet.</li>
            <li> My husband suffered from &#x27;splits&#x27; on his heels, REALLY badly for literally years. A doctor advised him to try this - we used to get it elswehere for more money and not free shipping - after using this for a season, his splits healed. COMPLETELY. After the first year, he never had another split. He also uses it on his hands and it works just as well for that - although the splits on the hand are harder to heal/prevent because there&#x27;s so much hand washing going on, especially in colds and flu weather. I saw that one person didn&#x27;t like this product - I cannot imagine what their problem was that this didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s THE BEST product we&#x27;ve ever used, and we&#x27;ve tried all of them from &#x27;butt paste&#x27; to &#x27;udder&#x27; something or other - and all the things in between.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream. It works very very well. It lasts the day &amp; barely has a detectable scent!</li>
