    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am obsessed with all of the Good On Ya products.  They are wonderful.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Great for my sensitive skin. I use it on my feet and hands as well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it was nor for me. This is not a a gentle microdermabrasion scrub. This is a bead exfoliant yes,  but with acid. Yes very apparent. The first time, my skin looked great. But after using it twice a week as suggested. My skin started to look dehydrated in the morning. Even after I put on moisturizer. It still looked tired. And I was starting to break out. No thank you!! I have found better products that work better for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the price at amazon is almost half off from their website.</li>
            <li> I bought the cleanser and this facial scrub. After reading reviews I was wanting to try this. Both items were too watery I thought. Don&#x27;t know if others felt this way or if it was only my bottles.</li>
            <li> For the short time I have been using these products, I am impressed with great result and better skin.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! Super gentle and beyond natural. This company really has their products down perfectly.</li>
            <li> No real noticeable difference in skin condition. May work well for others but not the skin care regimen for me.</li>
            <li> Love it, part of the overall healthy skin routine</li>
            <li> I use around a dozen products a week (I have rosacea, acne, im very pale, senstivie skin).  Its a very non drying exfoliator.  Some of my other exfoliators dry my skin out or I can only use once a week, etc, but this is VERY sensitive, yet works.  The beads don&#x27;t dissolve  very fast (some other brands do dissolve fast once u rub it around) , but it doesn&#x27;t make my face dry at all.  I like to use this after my normal face wash (cetaphil) every few days.  This bottle will last a very long time since I only have to use a pea size amount for my face.  I use lots of products, lots of MAC, but I do like this.  Its not a miracle product, but it works, removes dead skin with no irriation and will last a long time and the ingredients aren&#x27;t cheap feeling so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel stripped like drug store products do.</li>
            <li> Works well. Arrived on time. As advertised.</li>
            <li> It came fast and works great! It really helps my skin which has multiple problems. They even send you samples of their other products which I really want now, but have to wait until next paycheck. :( I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This products they work magic.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. I also got an awesome deal on it was well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years now.  It&#x27;s the best of its kind I have found.</li>
            <li> A great price for a good product.  After two uses, I see a difference in skin texture and look.</li>
            <li> This ia my 3rd time buying this product , i really love it and it helps with my acne and blemish. Great product!!!</li>
