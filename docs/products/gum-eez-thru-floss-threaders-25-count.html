            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for flossing bridges</li>
            <li>This little gadget is the best, most economical way to clean under bridges that are not removable.  </li>
            <li>My dentist and staff &amp;#34;forgot&amp;#34; to tell me how important it is to keep this area clean.</li>
            <li>These do a great job, and I love the little plastic case.</li>
            <li>Item was as expected and a great price</li>
            <li>These flossers are so much more comfortable to use than the harder, thicker plastic kind that were tearing my gums.  </li>

            <li>Some days it takes a lot of patience and a bit of twirling the loop so the free end feeds through to the other side.</li>
            <li>These split easily, by the time I am half way through flossing my teeth (under my braces)</li>
            <li>The product is flexible and strong enough to do the job with little discomfort from accidental jabs.</li>
            <li>Each little threader can be used multiple times with fresh dental floss.</li>

            <li> Item was as expected and a great price</li>
            <li> If you have braces you need this. The separate cases for each 25 count is great for travelling.</li>
            <li> These flossers are so much more comfortable to use than the harder, thicker plastic kind that were tearing my gums.  I like how they are stored in a reusable case too. I can easily carry them with me when I&#x27;m away from home. I&#x27;m very glad I tried them.</li>

            <li> Really good. I can finally get under my wire. I would not buy this unless you have braces or a wire.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Gum Eez-Thru Floss threaders and they work great! If you don&#x27;t lose them they will last quiet a while. The price of a three pack is 50% of the local price.</li>
            <li> I us these all the time for good dental care.</li>
            <li> For some reason, fewer and fewer stores carry these, yet I still need to floss behind my permanent retainer. These do a great job, and I love the little plastic case. Happy to find somewhere to buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> arrived ok. was as described.</li>
            <li> Works well for me and I&#x27;ve used them for a number of years. I will continue to use them as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because you can use you existing dental floss, you know the good floss that does not tear into pieces while flossing, and it is easy to thread between the teeth. The product came on time and it was packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li> These floss threaders are the thinnest and the longest making it easy to get under a bridge. Other brands are thicker and rub causing discomfort. Buy these!</li>
            <li> These threaders make cleaning under dental bridges easy and efficient! My dentist and staff &amp;#34;forgot&amp;#34; to tell me how important it is to keep this area clean. Fortunately I learned about threaders and how to use them through the internet and the great Amazon.com reviews of this product!</li>
            <li> Just what dentist said to get</li>
            <li> My husband and I use these all the time.</li>
            <li> Great product that is easy to use. Really effective for flossing with braces which is a trick if you&#x27;ve ever done it. Good value buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> BEST FLOSS THREADERS I HAVE EVER USED.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM</li>
            <li> Great for bridges.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love these floss threaders.  They are durable and hold up well.</li>
            <li> These are THE threaders to use if you have permanent retainers! The same feel as the ones I get from my dentist, they are easier on my gums than the pre-threaded floss kind.</li>
            <li> perfect my local store always runs out now i just order these</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is designed to do!</li>
            <li> These are the only way I can get floss under my bridge. Some days it takes a lot of patience and a bit of twirling the loop so the free end feeds through to the other side.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I really liked how easy these are to use. I would recommend these for anyone who has a bridge or an area in their mouth where it is difficult floss through.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding these are drugstores so was pleased to find them at Amazon.  I ordered a 3 pack and found them economical and exactly like the ones my dentist use to give me at the end of cleaning appointments.</li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for many years. My dentist was giving me a sample set after each cleaning but for some reason, she switched to another brand.  The other brand did not work well for me so I ended up looking for it and luckily found it in Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried the other brands but it did not work well for me. The product arrived quickly and will continue to use this brand.</li>
            <li> Best floss for retainers</li>
            <li> Using the Gum EZ threader is somewhat cumbersome because you have to tie the floss to the threader, but combine Johnson and Johnson waxed floss with these threaders and you can&#x27;t beat the flossing experience. For those with narrow gapped teeth and permanent retainers, this is the only way you can go for a great floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT get the oral-B simply threader floss or whatever their garbage is called. It takes me three of those pieces of floss to floss once because the thread constantly snaps. Spend the extra money and take the extra 10 seconds of time to tie your floss and do your gums and ultimately your health a big favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This product works. I have had braces for over one year. These are a must to floss with</li>
            <li> These work perfectly for me since I have braces they make flossing so much easier!</li>
            <li> If you have bridges, you need these!</li>
            <li> Although they are G-U-M brand they are not as durable as other identical G-U-M floss threaders I have purchased. These split easily, by the time I am half way through flossing my teeth (under my braces) the loop is enlarged and the stem is 1/3 of the size it was out of the package. Other G-U-M threaders I have been able to reuse after washing and a quick peroxide rinse. Not these.</li>
