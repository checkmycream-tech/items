            <li>beautiful shine and strenghtener in one!!!</li>
            <li>A great find!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product, everything I thought it would be!</li>
            <li>I hop CD never stops making this color, I love it!</li>
            <li>But since I knew that when I purchased it, I&#x27;ll say that the polish does look nice and it lasts well.  </li>
            <li>I rarely wear nail polish, and Dior Glow makes my nails look healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>What I love the most is it doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>I use 2 coats to give an even more glossy effect.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Found the recommendation for the product in MORE Magazine.</li>
            <li>LOVE this polish.</li>
            <li>The magic pinkening/whitening effect didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great clear nail polish!</li>
            <li>Used 2 coats, no base or top coat.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT clear polish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the product every week for 5 months, the bottle is still about 80% full !</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, sophisticated and chic.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to put on, just one coat with a very user friendly brush, and my nails suddenly look naturally beautiful.</li>
            <li>Also, and the best part in my opinion is that Dior makes a super wide brush and it covers my whole nail in on stroke.</li>
            <li>A good bet for low maintenance polish.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought that the price was rather high for nail polish, but my nails always look professionally manicured, and if you consider the money I&#x27;m saving in NOT going to a nail shop, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>I always wear clear polish and my nails seem even more well groomed after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, Love the wide brush and wonder why other companies have never done this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product because it makes my nails looks as if I have in french manicure in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s awesome since I&#x27;m typing everyday all day long!</li>
            <li>I rarely wear nail polish these days, but wanted my hands to look a little more \\&quot;put together\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It looked like diluted blood....or some version of cheap nail polish marketed to grade school girls back in the 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;DOWNSIDE - very pricy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was very timely, though.</li>
            <li>Makes your nails look really natural only better.  </li>
            <li>Nice, but a small container, very pricey.</li>
            <li>Although you won&#x27;t get a true French manicure effect, you will get a rosy glow and your nails will look whiter.</li>
            <li>I bought something like it at the drugstore for half the price from Sally Hansen and it worked better.</li>
            <li>I have to keep a classic look in my profession</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but next time I will definitely find a cheaper option.</li>
            <li>brush is wide and lush, and the polish goes on easily with one stroke to cover the entire nail bed.</li>
            <li>On me, this just looks like clear polish.</li>
            <li>It really does make your nail lock like you had a French manicure.</li>
            <li>One coat and my nails look professionally done and has laster two weeks and counting.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and application is a breeze.</li>
            <li>The color is extremely subtle and lovely.  </li>
            <li>Really pretty pink tint that looks natural.</li>
            <li>Just won&#x27;t exactly give you the white tips you would expect in a French manicure.</li>
            <li>Dried quickly.</li>
            <li>The bright pink shade of the Nail Glow polish does add a subtle pink tone to the nail beds, and the whites do appear to be brighter.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that it looks like a salon-applied French manicure, but my nails do look well groomed and shiny, and if I apply two coats it lasts for at least a full week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t disagree with the previous reviewer enough.  </li>

            <li> effect as I had anticipated based on other reviews.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle.</li>

            <li> Purchased this product and had it applied by my manicurist.  It looked like diluted blood....or some version of cheap nail polish marketed to grade school girls back in the 50&#x27;s.  Truly a terrible effect.</li>
            <li> not totally satisfied with coverage</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish. It really does make your nail lock like you had a French manicure. I&#x27;ve used it constantly since receiving it in the mail!  What I love the most is it doesn&#x27;t chip. Wore it all week and no chips!  That&#x27;s awesome since I&#x27;m typing everyday all day long!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. I bought something like it at the drugstore for half the price from Sally Hansen and it worked better.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear nail polish these days, but wanted my hands to look a little more \\&quot;put together\\&quot;.  I decided to try nail glow and I love it! This is so easy to put on, just one coat with a very user friendly brush, and my nails suddenly look naturally beautiful. It&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li> Although you won&#x27;t get a true French manicure effect, you will get a rosy glow and your nails will look whiter. It&#x27;s pretty, sophisticated and chic. A good bet for low maintenance polish.</li>

            <li> beautiful shine and strenghtener in one!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up under artificial light but in sunlight it&#x27;s definately pink on the nail and sort of like a French manicure on the tips. Used 2 coats, no base or top coat. Dried quickly. Stands up very well to everyday wear and tear of handwashing, washing dishes and doing stuff with my hands. I&#x27;ll use it up but won&#x27;t buy again because of the price.</li>
            <li> Love this product, everything I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> Love this product. One coat and my nails look professionally done and has laster two weeks and counting. Found the recommendation for the product in MORE Magazine. A great find!</li>
            <li> LOVE this polish. Looks natural and application is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Makes your nails look really natural only better.  Nails look healthier and keeps my nails looking \\&quot;done\\&quot;. Dries very quickly. Also, and the best part in my opinion is that Dior makes a super wide brush and it covers my whole nail in on stroke. LOVE, LOVE, Love the wide brush and wonder why other companies have never done this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOWNSIDE - very pricy. Only $25 at Sephora.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t disagree with the previous reviewer enough.  The color is extremely subtle and lovely.  I rarely wear nail polish, and Dior Glow makes my nails look healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this and a few other Dior polishes at the Dior counter at Macy&#x27;s. I have to keep a classic look in my profession so I stick to French manicures or neutrals. This gave me an American manicure look if anyone knows what that means (subdued version of the French without white tips). I needed 2 coats as I&#x27;m olive skinned. Darker beauties may need 3. Sephora has a pink gel dupe for half the price if anyone wants to seek that out.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes my nails looks as if I have in french manicure in the sunlight. I suggest applying two coats if you want it to last longer.  The nail polish is expensive but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I hop CD never stops making this color, I love it!</li>
            <li> Great clear nail polish!</li>
            <li> Really pretty pink tint that looks natural.</li>
            <li> I will save $ on French manicures now</li>
            <li> On me, this just looks like clear polish. Nice, but a small container, very pricey. The magic pinkening/whitening effect didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very timely, though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but next time I will definitely find a cheaper option.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT clear polish.  I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;French manicure&amp;#34; effect as I had anticipated based on other reviews.  But since I knew that when I purchased it, I&#x27;ll say that the polish does look nice and it lasts well.  Just won&#x27;t exactly give you the white tips you would expect in a French manicure.</li>
