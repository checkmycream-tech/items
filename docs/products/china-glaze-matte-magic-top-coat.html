            <li>This is the best top coat I have used so far.</li>
            <li>oh and the shipping was quick and good came</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Or a blue for best results of the matte outcome .</li>
            <li>Love, love, loooooooove.</li>
            <li>But the coat is perfect going on i only need one or two coats and it lasts!</li>
            <li>I know these matte top coats have been around for some time now</li>
            <li>Love it when people ask &amp;#</li>
            <li>and I love the look it gives my nail color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gives a more &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish to the nails&lt;</li>
            <li>I love love love this.</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat because it neutralizes the shine but doesn&#x27;t make it Matte finish.</li>
            <li>You will love it this finish.</li>
            <li>I love the China Gaze Magic Top Coat.</li>
            <li>One of the better topcoats I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like magic.</li>
            <li>but I prefer to to apply it on top of dark/black nails.</li>
            <li>If you want a Matte top coat then dont look anywhere else.</li>
            <li>And the free shipping is a plus!</li>
            <li>I used this top coat on a metallic, medium brown nail polish, and it worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I think I&#x27;d rather have the nail color itself be matte.</li>
            <li>I have several matte-finish polishes and it is perfect with them.</li>
            <li>it was great loved it wish it was a bigger bottle though will use it again and again</li>
            <li>i think i like the matte about you better.</li>
            <li>I rated this 5 stars because it works well and is a very cool effect on the nails.</li>
            <li>great for a man&#x27;s manicure, or if you just want a natural nail look</li>
            <li>This stuff is so cool!</li>
            <li>Tried it on my sky blue color and it looks great</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>omg must try changes the colors and outcomes of the nail polishes its like magic right before your eyes you wont belive its wonders</li>
            <li>I even tried this one with regular polish and it also made very nice matte-finish.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t give the matte finish that a matte nail polish would originally give you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it works just as well on pastel colours too.  </li>
            <li>First time using matte top coat</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried it and love it</li>
            <li>It takes the shine out of the polish for a unique look.</li>
            <li>It was perfect and came out how expected, would recommend to anyone who wants matte nail polish</li>
            <li>I was delighted it work so nice and did not cheap.</li>
            <li>And like most matte top coats it takes more than a couple of minutes to dry</li>
            <li>Very nice, but it takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good money saver when you wanna turn your regular nailpolish into a matte one</li>
            <li>so that was cool.</li>
            <li>I really like the matte top coat for a lot of my colors.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still really cool to see the transformation.</li>
            <li>It was just smaller than I imagined, but its still a good size.</li>
            <li>This matte top coat gives my nails a really matte finish.</li>
            <li>Personally I llike the essie matte top coat better because it seems like this one clouded my nail designs and dulled the colors vibrancy.</li>
            <li>It dries super quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this :)  Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li>Dries quick also.</li>
            <li>so I did it again where I used the matte top coat the next day (just to be sure).</li>
            <li>it works great at first but then in wears off after like a day.... Very strange.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a very nice matte.</li>
            <li>but i am pretty sure most matte polishes do, i am very new at doing nails and out of everything new</li>
            <li>The matte polish works really well!!</li>
            <li>I mean it is a good matte top coat</li>
            <li>but really when I tried it was not that special.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super duper fast.</li>
            <li>Loved the effect this had on my black nail polish</li>
            <li>The Matte Magic on the right is what I paid for the purple bottle on the left!</li>
            <li>shipped very fast and was secured in a safe packaging, i have tried other matte top coats and they still have a weird shine, but this china glaze matte magic truly is magic!</li>
            <li>Although the bottle is small I do love this matte top coat.</li>
            <li>ALSO be aware that this is a MINI bottle of polish.</li>
            <li>It also fries fast!</li>
            <li>It works really well on my nails !</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does....</li>
            <li>China Glaze has been called the best matte nail polish around, other brands will cost more but only give you half the results.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product to anyone who just wants a cute look for a night, but if you&#x27;re looking for it to last</li>
            <li>This is the only matte top coat I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but I really like China Glaze polishes</li>
            <li>the only con is that it does chip pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Is also chips pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It also shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It works good just a small bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, it takes a while to matte your nail and dry but it does the job.</li>
            <li>I had painted my nails and waited for the polish to dry (30 ish minutes) and then put the top coat on.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if mine ever completely dried without a quick-dry top coat!</li>
            <li>and I must add that it is 2 bottles that are Deluxe size not 1 full size</li>
            <li>So I really like the matte</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be purchasing this item again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The girlfriend wants this one</li>
            <li>Dries fast, and it&#x27;s very matte.</li>
            <li>I really ordered it in error.</li>
            <li>The polish is a reasonable price for what it does.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the oz</li>
            <li>Kept the matte Finish the whole time my nail polish was on.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping /</li>
            <li>It dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Works really well with any nail polish</li>
            <li>I really like the result.</li>
            <li>It also dries as quickly as any quick dry topcoat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Its nice small bottle</li>
            <li>so Im not quite sure what they&#x27;re average bottles sizes are</li>
            <li>One thing to note is that it is not the full sized nail polish, it is one of the smaller ones.  </li>
            <li>With this matte top coat you basically double your entire colour collection as this gives a whole new look to the colour.</li>
            <li>I love matte black for some reason but</li>
            <li>Best let your colour dry properly though before application as I almost ended up getting wet Russian Navy (OPI)</li>
            <li>The bottle far left is an Essie nail polish, the China Glaze Matte top coat, OPI nail polish, and finally a Sally Hansen Nail polish.</li>
            <li>Once it has completely dried I apply a normal coat of the matte magic and it dries like normal polish.</li>
            <li>totally recommend this product for you nail designers or just for fun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d paint the left and right side of my nail, and the left side would be drying as I would be doing the right.</li>
            <li>Tough, long lasting, great for a mani pedi!</li>
            <li>It turns matte quickly although it takes a lil minute to dry..</li>
            <li>The polish does start to come off after about 3 days, but that&#x27;s the same with any other top coat.</li>
            <li>Pretty small bottle but its not that big of a deal because you won&#x27;t use it as often as a top coat.</li>
            <li>Such a great matte coat - only the second I&#x27;ve tried but goes on very smoothly - definitely apply in well lit areas as it&#x27;s easy to miss and have a half shiny / half matte manicure.</li>
            <li>It could have been more dull</li>
            <li>Do NOT put clear over this polish once you apply it.</li>
            <li>Never dried.</li>
            <li>Never dried and smeared everywhere.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your $.</li>
            <li>though so it is a good buy just not totally awesome.</li>
            <li>It soaks the whole nail polish on your nail and you have to wait for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few and they all seem to get glossy after a day but this one stayed true to being matte.</li>
            <li>say it does not help prevent the base nail varnish from chipping, unlike most top coats</li>
            <li>I mean it works with which ever color most definitely</li>
            <li>It is a small bottle but actually a perfect size because I don&#x27;t use it every time I do my nails, if I had a normal size bottle it would probably go bad.</li>
            <li>Wow i can&#x27;t believe it the polish actually works it&lt;</li>
            <li>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t mind the extra coats, but this bottle is TINY.</li>
            <li>Was really pricey in other stores &amp; sites, so I decided to check on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Worked great for a little while but then started drying with randomly placed white spots embedded in the polish.</li>
            <li>I painted it over black nail polish, leaving the tip of the nail untouched to compare and two days later the matte part of the nail looked also exactly like the tip of the nail with the regualr polish on it.</li>
            <li>Used it last night, works very well, however the bottle was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>This product never seemed to dry completely, and didn&#x27;t create a fully matte look.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I think I&#x27;d rather have the nail color itself be matte.</li>
            <li> I have several matte-finish polishes and it is perfect with them.</li>
            <li> it was great loved it wish it was a bigger bottle though will use it again and again</li>
            <li> i think i like the matte about you better.</li>
            <li> I rated this 5 stars because it works well and is a very cool effect on the nails.</li>
            <li> great for a man&#x27;s manicure, or if you just want a natural nail look</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cool!</li>
            <li> Tried it on my sky blue color and it looks great</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> omg must try changes the colors and outcomes of the nail polishes its like magic right before your eyes you wont belive its wonders</li>
            <li> I even tried this one with regular polish and it also made very nice matte-finish.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t give the matte finish that a matte nail polish would originally give you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it works just as well on pastel colours too.  </li>
            <li> First time using matte top coat</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried it and love it</li>
            <li> It takes the shine out of the polish for a unique look.</li>
            <li> It was perfect and came out how expected, would recommend to anyone who wants matte nail polish</li>
            <li> I was delighted it work so nice and did not cheap.</li>
            <li> And like most matte top coats it takes more than a couple of minutes to dry</li>
            <li> Very nice, but it takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good money saver when you wanna turn your regular nailpolish into a matte one</li>
            <li> so that was cool.</li>
            <li> I really like the matte top coat for a lot of my colors.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still really cool to see the transformation.</li>
            <li> It was just smaller than I imagined, but its still a good size.</li>
            <li> This matte top coat gives my nails a really matte finish.</li>
            <li> Personally I llike the essie matte top coat better because it seems like this one clouded my nail designs and dulled the colors vibrancy.</li>
            <li> It dries super quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this :)  Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Dries quick also.</li>
            <li> so I did it again where I used the matte top coat the next day (just to be sure).</li>
            <li> it works great at first but then in wears off after like a day.... Very strange.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a very nice matte.</li>
            <li> but i am pretty sure most matte polishes do, i am very new at doing nails and out of everything new</li>
            <li> The matte polish works really well!!</li>
            <li> I mean it is a good matte top coat</li>
            <li> but really when I tried it was not that special.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super duper fast.</li>
            <li> Loved the effect this had on my black nail polish</li>
            <li> The Matte Magic on the right is what I paid for the purple bottle on the left!</li>
            <li> shipped very fast and was secured in a safe packaging, i have tried other matte top coats and they still have a weird shine, but this china glaze matte magic truly is magic!</li>
            <li> Although the bottle is small I do love this matte top coat.</li>
            <li> ALSO be aware that this is a MINI bottle of polish.</li>
            <li> It also fries fast!</li>
            <li> It works really well on my nails !</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does....</li>
            <li> China Glaze has been called the best matte nail polish around, other brands will cost more but only give you half the results.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to anyone who just wants a cute look for a night, but if you&#x27;re looking for it to last</li>
            <li> This is the only matte top coat I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but I really like China Glaze polishes</li>
            <li> the only con is that it does chip pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Is also chips pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It also shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It works good just a small bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, it takes a while to matte your nail and dry but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I had painted my nails and waited for the polish to dry (30 ish minutes) and then put the top coat on.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if mine ever completely dried without a quick-dry top coat!</li>
            <li> and I must add that it is 2 bottles that are Deluxe size not 1 full size</li>
            <li> So I really like the matte</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be purchasing this item again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The girlfriend wants this one</li>
            <li> Dries fast, and it&#x27;s very matte.</li>
            <li> I really ordered it in error.</li>
            <li> The polish is a reasonable price for what it does.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the oz</li>
            <li> Kept the matte Finish the whole time my nail polish was on.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping /</li>
            <li> It dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Works really well with any nail polish</li>
            <li> I really like the result.</li>
            <li> It also dries as quickly as any quick dry topcoat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Its nice small bottle</li>
            <li> so Im not quite sure what they&#x27;re average bottles sizes are</li>
            <li> One thing to note is that it is not the full sized nail polish, it is one of the smaller ones.  </li>
            <li> With this matte top coat you basically double your entire colour collection as this gives a whole new look to the colour.</li>
            <li> I love matte black for some reason but</li>
            <li> Best let your colour dry properly though before application as I almost ended up getting wet Russian Navy (OPI)</li>
            <li> The bottle far left is an Essie nail polish, the China Glaze Matte top coat, OPI nail polish, and finally a Sally Hansen Nail polish.</li>
            <li> Once it has completely dried I apply a normal coat of the matte magic and it dries like normal polish.</li>
            <li> totally recommend this product for you nail designers or just for fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d paint the left and right side of my nail, and the left side would be drying as I would be doing the right.</li>
            <li> Tough, long lasting, great for a mani pedi!</li>
            <li> It turns matte quickly although it takes a lil minute to dry..</li>
            <li> The polish does start to come off after about 3 days, but that&#x27;s the same with any other top coat.</li>
            <li> Pretty small bottle but its not that big of a deal because you won&#x27;t use it as often as a top coat.</li>
            <li> Such a great matte coat - only the second I&#x27;ve tried but goes on very smoothly - definitely apply in well lit areas as it&#x27;s easy to miss and have a half shiny / half matte manicure.</li>
            <li> It could have been more dull</li>
            <li> Do NOT put clear over this polish once you apply it.</li>
            <li> Never dried.</li>
            <li> Never dried and smeared everywhere.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your $.</li>
            <li> though so it is a good buy just not totally awesome.</li>
            <li> It soaks the whole nail polish on your nail and you have to wait for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few and they all seem to get glossy after a day but this one stayed true to being matte.</li>
            <li> say it does not help prevent the base nail varnish from chipping, unlike most top coats</li>
            <li> I mean it works with which ever color most definitely</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle but actually a perfect size because I don&#x27;t use it every time I do my nails, if I had a normal size bottle it would probably go bad.</li>
            <li> Wow i can&#x27;t believe it the polish actually works it&lt;</li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t mind the extra coats, but this bottle is TINY.</li>
            <li> Was really pricey in other stores &amp; sites, so I decided to check on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a little while but then started drying with randomly placed white spots embedded in the polish.</li>
            <li> I painted it over black nail polish, leaving the tip of the nail untouched to compare and two days later the matte part of the nail looked also exactly like the tip of the nail with the regualr polish on it.</li>
            <li> Used it last night, works very well, however the bottle was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> This product never seemed to dry completely, and didn&#x27;t create a fully matte look.</li>
            <li> just apply my regular colored nail polish as normal, typically two coats.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work that well with other nail polishes but works really well with other china glaze nail polishes</li>
            <li> It definitely does it&#x27;s job in mattefying however it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> and if you lead an active lifestyle you should probably look into something more expensive that will last longer.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle is not as big as other China glaze nail polish bottles, I still have smaller bottles then that.</li>
            <li> Sorry for this huge run on sentence of a review for you grammar nazis out there</li>
            <li> It lasts as long as I have ever wanted it</li>
            <li> (????) It makes a good base coat though..</li>
            <li> I recently bought a black matte polish, from another company, and the polish turned glossy a day later.</li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s not prime and usually non prime products don&#x27;t usually arrive so quickly</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but you only need one coat and likely won&#x27;t use it every time you paint your nails so it should last a bit.</li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I started using Seche-Vite under it, but sometimes it just wouldn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> The metallic brown looked matte, but it took 3 coats in between letting it dry.</li>
            <li> The bottle is the same size as your average nail polish bottle.</li>
            <li> but i prefer the coat over black or blue.</li>
            <li> I even tried several coats still has a slight shine to it.</li>
            <li> but the outside of the bottle had some on it so that kinda disappointed me but ultimately wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back to me</li>
            <li> I had to remove my entire manicure, so it&#x27;s just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> It might take a little long to dry</li>
            <li> and I agree with some of the other comments</li>
            <li> I would paint my nail matte, and a day later if I pushed too hard on the nail</li>
            <li> it just looked flat and dull.</li>
            <li> It just made my nail polish look extra thick and a little hazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen pictures of black matte nails on Facebook and Tumblr</li>
            <li> I recommend t use it over black nail polish.</li>
            <li> the matte black BK colour I used to buy stains my nails like nothing else.</li>
            <li> It was actually less matte finished than my essie matte about you.</li>
            <li> it seems the matte finish comes off so quickly, no chipping just gets shiny.</li>
            <li> One coat works well for me and dries in less than 10 secs.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but still cheaper than going to the nail salon!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can almost guarantee you the finish will be bumpy from uneven drying times.</li>
            <li> but after a few days it becomes oily and starts to look shiny.</li>
            <li> A little on the small size.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to little which contains very little polish and cost a lot for a small thing.</li>
            <li> Not very nice and smudges the nail polish under</li>
            <li> However, it is somewhat thick and caused my black Sally Hansen polish to look like rather clumpy.</li>
            <li> but this one is small.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> This one makes the color kinda dull.</li>
            <li> , at least that&#x27;s what I have found.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goopy and thick, but still watery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it might have been too thick a coat, but I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the finish of it isn&#x27;t long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how tiny it was when I got the package.</li>
            <li> yet it is thin.</li>
            <li> and I was obsessed.</li>
            <li> Sorry i won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> So I thought maybe my base coat hadn&#x27;t dried</li>
            <li> This polish never dries so it smears and looks chunky and awful.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good money saver when you wanna turn your regular nailpolish into a matte one but it doesn&#x27;t give the matte finish that a matte nail polish would originally give you. This one makes the color kinda dull. But still serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. I&#x27;ve seen pictures of black matte nails on Facebook and Tumblr and I was obsessed. I purchased this and it did the job the only con is that it does chip pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Not very nice and smudges the nail polish under</li>
            <li> Smaller than their regular nail polish</li>
            <li> So I really like the matte and I agree with some of the other comments it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work that well with other nail polishes but works really well with other china glaze nail polishes, I&#x27;m giving this review a three because it seems the nail polish was already used when I got it maybe not on someone&#x27;s nails but the outside of the bottle had some on it so that kinda disappointed me but ultimately wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back to me,  the product is good and I give it four stars :) oh and the shipping was quick and good came a couple days after I ordered it which is awesome cuz it&#x27;s not prime and usually non prime products don&#x27;t usually arrive so quickly so that was cool. Sorry for this huge run on sentence of a review for you grammar nazis out there hahaha</li>
            <li> Its nice small bottle</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this matte top coat!!!! It makes any nail polish matte!! And like most matte top coats it takes more than a couple of minutes to dry but once it does try it leaves your polish beautifully matte!! I&#x27;ve never used a China Glaze polish before so Im not quite sure what they&#x27;re average bottles sizes are but this one is small. I didn&#x27;t quite worry about it though because of how great it works plus when I ordered mine I paid $6 for it from a different company so this is a bargain!! I will absolutely be purchasing this item again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I took a picture to help give an ide of how big it is. The bottle far left is an Essie nail polish, the China Glaze Matte top coat, OPI nail polish, and finally a Sally Hansen Nail polish. Hope this helps!!!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, love it! Great buy!</li>
            <li> The girlfriend wants this one so here it goes...</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift, but I LOVE IT! This is the best top coat I have used so far. I really like the matte top coat for a lot of my colors. I have had it on for multiple days without any chips. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle is small I do love this matte top coat. I&#x27;ve tried a few and they all seem to get glossy after a day but this one stayed true to being matte. I&#x27;ve always loved china glaze and this is no exception. Also my package came in great time. I will definitely buy from seller again when I have the funds. :o)</li>
            <li> omg must try changes the colors and outcomes of the nail polishes its like magic right before your eyes you wont belive its wonders</li>
            <li> Personally I llike the essie matte top coat better because it seems like this one clouded my nail designs and dulled the colors vibrancy.</li>
            <li> Loved It ! Works Really Good ! I recommend t use it over black nail polish. Or a blue for best results of the matte outcome . I mean it works with which ever color most definitely but i prefer the coat over black or blue.</li>
            <li> Saw this on tou tube and i hadtotey this brand and it was true to what it said love this one gives the best matte look</li>
            <li> Love it! Dries fast, and it&#x27;s very matte. Shipping was super duper fast. Love, love, loooooooove.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s still disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick yet it is thin. It dries super quickly. I&#x27;d paint the left and right side of my nail, and the left side would be drying as I would be doing the right. I can almost guarantee you the finish will be bumpy from uneven drying times. It&#x27;s goopy and thick, but still watery.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I don&#x27;t know if mine ever completely dried without a quick-dry top coat! I would paint my nail matte, and a day later if I pushed too hard on the nail, it would come off, polish underneath included. I started using Seche-Vite under it, but sometimes it just wouldn&#x27;t dry and I wouldn&#x27;t know why. I think it might have been too thick a coat, but I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the finish of it isn&#x27;t long-lasting. I used to do matte-black nails with glossy French-tips. It would look great and discernible in pictures, but by the end of the day I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the nail-bed and the tip.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, unless you never use your hands for anything or you&#x27;re using it for pictures.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars not because it doesn&#x27;t do its job, but because I don&#x27;t like the matte finish. For any one who likes the matte finish this is the product for them. I just prefer the shine. I really ordered it in error. But it is a good matte finish. I just like shine.</li>
            <li> it works great at first but then in wears off after like a day.... Very strange.</li>
            <li> This product never seemed to dry completely, and didn&#x27;t create a fully matte look. It just made my nail polish look extra thick and a little hazy. I had to remove my entire manicure, so it&#x27;s just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> A little on the small size. But the coat is perfect going on i only need one or two coats and it lasts!</li>
            <li> It turns matte quickly although it takes a lil minute to dry..i tried it on my mannequin hand Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my nails and clients! (:</li>
            <li> I know these matte top coats have been around for some time now but it&#x27;s still really cool to see the transformation. I love matte black for some reason but the matte black BK colour I used to buy stains my nails like nothing else. With this matte top coat you basically double your entire colour collection as this gives a whole new look to the colour. I&#x27;m pretty sure it works just as well on pastel colours too.  Best let your colour dry properly though before application as I almost ended up getting wet Russian Navy (OPI) all over the brush for rushing ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must say it does not help prevent the base nail varnish from chipping, unlike most top coats, at least that&#x27;s what I have found.</li>
            <li> I just got my nails done yesterday and thought it would be a good time to put this to the test and it worked! Tried it on my sky blue color and it looks great</li>
            <li> I heard this was the best matte top coat that&#x27;s out there but really when I tried it was not that special. It was actually less matte finished than my essie matte about you. I mean it is a good matte top coat though so it is a good buy just not totally awesome.</li>
            <li> I like it. The polish does start to come off after about 3 days, but that&#x27;s the same with any other top coat. It&#x27;s does make the manicure matted so it does it&#x27;s job. The polish is a reasonable price for what it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, it takes a while to matte your nail and dry but it does the job. But the matte wear off after like a day or two so I have to keep reapplying. Is also chips pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It definitely does it&#x27;s job in mattefying however it doesn&#x27;t last too long. Maybe 1 or two days and if you lead an active lifestyle you should probably look into something more expensive that will last longer. I painted it over black nail polish, leaving the tip of the nail untouched to compare and two days later the matte part of the nail looked also exactly like the tip of the nail with the regualr polish on it. I do recommend this product to anyone who just wants a cute look for a night, but if you&#x27;re looking for it to last a while I&#x27;d look elsewhere. ALSO be aware that this is a MINI bottle of polish. I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the oz but .325 is not very big at all. I was shocked at how tiny it was when I got the package. It should last you a while though if you don&#x27;t plan on using it every time you do your nails.</li>
            <li> this did not work ....</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cool! Love it when people ask &amp;#34;how I did that&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> First time using matte top coat and I love the look it gives my nail color but after a few days it becomes oily and starts to look shiny.</li>
            <li> Love love love this! I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so small!&lt;br /&gt;Of all matte finish polishes I&#x27;ve tried, this one works best for the price!</li>
            <li> Wow i can&#x27;t believe it the polish actually works it&lt;br /&gt;really makes glossy polish matte with just one coat.</li>
            <li> Love it, it came in perfect condition &amp;&amp; I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it right away!</li>
            <li> The matte polish works really well!! It also fries fast! Although the bottle is not as big as other China glaze nail polish bottles, I still have smaller bottles then that.</li>
            <li> Mattifys but within 2 days comes off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gives a more &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish to the nails&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dissapointed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright matte finish for those who don&#x27;t use their hands as often as I do. :/ it seems the matte finish comes off so quickly, no chipping just gets shiny. I&#x27;d buy again though.</li>
            <li> I love love love this. Its as they said it was and my nails look great. This is the first time I tried it and love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a design I am trying out. Was really pricey in other stores &amp; sites, so I decided to check on Amazon. Great price, came new and works great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product bcz it&#x27;s to little which contains very little polish and cost a lot for a small thing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this too coat! The matte effect is so cute! I recently bought a black matte polish, from another company, and the polish turned glossy a day later. This too coat is amazing! Kept the matte Finish the whole time my nail polish was on.</li>
            <li> This is the only matte top coat I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but I really like China Glaze polishes so that is why I stuck with them. The bottle is small, but you only need one coat and likely won&#x27;t use it every time you paint your nails so it should last a bit. It is a little pricey, but still cheaper than going to the nail salon!&lt;br /&gt;I just apply my regular colored nail polish as normal, typically two coats. Once it has completely dried I apply a normal coat of the matte magic and it dries like normal polish. It takes the shine out of the polish for a unique look. It lasts as long as I have ever wanted it to so I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> It works really well on my nails ! It was just smaller than I imagined, but its still a good size. Four stars!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
            <li> Great use this every time I do my nails works over any polish flawlessly and works over already matte polish as a great top coat will not regret and I must add that it is 2 bottles that are Deluxe size not 1 full size</li>
            <li> I use it as a top coat because it neutralizes the shine but doesn&#x27;t make it Matte finish. I even tried several coats still has a slight shine to it. I thought it was going to look like my actual matte finished polishes.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the best matte but nail polish dries and easily gets dirt on it</li>
            <li> Perfect matte coat, it was exactly what I was looking for! I just wish the bottle was bigger!!  That&#x27;s the only con!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than what I thought it was going to be but works wonderfully and is perfect!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does....matte cover. However, it is somewhat thick and caused my black Sally Hansen polish to look like rather clumpy. It dries extremely fast. someone suggested to add nail thinner, but I don&#x27;t want to take away from the Matte finish. The bottle is the same size as your average nail polish bottle. Do NOT put clear over this polish once you apply it. It will change the appearance of the Matte to gloss. You will love it this finish. I never knew about it until I went on youtube under Nail Art. You will find many great easy nail designs there. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Love this :)  Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> It was perfect and came out how expected, would recommend to anyone who wants matte nail polish</li>
            <li> I love the China Gaze Magic Top Coat.</li>
            <li> One of the better topcoats I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s almost like magic. Once it dries, your nails are magazine perfect. It also dries as quickly as any quick dry topcoat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! What an awesome way to make any color matte.</li>
            <li> Pretty small bottle but its not that big of a deal because you won&#x27;t use it as often as a top coat. It also shipped pretty fast. Works really well with any nail polish but I prefer to to apply it on top of dark/black nails. Dries quick also. China Glaze has been called the best matte nail polish around, other brands will cost more but only give you half the results.If you want a Matte top coat then dont look anywhere else. And the free shipping is a plus!</li>
            <li> Came within 3 days of me ordering! Used it last night, works very well, however the bottle was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Such a great matte coat - only the second I&#x27;ve tried but goes on very smoothly - definitely apply in well lit areas as it&#x27;s easy to miss and have a half shiny / half matte manicure.</li>
            <li> I used this top coat on a metallic, medium brown nail polish, and it worked. The metallic brown looked matte, but it took 3 coats in between letting it dry.Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t mind the extra coats, but this bottle is TINY. It&#x27;s okay, but I think I&#x27;d rather have the nail color itself be matte.</li>
            <li> It worked great for me!! It might take a little long to dry but i am pretty sure most matte polishes do, i am very new at doing nails and out of everything new i tried this was the easiest and turned out really great!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> great for a man&#x27;s manicure, or if you just want a natural nail look</li>
            <li> It made it matteBut did not protect my nail polish and it was quality nail polish so i will shop for another.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful over my nails</li>
            <li> Loved this. It is the perfect matte finish I was looking for. China Glaze never seems to disappoint! Good buy.</li>
            <li> I rated this 5 stars because it works well and is a very cool effect on the nails. It is a small bottle but actually a perfect size because I don&#x27;t use it every time I do my nails, if I had a normal size bottle it would probably go bad. I love it!</li>
            <li> Worked great for a little while but then started drying with randomly placed white spots embedded in the polish. (????) It makes a good base coat though..</li>
            <li> Love matte nails, and this works wonderfully. And it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I have several matte-finish polishes and it is perfect with them. I even tried this one with regular polish and it also made very nice matte-finish. I would repurchase this again.</li>
            <li> It works good just a small bottle</li>
            <li> leaves a yellow finish on all colors except for black(obviously)</li>
            <li> A tad bit smaller than the sinful colors polish but works in an instant. One coat works well for me and dries in less than 10 secs.</li>
            <li> it was great loved it wish it was a bigger bottle though will use it again and again thank you</li>
            <li> It could have been more dull i think i like the matte about you better. Sorry i won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This matte top coat gives my nails a really matte finish. I really like the result. I wish China Glaze hadn&#x27;t discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Would defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> shipped very fast and was secured in a safe packaging, i have tried other matte top coats and they still have a weird shine, but this china glaze matte magic truly is magic! i love it!</li>
            <li> This top coat  works great. Tough, long lasting, great for a mani pedi!</li>
            <li> I was delighted it work so nice and did not cheap. Go quality product. totally recommend this product for you nail designers or just for fun.</li>
            <li> Worked great and got the look i wanted!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee loveee love works perfect &amp; doesn&#x27;t wash off</li>
            <li> Loved the effect this had on my black nail polish</li>
            <li> This polish never dries so it smears and looks chunky and awful. I had painted my nails and waited for the polish to dry (30 ish minutes) and then put the top coat on. Awful. Never dried. So I thought maybe my base coat hadn&#x27;t dried so I did it again where I used the matte top coat the next day (just to be sure). NOPE. Same thing. Never dried and smeared everywhere. Plus it didn&#x27;t look matte it just looked flat and dull. Do not waste your $.</li>
            <li> Overcharging for smaller bottles of polish!! The Matte Magic on the right is what I paid for the purple bottle on the left! Seller should be ashamed!</li>
            <li> Very nice, but it takes a while to dry. It soaks the whole nail polish on your nail and you have to wait for it to dry completely. Other than that, it is a very nice matte.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time.  One thing to note is that it is not the full sized nail polish, it is one of the smaller ones.  But I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and I still have plenty left in the bottle.</li>
