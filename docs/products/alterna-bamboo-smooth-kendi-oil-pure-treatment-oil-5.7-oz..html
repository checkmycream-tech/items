            <li>I LOVE this oil.</li>
            <li>but this is just as easy.  </li>
            <li>Has a soft pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue if you apply sparingly--</li>
            <li>Makes it so smooth</li>
            <li>helps smooth hair and remove frizz, as well as prevent damage during heat styling.  </li>
            <li>Two pumps and my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have bought this oil treatment before at Sephora, but this large salon size is a better deal for the money.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing for repairing split ends and helping fight reg old frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the oil making my hair oily, but instead makes it very shiny and look healthy.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>I love hot soft this feels in my hair, without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>I put the oil on my hair and found that it was absorbed very fast.</li>
            <li>Getting it with the pump and this size is way better than the smaller size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years since I first tried a sample at Sephora.</li>
            <li>Works best on wet hair, rather than dry, as some silicone products to, but works better on wet than silcones.</li>
            <li>I have really think long hair and this larger size with the pump is amazing!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>Able to take the smaller one on vacation as lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>This oil has so many uses—as an overnight or pre-shower hair mask, tame flyaways, and I apply it to the ends of my damp hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li>Gives hair an amazing shine, softness, and seriously repairs split ends.</li>
            <li>Works super on my dry hair.</li>
            <li>My sis got this for me saying, &amp;#34;Your hair isn&#x27;t pretty enough.</li>
            <li>My hair was pretty enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but not worth the money, especially for natural hair style.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado and have fine, dry, curly hair which i blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li>On Amazon it&#x27;s just a few dollars more for just over double the product.</li>
            <li>love this stuff it is applied on wet hair then dried.</li>
            <li>I use the old smaller one as my travel kendi oil!</li>
            <li>Works very well just after shampooing to smooth and shine my very thick, somewhat dry, colored hair.  </li>

            <li> Larger bottle. Priced right. Good service</li>
            <li> The best hair oil! Makes my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> It is a great product&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy at all, also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it without reservation</li>

            <li> Works very well just after shampooing to smooth and shine my very thick, somewhat dry, colored hair.  Works best on wet hair, rather than dry, as some silicone products to, but works better on wet than silcones.</li>
            <li> Replenished with this larger product to refill the smaller applicator.  Saves quite a lot of $s.  Able to take the smaller one on vacation as lasts quite a long time.  Only needs a small bubble for short hair.  Would recomment to anyone with coarse, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My sis got this for me saying, &amp;#34;Your hair isn&#x27;t pretty enough. Put this on it,&amp;#34; and then BAM! My hair was pretty enough. Getting it with the pump and this size is way better than the smaller size. I use the old smaller one as my travel kendi oil!</li>
            <li> use this product and usually buy from hair dresser but this is just as easy.  love this stuff it is applied on wet hair then dried.</li>

            <li> Works super on my dry hair. Makes it so smooth</li>
            <li> I have bought this oil treatment before at Sephora, but this large salon size is a better deal for the money.  Works like a charm--helps smooth hair and remove frizz, as well as prevent damage during heat styling.  I use it on my hair every time after washing it.  Has a soft pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue if you apply sparingly--would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I put the oil on my hair and found that it was absorbed very fast. I guess it is good. But after air blow drying, my hair become too frizz...</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for years now. Usually I would have to purchase at the salon or at Ulta. On Amazon it&#x27;s just a few dollars more for just over double the product. The oil is great for smoothing your ends and adding shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil. I have really think long hair and this larger size with the pump is amazing! Two pumps and my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but not worth the money, especially for natural hair style. This product did not make my hair any smoother.</li>
