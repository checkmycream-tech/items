            <li>I love this shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I think my hair is happy now. :)</li>
            <li>And the scent is a very light but pleasant lemony smell.</li>
            <li>Nice cleansing shampoo</li>
            <li>Didnt liked.</li>
            <li>I used the Shampoo Three and really liked it and decided to purchase Shampoo Two.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job, and is still gentle (my hair is also colored, which I have not noticed any color stripping at all).</li>
            <li>It has a nice light citrus smell that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love that there is no animal testing.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels after using this and it has done wonders this summer helping my hair out after a chlorine-y pool day.</li>
            <li>it considering how much more cheaper shampoo I&#x27;d have to use.</li>
            <li>will return to buy more  - love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting more from this product plus my bottle seemed like product leaked out</li>
            <li>It got better after a couple days, but still not so effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It strips away the oily buildup and makes my hair manageable and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped her hair to remain healthy.</li>
            <li>but this stuff does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>The lemony smell is pretty good also.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it makes my hair really clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I wish the scent was stronger but a great product overall</li>
            <li>The good part is that it did not dry out my hair and make it feel like cotton candy after using it.</li>
            <li>this really works well with  &amp;#34;wen&amp;#34;  conditioner --  love the smell of the lemon  </li>
            <li>After I dry my hair it feel so soft and smells (temporarily) real good.</li>
            <li>My hair gets super oily through the day.  </li>
            <li>Love and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It really feels CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Better smell and feels different.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleans it without stripping it and leaves it fresh and ready for styling.</li>
            <li>My first bottle exploded in the Amazon shipping box, so Amazon sent a replacement</li>
            <li>and it definitely looks so much better after drying.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter uses often for oily hair, but I use twice a week for dry hair and it is great.</li>
            <li>The product does an OK job on my fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and my hair feels really clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>My only reservation about this shampoo is that it does kind of take me a lot to feel like I am getting a decent lather (maybe that&#x27;s just a personal hangup), but at this price/size that isn&#x27;t really a huge deal.</li>
            <li>I have seen so much growth and more volume, and I have Deep Cleansing to thank for that.</li>
            <li>My baby fine hair is back to its long-previous texture and lightness.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really cleanses my scalp without it feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>I have really oily hair.</li>
            <li>I have the feather I have from high school and still rocking my roller skates.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo for straight hair that needs to be washed daily.</li>
            <li>I have hard water and swim in lake water so debated about getting PM shampoo three, but glad that I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>I think that this one is actually better than Three because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as hard</li>
            <li>I just need a tiny bit of the shampoo to wash my whole head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this for the last 6 or 7 months and my hair has improved so much.</li>
            <li>I use this about once a week to remove build up.&lt;br /&gt;The major downfall...</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but thick.</li>
            <li>A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently transitioning to natural hair, but have a lot of relaxed hair on my head.</li>
            <li>Other then that, its a decent deep cleansing shampoo.</li>

            <li> It is hard to find a shampoo for oily hair in the first place, but to find one that actually works is even harder.</li>
            <li> I use a clay hair product daily, and nothing else will get the product out of my hair in a single wash.  </li>
            <li> how well it cleans  - squeaky -  esp after  long spells of not washing with &amp;#34;cleansing product&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> When I first tried this shampoo, my hair usually got oily again no longer than half a day.</li>
            <li> A lil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It washes my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about paying so much for such a small bottle of shampoo, but it really goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands in store and none work like this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo with just one wash (and no conditioner) made my hair feel clean, soft and like I had never colored it or hated the sticky, gummy, coated feeling that I continued to have just a day ago.</li>
            <li> It def made my hair less oily, but after about a month of using it I noticed it was drying my scalp</li>
            <li> It does smell a little bit like lemon floor cleanser</li>
            <li> i still have to wash my hair everyday but it feels a little cleaner.</li>
            <li> and I could tell product was missing from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair twice a day, but using Paul Mitchell Shampoo, I need to wash everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have to say, my hair didn&#x27;t loss my hair heavily before.</li>
            <li> You have to wash all of this out or your hair will feel dirty .</li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> i hate it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cleans my scalp well without drying it.  It has a nice light citrus smell that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.  I highly recommend this shampoo for straight hair that needs to be washed daily.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling and smelling great. I will definitely purchase it again .</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! My hair is great after using it. Removes all the oil from my hair. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I wish the scent was stronger but a great product overall</li>
            <li> It def made my hair less oily, but after about a month of using it I noticed it was drying my scalp so I stopped using it for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently transitioning to natural hair, but have a lot of relaxed hair on my head. This shampoo really cleanses my scalp without it feeling stripped. After I dry my hair it feel so soft and smells (temporarily) real good. I think my hair is happy now. :)</li>
            <li> The product does an OK job on my fine limp hair. I use this about once a week to remove build up.&lt;br /&gt;The major downfall... it smells like lemon pledge.  I cant seem to get over it. Other then that, its a decent deep cleansing shampoo.</li>
            <li> Suspected the shampoo was substituted with a different one and went to buy another one from ULTA to compare. Yup. Better smell and feels different. My bad. Never buy products that are not sealed over the internet.</li>
            <li> It cleans and it smells okay but I felt like I still had some of the products that I use in my hair after using this. The good part is that it did not dry out my hair and make it feel like cotton candy after using it.</li>
            <li> This makes my 80&#x27;s style hair look shiny and beautiful.  I have the feather I have from high school and still rocking my roller skates. I love that there is no animal testing.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels after using this and it has done wonders this summer helping my hair out after a chlorine-y pool day. It does smell a little bit like lemon floor cleanser but I can deal with that...</li>
            <li> I use a clay hair product daily, and nothing else will get the product out of my hair in a single wash.  A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it considering how much more cheaper shampoo I&#x27;d have to use.</li>
            <li> Great five stars all the way. May God continue to bless...</li>
            <li> if i don&#x27;t wash my hair every day it gets oily... i hate it. but this stuff does a pretty good job. i still have to wash my hair everyday but it feels a little cleaner.</li>
            <li> this really works well with  &amp;#34;wen&amp;#34;  conditioner --  love the smell of the lemon  &amp;  how well it cleans  - squeaky -  esp after  long spells of not washing with &amp;#34;cleansing product&amp;#34;  -  ty  for selling online- will return to buy more  - love it</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a shampoo for oily hair in the first place, but to find one that actually works is even harder. This shampoo keeps my hair from getting oily a lot longer than others I have tried. I am impressed and will order more. The lemony smell is pretty good also.</li>
            <li> I have really oily hair. This shampoo cleans it without stripping it and leaves it fresh and ready for styling.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it makes my hair really clean and smooth. My first bottle exploded in the Amazon shipping box, so Amazon sent a replacement</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell is good</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really perfect, for my hair anyway. It really feels CLEAN. My hair is fine but thick.</li>
            <li> Excellent for oily hair! Used by our teenage son. Have tried other brands in store and none work like this. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you want a clarifying shampoo, this is the one to get. Paul Mitchell makes excellent products. I personally recommend the Awapuhi and Ginger for a daily shampoo - it&#x27;s made my hundred-times bleached hair feel like HAIR again instead of hay. I actually got this for my husband to use, and he loves it! It has an amazing lemon scent, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I guess I was expecting more from this product plus my bottle seemed like product leaked out and I could tell product was missing from the bottle. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair twice a day, but using Paul Mitchell Shampoo, I need to wash everyday. When I first tried this shampoo, my hair usually got oily again no longer than half a day. It got better after a couple days, but still not so effective.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have to say, my hair didn&#x27;t loss my hair heavily before. It also stops my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter uses often for oily hair, but I use twice a week for dry hair and it is great. I do have to apply a heavier conditioner than the one that goes with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels cleaner and healthier when I use Paul Mitchell products.</li>
            <li> Nice cleansing shampoo</li>
            <li> I just need a tiny bit of the shampoo to wash my whole head. I was a little skeptical about paying so much for such a small bottle of shampoo, but it really goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Dries the hair. Didnt liked. No smelling</li>
            <li> It washes my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> This shampoo with just one wash (and no conditioner) made my hair feel clean, soft and like I had never colored it or hated the sticky, gummy, coated feeling that I continued to have just a day ago. My baby fine hair is back to its long-previous texture and lightness. I have hard water and swim in lake water so debated about getting PM shampoo three, but glad that I purchased this.  AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I used the Shampoo Three and really liked it and decided to purchase Shampoo Two. I think that this one is actually better than Three because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as hard and it definitely looks so much better after drying. I do a deep cleanser once a month followed by a deep conditioner. I&#x27;ve done this for the last 6 or 7 months and my hair has improved so much. I have seen so much growth and more volume, and I have Deep Cleansing to thank for that.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and this shampoo helps control that.  It strips away the oily buildup and makes my hair manageable and healthy.  A lil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo for the sole purpose of clarifying my hair once or twice a week. It does an excellent job, and is still gentle (my hair is also colored, which I have not noticed any color stripping at all). It does a good job of removing silicones, mousses, oils, you name it. And the scent is a very light but pleasant lemony smell. I love it. My only reservation about this shampoo is that it does kind of take me a lot to feel like I am getting a decent lather (maybe that&#x27;s just a personal hangup), but at this price/size that isn&#x27;t really a huge deal. Still would rate it 5 stars for clarifying.</li>
            <li> You have to wash all of this out or your hair will feel dirty . Must use another moisturizer shampoo after but it&#x27;s a great clarifier does everything it says</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and my hair feels really clean and soft.  We will see how it stands up after blow drying and straightening.  My hair gets super oily through the day.  I have a feeling this shampoo will work for me.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, and the company is &#x27;Cruelty-Free&#x27; , , never tests on animals</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My daughter is on the swim team. She uses it after every swim. It&#x27;s helped her hair to remain healthy.</li>
            <li> Another Paul Mitchell great products&lt;br /&gt;Cleans hair well</li>
            <li> I have well water for my blonge hair- this does the trick to get out that bronzish tint that I tend to get from the iron in my welll water. Love and highly recommend.</li>
