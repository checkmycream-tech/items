    <ol>
            <li>Very cheap material!!!!</li>
            <li>this the best product for the job?</li>
            <li>It was a perfect gift for my wife.</li>
            <li>and it was the best move I made.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was really impressed with the results for the amount of money it cost me.</li>
            <li>They work great!  </li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>I’m happy to recommend it!</li>
            <li>Best decision I ever made.</li>
            <li>I think the best thing is all that you get in this kit.</li>
            <li>During the summer I tend to break out a lot and this has been the best summer</li>
            <li>The two cleansing products provide a perfect balance for my needs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to use before a spray tan too.  </li>
            <li>After using the cleansing brush, my skin felt perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’ve done some research and had been using a variety of products to best accomplish each piece of my routine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to mention—the massage sponge feels magnificent!</li>
            <li>I was immediately impressed.</li>
            <li>The cleansing brush is perfect for irritable skin, though, and it always gets every bit of dirt and makeup off.</li>
            <li>I very happy with the product</li>
            <li>I have always admired her beautiful skin that just seemed so flawless</li>
            <li>Incredible value.  </li>
            <li>Maybe not as well made---but works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>The product was great until I went to use, it on the 8th day and the on/off button fell off.  </li>
            <li>so this works great.  </li>
            <li>This brush had great reviews so I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>At this price, my budget is happy, and so is my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really great.</li>
            <li>Met my expectations, great value for money</li>
            <li>It is a great investment for health and convenience reasons.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The samples were great as well.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great skin set from the brushes to the skin products.  </li>
            <li>It was great for about a month...</li>
            <li>Cleansers and moisturizer was great.</li>
            <li>I like its pulse and it leaves my skin feeling great, but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again because of the water issues.</li>
            <li>Bellapulse was a refreshingly pleasant</li>
            <li>Save your money and get the good one.</li>
            <li>Good, but no replacement brushes avaialble.</li>
            <li>I suppose that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>The Bellapulse is just as good.  </li>
            <li>I was happy that it came with it&#x27;s own cleansers.  </li>
            <li>The vibration feels really good while it is massaging the serums and moisturizers into my face.</li>
            <li>Good chance</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s no law that says I can&#x27;t have gorgeous skin.</li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for othes</li>
            <li>Good Service from the Seller, Product</li>
            <li>Every service I experienced was nice and prompt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has helped me stick to a routine that I wasn&#x27;t always so good at adhering to.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed when it worked, my skin was cleaner and softer right away.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>And at this price, even better!  </li>
            <li>Really pleased!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>I love this Bellapulse!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I was not expecting anything this sophisticated as a replacement and was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit it: I&#x27;m kind of a skeptic.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using Bellapulse and have even been using it twice a day because it feels so good.</li>
            <li>The products it came with I really liked too...</li>
            <li>As part of a couple&#x27;s agreement, we ordered this to just kind of see what it would do for our skin.</li>
            <li>, I can honestly say this has been keeping it under control.</li>
            <li>I am not the kind of person that will spend $100+ on a cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer applicator is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It is nice for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice it doesn&#x27;t spin..</li>
            <li>but my face is cleared up nicely</li>
            <li>It feels nice, too, so it encourages me to relax my face after it being tensed up all day.</li>
            <li>reminds me of how much care must go into being the best I can be.</li>
            <li>Seems like a nice quality brush.</li>
            <li>the cleansing system works awesome , i highly recomend</li>
            <li>Three things caught my attention with the Bellapulse system: the cleanser had rosehip seeds, which I already knew helped keep skin hydrated and smooth, the moisturizer had hyaluronic acid, another great anti-oxidant, and touted by Dr. Oz (who doesn&#x27;t love Dr. Oz?), and the system was made by SkinPro, which friends and clients had raved about.</li>
            <li>Bellapulse was available at a great price and I am so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>And the Bellepulse system is the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>The Bellapulse efficiently scrubs all the makeup, dirt, and oil caked in the wrinkles of my skin, leaving my skin looking bright and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that easy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this almost every day for three months now, and I think this is the first time in my life that I&#x27;m completely happy with my skin.</li>
            <li>but I am happy with clean and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>This unit is easy to use and nice that it is powered by batteries.  </li>
            <li>(By the way, I recommend using a “very warm” vs hot water shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but thats even better.</li>
            <li>I want to take better care of my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>DETAILS ARE IMPORTANT!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>so maybe I just need to adjust my expectations :)  </li>
            <li>Love the way this works and makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>But for the price it was ok.</li>
            <li>My Olay brush works a lot better for the rejuvenated look</li>
            <li>I took a chance and now I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I’m glad I took the chance on switching to the bellapulse.</li>
            <li>I bought the product and was impressed with the packaging, it was sleek and simple.</li>
            <li>I also cleaned up my diet and began drinking more water, which also helped.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect price point and it includes cleansers, which is a double bonus.  </li>
            <li>Love it to death!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>more so vibrates</li>
            <li>I always thought it was just a marketing ploy, but after trying it, I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Plus this product is more affordable than many of the brands on the market that are similar.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It exfoliates better than anything I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li>I love this product for so many reasons.  </li>
            <li>have always had a problem with foundation laying on top of my skin, creating a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; makeup effect.  </li>
            <li>The Bellapulse helps the foundation to absorb nicely into my skin for a smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li>This is so that I can get most of the makeup off before using my Bellapulse, otherwise my makeup stains the brushes.  </li>
            <li>LOOOVE the fact that so much stuff comes with the package, making this a GREAT buy.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that helps to rejuvenate my skin, while also cleaning my pores, the Bellapulse cleansing system does that and more.</li>
            <li>I thought for all most 50$ it would spin</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Bellapulse.</li>
            <li>I must say that I have found the results to be better than I even expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best aspect of this system is the set of brushes (4) which are used for the different cleansers.</li>
            <li>The massage brush provides a relaxing, pampering experience that is better than what I could get at any spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>However, this is just from my experience, and if you need to use the brushes more than once a day, do it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better on the skin.</li>
            <li>I love this device.</li>
            <li>Everything and more..</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what all woman want!.I love the way</li>
            <li>But thats OK.  </li>
            <li>The Bellapulse efficiently scrubs all the makeup, dirt, and oil caked in the wrinkles of my skin, leaving my skin looking bright, smooth, clean and healthy,</li>
            <li>Using my hands or a washcloth to wash my face was fine and well, but I feel the Bellapulse system is able to do a better job.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to buy the Bellapulse at a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin and has a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know I had leftover from my makeup removal even when I thought my skin was clean!</li>
            <li>Contacted the manufacturer and they were very nice and sent out a brand new one, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>If it were the original $229, I would care  a lot more about almost-identical brush heads, weird-smelling cleansers, and not being able to replace the brushes as easily as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>The Bellapulse system removes damage and stress, and is a fantastic aide to have in restoring and preserving healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is softer, has a healthy glow, and practically free of blemishes and imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>makeup goes on much more smoothly now because of my complexion, but I use the sponge applicator to apply my foundation and it gives me a polished look that looks like I had my makeup airbrushed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The word “microdermabrasion” can be intimidating, but the Advanced Pulsar Technology Microdermabrasion Power Wand could not be more user-friendly.  </li>
            <li>it does not smell too much, and all the brushes feel  good and do not scratch my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product and super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, the Bellapulse keeps my skin clean and healthy, unlike my washcloth and scrubbers I have used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very nice and complete set for your skin.</li>
            <li>I hope other women try this product and experience as great results as I have!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any of the other attachments but the cleansing brush is awesome.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin clean, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>The heads are easy to swap out and durable.</li>
            <li>Everything put together easily, and it fits well in the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to pop the heads off and change them out.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have to contact customer service, but the shipping was also very quick.</li>
            <li>Since I’ve started using the Bellapulse System, I’ve noticed a visible difference in how healthy my skin looks, and how clean it feels.</li>
            <li>I’m the kind of person that appreciates a good facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I particularly enjoy how “clean” my face looks after a shower with the cleansing brush/cleanser in the morning!  </li>
            <li>First let me say the package is nice</li>
            <li>The brush works fine...</li>
            <li>As a tool oriented guy, this suited me just fine.</li>
            <li>Once I start something I tend to get obsessive, which worked out just fine for me in this case.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why sellers don&#x27;t list important details about the product where they are readily available and easy to read.</li>
            <li>I love them all and most certainly will continue with my skin regimen.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of a cheap Avon</li>
            <li>This system is fantastic and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>The three facial items that came with it weren&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li>Honestly it is worth more than its selling price.</li>
            <li>The massaging brush is a great bonus to spa therapy at home, and not only does it add to my skin&#x27;s softness, it helps de-stress tension aches in my forehead and along my jaw.</li>
            <li>They go so much deeper than anything you can apply to the skin with your own fingertips.</li>
            <li>concept of the sponge to apply serum or makeup is a great idea but since the brush doesn&#x27;t spin, it&#x27;s easier to just use a regular makeup sponge to apply.</li>
            <li>The Bellapulse brush doesn&#x27;t rotate, it pulsates, so it&#x27;s a much gentler, but effective, cleansing method.  </li>
            <li>Nice and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>However, having used the Bellapulse now (and the products included), I’m getting great results with a very similar routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I now have an amazingly smooth face.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Rose Hip Seed cleanser.</li>
            <li>The wand is easy to use, and easy on my face, yet still incredibly effective, making sure that there is no residual muck left to clog my pores.</li>
            <li>Very useful cause</li>
            <li>and I have never felt to smooth and clean in my face.</li>
            <li>it saves me a lot of time and money and my skin is smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>Came across this product and got excited for no reason.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell, it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, and most of all it works.</li>
            <li>I love using the massager after I get out of a hot shower at night.</li>
            <li>So, I originally bought this for my sister for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>It also looks better to me, the sleek black look of it on my cabinet, very nice.</li>
            <li>Plus, the massaging head is always a great little treat for those days when I want just a bit more</li>
            <li>I love anything with Rose Hip Seed - my face definitely responds to this.</li>
            <li>I bought this instead of the clarisonic, but if you want a deeper clean, I would probably try LoReal Go 360</li>
            <li>I use it as my routine for keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li>I tried this one because it sounds like it gets your skin really CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I simply use the product application brush to apply a light layer of beauty balm and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>In any case, I never felt like my face was getting as clean as I wanted it to, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Good skin care has always been important to me, but it wasn’t until recently that I started thinking about preventative skin care, too.</li>
            <li>A month into morning and evening routines, and what a difference – my skin feels clearer, and has a really nice natural glow!</li>
            <li>It fits nicely and comfortably into your hand and is simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints, specially with a money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li>Even with different skin types, we both got pretty great results.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>I looked and looked and looked for a good deal on a facial brush on Amazon.</li>
            <li>most salons charge 3x as much for this.</li>
            <li>Bellapulse is a facial cleansing system that uses superior Pulsar Technology.</li>
            <li>I’ve used the Clarisonic before and seen mixed results with my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Being recently back in the dating pool, I want to look good.</li>
            <li>I like the vibrations because it&#x27;s more gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating and cleansing brushes gave my skin a healthy glow, so much so that I do not even need to use foundation anymore.  </li>
            <li>The Bellapulse system really makes my face feel like it&#x27;s been thoroughly cleansed and is just really refreshing.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice and looked professional.</li>
            <li>But as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I do find myself paying more attention to my skin.</li>
            <li>my pores were more closed and my skin was not as abrasive to the touch of my own hands.</li>
            <li>but it cleared up quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit apprehensive about using brushes on my skin, but my apprehension quickly disappeared after using them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky to have youthful skin, and I have doubts that Bellapulse will help keep it that way.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product; much more competitively priced than another national brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is new in the listing, but I sure didn&#x27;t see it before it was ordered.</li>
            <li>Not bad right?</li>
            <li>The Bellapulse Complete’s a smooth machine that’s easy to use.</li>
            <li>clean first</li>
            <li>Worth $10.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit to get used to the system, but it is well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I would like.</li>
            <li>and I always feel fresh after I use it.  </li>
            <li>My spots started to disappear and it even worked on my laugh lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 35 days as of today, and these are my results, completely worth the price.</li>
            <li>And though this has been good for my health, all of this sweat and dirt has been rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>Pleased so far</li>
            <li>The Hyaluronic moisturizer is gentle and perfect to provide long-lasting moisture barrier to the elements.&lt;br /&gt;The pulsar cleanser system makes this facial routine a pleasure to accomplish daily.  </li>
            <li>but you get professional results, which would cost you a lot more if you went to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have been using this facial cleansing brush for about 4 months now, I liked it, the face wash was not working for me at all</li>
            <li>Not as good as Clarisonic but for a reasonable price and has the same effect.</li>
            <li>For the price, Bellapulse offers more.  </li>
            <li>in all, I have found this package addresses a much more complete approach for my skincare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li>For that price it&#x27;s worth it, considering all that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>Although I just got it, for $30 it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, and then some.</li>
            <li>I’m seeing a real difference in the look and feel of my face—really a nice deep clean and exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works exactly was described, works quick, inexpensive for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>pampering!&lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard good things about other skin care systems, but for the price and with everything you get, I haven’t found anything yet that beats the Bellapulse System.</li>
            <li>These range from the high end to low end with a good deal in between.</li>
            <li>This one is just right.</li>
            <li>With the bellapulse cleanser i can use it anywhere because of its battery pack that comes with it, and it fits right in my pocket.</li>
            <li>I keep it right on my counter and just use it at night.  </li>
            <li>Why bother if it doesn&#x27;t work, right?</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants thier skin to look fresh and new and to help maintaine and even balance and healthy apperance,</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use another product again, this has actually shown me beautiful, and lasting results!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it, though, and probably wouldn&#x27;t even care to replace the brushes later on (I&#x27;m not even sure how you do that</li>
            <li>Batteries tested fine, tried new ones anyways and still nothing.</li>
            <li>Not bad really,</li>
            <li>Next was that I was that my face really did look better after using the product!</li>
            <li>It was a fairly neat novelty at first when the electronic brush didn&#x27;t seem to rub or irritate the skin at all when, in some other product reviews, we hear there&#x27;s an electric buzzing that goes through the affected area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear glasses, but I&#x27;ve heard about how its like using your eyes for the first time when you get the right prescription.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and you can feel the pores opening up as you use it on the face.</li>
            <li>Skin is not only clean, but smooth.</li>
            <li>I got a rechargeable coffee frother for Christmas for this exact reason.</li>
            <li>While I have a healthy dose of vanity, I am about as low maintenance as it gets and rather</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an enjoyable experience.  </li>
            <li>I world&#x27;s recommend Bellapulse to anyone who wants to pamper themselves without spending a bundle!</li>
            <li>I know all the ads on TV promise to give younger and better looking skin, but I can vouch that this one does.</li>
            <li>Most days I&#x27;m covered in dust and dirt or breathing in enough enamel paint fumes to make me dizzy.</li>
            <li>The brushes are easy to use and clean and the whole system is simple to make part of your routine.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that this product works  better than my traditional routine of manual hand washing my face with soap and water.</li>
            <li>My face does feel refreshed and my skin looks more brighter after using the bellapulse on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Well the first unit just stopped working a month in.</li>
            <li>At night, I first wash my face with cleanser using just my hands.  </li>
            <li>The first week I used it I noticed the diffrence in my face</li>
            <li>About six months ago, for the first time in my life I began experiencing breakouts of acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it eliminate my need for spa facials altogether, but my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Sun and environmental exposure over the years have made me want to not only take care of but heal and repair my skin, and the Bellapulse has become my go-to tool to keep everything healthy and</li>
            <li>the sonic will not be able to cleanse the skin properly.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>As for the moisturizer and cleanser aspect of it, it’s pretty spot-on with my complexion.  </li>
            <li>so thats a down fall, but if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the real deal, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a good value for what it&#x27;s at right now, because it&#x27;s low enough that you can recognize the craftsmanship without caring about the flaws.</li>
            <li>The cleansers that it comes with don&#x27;t leave my face feeling as clean as my normal cleansers do (I use Clean and Clear).</li>
            <li>My foundation went on more smoothly, I had less breakouts</li>
            <li>It could have been my laziness for getting new brush heads for the clarisonic, but when I had the chance to upgrade with this full package I went for it.</li>
            <li>Definitely buy this the limited time extras are great</li>
            <li>With the Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleaning System, you will receive an unparalleled quality to professional skin care that will keep your skin looking young, smooth, and most importantly, healthy.</li>
            <li>My husband noticed right away how much softer my face is now that I&#x27;m using the Bellapulse system.</li>
            <li>Other than that the brush is really nice</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>moisturizer was drying the first couple weeks; however, the skin that was underneath was fresh, new and revitalized.</li>
            <li>I had heard some positive reviews about the Bellapulse System</li>
            <li>I feel younger because i feel more confident with healthier looking skin and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry up as much as it use too.</li>
            <li>Our expectations were pretty much rock bottom.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a couple of days so far, and the major improvement that I have noticed is that using a bristled brush is better than using a washcloth or hands, but that is about it.</li>
            <li>No dramatic results after weeks.  </li>
            <li>I got the set, which comes with the cleansers (for a limited time), so I was able to sample them.</li>
            <li>really helped to give my face a refreshing feel without making it too dry.  </li>
            <li>You have to take the batteries out after every use and make sure everything is very dry, which is a hassle.</li>
            <li>If you want healthy, smooth, bump-free skin, then you have to start taking care of it by washing and exfoliating at least once a day.</li>
            <li>The Bella Pulse gently vibrates but works effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like I really wanted anyway.</li>
            <li>I REALLY did not want a battery operated one.</li>
            <li>She really enjoys it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; recommend this to anyone who really wants to get the renewed skin look.  </li>
            <li>Very Goldie Locks.</li>
            <li>I work outside a lot, doing light construction on a house I&#x27;m building.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m convinced that it was Bellapulse that made the real difference.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll see some real improvement.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The brushes do not rotate at all, they entire unit just vibrates from a cheap off balance motor...</li>
            <li>I think using it twice a day would be too much.  </li>
            <li>Now I just can&#x27;t get over how fresh and young my skin looks every day.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating cleanser  is gentle and what I like</li>
            <li>Use it if you will, but it does feel really</li>
            <li>Bellapulse has the real exfoliating and rejuvenating value.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>Much to my delight</li>
            <li>That, along with the very steep discount on Amazon did make me wonder at how legitimate a product it is.</li>
            <li>and I would HIGHLY recommend it to a friend for use and as a gift!</li>
            <li>Bellapulse exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my complexion in the four weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much water was in mine until rust had already formed.</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft and smooth and the cleansers helped clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the sensitive brush and regular brush, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>The Bella pulse Complete Facial Cleansing System, is so much more convenient to use then spend all that time and money.</li>
            <li>My first time using it was at nighttime, so I woke up to the acne spots I had previously had, completely minimized, it looked liked</li>
            <li>And after having looked at 20 other products trying to figure out what I wanted, I&#x27;m sure it was very easy to miss two words that you have to scroll 3/4 of the way down to find.</li>
            <li>I am new to this whole facial care thing, but with a new job and wanting to try this take better care of myself thing</li>
            <li>I chose this after trying three other brushes at varying prices and this is the only one I truly feel is a good purchase and product for the cost.</li>
            <li>After I washed my face, it didn&#x27;t feel irritated, and I actually felt clean.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so much better just after the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>The pulsating brushes deep clean and remove every trace of makeup.</li>
            <li>am a minimalist and really  don’t enjoy a long drawn out process for anything</li>
            <li>The Bellapulse gives my skin a deep, thorough clean with its interchangeable heads.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend the Bellapulse system to anyone who wants to improve the way their face looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I really love that this system offers a variety of skin care tools, making it useful not only for cleansing, but for an overall skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>Can’t evaluate its anti-aging effect because I am pretty young</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my face not only looks smooth and younger, but it feels soft and completely clean.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my face not only looks smooth and younger, but it feels soft and completely clean.</li>
            <li>so glad that I chose this system over other ones as it is affordable and just as powerful as the bigger brands!</li>
            <li>With the new replacement Olay brush, I still decided to continue the use of the cleansers/moisturizer that came with this Bellapulse set, but I was really unimpressed with that, as well.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new way to clean their face.</li>
            <li>Now that I’m getting older</li>
            <li>I have tried most of the basic pads and cleansers for my face, but every morning I wake up with left over residue on my pillow case.</li>
            <li>The cleanser has a nice smell to it and dosen&#x27;t seem to harsh for the skin beging use so frequently.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Bellapulse Complete Facial Care System at the recommendation of a friend and because it comes with a free exfoliating cleanser set.</li>
            <li>in looking up reviews for this system, I saw more than one duplicate multi-paragraph review on different personal blogs.</li>
            <li>Had to find instructions on utube which was very hard to find a good video.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bellapulse Complete for 3 weeks now and must say that the results are more than I expected!</li>
            <li>I love this system my face feels so clean and fresh and tight or firm</li>
            <li>Instead of tearing my skin up, it pulsated the unevenness away and left me feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not typically one to write reviews, but I can say with confidence that the Bellapulse helped clear up my dry skin better than anything else could.</li>
            <li>Bellapulse System’s brush is a soft and gentle brush that pulsates.</li>
            <li>are already is starting to notice smile lines.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have to fuss with batteries dying and possibly not having fresh ones.</li>
            <li>and this makes keeping me looking fresh without a big investment in time.</li>
            <li>I decided it was worth it because of the multiple headsand the cleansing system.</li>
            <li>As a child, I used special, doctor-recommended soap because I had dry skin.</li>
            <li>; I did some research and came across this product, now I am a big fan of doing research before buying a product and right away</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see the difference right away, but I could definitely feel it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine with me, since using only one at a time would make the brush system last longer.</li>
            <li>Live lighter.</li>
            <li>Even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>Every time I ordered something new, it felt like I was throwing money away.</li>
            <li>unless you opt into their loyalty program to buy new ones on a scheduled date).</li>
            <li>I am a super active person and my whole life is outdoors.</li>
            <li>First I remove my makeup with a hydrating cream cleanser then use this with my normal facial foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that the batteries run out very fast</li>
            <li>It is my first one; the brushes don&#x27;t rotate, only vibrate</li>
            <li>I actually thought I broke it when I dropped it in the tub the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I worry about looking older than I already do, with my prematurely grey hair (thanks, Dad!).</li>
            <li>The sponge brush put the moisturizer on smoothly and evenly, and it did feel like it was going deeper than moisturizers typically</li>
            <li>As a mom that is constantly on the go and worried about sun exposure and wrinkles, this product over a few months seemed to energize my pores and helped my face feel more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I finally have the soft skin I&#x27;ve been craving my whole life!</li>
            <li>When I first set out to find a facial care system, I bought one that completely rotates.  </li>
            <li>At first, I never heard of the product known as Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System, until I overheard a co -worker talking about it on our lunch break.</li>
            <li>I recently was gifted the Bellapulse after my girlfriend “permanently borrowed” my previous spinbrush (which was pretty basic and about a year old now).  </li>
            <li>I did some research, and this came back with generally positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Was disappointed that the brush does not oscillate, but have grown to LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li>Add to that a diet that is pretty much grabbing what&#x27;s handy, and my skin suffers.</li>
            <li>The tubes were useless but the facial cleaning brushes were pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>After the first day that I used it I noticed a difference, I normally feel dry on my face after I wash it.</li>
            <li>, it appears more neutral sitting on our sink cabinet, which is next to my husband&#x27;s black mustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want to go overboard and make promises, but I started seeing results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>After doing a search online, I came across the Bellapulse Complete Facial Care System and figured I would give it a shot after I read the positive reviews on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pores on my cheeks are large, I have deep blackheads on my nose and acne scars from experiencing hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li>The unit itself does feel a little cheap but for that price, who cares.</li>
            <li>If you care about the health of your skin, you should at the very least give Bellapulse an honest try.</li>
            <li>After deep cleansing with my new Bellapulse, my skin feels soft, radiantly clean and detoxified from both internal and external excesses.  </li>
            <li>but this has kept my skin even and clear.</li>
            <li>The darker color makes it clean up of the product far less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>It took a while to get into the habit of using everything properly, but once I did, I actually did feel... not younger, necessarily, but better.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much heavier my skin felt before taking off all the accumulated junk that regular life just deposits on your face.</li>
            <li>I think using this product twice a day would be damaging to my sensitive</li>
            <li>skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Brushes are soft and not abrasive, they do not spin like a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>they were on there way to being completely gone.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li>Having it in the shower (completely waterproof) forces me to look at it and remind me to wash my face every day.</li>
            <li>The system also includes a storage cradle, a battery pack, and a complete user guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I do not have to spend a considerable amount of money scheduling a massage every now and then.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I’ve tried a couple of different methods and moisturizers, nothing really helped.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The soft brushes are truly genius.</li>
            <li>Bellapulse also comes with a soft messaging sponge which applies moisturizer to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never realized how much residue was left on my face before using this.  </li>
            <li>I also love to exfoliate my the rest of my body at least once a month.  </li>
            <li>several people even commented on it, I was really suprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old crone of 58</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t apply foundation directly to the sponge, I dab it on my face and then use the Bellapulse to blend all over my face.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are soft, but i can feel them working and notice a difference every time i use it.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, so the idea of using a brush on my face was immediately off-putting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different moisturizers and exfoliating creams, but nothing really did the trick.  </li>
            <li>Old makeup accumulates in pores, blocks them, and collects oils which cause blemishes and bumps to appear in the skin.</li>
            <li>My experience washing with a washcloth helped clear up my skin, but at times my skin felt old makeup and dirt on my face, even though I had just washed it.</li>
            <li>The cleansing system created a lot of &amp;#34;irritation-based&amp;#34; acne that cleared up as soon as I discontinued use, and I do not have what you would consider to be sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also like that it offers a cradle for easier storage or set up on my vanity.  </li>
            <li>She is very into her beauty regiment, and definitely loves her high-end products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exactly like feeling my skin for the first time, but there was certainly a stark contrast before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even participated in a paid trial by a local market research company for a line of products that were supposed to take years off your appearance, but alas, none of these products have really yielded spectacular results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System is honestly a decent system for the price.  </li>
            <li>It clears out my pores and leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth, while removing the dead skin leaving it smooth with no more flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I grew older, the problems only got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having used a more basic spinbrush for a while (and usually for nightly cleansing), I can now take care of my day to day exfoliating, cleansing and moisturizing with one product.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that the clean feeling of other products only lasts about half the day, but using the Bellapulse system keeps my face oil free for the entire day and well into the night.</li>
            <li>Complete Cleansing system comes with interchangeable heads that include a hard exfoliating brush, a cleansing brush, a massaging sponge, and my favorite of all, a “massaging applicator” that is designed to release facial tension.</li>
            <li>I always love the way my skin looks after a spa facial, but facials are a luxury in my budget that I can only afford every few months.</li>
            <li>It gives your face a deep down clean to get your pores unclogged.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because of the low cost and my belief in giving new technology a try.</li>
            <li>I went and bought a new face brush by Olay that can be purchased in just about any store with a facial cleanser aisle (probably on Amazon too).  </li>
            <li>and I actually needed less than the recommended amount to clean my face thoroughly, so</li>
            <li>I only use it at night because in the morning my face only needs to be cleansed gently with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really are not going to see any results slathering any creams on your face unless you take off a very thin layer of skin, and this nifty tool does that better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I followed the instruction at the back making me clean my face in the mornings and evenings and it dried my face to the point that its itchy and painfull.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised I hadn&#x27;t heard about it before, because with a combination of oily and dry skin, I&#x27;m always looking for just the right facial products that won&#x27;t leave my skin feeling too dry or too oily.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin in general, so using the Bellapulse system and cleanser set</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after trying Bellapulse’s Complete Facial Cleansing System, my long-term problems have been solved!</li>
            <li>frugal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not only very pleasantly surprised by the results of this product, but it was quite a bargain.</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to, but I cannot imagine going back to my old methods</li>
            <li>A friend of my mom’s told me about the Bellapulse Complete Facial Care System.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels like it&#x27;s had a professional facial every day.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft,  clearer and younger than it&#x27;s been in years!!</li>
            <li>Plus the moisturizer is worked deep into the skin by those brushes which works wonders for mature skin.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>so I started using the Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleaning</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the cleansers go, I like them well enough.</li>
            <li>and I am as confused as anyone about which one gives you the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>The brushes are easy to change out on this cleanser; all internal working parts are sealed, so there is no concern about rust and ensuing break down of  parts, so it will be long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin is so much softer and smother, I never have dry patches and my pores appear smaller and cleaner.</li>
            <li>My medicine cabinet, linen closet, and bathroom drawers are bursting with so many different types of facial creams that it is verging on the ridiculous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is waterproof, but based on the other reviews, I don&#x27;t use it in the shower just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>Both of those things would hike the price up past $30 in my opinion, so it seemed like a worthy gamble.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer makes my skin look all even without having a hot greasy mess on my face-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless numbers of facial creams and moisturizers to get my skin to feeling soft and have a glow.</li>
            <li>The Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System is what I&#x27;ve been looking for personal facials.</li>
            <li>After trying various gels and creams I decided to go hi tech and try the Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>A few days later, I noticed a sort of velvety texture to my skin that felt fresh, as if it was staying cleaner longer.</li>
            <li>After a couple days, my skin, usually dry, chapped even, lost the rough first layer.</li>
            <li>Since I am married, I actually like the black</li>
            <li>After a complete cleansing, my face not only looks younger, but also feels younger.</li>
            <li>I had a few breakouts within the first week of using it</li>
            <li>The design is flawed - water enters the battery compartment so easily!</li>
            <li>Ever since I was a young kid, I have had dry patchy skin.</li>
            <li>only apparent downside I have found is that the moisture application brush can be a bit messy to operate, took a while to master much moisturizer and pressure to apply while using it.  </li>
            <li>After more research, I&#x27;ve learned that the company manufactures other skin care products so I am going to look for a few other products to work in synergy with this one.</li>
            <li>and once the dead cells are cleared away from the surface of your skin, the new skin is clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>Then I apply a small amount of cleanser to the Bellapulse and starting with my forehead, go in a circular motion around my face, spending about 20 seconds in each area, so forehead, right cheek, chin, left cheek and then nose.  </li>

            <li> Best decision I ever made.</li>
            <li> I think the best thing is all that you get in this kit.</li>
            <li> During the summer I tend to break out a lot and this has been the best summer</li>
            <li> The two cleansing products provide a perfect balance for my needs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to use before a spray tan too.  </li>
            <li> After using the cleansing brush, my skin felt perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’ve done some research and had been using a variety of products to best accomplish each piece of my routine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to mention—the massage sponge feels magnificent!</li>
            <li> I was immediately impressed.</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush is perfect for irritable skin, though, and it always gets every bit of dirt and makeup off.</li>
            <li> I very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I have always admired her beautiful skin that just seemed so flawless</li>
            <li> Incredible value.  </li>
            <li> Maybe not as well made---but works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> The product was great until I went to use, it on the 8th day and the on/off button fell off.  </li>
            <li> so this works great.  </li>
            <li> This brush had great reviews so I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> At this price, my budget is happy, and so is my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really great.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations, great value for money</li>
            <li> It is a great investment for health and convenience reasons.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The samples were great as well.</li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin set from the brushes to the skin products.  </li>
            <li> It was great for about a month...</li>
            <li> Cleansers and moisturizer was great.</li>
            <li> I like its pulse and it leaves my skin feeling great, but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again because of the water issues.</li>
            <li> Bellapulse was a refreshingly pleasant</li>
            <li> Save your money and get the good one.</li>
            <li> Good, but no replacement brushes avaialble.</li>
            <li> I suppose that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> The Bellapulse is just as good.  </li>
            <li> I was happy that it came with it&#x27;s own cleansers.  </li>
            <li> The vibration feels really good while it is massaging the serums and moisturizers into my face.</li>
            <li> Good chance</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no law that says I can&#x27;t have gorgeous skin.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe good for othes</li>
            <li> Good Service from the Seller, Product</li>
            <li> Every service I experienced was nice and prompt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has helped me stick to a routine that I wasn&#x27;t always so good at adhering to.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed when it worked, my skin was cleaner and softer right away.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> And at this price, even better!  </li>
            <li> Really pleased!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I love this Bellapulse!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting anything this sophisticated as a replacement and was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it: I&#x27;m kind of a skeptic.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using Bellapulse and have even been using it twice a day because it feels so good.</li>
            <li> The products it came with I really liked too...</li>
            <li> As part of a couple&#x27;s agreement, we ordered this to just kind of see what it would do for our skin.</li>
            <li> , I can honestly say this has been keeping it under control.</li>
            <li> I am not the kind of person that will spend $100+ on a cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer applicator is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It is nice for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice it doesn&#x27;t spin..</li>
            <li> but my face is cleared up nicely</li>
            <li> It feels nice, too, so it encourages me to relax my face after it being tensed up all day.</li>
            <li> reminds me of how much care must go into being the best I can be.</li>
            <li> Seems like a nice quality brush.</li>
            <li> the cleansing system works awesome , i highly recomend</li>
            <li> Three things caught my attention with the Bellapulse system: the cleanser had rosehip seeds, which I already knew helped keep skin hydrated and smooth, the moisturizer had hyaluronic acid, another great anti-oxidant, and touted by Dr. Oz (who doesn&#x27;t love Dr. Oz?), and the system was made by SkinPro, which friends and clients had raved about.</li>
            <li> Bellapulse was available at a great price and I am so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> And the Bellepulse system is the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> The Bellapulse efficiently scrubs all the makeup, dirt, and oil caked in the wrinkles of my skin, leaving my skin looking bright and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that easy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost every day for three months now, and I think this is the first time in my life that I&#x27;m completely happy with my skin.</li>
            <li> but I am happy with clean and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> This unit is easy to use and nice that it is powered by batteries.  </li>
            <li> (By the way, I recommend using a “very warm” vs hot water shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but thats even better.</li>
            <li> I want to take better care of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> DETAILS ARE IMPORTANT!</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> so maybe I just need to adjust my expectations :)  </li>
            <li> Love the way this works and makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> But for the price it was ok.</li>
            <li> My Olay brush works a lot better for the rejuvenated look</li>
            <li> I took a chance and now I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I’m glad I took the chance on switching to the bellapulse.</li>
            <li> I bought the product and was impressed with the packaging, it was sleek and simple.</li>
            <li> I also cleaned up my diet and began drinking more water, which also helped.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect price point and it includes cleansers, which is a double bonus.  </li>
            <li> Love it to death!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> more so vibrates</li>
            <li> I always thought it was just a marketing ploy, but after trying it, I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Plus this product is more affordable than many of the brands on the market that are similar.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It exfoliates better than anything I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li> I love this product for so many reasons.  </li>
            <li> have always had a problem with foundation laying on top of my skin, creating a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; makeup effect.  </li>
            <li> The Bellapulse helps the foundation to absorb nicely into my skin for a smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li> This is so that I can get most of the makeup off before using my Bellapulse, otherwise my makeup stains the brushes.  </li>
            <li> LOOOVE the fact that so much stuff comes with the package, making this a GREAT buy.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that helps to rejuvenate my skin, while also cleaning my pores, the Bellapulse cleansing system does that and more.</li>
            <li> I thought for all most 50$ it would spin</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Bellapulse.</li>
            <li> I must say that I have found the results to be better than I even expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best aspect of this system is the set of brushes (4) which are used for the different cleansers.</li>
            <li> The massage brush provides a relaxing, pampering experience that is better than what I could get at any spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> However, this is just from my experience, and if you need to use the brushes more than once a day, do it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this device.</li>
            <li> Everything and more..</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what all woman want!.I love the way</li>
            <li> But thats OK.  </li>
            <li> The Bellapulse efficiently scrubs all the makeup, dirt, and oil caked in the wrinkles of my skin, leaving my skin looking bright, smooth, clean and healthy,</li>
            <li> Using my hands or a washcloth to wash my face was fine and well, but I feel the Bellapulse system is able to do a better job.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to buy the Bellapulse at a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin and has a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I had leftover from my makeup removal even when I thought my skin was clean!</li>
            <li> Contacted the manufacturer and they were very nice and sent out a brand new one, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> If it were the original $229, I would care  a lot more about almost-identical brush heads, weird-smelling cleansers, and not being able to replace the brushes as easily as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> The Bellapulse system removes damage and stress, and is a fantastic aide to have in restoring and preserving healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer, has a healthy glow, and practically free of blemishes and imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> makeup goes on much more smoothly now because of my complexion, but I use the sponge applicator to apply my foundation and it gives me a polished look that looks like I had my makeup airbrushed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The word “microdermabrasion” can be intimidating, but the Advanced Pulsar Technology Microdermabrasion Power Wand could not be more user-friendly.  </li>
            <li> it does not smell too much, and all the brushes feel  good and do not scratch my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, the Bellapulse keeps my skin clean and healthy, unlike my washcloth and scrubbers I have used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and complete set for your skin.</li>
            <li> I hope other women try this product and experience as great results as I have!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any of the other attachments but the cleansing brush is awesome.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin clean, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> The heads are easy to swap out and durable.</li>
            <li> Everything put together easily, and it fits well in the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to pop the heads off and change them out.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have to contact customer service, but the shipping was also very quick.</li>
            <li> Since I’ve started using the Bellapulse System, I’ve noticed a visible difference in how healthy my skin looks, and how clean it feels.</li>
            <li> I’m the kind of person that appreciates a good facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I particularly enjoy how “clean” my face looks after a shower with the cleansing brush/cleanser in the morning!  </li>
            <li> First let me say the package is nice</li>
            <li> The brush works fine...</li>
            <li> As a tool oriented guy, this suited me just fine.</li>
            <li> Once I start something I tend to get obsessive, which worked out just fine for me in this case.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why sellers don&#x27;t list important details about the product where they are readily available and easy to read.</li>
            <li> I love them all and most certainly will continue with my skin regimen.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of a cheap Avon</li>
            <li> This system is fantastic and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> The three facial items that came with it weren&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li> Honestly it is worth more than its selling price.</li>
            <li> The massaging brush is a great bonus to spa therapy at home, and not only does it add to my skin&#x27;s softness, it helps de-stress tension aches in my forehead and along my jaw.</li>
            <li> They go so much deeper than anything you can apply to the skin with your own fingertips.</li>
            <li> concept of the sponge to apply serum or makeup is a great idea but since the brush doesn&#x27;t spin, it&#x27;s easier to just use a regular makeup sponge to apply.</li>
            <li> The Bellapulse brush doesn&#x27;t rotate, it pulsates, so it&#x27;s a much gentler, but effective, cleansing method.  </li>
            <li> Nice and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> However, having used the Bellapulse now (and the products included), I’m getting great results with a very similar routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I now have an amazingly smooth face.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Rose Hip Seed cleanser.</li>
            <li> The wand is easy to use, and easy on my face, yet still incredibly effective, making sure that there is no residual muck left to clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Very useful cause</li>
            <li> and I have never felt to smooth and clean in my face.</li>
            <li> it saves me a lot of time and money and my skin is smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> Came across this product and got excited for no reason.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell, it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, and most of all it works.</li>
            <li> I love using the massager after I get out of a hot shower at night.</li>
            <li> So, I originally bought this for my sister for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> It also looks better to me, the sleek black look of it on my cabinet, very nice.</li>
            <li> Plus, the massaging head is always a great little treat for those days when I want just a bit more</li>
            <li> I love anything with Rose Hip Seed - my face definitely responds to this.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the clarisonic, but if you want a deeper clean, I would probably try LoReal Go 360</li>
            <li> I use it as my routine for keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because it sounds like it gets your skin really CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I simply use the product application brush to apply a light layer of beauty balm and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li> In any case, I never felt like my face was getting as clean as I wanted it to, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Good skin care has always been important to me, but it wasn’t until recently that I started thinking about preventative skin care, too.</li>
            <li> A month into morning and evening routines, and what a difference – my skin feels clearer, and has a really nice natural glow!</li>
            <li> It fits nicely and comfortably into your hand and is simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints, specially with a money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Even with different skin types, we both got pretty great results.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked and looked for a good deal on a facial brush on Amazon.</li>
            <li> most salons charge 3x as much for this.</li>
            <li> Bellapulse is a facial cleansing system that uses superior Pulsar Technology.</li>
            <li> I’ve used the Clarisonic before and seen mixed results with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Being recently back in the dating pool, I want to look good.</li>
            <li> I like the vibrations because it&#x27;s more gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating and cleansing brushes gave my skin a healthy glow, so much so that I do not even need to use foundation anymore.  </li>
            <li> The Bellapulse system really makes my face feel like it&#x27;s been thoroughly cleansed and is just really refreshing.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice and looked professional.</li>
            <li> But as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I do find myself paying more attention to my skin.</li>
            <li> my pores were more closed and my skin was not as abrasive to the touch of my own hands.</li>
            <li> but it cleared up quickly</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit apprehensive about using brushes on my skin, but my apprehension quickly disappeared after using them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky to have youthful skin, and I have doubts that Bellapulse will help keep it that way.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product; much more competitively priced than another national brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is new in the listing, but I sure didn&#x27;t see it before it was ordered.</li>
            <li> Not bad right?</li>
            <li> The Bellapulse Complete’s a smooth machine that’s easy to use.</li>
            <li> clean first</li>
            <li> Worth $10.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to the system, but it is well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would like.</li>
            <li> and I always feel fresh after I use it.  </li>
            <li> My spots started to disappear and it even worked on my laugh lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 35 days as of today, and these are my results, completely worth the price.</li>
            <li> And though this has been good for my health, all of this sweat and dirt has been rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Pleased so far</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic moisturizer is gentle and perfect to provide long-lasting moisture barrier to the elements.&lt;br /&gt;The pulsar cleanser system makes this facial routine a pleasure to accomplish daily.  </li>
            <li> but you get professional results, which would cost you a lot more if you went to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial cleansing brush for about 4 months now, I liked it, the face wash was not working for me at all</li>
            <li> Not as good as Clarisonic but for a reasonable price and has the same effect.</li>
            <li> For the price, Bellapulse offers more.  </li>
            <li> in all, I have found this package addresses a much more complete approach for my skincare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li> For that price it&#x27;s worth it, considering all that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> Although I just got it, for $30 it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, and then some.</li>
            <li> I’m seeing a real difference in the look and feel of my face—really a nice deep clean and exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works exactly was described, works quick, inexpensive for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> pampering!&lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard good things about other skin care systems, but for the price and with everything you get, I haven’t found anything yet that beats the Bellapulse System.</li>
            <li> These range from the high end to low end with a good deal in between.</li>
            <li> This one is just right.</li>
            <li> With the bellapulse cleanser i can use it anywhere because of its battery pack that comes with it, and it fits right in my pocket.</li>
            <li> I keep it right on my counter and just use it at night.  </li>
            <li> Why bother if it doesn&#x27;t work, right?</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants thier skin to look fresh and new and to help maintaine and even balance and healthy apperance,</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use another product again, this has actually shown me beautiful, and lasting results!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it, though, and probably wouldn&#x27;t even care to replace the brushes later on (I&#x27;m not even sure how you do that</li>
            <li> Batteries tested fine, tried new ones anyways and still nothing.</li>
            <li> Not bad really,</li>
            <li> Next was that I was that my face really did look better after using the product!</li>
            <li> It was a fairly neat novelty at first when the electronic brush didn&#x27;t seem to rub or irritate the skin at all when, in some other product reviews, we hear there&#x27;s an electric buzzing that goes through the affected area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear glasses, but I&#x27;ve heard about how its like using your eyes for the first time when you get the right prescription.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and you can feel the pores opening up as you use it on the face.</li>
            <li> Skin is not only clean, but smooth.</li>
            <li> I got a rechargeable coffee frother for Christmas for this exact reason.</li>
            <li> While I have a healthy dose of vanity, I am about as low maintenance as it gets and rather</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an enjoyable experience.  </li>
            <li> I world&#x27;s recommend Bellapulse to anyone who wants to pamper themselves without spending a bundle!</li>
            <li> I know all the ads on TV promise to give younger and better looking skin, but I can vouch that this one does.</li>
            <li> Most days I&#x27;m covered in dust and dirt or breathing in enough enamel paint fumes to make me dizzy.</li>
            <li> The brushes are easy to use and clean and the whole system is simple to make part of your routine.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this product works  better than my traditional routine of manual hand washing my face with soap and water.</li>
            <li> My face does feel refreshed and my skin looks more brighter after using the bellapulse on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Well the first unit just stopped working a month in.</li>
            <li> At night, I first wash my face with cleanser using just my hands.  </li>
            <li> The first week I used it I noticed the diffrence in my face</li>
            <li> About six months ago, for the first time in my life I began experiencing breakouts of acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it eliminate my need for spa facials altogether, but my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Sun and environmental exposure over the years have made me want to not only take care of but heal and repair my skin, and the Bellapulse has become my go-to tool to keep everything healthy and</li>
            <li> the sonic will not be able to cleanse the skin properly.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> As for the moisturizer and cleanser aspect of it, it’s pretty spot-on with my complexion.  </li>
            <li> so thats a down fall, but if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the real deal, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a good value for what it&#x27;s at right now, because it&#x27;s low enough that you can recognize the craftsmanship without caring about the flaws.</li>
            <li> The cleansers that it comes with don&#x27;t leave my face feeling as clean as my normal cleansers do (I use Clean and Clear).</li>
            <li> My foundation went on more smoothly, I had less breakouts</li>
            <li> It could have been my laziness for getting new brush heads for the clarisonic, but when I had the chance to upgrade with this full package I went for it.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy this the limited time extras are great</li>
            <li> With the Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleaning System, you will receive an unparalleled quality to professional skin care that will keep your skin looking young, smooth, and most importantly, healthy.</li>
            <li> My husband noticed right away how much softer my face is now that I&#x27;m using the Bellapulse system.</li>
            <li> Other than that the brush is really nice</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft, and clean.</li>
            <li> moisturizer was drying the first couple weeks; however, the skin that was underneath was fresh, new and revitalized.</li>
            <li> I had heard some positive reviews about the Bellapulse System</li>
            <li> I feel younger because i feel more confident with healthier looking skin and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry up as much as it use too.</li>
            <li> Our expectations were pretty much rock bottom.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of days so far, and the major improvement that I have noticed is that using a bristled brush is better than using a washcloth or hands, but that is about it.</li>
            <li> No dramatic results after weeks.  </li>
            <li> I got the set, which comes with the cleansers (for a limited time), so I was able to sample them.</li>
            <li> really helped to give my face a refreshing feel without making it too dry.  </li>
            <li> You have to take the batteries out after every use and make sure everything is very dry, which is a hassle.</li>
            <li> If you want healthy, smooth, bump-free skin, then you have to start taking care of it by washing and exfoliating at least once a day.</li>
            <li> The Bella Pulse gently vibrates but works effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I really wanted anyway.</li>
            <li> I REALLY did not want a battery operated one.</li>
            <li> She really enjoys it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; recommend this to anyone who really wants to get the renewed skin look.  </li>
            <li> Very Goldie Locks.</li>
            <li> I work outside a lot, doing light construction on a house I&#x27;m building.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m convinced that it was Bellapulse that made the real difference.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll see some real improvement.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The brushes do not rotate at all, they entire unit just vibrates from a cheap off balance motor...</li>
            <li> I think using it twice a day would be too much.  </li>
            <li> Now I just can&#x27;t get over how fresh and young my skin looks every day.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating cleanser  is gentle and what I like</li>
            <li> Use it if you will, but it does feel really</li>
            <li> Bellapulse has the real exfoliating and rejuvenating value.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Much to my delight</li>
            <li> That, along with the very steep discount on Amazon did make me wonder at how legitimate a product it is.</li>
            <li> and I would HIGHLY recommend it to a friend for use and as a gift!</li>
            <li> Bellapulse exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my complexion in the four weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much water was in mine until rust had already formed.</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft and smooth and the cleansers helped clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the sensitive brush and regular brush, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> The Bella pulse Complete Facial Cleansing System, is so much more convenient to use then spend all that time and money.</li>
            <li> My first time using it was at nighttime, so I woke up to the acne spots I had previously had, completely minimized, it looked liked</li>
            <li> And after having looked at 20 other products trying to figure out what I wanted, I&#x27;m sure it was very easy to miss two words that you have to scroll 3/4 of the way down to find.</li>
            <li> I am new to this whole facial care thing, but with a new job and wanting to try this take better care of myself thing</li>
            <li> I chose this after trying three other brushes at varying prices and this is the only one I truly feel is a good purchase and product for the cost.</li>
            <li> After I washed my face, it didn&#x27;t feel irritated, and I actually felt clean.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so much better just after the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> The pulsating brushes deep clean and remove every trace of makeup.</li>
            <li> am a minimalist and really  don’t enjoy a long drawn out process for anything</li>
            <li> The Bellapulse gives my skin a deep, thorough clean with its interchangeable heads.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend the Bellapulse system to anyone who wants to improve the way their face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I really love that this system offers a variety of skin care tools, making it useful not only for cleansing, but for an overall skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Can’t evaluate its anti-aging effect because I am pretty young</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my face not only looks smooth and younger, but it feels soft and completely clean.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my face not only looks smooth and younger, but it feels soft and completely clean.</li>
            <li> so glad that I chose this system over other ones as it is affordable and just as powerful as the bigger brands!</li>
            <li> With the new replacement Olay brush, I still decided to continue the use of the cleansers/moisturizer that came with this Bellapulse set, but I was really unimpressed with that, as well.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new way to clean their face.</li>
            <li> Now that I’m getting older</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the basic pads and cleansers for my face, but every morning I wake up with left over residue on my pillow case.</li>
            <li> The cleanser has a nice smell to it and dosen&#x27;t seem to harsh for the skin beging use so frequently.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Bellapulse Complete Facial Care System at the recommendation of a friend and because it comes with a free exfoliating cleanser set.</li>
            <li> in looking up reviews for this system, I saw more than one duplicate multi-paragraph review on different personal blogs.</li>
            <li> Had to find instructions on utube which was very hard to find a good video.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bellapulse Complete for 3 weeks now and must say that the results are more than I expected!</li>
            <li> I love this system my face feels so clean and fresh and tight or firm</li>
            <li> Instead of tearing my skin up, it pulsated the unevenness away and left me feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not typically one to write reviews, but I can say with confidence that the Bellapulse helped clear up my dry skin better than anything else could.</li>
            <li> Bellapulse System’s brush is a soft and gentle brush that pulsates.</li>
            <li> are already is starting to notice smile lines.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have to fuss with batteries dying and possibly not having fresh ones.</li>
            <li> and this makes keeping me looking fresh without a big investment in time.</li>
            <li> I decided it was worth it because of the multiple headsand the cleansing system.</li>
            <li> As a child, I used special, doctor-recommended soap because I had dry skin.</li>
            <li> ; I did some research and came across this product, now I am a big fan of doing research before buying a product and right away</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see the difference right away, but I could definitely feel it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine with me, since using only one at a time would make the brush system last longer.</li>
            <li> Live lighter.</li>
            <li> Even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> Every time I ordered something new, it felt like I was throwing money away.</li>
            <li> unless you opt into their loyalty program to buy new ones on a scheduled date).</li>
            <li> I am a super active person and my whole life is outdoors.</li>
            <li> First I remove my makeup with a hydrating cream cleanser then use this with my normal facial foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that the batteries run out very fast</li>
            <li> It is my first one; the brushes don&#x27;t rotate, only vibrate</li>
            <li> I actually thought I broke it when I dropped it in the tub the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I worry about looking older than I already do, with my prematurely grey hair (thanks, Dad!).</li>
            <li> The sponge brush put the moisturizer on smoothly and evenly, and it did feel like it was going deeper than moisturizers typically</li>
            <li> As a mom that is constantly on the go and worried about sun exposure and wrinkles, this product over a few months seemed to energize my pores and helped my face feel more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I finally have the soft skin I&#x27;ve been craving my whole life!</li>
            <li> When I first set out to find a facial care system, I bought one that completely rotates.  </li>
            <li> At first, I never heard of the product known as Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System, until I overheard a co -worker talking about it on our lunch break.</li>
            <li> I recently was gifted the Bellapulse after my girlfriend “permanently borrowed” my previous spinbrush (which was pretty basic and about a year old now).  </li>
            <li> I did some research, and this came back with generally positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that the brush does not oscillate, but have grown to LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> Add to that a diet that is pretty much grabbing what&#x27;s handy, and my skin suffers.</li>
            <li> The tubes were useless but the facial cleaning brushes were pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> After the first day that I used it I noticed a difference, I normally feel dry on my face after I wash it.</li>
            <li> , it appears more neutral sitting on our sink cabinet, which is next to my husband&#x27;s black mustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to go overboard and make promises, but I started seeing results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> After doing a search online, I came across the Bellapulse Complete Facial Care System and figured I would give it a shot after I read the positive reviews on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pores on my cheeks are large, I have deep blackheads on my nose and acne scars from experiencing hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li> The unit itself does feel a little cheap but for that price, who cares.</li>
            <li> If you care about the health of your skin, you should at the very least give Bellapulse an honest try.</li>
            <li> After deep cleansing with my new Bellapulse, my skin feels soft, radiantly clean and detoxified from both internal and external excesses.  </li>
            <li> but this has kept my skin even and clear.</li>
            <li> The darker color makes it clean up of the product far less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> It took a while to get into the habit of using everything properly, but once I did, I actually did feel... not younger, necessarily, but better.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much heavier my skin felt before taking off all the accumulated junk that regular life just deposits on your face.</li>
            <li> I think using this product twice a day would be damaging to my sensitive</li>
            <li> skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Brushes are soft and not abrasive, they do not spin like a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> they were on there way to being completely gone.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li> Having it in the shower (completely waterproof) forces me to look at it and remind me to wash my face every day.</li>
            <li> The system also includes a storage cradle, a battery pack, and a complete user guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I do not have to spend a considerable amount of money scheduling a massage every now and then.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I’ve tried a couple of different methods and moisturizers, nothing really helped.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The soft brushes are truly genius.</li>
            <li> Bellapulse also comes with a soft messaging sponge which applies moisturizer to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never realized how much residue was left on my face before using this.  </li>
            <li> I also love to exfoliate my the rest of my body at least once a month.  </li>
            <li> several people even commented on it, I was really suprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old crone of 58</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply foundation directly to the sponge, I dab it on my face and then use the Bellapulse to blend all over my face.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are soft, but i can feel them working and notice a difference every time i use it.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, so the idea of using a brush on my face was immediately off-putting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different moisturizers and exfoliating creams, but nothing really did the trick.  </li>
            <li> Old makeup accumulates in pores, blocks them, and collects oils which cause blemishes and bumps to appear in the skin.</li>
            <li> My experience washing with a washcloth helped clear up my skin, but at times my skin felt old makeup and dirt on my face, even though I had just washed it.</li>
            <li> The cleansing system created a lot of &amp;#34;irritation-based&amp;#34; acne that cleared up as soon as I discontinued use, and I do not have what you would consider to be sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also like that it offers a cradle for easier storage or set up on my vanity.  </li>
            <li> She is very into her beauty regiment, and definitely loves her high-end products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exactly like feeling my skin for the first time, but there was certainly a stark contrast before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even participated in a paid trial by a local market research company for a line of products that were supposed to take years off your appearance, but alas, none of these products have really yielded spectacular results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System is honestly a decent system for the price.  </li>
            <li> It clears out my pores and leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth, while removing the dead skin leaving it smooth with no more flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I grew older, the problems only got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having used a more basic spinbrush for a while (and usually for nightly cleansing), I can now take care of my day to day exfoliating, cleansing and moisturizing with one product.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the clean feeling of other products only lasts about half the day, but using the Bellapulse system keeps my face oil free for the entire day and well into the night.</li>
            <li> Complete Cleansing system comes with interchangeable heads that include a hard exfoliating brush, a cleansing brush, a massaging sponge, and my favorite of all, a “massaging applicator” that is designed to release facial tension.</li>
            <li> I always love the way my skin looks after a spa facial, but facials are a luxury in my budget that I can only afford every few months.</li>
            <li> It gives your face a deep down clean to get your pores unclogged.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the low cost and my belief in giving new technology a try.</li>
            <li> I went and bought a new face brush by Olay that can be purchased in just about any store with a facial cleanser aisle (probably on Amazon too).  </li>
            <li> and I actually needed less than the recommended amount to clean my face thoroughly, so</li>
            <li> I only use it at night because in the morning my face only needs to be cleansed gently with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really are not going to see any results slathering any creams on your face unless you take off a very thin layer of skin, and this nifty tool does that better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I followed the instruction at the back making me clean my face in the mornings and evenings and it dried my face to the point that its itchy and painfull.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I hadn&#x27;t heard about it before, because with a combination of oily and dry skin, I&#x27;m always looking for just the right facial products that won&#x27;t leave my skin feeling too dry or too oily.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin in general, so using the Bellapulse system and cleanser set</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after trying Bellapulse’s Complete Facial Cleansing System, my long-term problems have been solved!</li>
            <li> frugal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not only very pleasantly surprised by the results of this product, but it was quite a bargain.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, but I cannot imagine going back to my old methods</li>
            <li> A friend of my mom’s told me about the Bellapulse Complete Facial Care System.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels like it&#x27;s had a professional facial every day.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft,  clearer and younger than it&#x27;s been in years!!</li>
            <li> Plus the moisturizer is worked deep into the skin by those brushes which works wonders for mature skin.</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> so I started using the Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleaning</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the cleansers go, I like them well enough.</li>
            <li> and I am as confused as anyone about which one gives you the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> The brushes are easy to change out on this cleanser; all internal working parts are sealed, so there is no concern about rust and ensuing break down of  parts, so it will be long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin is so much softer and smother, I never have dry patches and my pores appear smaller and cleaner.</li>
            <li> My medicine cabinet, linen closet, and bathroom drawers are bursting with so many different types of facial creams that it is verging on the ridiculous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is waterproof, but based on the other reviews, I don&#x27;t use it in the shower just to be safe.  </li>
            <li> Both of those things would hike the price up past $30 in my opinion, so it seemed like a worthy gamble.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer makes my skin look all even without having a hot greasy mess on my face-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless numbers of facial creams and moisturizers to get my skin to feeling soft and have a glow.</li>
            <li> The Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System is what I&#x27;ve been looking for personal facials.</li>
            <li> After trying various gels and creams I decided to go hi tech and try the Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I noticed a sort of velvety texture to my skin that felt fresh, as if it was staying cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> After a couple days, my skin, usually dry, chapped even, lost the rough first layer.</li>
            <li> Since I am married, I actually like the black</li>
            <li> After a complete cleansing, my face not only looks younger, but also feels younger.</li>
            <li> I had a few breakouts within the first week of using it</li>
            <li> The design is flawed - water enters the battery compartment so easily!</li>
            <li> Ever since I was a young kid, I have had dry patchy skin.</li>
            <li> only apparent downside I have found is that the moisture application brush can be a bit messy to operate, took a while to master much moisturizer and pressure to apply while using it.  </li>
            <li> After more research, I&#x27;ve learned that the company manufactures other skin care products so I am going to look for a few other products to work in synergy with this one.</li>
            <li> and once the dead cells are cleared away from the surface of your skin, the new skin is clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> Then I apply a small amount of cleanser to the Bellapulse and starting with my forehead, go in a circular motion around my face, spending about 20 seconds in each area, so forehead, right cheek, chin, left cheek and then nose.  </li>
            <li> When a friend recommended Bellapulse by SkinPro, I was honestly a little skeptical, but with the special promotion on Amazon, it was well worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in sharing my product experiences, which is why I write reviews online - whether positive or negative.</li>
            <li> I see them lasting a long while.</li>
            <li> My everyday cosmetic routine consists of a soft blush only, therefore immaculate looking skin is fundamentally essential.  </li>
            <li> Of course you don&#x27;t want anything harsh, but I just thought they would be a little more stiff.  </li>
            <li> A couple other systems that I tried before, like the Spa Sonic, had smaller applicators or, like the Youthful Advantage Facial Brush, had enormous applicators.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, post-menopausal, still slightly t-zone skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin does dry up a lot and it gets flakey, which i&#x27;m constantly running into the bathroom at my job to wash my face.</li>
            <li> My skin type is normal, not oily and not dry, just dull.</li>
            <li> And by mature I mean old.</li>
            <li> I, on the other hand, can barely tell concealer from foundation (and I’m still not 100%).  </li>
            <li> I think the cleansing washes smell like plastic, so I will likely switch back to my other face washes and use it with the brush.</li>
            <li> She says the brush is like a little massage and her face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> All of the bits just kinda came together to push off the dead skin, firm up some forehead wrinkles, actually put a little color in our cheeks, then clean whatever what was left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried a couple of products that were suppose to help clean and refresh my skin, but they actually added to blemishes, irritating me and leaving blotches!</li>
            <li> I use the exfoliating and cleaning heads to gently scrub the hard to reach places of my skin, while I use the massaging sponge to apply lotions.</li>
            <li> I use the exfoliating and cleaning heads to gently scrub the hard to reach places of my skin, while I use the massaging sponge to apply lotions.</li>
            <li> Just note to use gentle circular motions on the face, don&#x27;t press hard or else</li>
            <li> I should have spent the extra money and got the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> All the brushes felt as firm but soft as I like them, since they feel like they&#x27;re cleaning without hurting the skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, year round.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and black heads are my major</li>
            <li> The AHA exfoliating cleanser has done wonders for keeping my skin clear, less inflamed, and for healing and diminishing spots on my skin that I could not for the life of me get rid of!</li>
            <li> Luckily my face has never been severely problematic, but I never really grew out of acne and within the past few years I started getting a couple of dry patches that never seemed to go away.</li>
            <li> Looking back on the listing there&#x27;s one little sentence &amp;#34;batteries included&amp;#34; that is the only place anything is mentioned about how this product is powered.</li>
            <li> It felt smoother and softer, and other people definitely noticed the difference!</li>
            <li> Still, it did its part, and that mixed with the four other brushes to perform exceedingly well and make noticeable differences.</li>
            <li> What you get is a complete skin care system consisting of a handle (with batteries) that attaches to the accessories; (1) a hard exfoliating brush that exfoliates the skin; (2) a cleansing brush for routine skin cleansing; (3) a massaging sponge that massages moisturizer into the skin; (4) a massaging applicator that relaxes facial tension and increases circulation and a storage cradle.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin (or so my sister tells me), so I have oily spots and dry spots.  </li>
            <li> a lifetime warranty, a money-back guarantee and the limited time bonus offer of a three-piece exfoliating cleanser set and hyaluronic acid moisturizer</li>
            <li> I got the Bellapulse for the limited time price of $30 (including shipping).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different facial care regimens over the years, but never really stuck to anything since it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Also, the metal battery connector was loose</li>
            <li> Not a high quality face washer.</li>
            <li> only quibble is that the process itself feels a bit odd.</li>
            <li> By the second week my skin was glowing the brush is definetly the secret, it exfoliated my skin evenly and thorough and it removed all traces of dead skin and left it vibrant to the touch</li>
            <li> This item only vibrates just a little.  </li>
            <li> have tried other cleansing systems in the past, including ones more expensive than the Bellapulse.</li>
            <li> The little red, green and white stripes and</li>
            <li> In comparison to other products, Bellapulse adopts technology that cleans my upper skin layer and pores that typically contain makeup residue and dust.</li>
            <li> They all left me with a feeling that was far worse than what I expected.</li>
            <li> but the brush bristles seemed a bit softer than I expected when dealing with skin on my face, although it still gets the job done</li>
            <li> BUT what I received wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> That causes my eye to burn and that burning sensation can last a few hours.</li>
            <li> It takes all of the dead skin off and helps the spray tan to last longer.</li>
            <li> I started seeing the difference in my skin after a few days using the bonus cleanser set and their respective brush attachments.</li>
            <li> Washing your skin in the morning and before bed can prevent these bumps and blemishes from forming, but I wanted to ensure I was giving myself a quality wash to prevent these inconsistencies in my skin from reforming.</li>
            <li> She says its annoying to wash her face and then get makeup on the towel after removing her makeup, but she’s too frugal to invest in a nice set.</li>
            <li> I have seen a major improvement in both my skins complexion (my pores are smaller), decreased blemishes less red spots and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> First was that I was doing the face cleaning wrong for a long time now!</li>
            <li> It uses the principle of microdermabrasion, which is a minimally invasive spa procedure that rejuvenates the appearance of the skin by treating sun damage, scarring, wrinkles and other unwanted skin problems.</li>
            <li> I have found that pressing too hard or overusing the exfoliating and cleaning heads can cause minor irritation, so I only use them once a day.</li>
            <li> have always known about the virtues of exfoliating, but never tried anything other than pads on my face.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no reason to buy additional items, unlike other products that I&#x27;ve tried and bought before.</li>
            <li> wireless aspect makes it extremely convenient because i can take it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about an electronic brush to exfoliate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other brushes that came along with it other than the exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li> I had seen other brush systems advertised, but was hesitant to try them.</li>
            <li> small gripe is that the black color seems a little masculine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the only thing I ended up doing is spend a considerable amount of money with nothing to show for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of exfoliators with no success.</li>
            <li> , I really couldn’t go wrong in giving Bellapulse a try.  </li>
            <li> My two favorite things about this product is that it is wireless and &amp;#34;eye safety equipt.&amp;#34; I always hate when i&#x27;m washing my face with soap and water and then the soapy water sometimes gets in my eye.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t go out for specialized products of any sort, no matter what they purport to do.</li>
            <li> So all in all I suffer from way less acne using this,</li>
            <li> then the black reminds me of a racing car, but that’s just me.</li>
            <li> My blackheads were disappearing and my pores were a lot less visible.</li>
            <li> was SHOCKED to discover how much makeup was left on my skin after washing by hand!!!</li>
            <li> and I noticed my face was less oily.  </li>
            <li> This device does feel a little less durable than others I use, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems a little brighter.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I have almost literally no sense of smell, though, and I was still a little put off by the rosehip cleanser scent.</li>
            <li> Before I tried Bellapulse, I had tried a few other no name brand brushes like this from TJMaxx and Marshalls, both were very harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> When a friend who also suffered from acne recommended the BellaPulse to me, I initially was skeptical due to my previous failures with virtually every product I tried.</li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive skin, I always proceed with caution and skepticism whenever I purchase a skin care product, and I generally end up disappointed in the results.  </li>
            <li> It seemed as if when I applied it, I would have this heavy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> Definitely not smooth and supple like I</li>
            <li> BUT the cleansers dried out my face.</li>
            <li> A few have even asked if I have had work done.  </li>
            <li> So, my advice: give this a try and stick with it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of these including Olay&#x27;s Pro X and an off brand from TJ Maxx.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few minutes to try and figure out how to take off the brush head to put on another one</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find out how affordable it was and that it pays for itself with just a few uses at max, although I noticed a difference in my first use.</li>
            <li> have tried a myriad of different products, including very expensive mail-order creams, exfoliants and cleansing systems that made promises that they did not live up to.  </li>
            <li> Bellapulse removed the dead dull skin.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and small breakout problems</li>
            <li> Not sure when replacements would be needed.</li>
            <li> Imperfections and blemishes are now a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face doesn&#x27;t feel randomly irritated anymore, and my complexion just has gotten smoother overall.</li>
            <li> There was some weird smell in it that lasted about a second.</li>
            <li> So when a casual acquaintance mentioned using the Bellapulse system, I started asking questions, and before too long I picked one up for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would imagine the client base is primarily female, so the color scheme is a little odd.</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve had to deal with dry and flaky skin; worst of all on my face.</li>
            <li> Not the spinning brushes that are hard on skin, but a pulsing motion to stimulate your skin.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to take off the brushes to swap them</li>
            <li> I submitted a complaint</li>
            <li> biggest complaint about this item is that I have to replace the brushes, which is a necessity, but I guess you do with any device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though the massaging head was a bit harder to get off than the rest, it still wasn&#x27;t difficult.</li>
            <li> No more itchy, flaky skin!</li>
            <li> My advice is if you decide to use this product, get serious about it - for at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> The Olay system was about $25 or so, is waterproof and includes a very small amount of cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was black, sleek and sexxxy!!!</li>
            <li> Details are unimportant to seller.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of twisting too hard and breaking it, but now I can swap them out with ease.</li>
            <li> Sadly the quality is just plain bad.</li>
            <li> Now, my skin was not that bad, at least I did not think so, but after I used this product I realized two things.</li>
            <li> I am not the type of woman who will go to a dermatologist for expensive cosmetic procedures.</li>
            <li> My skin is notoriously difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found facials to be expensive and abrasive.</li>
            <li> Whats worst, sometimes the mens room only has hand soap that can&#x27;t be used on the face.</li>
            <li> Sadly, 2 weeks in a plastic part that holds the handle / battery compartment onto the rest of the unit broke.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my face alright, but took with it the entire 1st layer of skin, leaving me with nasty \\&quot;road rash.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I have scars and tend to get really bad acne</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not to bad.</li>
            <li> Plus,  I hate waking up with blemishes and blotches for days after.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s disgusting!  </li>
            <li> Horrible build quality, started working intermittently after day two, battery cover would not stay on.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I followed the instruction at the back making me clean my face in the mornings and evenings and it dried my face to the point that its itchy and painfull.    I recommend doing only mornings or evenings only, not both.    Other than that the brush is really nice it only vibrates but thats even better.</li>
            <li> Worth $10. Very cheap material!!!! The brush works fine... but I don&#x27;t use it often.</li>
            <li> Not a high quality face washer. Would never pay MSRP</li>
            <li> I love this system my face feels so clean and fresh and tight or firm</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the great reviews.  I dont know which one they were sent, but this unit lasted me all of 1 month before it quit working.  Save your money and get the good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it: I&#x27;m kind of a skeptic. I typically don&#x27;t go out for specialized products of any sort, no matter what they purport to do. But as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I do find myself paying more attention to my skin. I worry about looking older than I already do, with my prematurely grey hair (thanks, Dad!). So when a casual acquaintance mentioned using the Bellapulse system, I started asking questions, and before too long I picked one up for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to go overboard and make promises, but I started seeing results pretty quickly. It took a while to get into the habit of using everything properly, but once I did, I actually did feel... not younger, necessarily, but better. I never realized how much heavier my skin felt before taking off all the accumulated junk that regular life just deposits on your face. I walk around lighter these days, which is something I&#x27;d never have thought I&#x27;d say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this the best product for the job? I don&#x27;t know, and frankly, I don&#x27;t care, because it works for me. I&#x27;m sticking with it, and I recommend it to my friends. If you care about the health of your skin, you should at the very least give Bellapulse an honest try. Live lighter.</li>
            <li> My skin type is normal, not oily and not dry, just dull. The pores on my cheeks are large, I have deep blackheads on my nose and acne scars from experiencing hormonal breakouts. I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties are already is starting to notice smile lines. After reading all the reviews for this product I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I can&#x27;t decipher difference between exfoliating brush and cleansing brush. They both look and feel the same to me. Labeling would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;-Misspelling/Grammatical errors on packaging and products.&lt;br /&gt;-Concerned that the washes and moisturizer are made in China.&lt;br /&gt;- Rose seed wash stinks. Reminds me of a cheap Avon product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I noticed a difference within a week of how my skin felt and looked.&lt;br /&gt;-Water proof, this can be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliating wash and AHA moisturizer was drying the first couple weeks; however, the skin that was underneath was fresh, new and revitalized. I only use the product at night and in the morning I rinse my face with water and rub an ice cube over it so my pores are not open. I think using this product twice a day would be damaging to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Brushes are soft and not abrasive, they do not spin like a Clarisonic. The Bella Pulse gently vibrates but works effectively.&lt;br /&gt;-Shipping was fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I rate this product a 5. It does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I find this stuff to be even more expensive than Proactiv, but the difference is that this facial kit works for me. After the first day that I used it I noticed a difference, I normally feel dry on my face after I wash it. After I washed my face, it didn&#x27;t feel irritated, and I actually felt clean. My first time using it was at nighttime, so I woke up to the acne spots I had previously had, completely minimized, it looked liked they were on there way to being completely gone. So all in all I suffer from way less acne using this, and I&#x27;m going to stick with it.</li>
            <li> The product was great until I went to use, it on the 8th day and the on/off button fell off.  The inside mechanism fell out and I never found it,so now I a product that does not function.</li>
            <li> It was a perfect gift for my wife.</li>
            <li> The tubes were useless but the facial cleaning brushes were pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> Now that I’m getting older I want to take better care of my skin. Bellapulse System’s brush is a soft and gentle brush that pulsates. It gives your face a deep down clean to get your pores unclogged. You can feel the difference immediately. My skin feels fresh and smooth. I have really enjoyed using Bellapulse and have even been using it twice a day because it feels so good. My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Came today and just used it it&#x27;s beyond words. Definitely buy this the limited time extras are great I used the massage head to apply the moisturizer it came with and my skin feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li> Broke after one use. Get what you pay for I guess. The products it came with I really liked too... Bummer. I should have spent the extra money and got the Clarisonic like I really wanted anyway.</li>
            <li> Details are unimportant to seller. I looked and looked and looked for a good deal on a facial brush on Amazon. Came across this product and got excited for no reason. I read the product description several times and couldn&#x27;t find anything about whether or not it was battery powered. I REALLY did not want a battery operated one. I wanted one I could recharge so I wouldn&#x27;t have to fuss with batteries dying and possibly not having fresh ones. I got a rechargeable coffee frother for Christmas for this exact reason. Anyway, I get the product and BOOM! Batteries. DETAILS ARE IMPORTANT! I can&#x27;t understand why sellers don&#x27;t list important details about the product where they are readily available and easy to read. Looking back on the listing there&#x27;s one little sentence &amp;#34;batteries included&amp;#34; that is the only place anything is mentioned about how this product is powered. I don&#x27;t know if this is new in the listing, but I sure didn&#x27;t see it before it was ordered. And after having looked at 20 other products trying to figure out what I wanted, I&#x27;m sure it was very easy to miss two words that you have to scroll 3/4 of the way down to find. I will be returning the product.</li>
            <li> love it. most salons charge 3x as much for this. the cleansing system works awesome , i highly recomend</li>
            <li> For years, I had problems with my makeup feeling like it was caked onto my face. It seemed as if when I applied it, I would have this heavy feeling on my face. It got to the point where I didn’t want to wear makeup anymore, so I let my appearance suffer. I tried a lot of exfoliators with no success. They all left me with a feeling that was far worse than what I expected. It seemed as if my face was on fire. Definitely not smooth and supple like I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving Bellapulse a shot and it was the best move I made. Instead of tearing my skin up, it pulsated the unevenness away and left me feeling clean and clear. It takes a bit to get used to the system, but it is well worth it in the end. You have got to check out this product and experience the difference it can make for your skin.</li>
            <li> Good, but no replacement brushes avaialble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear glasses, but I&#x27;ve heard about how its like using your eyes for the first time when you get the right prescription. I&#x27;ve only recently started taking extra care of my skin, so I wanted to try one of these exfoliating products without breaking my bank in the process. I have to say that I was really impressed with the results for the amount of money it cost me. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exactly like feeling my skin for the first time, but there was certainly a stark contrast before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble is that the process itself feels a bit odd. Not bad really, but the brush bristles seemed a bit softer than I expected when dealing with skin on my face, although it still gets the job done so maybe I just need to adjust my expectations :)  Of course you don&#x27;t want anything harsh, but I just thought they would be a little more stiff.  I suppose that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She’s always wanted one of these, but didn&#x27;t want to drop the $100 + for the designer brand.  She says its annoying to wash her face and then get makeup on the towel after removing her makeup, but she’s too frugal to invest in a nice set. I bought this hoping it would shave some time off her nightly ritual. She says the brush is like a little massage and her face feels so soft. She really enjoys it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small gripe is that the black color seems a little masculine. The little red, green and white stripes and then the black reminds me of a racing car, but that’s just me. I would imagine the client base is primarily female, so the color scheme is a little odd.</li>
            <li> As a child, I used special, doctor-recommended soap because I had dry skin. As I grew older, the problems only got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after trying Bellapulse’s Complete Facial Cleansing System, my long-term problems have been solved! No more itchy, flaky skin! This system is fantastic and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to buy the Bellapulse at a fantastic price.  My Clarisonic Plus died when the warranty ran out and I didn&#x27;t want to buy another one @ $200+ dollars.  The Bellapulse is just as good.  Maybe not as well made---but works beautifully.  For the price, I won&#x27;t mind if it dies when the warranty wears out.</li>
            <li> My medicine cabinet, linen closet, and bathroom drawers are bursting with so many different types of facial creams that it is verging on the ridiculous. These range from the high end to low end with a good deal in between. I have tried La Prairie, Estee Lauder, Oil of Olay, Aubrey, Lancome, etc. I even participated in a paid trial by a local market research company for a line of products that were supposed to take years off your appearance, but alas, none of these products have really yielded spectacular results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always known about the virtues of exfoliating, but never tried anything other than pads on my face. When a friend recommended Bellapulse by SkinPro, I was honestly a little skeptical, but with the special promotion on Amazon, it was well worth a shot. It uses the principle of microdermabrasion, which is a minimally invasive spa procedure that rejuvenates the appearance of the skin by treating sun damage, scarring, wrinkles and other unwanted skin problems. I am not the type of woman who will go to a dermatologist for expensive cosmetic procedures. While I have a healthy dose of vanity, I am about as low maintenance as it gets and rather frugal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not only very pleasantly surprised by the results of this product, but it was quite a bargain. The kit came with the three-piece exfoliating cleanser set and four separate brushes for exfoliating, cleansing, massaging, and applying the cleanser. I love anything with Rose Hip Seed - my face definitely responds to this. I think the big difference with the Pulsar Technology Microdermabrasion Wand is that it thoroughly exfoliated my skin. It took some getting used to, but I cannot imagine going back to my old methods now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really are not going to see any results slathering any creams on your face unless you take off a very thin layer of skin, and this nifty tool does that better than anything I have ever used. My skin looks smoother and my age spots have actually faded tothe point that I don&#x27;t have to use a cosmetic concealer, although I still do. I am a big believer in sharing my product experiences, which is why I write reviews online - whether positive or negative. I hope other women try this product and experience as great results as I have!</li>
            <li> I’m the kind of person that appreciates a good facial cleanser.  I have oily skin in general, so using the Bellapulse system and cleanser set really helped to give my face a refreshing feel without making it too dry.  As a mom that is constantly on the go and worried about sun exposure and wrinkles, this product over a few months seemed to energize my pores and helped my face feel more vibrant.  I have noticed that the clean feeling of other products only lasts about half the day, but using the Bellapulse system keeps my face oil free for the entire day and well into the night.</li>
            <li> I like my Bellapulse, but it did not give thorough instructions on how to use. Had to find instructions on utube which was very hard to find a good video.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for my sister as a gift and one for myself.  Had an issue with one but the seller took care of it immediately.  They work great!  Not the spinning brushes that are hard on skin, but a pulsing motion to stimulate your skin. I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time on my skin care regime so this works great.  Having it in the shower (completely waterproof) forces me to look at it and remind me to wash my face every day.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have oily skin and small breakout problems but this has kept my skin even and clear. Helps with shine as well. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Horrible! Stopped working after a week.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> Love the way this works and makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> Works ok. Not as powerful as I would like. The three facial items that came with it weren&#x27;t great either. But for the price it was ok.</li>
            <li> I already have a facial brush, but the one I have didn&#x27;t come with a &amp;#34;SERUM&amp;#34; brush/sponge .  This brush had great reviews so I purchased it.  BUT what I received wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  I was happy that it came with it&#x27;s own cleansers.  BUT the cleansers dried out my face. I have oily skin, and black heads are my major problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush only vibrates.  It does not move in a circular motion.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling &amp;#34;RENEWED&amp;#34;.  I wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; recommend this to anyone who really wants to get the renewed skin look.  My Olay brush works a lot better for the rejuvenated look I want.  BUT my Olay brush doesn&#x27;t come with something that I can massage my serums and moisturizers with. SO that is the only thing I use this for.  The vibration feels really good while it is massaging the serums and moisturizers into my face.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was a young kid, I have had dry patchy skin. I&#x27;ve tried countless numbers of facial creams and moisturizers to get my skin to feeling soft and have a glow. Now that I&#x27;ve tried bellapulse I finally have the soft skin I&#x27;ve been craving my whole life! It makes my skin feel soft, and clean. I won&#x27;t use another product again, this has actually shown me beautiful, and lasting results! The cleansing brush gets all the dirt and makeup off my face and I always feel fresh after I use it.  I don&#x27;t use any of the other attachments but the cleansing brush is awesome.  Incredible value.  You can&#x27;t find one of these cleansing systems for any cheaper, even on Groupon.</li>
            <li> Bellapulse is a facial cleansing system that uses superior Pulsar Technology. It comprises four distinctive brushes for cleansing, exfoliation, massaging, and product application. Designed to give you a youthful appearance, the system comes with a Lifetime Warranty. The system also includes a storage cradle, a battery pack, and a complete user guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use this product after trying out various products to conceal my acne and wrinkles. Decades of wearing makeup has finally caught up with my skin, resulting in damaged skin. I therefore, resorted to trying varied products in the hope of restoring my skin to its former state-youthful and radiant. Unfortunately, the only thing I ended up doing is spend a considerable amount of money with nothing to show for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bellapulse has not only made me feel younger but also restored my self-confidence. Rather than purchase a cleanser and exfoliating product separately, Bellapulse allows me to experience both under one product. Furthermore, I do not have to spend a considerable amount of money scheduling a massage every now and then. In comparison to other products, Bellapulse adopts technology that cleans my upper skin layer and pores that typically contain makeup residue and dust. The product is a definite must-have.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t spin, it only vibrates, which is the opposite of what I was under the impression of. The cleansers that it comes with don&#x27;t leave my face feeling as clean as my normal cleansers do (I use Clean and Clear). I got this for the promotional price of $25, and if I could go back in time I wouldn&#x27;t buy it. I have used it for a couple of days so far, and the major improvement that I have noticed is that using a bristled brush is better than using a washcloth or hands, but that is about it. The product recommends putting on the moisturizer with the sponge, which is supposed to improve the absorption, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with that. My skin seems a little brighter. I think the cleansing washes smell like plastic, so I will likely switch back to my other face washes and use it with the brush. I bought this instead of the clarisonic, but if you want a deeper clean, I would probably try LoReal Go 360 clean first</li>
            <li> What you get is a complete skin care system consisting of a handle (with batteries) that attaches to the accessories; (1) a hard exfoliating brush that exfoliates the skin; (2) a cleansing brush for routine skin cleansing; (3) a massaging sponge that massages moisturizer into the skin; (4) a massaging applicator that relaxes facial tension and increases circulation and a storage cradle.  The Bellapulse gives my skin a deep, thorough cleaning with its interchangeable heads. I use the exfoliating and cleaning heads to gently scrub the hard to reach places of my skin, while I use the massaging sponge to apply lotions. Afterwards, my face not only looks smooth and younger, but it feels soft and completely clean. The Bellapulse efficiently scrubs all the makeup, dirt, and oil caked in the wrinkles of my skin, leaving my skin looking bright, smooth, clean and healthy,</li>
            <li> My skin is notoriously difficult. Over the years, I’ve tried a couple of different methods and moisturizers, nothing really helped. A friend of my mom’s told me about the Bellapulse Complete Facial Care System. It sends out a sonic pulse to open the pores, exfoliate, and allow the cleansers into the skin. It has three different applicator heads, one for each step—exfoliating, cleansing, and messaging. I got the set, which comes with the cleansers (for a limited time), so I was able to sample them. After a couple days, my skin, usually dry, chapped even, lost the rough first layer. A few days later, I noticed a sort of velvety texture to my skin that felt fresh, as if it was staying cleaner longer. A couple other systems that I tried before, like the Spa Sonic, had smaller applicators or, like the Youthful Advantage Facial Brush, had enormous applicators. This one is just right. Very Goldie Locks. It also looks better to me, the sleek black look of it on my cabinet, very nice. The Bellapulse Complete’s a smooth machine that’s easy to use. I’m happy to recommend it!</li>
            <li> The Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System is what I&#x27;ve been looking for personal facials. Since my budget has no room for expensive facials in a spa, Bellapulse is the only sensible solution, because you really get your money&#x27;s worth. Not only do you get the wand and brush heads but you also get the cleansers.  There is a vibrating wand with four attachments that gently but firmly exfoliate your skin. The results are almost immediate. You can feel it working. Skin is not only clean, but smooth. Your skin feels like it&#x27;s had a professional facial every day. I&#x27;m surprised I hadn&#x27;t heard about it before, because with a combination of oily and dry skin, I&#x27;m always looking for just the right facial products that won&#x27;t leave my skin feeling too dry or too oily. This system comes with everything you need to start a facial cleansing routine, or upgrade one if you&#x27;re doing so already. At this price, my budget is happy, and so is my skin. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new way to clean their face.</li>
            <li> My friends are constantly asking me to join them at the spa for facials but I always say no. I&#x27;ve always found facials to be expensive and abrasive. Plus,  I hate waking up with blemishes and blotches for days after. I&#x27;ve always been now of a soap and water girl.  However, I have to admit that this product caught my eye and made me want to try it. I took a chance and now I&#x27;m so glad I did. Bellapulse has changed my thinking about all of this!  It&#x27;s such an enjoyable experience.  My skin feels so soft,  clearer and younger than it&#x27;s been in years!! Friends are asking me all the time what I&#x27;m doing.  A few have even asked if I have had work done.  And at this price, even better!  I world&#x27;s recommend Bellapulse to anyone who wants to pamper themselves without spending a bundle!</li>
            <li> I’ve used the Clarisonic before and seen mixed results with my fair skin. It could have been my laziness for getting new brush heads for the clarisonic, but when I had the chance to upgrade with this full package I went for it. The Bellapulse goes the extra step with the anti-aging guide and the different types of heads that come with it. I’m seeing a real difference in the look and feel of my face—really a nice deep clean and exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great. I’m glad I took the chance on switching to the bellapulse.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that I could use that was simple but would get the job done. I am new to this whole facial care thing, but with a new job and wanting to try this take better care of myself thing, I thought &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34; I did some research and came across this product, now I am a big fan of doing research before buying a product and right away the idea of it having a lifetime warranty appealed to me. I bought the product and was impressed with the packaging, it was sleek and simple. Now, my skin was not that bad, at least I did not think so, but after I used this product I realized two things. First was that I was doing the face cleaning wrong for a long time now! Next was that I was that my face really did look better after using the product! It felt smoother and softer, and other people definitely noticed the difference! I plan on getting this for my sister and mother as a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> I know all the ads on TV promise to give younger and better looking skin, but I can vouch that this one does. After getting this as a gift, I decided to try it. Best decision I ever made. My spots started to disappear and it even worked on my laugh lines. I think the best thing is all that you get in this kit. You get everything you need so there&#x27;s no reason to buy additional items, unlike other products that I&#x27;ve tried and bought before. It doesn&#x27;t smell, it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, and most of all it works.</li>
            <li> As a guy, skin care is not something I care to discuss with my friends - I&#x27;m not a metrosexual. I work outside a lot, doing light construction on a house I&#x27;m building. Most days I&#x27;m covered in dust and dirt or breathing in enough enamel paint fumes to make me dizzy. Add to that a diet that is pretty much grabbing what&#x27;s handy, and my skin suffers. Being recently back in the dating pool, I want to look good. Part of that is having skin that doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m still stuck back in puberty. After trying various gels and creams I decided to go hi tech and try the Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System. As a tool oriented guy, this suited me just fine. Within ten days or so I started seeing improvement. I also cleaned up my diet and began drinking more water, which also helped. But I&#x27;m convinced that it was Bellapulse that made the real difference. The brushes are easy to use and clean and the whole system is simple to make part of your routine. Once I start something I tend to get obsessive, which worked out just fine for me in this case. My advice is if you decide to use this product, get serious about it - for at least a couple of weeks. Good chance you&#x27;ll see some real improvement.</li>
            <li> As part of a couple&#x27;s agreement, we ordered this to just kind of see what it would do for our skin. We&#x27;re not the oldest (mid 20s) but still figured what the heck. Our expectations were pretty much rock bottom. About a week into treatments, and the difference actually shows. It was a fairly neat novelty at first when the electronic brush didn&#x27;t seem to rub or irritate the skin at all when, in some other product reviews, we hear there&#x27;s an electric buzzing that goes through the affected area. Still, it did its part, and that mixed with the four other brushes to perform exceedingly well and make noticeable differences. All of the bits just kinda came together to push off the dead skin, firm up some forehead wrinkles, actually put a little color in our cheeks, then clean whatever what was left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works exactly was described, works quick, inexpensive for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None as of yet.</li>
            <li> For the price you are going to get something that actually works, I did. I use it as my routine for keeping my face clean. I have scars and tend to get really bad acne, I can honestly say this has been keeping it under control. During the summer I tend to break out a lot and this has been the best summer were I&#x27;ve suffered from minimum acne, and my scars are fading away. I&#x27;ve been using this for 35 days as of today, and these are my results, completely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin clean, smooth and shiny! It moisturizers the skin and revives it. Highly recommended! Met my expectations, great value for money</li>
            <li> It worked well, for two weeks. After that the battery cover wouldn&#x27;t stay on and and the pulse would go on and off. Then after a month it just stopped working all together. Even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> I am a super active person and my whole life is outdoors. I am constantly hiking, running, and going on whatever adventure I can find. And though this has been good for my health, all of this sweat and dirt has been rough on my skin. I have tried most of the basic pads and cleansers for my face, but every morning I wake up with left over residue on my pillow case. I am not the kind of person that will spend $100+ on a cleansing brush.  This is the perfect price point and it includes cleansers, which is a double bonus.  My skin felt so much better just after the first few uses.  I couldn&#x27;t believe what the Bellapulse removed from face that soap and water alone wasn&#x27;t removing.  That&#x27;s disgusting!  Pleased so far, no complaints.  The unit itself does feel a little cheap but for that price, who cares.</li>
            <li> Literally a piece of junk. Horrible build quality, started working intermittently after day two, battery cover would not stay on. None of the electrical components were protected from cleanser and water. The brushes do not rotate at all, they entire unit just vibrates from a cheap off balance motor... I submitted a complaint and before I coukd respond they sent another one to the address I no longer lived at and want me to return it and pay the postage..</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for over a week, now.  I have sensitive, post-menopausal, still slightly t-zone skin.  I live in a very dry climate, year round.  The two cleansing products provide a perfect balance for my needs.  I use the exfoliating cleanser to remove makeup at the end of the day, and the gentile cleanser upon rising in the morning.  The Hyaluronic moisturizer is gentle and perfect to provide long-lasting moisture barrier to the elements.&lt;br /&gt;The pulsar cleanser system makes this facial routine a pleasure to accomplish daily.  The brushes are easy to change out on this cleanser; all internal working parts are sealed, so there is no concern about rust and ensuing break down of  parts, so it will be long lasting.  Since I am married, I actually like the black, it appears more neutral sitting on our sink cabinet, which is next to my husband&#x27;s black mustache trimmer.  The darker color makes it clean up of the product far less of a hassle.  I would highly recommend this product; much more competitively priced than another national brand.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this product works  better than my traditional routine of manual hand washing my face with soap and water. My two favorite things about this product is that it is wireless and &amp;#34;eye safety equipt.&amp;#34; I always hate when i&#x27;m washing my face with soap and water and then the soapy water sometimes gets in my eye. That causes my eye to burn and that burning sensation can last a few hours. The microdermabrasion powered wand is basically a handheld battery powered facial cleanser. The brushes on the wand keep the cleanser grounded into your skin which prevents any water from splashing into your eye. Love it to death!!!&lt;br /&gt;The wireless aspect makes it extremely convenient because i can take it anywhere. My skin does dry up a lot and it gets flakey, which i&#x27;m constantly running into the bathroom at my job to wash my face. Whats worst, sometimes the mens room only has hand soap that can&#x27;t be used on the face. With the bellapulse cleanser i can use it anywhere because of its battery pack that comes with it, and it fits right in my pocket. My face does feel refreshed and my skin looks more brighter after using the bellapulse on a daily basis. Honestly it is worth more than its selling price. It is a great investment for health and convenience reasons.&lt;br /&gt;You also might not believe it when you read the product description, but the rotating spin on the cleansing brushes actually do massage the skin while cleansing. The soothing feeling from the brush leaves a refreshed feeling on the skin. I have sensitive skin but my skin never turns red when using the handheld electronic bellapulse device. The soft brushes are truly genius. I chose this product because of the low cost and my belief in giving new technology a try. I have no complaints, specially with a money-back guarantee. I feel younger because i feel more confident with healthier looking skin and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry up as much as it use too. Convenient hygiene and a sensual pleasure on the skin. iwill never touch a bar of soap again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always outside and having to contend with the elements, especially the sun. I had tried a couple of products that were suppose to help clean and refresh my skin, but they actually added to blemishes, irritating me and leaving blotches! Three things caught my attention with the Bellapulse system: the cleanser had rosehip seeds, which I already knew helped keep skin hydrated and smooth, the moisturizer had hyaluronic acid, another great anti-oxidant, and touted by Dr. Oz (who doesn&#x27;t love Dr. Oz?), and the system was made by SkinPro, which friends and clients had raved about. A month into morning and evening routines, and what a difference – my skin feels clearer, and has a really nice natural glow! The wand is easy to use, and easy on my face, yet still incredibly effective, making sure that there is no residual muck left to clog my pores. The massaging brush is a great bonus to spa therapy at home, and not only does it add to my skin&#x27;s softness, it helps de-stress tension aches in my forehead and along my jaw. The Bellapulse system removes damage and stress, and is a fantastic aide to have in restoring and preserving healthy skin.  The vibration unclogs pores without being too abrasive on my skin.  Really pleased!</li>
            <li> Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System is honestly a decent system for the price.  This system comes with a wand that is used to hold the accessories which exfoliate the skin with a variety of brushes. They go so much deeper than anything you can apply to the skin with your own fingertips. The pulsating brushes deep clean and remove every trace of makeup. My makeup cleanser cloths could never get it all off. I have noticed that my skin is so much softer and smother, I never have dry patches and my pores appear smaller and cleaner. Bellapulse also comes with a soft messaging sponge which applies moisturizer to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are pros and cons to this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are:  The unit is not as durable as I thought it was going to be.&lt;br /&gt;The unit more so vibrates, it does not spin all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are:  The price&lt;br /&gt;The additional brushes and cleansers it comes with for the price.</li>
            <li> I never used a facial cleansing system before so I can&#x27;t compare it.  This unit is easy to use and nice that it is powered by batteries.  I am having problems finding where to purchase brush replacements, so if anyone knows, please let us know.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about an electronic brush to exfoliate my skin.  I always thought it was just a marketing ploy, but after trying it, I&#x27;m glad I did.  !It&#x27;s like switching from a regular toothbrush to an electronic toothbrush: you notice the difference after using it only once! It made my skin so soft and smooth and the cleansers helped clear up my skin.  Using my hands or a washcloth to wash my face was fine and well, but I feel the Bellapulse system is able to do a better job. I never realized how much residue was left on my face before using this.  I also love to exfoliate my the rest of my body at least once a month.  It&#x27;s perfect to use before a spray tan too.  It takes all of the dead skin off and helps the spray tan to last longer.</li>
            <li> Got one during a sale for $25! Not bad right? Well the first unit just stopped working a month in. Batteries tested fine, tried new ones anyways and still nothing. Contacted the manufacturer and they were very nice and sent out a brand new one, no questions asked. Sadly, 2 weeks in a plastic part that holds the handle / battery compartment onto the rest of the unit broke. I never took it off, it just snapped off from use. Now it won&#x27;t work at all because the batteries won&#x27;t stay in place to power it. I was very impressed when it worked, my skin was cleaner and softer right away. I&#x27;m a dude and several people even commented on it, I was really suprised. The samples were great as well. Sadly the quality is just plain bad. I&#x27;ll be upgrading to the Clarisonic soon. Not looking forward to the $150-200 price tag though. Ouch!</li>
            <li> I got this gadget because I noticed that my skin was continuously breaking out.  Although I have only been using it for a month I have started noticing that my face looks a lot healthier. I wish I had gotten this sooner because my pores look smaller and my skin is softer.&lt;br /&gt;I am a minimalist and really  don’t enjoy a long drawn out process for anything and this makes keeping me looking fresh without a big investment in time. Plus this product is more affordable than many of the brands on the market that are similar.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this item is that I have to replace the brushes, which is a necessity, but I guess you do with any device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is waterproof, but based on the other reviews, I don&#x27;t use it in the shower just to be safe.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the batteries or mine quitting or not working.  I keep it right on my counter and just use it at night.  I think using it twice a day would be too much.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the sensitive brush and regular brush, but that&#x27;s ok, this gives me a backup brush.  It is really hard to take off the brushes to swap them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of the sponge to apply serum or makeup is a great idea but since the brush doesn&#x27;t spin, it&#x27;s easier to just use a regular makeup sponge to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost every day for three months now, and I think this is the first time in my life that I&#x27;m completely happy with my skin. I couldn&#x27;t see the difference right away, but I could definitely feel it. After using the cleansing brush, my skin felt perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I learned the system and followed it for a few weeks, I really started to see changes. My blackheads were disappearing and my pores were a lot less visible. Now I just can&#x27;t get over how fresh and young my skin looks every day. So, my advice: give this a try and stick with it for a few weeks. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> There are hundreds of skin treatments out there and I am as confused as anyone about which one gives you the most bang for your buck. I tried this one because it sounds like it gets your skin really CLEAN. Yes it&#x27;s a little pricey but you get professional results, which would cost you a lot more if you went to a dermatologist. It exfoliates better than anything I&#x27;ve used before and once the dead cells are cleared away from the surface of your skin, the new skin is clear and glowing. Plus the moisturizer is worked deep into the skin by those brushes which works wonders for mature skin. And by mature I mean old. I&#x27;m an old crone of 58 but there&#x27;s no law that says I can&#x27;t have gorgeous skin. And the Bellepulse system is the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this product for so many reasons.  When I first set out to find a facial care system, I bought one that completely rotates.  Big mistake.  It cleaned my face alright, but took with it the entire 1st layer of skin, leaving me with nasty \\&quot;road rash.\\&quot;  My skin was red and I couldn&#x27;t apply product or makeup for over a week until it healed.  The Bellapulse brush doesn&#x27;t rotate, it pulsates, so it&#x27;s a much gentler, but effective, cleansing method.  I only use it at night because in the morning my face only needs to be cleansed gently with my fingertips.  Here&#x27;s how I use it:  Every morning I use the sponge attachment to apply my liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem with foundation laying on top of my skin, creating a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; makeup effect.  The Bellapulse helps the foundation to absorb nicely into my skin for a smooth appearance.  I don&#x27;t apply foundation directly to the sponge, I dab it on my face and then use the Bellapulse to blend all over my face.  At night, I first wash my face with cleanser using just my hands.  This is so that I can get most of the makeup off before using my Bellapulse, otherwise my makeup stains the brushes.  Then I apply a small amount of cleanser to the Bellapulse and starting with my forehead, go in a circular motion around my face, spending about 20 seconds in each area, so forehead, right cheek, chin, left cheek and then nose.  Then I apply my moisturizer.  It&#x27;s that easy!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and complete set for your skin. The attachments work well.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was black, sleek and sexxxy!!! LOOOVE the fact that so much stuff comes with the package, making this a GREAT buy.Was disappointed that the brush does not oscillate, but have grown to LOVE it!!! was SHOCKED to discover how much makeup was left on my skin after washing by hand!!! these facial cleansers are a MUST!</li>
            <li> This item only vibrates just a little.  It doesn&#x27;t actually help with cleaning your skin.  I just use it as a manual brush.  Also, the metal battery connector was loose so I had to use a double sided tape to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have used wash cloths for my face and have consistently had breakouts . Then I decided to try the Bellapulse facial cleansing system and I have never felt to smooth and clean in my face. It&#x27;s very gentle and you can feel the pores opening up as you use it on the face. My only problem is that the batteries run out very fast but I am happy with clean and smooth skin.  I like the vibrations because it&#x27;s more gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bellapulse Complete for 3 weeks now and must say that the results are more than I expected! First let me say the package is nice well thought out it&#x27;s not often you take notice of that sort of thing. The first week I used it I noticed the diffrence in my face my pores were more closed and my skin was not as abrasive to the touch of my own hands. The cleanser has a nice smell to it and dosen&#x27;t seem to harsh for the skin beging use so frequently. By the second week my skin was glowing the brush is definetly the secret, it exfoliated my skin evenly and thorough and it removed all traces of dead skin and left it vibrant to the touch this is my third week and i&#x27;m am truly convinced this is the product for me. I would recommend this to anyone who wants thier skin to look fresh and new and to help maintaine and even balance and healthy apperance,</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that helps to rejuvenate my skin, while also cleaning my pores, the Bellapulse cleansing system does that and more. Before I tried Bellapulse, I had tried a few other no name brand brushes like this from TJMaxx and Marshalls, both were very harsh on my skin. I was nervous that Bellapulse would be too.  Within a week my skin was brighter.  Bellapulse removed the dead dull skin.  My foundation went on more smoothly, I had less breakouts and I noticed my face was less oily.  I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other brushes that came along with it other than the exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li> stopped working after a month had to buy a different one. The pad for lotion was falling apart</li>
            <li> great product. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial cleansing brush for about 4 months now, I liked it, the face wash was not working for me at all but the brush was ... until i found out that all i needed WAS the brush and not the vibrating hand held thing at all, i just use the brush now in my hand and my acne has been at bay  ever since</li>
            <li> This is a great skin set from the brushes to the skin products.  I chose this after trying three other brushes at varying prices and this is the only one I truly feel is a good purchase and product for the cost.</li>
            <li> Only used it a short time, but is seems to do the job.  Nice and gentle on the skin.  The moisturizer applicator is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I have had a Clarisonic for years...gave it to a needy daughter and replaced with this one. It is nice for the money. The only thing I have noticed I didn&#x27;t like was how the cleanser stains the brush head. Just &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; deal..looks unclean.</li>
            <li> Just bought it and I have no regrets. Not as good as Clarisonic but for a reasonable price and has the same effect. The exfoliating cleanser  is gentle and what I like it does not smell too much, and all the brushes feel  good and do not scratch my skin. Very useful cause it saves me a lot of time and money and my skin is smooth and clean.  Can’t evaluate its anti-aging effect because I am pretty young but I think it has some lifting effect because when a brush massages my skin I feel like my face is getting an energy boost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice it doesn&#x27;t spin..I thought for all most 50$ it would spin but my face is cleared up nicely so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of these including Olay&#x27;s Pro X and an off brand from TJ Maxx.  The off brand from TJ Maxx was about $30, included no cleansers and is not waterproof.  The Olay system was about $25 or so, is waterproof and includes a very small amount of cleanser. For the price, Bellapulse offers more.  It includes several brushes and sponge attachments and 2 cleansers and a moisturizer.  For the money, it&#x27;s a good product.  The brush doesn&#x27;t spin and there&#x27;s only 1 speed so thats a down fall, but if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the real deal, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> I recently was gifted the Bellapulse after my girlfriend “permanently borrowed” my previous spinbrush (which was pretty basic and about a year old now).  I was not expecting anything this sophisticated as a replacement and was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I have been seeking advice on skincare routines for a preemptive approach to my inevitable aging.  Basically, I now cleanse and moisturize twice daily, and exfoliate once or twice a week.  I’ve done some research and had been using a variety of products to best accomplish each piece of my routine.  However, having used the Bellapulse now (and the products included), I’m getting great results with a very similar routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have found this package addresses a much more complete approach for my skincare.  Having used a more basic spinbrush for a while (and usually for nightly cleansing), I can now take care of my day to day exfoliating, cleansing and moisturizing with one product.  I particularly enjoy how “clean” my face looks after a shower with the cleansing brush/cleanser in the morning!  (By the way, I recommend using a “very warm” vs hot water shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only apparent downside I have found is that the moisture application brush can be a bit messy to operate, took a while to master much moisturizer and pressure to apply while using it.  Use it if you will, but it does feel really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that I will be relying on these brushes for quite a while!  Not sure when replacements would be needed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Bellapulse. I had seen other brush systems advertised, but was hesitant to try them. Bellapulse was available at a great price and I am so glad I gave it a try. The bristles on the brush are soft, but i can feel them working and notice a difference every time i use it. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin and has a great fragrance. If you have been looking for a facial cleaning system, this is the one try.</li>
            <li> It was great for about a month...and it worked well but after that it corroded where the batteries were and would not work anymore. I guess that is what I get for the price. Cleansers and moisturizer was great. I just don&#x27;t like that it lasted me 1 month.</li>
            <li> No dramatic results after weeks.  Maybe good for othes but I sent it back</li>
            <li> Good Service from the Seller, Product it&#x27;s not to bad.</li>
            <li> Bellapulse has the real exfoliating and rejuvenating value. It solved my facial problem within days and I now have an amazingly smooth face.  I had a few breakouts within the first week of using it but it cleared up quickly and then my skin was smoother than ever.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Bellapulse Complete Facial Care System at the recommendation of a friend and because it comes with a free exfoliating cleanser set. I must say that I have found the results to be better than I even expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using the system, here is a noticeable difference in  how my face both looks and feels. My skin is softer, has a healthy glow, and practically free of blemishes and imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other cleansing systems in the past, including ones more expensive than the Bellapulse. However, I did not see the same results even after using them longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the Bellapulse system to anyone who wants to improve the way their face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> About six months ago, for the first time in my life I began experiencing breakouts of acne. I tried various over-the-counter exfoliants, and nothing seemed to work. When a friend who also suffered from acne recommended the BellaPulse to me, I initially was skeptical due to my previous failures with virtually every product I tried. I also have sensitive skin, so the idea of using a brush on my face was immediately off-putting. Still, she insisted that it was the ONLY thing that worked for her and, after using the BellaPulse for over a month, I can say that it is the ONLY thing that has worked for me too.&lt;br /&gt;The Complete Cleansing system comes with interchangeable heads that include a hard exfoliating brush, a cleansing brush, a massaging sponge, and my favorite of all, a “massaging applicator” that is designed to release facial tension. The heads are easy to swap out and durable. After a complete cleansing, my face not only looks younger, but also feels younger. I highly recommended this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I’m so glad that I chose this system over other ones as it is affordable and just as powerful as the bigger brands! I started seeing the difference in my skin after a few days using the bonus cleanser set and their respective brush attachments. The AHA exfoliating cleanser has done wonders for keeping my skin clear, less inflamed, and for healing and diminishing spots on my skin that I could not for the life of me get rid of! The best aspect of this system is the set of brushes (4) which are used for the different cleansers. Not only has this changed how I think about cleansing, but also about product application. The pulsating power of the brush ensures that the product gets as deep as it can into the skin, so I have noticed an improvement in moisture. The icing on the cake is the massaging attachment! Massaging of the face has its roots in ancient Asian wellness tradition, for de-puffing, increasing circulation, and preventing wrinkles. I love using the massager after I get out of a hot shower at night. It is so relaxing! I really love that this system offers a variety of skin care tools, making it useful not only for cleansing, but for an overall skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I always love the way my skin looks after a spa facial, but facials are a luxury in my budget that I can only afford every few months. I had heard some positive reviews about the Bellapulse System so I thought I would give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it eliminate my need for spa facials altogether, but my skin has never looked better. My skin is glowing, my pores are smaller, and my skin is tighter and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My makeup goes on much more smoothly now because of my complexion, but I use the sponge applicator to apply my foundation and it gives me a polished look that looks like I had my makeup airbrushed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention—the massage sponge feels magnificent!</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve had to deal with dry and flaky skin; worst of all on my face. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different moisturizers and exfoliating creams, but nothing really did the trick.  My girlfriend just bought a Bellapulse and I started using it.  I was immediately impressed. It clears out my pores and leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth, while removing the dead skin leaving it smooth with no more flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not typically one to write reviews, but I can say with confidence that the Bellapulse helped clear up my dry skin better than anything else could.</li>
            <li> After spending what seems like a lifetime, and a fortune, trying to find an exfoliation product that truly works for me, I have finally found one in Bellapulse.  Because I have sensitive skin, I always proceed with caution and skepticism whenever I purchase a skin care product, and I generally end up disappointed in the results.  Bellapulse was a refreshingly pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a myriad of different products, including very expensive mail-order creams, exfoliants and cleansing systems that made promises that they did not live up to.  Bellapulse is the only product I have tried that has truly delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit apprehensive about using brushes on my skin, but my apprehension quickly disappeared after using them.  Much to my delight, my skin felt and looked like it did 10 years ago.  The exfoliating and cleansing brushes gave my skin a healthy glow, so much so that I do not even need to use foundation anymore.  I simply use the product application brush to apply a light layer of beauty balm and I am good to go.  The massage brush provides a relaxing, pampering experience that is better than what I could get at any spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word “microdermabrasion” can be intimidating, but the Advanced Pulsar Technology Microdermabrasion Power Wand could not be more user-friendly.  It fits nicely and comfortably into your hand and is simple and easy to use.  No learning curve involved with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a lifetime warranty, a money-back guarantee and the limited time bonus offer of a three-piece exfoliating cleanser set and hyaluronic acid moisturizer, I really couldn’t go wrong in giving Bellapulse a try.  I am so glad that I did.  My skin has never felt or looked smoother, cleaner or healthier.  They say you get what you pay for, and Bellapulse is definitely money well-spent.</li>
            <li> If you want healthy, smooth, bump-free skin, then you have to start taking care of it by washing and exfoliating at least once a day. Old makeup accumulates in pores, blocks them, and collects oils which cause blemishes and bumps to appear in the skin. Washing your skin in the morning and before bed can prevent these bumps and blemishes from forming, but I wanted to ensure I was giving myself a quality wash to prevent these inconsistencies in my skin from reforming. I knew a washcloth would not give me the quality results I was looking for so I started using the Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleaning System.&lt;br /&gt; Within weeks I noticed a difference in the way my skin looked and felt. My experience washing with a washcloth helped clear up my skin, but at times my skin felt old makeup and dirt on my face, even though I had just washed it. The Bellapulse gives my skin a deep, thorough clean with its interchangeable heads. I use the exfoliating and cleaning heads to gently scrub the hard to reach places of my skin, while I use the massaging sponge to apply lotions. Afterwards, my face not only looks smooth and younger, but it feels soft and completely clean. The Bellapulse efficiently scrubs all the makeup, dirt, and oil caked in the wrinkles of my skin, leaving my skin looking bright and smooth. Most importantly, the Bellapulse keeps my skin clean and healthy, unlike my washcloth and scrubbers I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt; I have found that pressing too hard or overusing the exfoliating and cleaning heads can cause minor irritation, so I only use them once a day. However, this is just from my experience, and if you need to use the brushes more than once a day, do it. Falling short of cleaning your skin every day builds up of makeup, dirt, and oils that cause majority of skin imperfections. With the Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleaning System, you will receive an unparalleled quality to professional skin care that will keep your skin looking young, smooth, and most importantly, healthy.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with my skin. It never mattered what products I used because they never seemed to do anything for me. Every time I ordered something new, it felt like I was throwing money away. I was looking for something that was going to solve my skin problems. After doing a search online, I came across the Bellapulse Complete Facial Care System and figured I would give it a shot after I read the positive reviews on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using Bellapulse, my skin feels and looks different. Not only is my skin softer, but it has a radiant glow to it all the time. Imperfections and blemishes are now a thing of the past. I am glad I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Luckily my face has never been severely problematic, but I never really grew out of acne and within the past few years I started getting a couple of dry patches that never seemed to go away. I&#x27;ve tried a few different facial care regimens over the years, but never really stuck to anything since it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. Why bother if it doesn&#x27;t work, right? In any case, I never felt like my face was getting as clean as I wanted it to, so I decided to give this a try. The Bellapulse system really makes my face feel like it&#x27;s been thoroughly cleansed and is just really refreshing. The skin on my face doesn&#x27;t feel randomly irritated anymore, and my complexion just has gotten smoother overall. It feels nice, too, so it encourages me to relax my face after it being tensed up all day. I&#x27;m lucky to have youthful skin, and I have doubts that Bellapulse will help keep it that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase so far. No issues with it working. I just popped the batteries in and turned it on. It took me a few minutes to try and figure out how to take off the brush head to put on another one but it just twists off. I was afraid of twisting too hard and breaking it, but now I can swap them out with ease. I really like the Rose Hip Seed cleanser. It smells amazing. I plan to re-order the cleansers. FYI: I have regular to oily skin so I actually use this twice a day.</li>
            <li> I like this brush.  It is my first one; the brushes don&#x27;t rotate, only vibrate so it&#x27;s better on the skin.</li>
            <li> I got the Bellapulse for the limited time price of $30 (including shipping). For that price it&#x27;s worth it, considering all that&#x27;s included. It made my face both feel and look noticeably cleaner. Everything put together easily, and it fits well in the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to pop the heads off and change them out. Though the massaging head was a bit harder to get off than the rest, it still wasn&#x27;t difficult. I&#x27;ve seen some people comment that they couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the cleaning brush and the exfoliating brush. I could tell the difference, but it did seem negligible to me. That&#x27;s fine with me, since using only one at a time would make the brush system last longer. All the brushes felt as firm but soft as I like them, since they feel like they&#x27;re cleaning without hurting the skin. The sponge brush put the moisturizer on smoothly and evenly, and it did feel like it was going deeper than moisturizers typically do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cleansers go, I like them well enough. They cleaned well and I actually needed less than the recommended amount to clean my face thoroughly, so I see them lasting a long while. I have almost literally no sense of smell, though, and I was still a little put off by the rosehip cleanser scent. There was some weird smell in it that lasted about a second. It was gone before I even washed it off, so again it doesn&#x27;t matter to me, but it might to some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to contact customer service, but the shipping was also very quick. The packaging was nice and looked professional. Every service I experienced was nice and prompt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a reflection on the product itself but I&#x27;m still going to make note of it: in looking up reviews for this system, I saw more than one duplicate multi-paragraph review on different personal blogs. That, along with the very steep discount on Amazon did make me wonder at how legitimate a product it is. I decided it was worth it because of the multiple headsand the cleansing system. Both of those things would hike the price up past $30 in my opinion, so it seemed like a worthy gamble. And it was. Although I just got it, for $30 it was worth it. I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it, though, and probably wouldn&#x27;t even care to replace the brushes later on (I&#x27;m not even sure how you do that unless you opt into their loyalty program to buy new ones on a scheduled date). It&#x27;s just a good value for what it&#x27;s at right now, because it&#x27;s low enough that you can recognize the craftsmanship without caring about the flaws. If it were the original $229, I would care  a lot more about almost-identical brush heads, weird-smelling cleansers, and not being able to replace the brushes as easily as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Good skin care has always been important to me, but it wasn’t until recently that I started thinking about preventative skin care, too. Sun and environmental exposure over the years have made me want to not only take care of but heal and repair my skin, and the Bellapulse has become my go-to tool to keep everything healthy and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating brush is harder than the rest, so using it too frequently caused a bit of irritation. For me, that wasn’t the attachment for daily use. The cleansing brush is perfect for irritable skin, though, and it always gets every bit of dirt and makeup off. Since I’ve started using the Bellapulse System, I’ve noticed a visible difference in how healthy my skin looks, and how clean it feels. Plus, the massaging head is always a great little treat for those days when I want just a bit more pampering!&lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard good things about other skin care systems, but for the price and with everything you get, I haven’t found anything yet that beats the Bellapulse System.</li>
            <li> With one cleansing, everything came together for me &amp; Bellapulse’s Deep Cleanser Skin Care remedy. My everyday cosmetic routine consists of a soft blush only, therefore immaculate looking skin is fundamentally essential.  After deep cleansing with my new Bellapulse, my skin feels soft, radiantly clean and detoxified from both internal and external excesses.  This routine exercise is not only thoroughly cleansing but just doing it reminds me of how much care must go into being the best I can be.</li>
            <li> The brush stopped working after only the third or fourth use.  I went and bought a new face brush by Olay that can be purchased in just about any store with a facial cleanser aisle (probably on Amazon too).  This is the type of brush I had prior to ordering this Bellapulse one, and it lasted for over two years before it quit working.  With the new replacement Olay brush, I still decided to continue the use of the cleansers/moisturizer that came with this Bellapulse set, but I was really unimpressed with that, as well.  The cleansing system created a lot of &amp;#34;irritation-based&amp;#34; acne that cleared up as soon as I discontinued use, and I do not have what you would consider to be sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> At first, I never heard of the product known as Bellapulse Complete Facial Cleansing System, until I overheard a co -worker talking about it on our lunch break. I have always admired her beautiful skin that just seemed so flawless and I always knew she had a &amp;#34;beauty regime&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t know what she used until she recommended this product! I was shocked to find out how affordable it was and that it pays for itself with just a few uses at max, although I noticed a difference in my first use. I bought the product and have been using it for well over 8 months now. I have seen a major improvement in both my skins complexion (my pores are smaller), decreased blemishes less red spots and texture of my skin. I very happy with the product and I would HIGHLY recommend it to a friend for use and as a gift! The Bella pulse Complete Facial Cleansing System, is so much more convenient to use then spend all that time and money. You can take it with you on the go or do your treatment at home.After more research, I&#x27;ve learned that the company manufactures other skin care products so I am going to look for a few other products to work in synergy with this one.</li>
            <li> The unit falls apart when using it, so I have asked for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Have used this for over a month with improvement on skin tone and texture. First I remove my makeup with a hydrating cream cleanser then use this with my normal facial foaming cleanser. Can&#x27;t tell you how surprise I am every time I use this. The Bellapulse picks up remaining makeup I didn&#x27;t know I had leftover from my makeup removal even when I thought my skin was clean! I love this device. Just note to use gentle circular motions on the face, don&#x27;t press hard or else the sonic will not be able to cleanse the skin properly. Currently use it at bedtime with nighttime skin regime.</li>
            <li> Everything and more..that&#x27;s what all woman want!.I love the way Bellapulse exfoliates gently. My husband noticed right away how much softer my face is now that I&#x27;m using the Bellapulse system. It&#x27;s a must have beauty tool...no matter your age. I like purchasing from the Bellapulse home site since shipments can be customized.  I missed out on this system twice, but because I&#x27;m an auto-ship customer, Skin Pro allowed me  one. All the Skin Pro products are USA made..a plus for me. I love them all and most certainly will continue with my skin regimen.Thanks! PS: Using the Skin Pro website gets you freebies too!</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast delivery.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would</li>
            <li> I love this Bellapulse! It has really helped my complexion in the four weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. It has helped me stick to a routine that I wasn&#x27;t always so good at adhering to. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to see improvement in their complexion.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night. I feel cleaner and that all of the dirt and make up has been removed versus just washing my face. Plus it exfoliates AND massages. I also like that it offers a cradle for easier storage or set up on my vanity.  I just keep it tucked away in its cradle in the corner.  This device does feel a little less durable than others I use, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  For the price it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> The design is flawed - water enters the battery compartment so easily! This leads to rusting. You have to take the batteries out after every use and make sure everything is very dry, which is a hassle. I didn&#x27;t realize how much water was in mine until rust had already formed. Now when I turn it on I have to thump it to get it running. I do not know if this is because of the water/rust or another problem. I like its pulse and it leaves my skin feeling great, but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again because of the water issues.</li>
            <li> Seems like a nice quality brush. It only vibrates though, it doesnt also rotate. But thats OK.  Products dont make me break out.</li>
            <li> So, I originally bought this for my sister for her birthday.  She is very into her beauty regiment, and definitely loves her high-end products.  I, on the other hand, can barely tell concealer from foundation (and I’m still not 100%).  I did some research, and this came back with generally positive reviews. So I decided to try it out.  I LOVE it! I actually thought I broke it when I dropped it in the tub the first time I used it (oops!).  Turns out, it’s waterproof, which totally saved me.  As for the moisturizer and cleanser aspect of it, it’s pretty spot-on with my complexion.  I have combination skin (or so my sister tells me), so I have oily spots and dry spots.  This moisturizer makes my skin look all even without having a hot greasy mess on my face- even I can tell the difference!After I used my sister’s set, I went out and bought her one.  She loves it, too!  She uses it to help tackle some of her acne, and I can definitely see the difference with this set.  Even with different skin types, we both got pretty great results.  Worth every penny, and then some.</li>
