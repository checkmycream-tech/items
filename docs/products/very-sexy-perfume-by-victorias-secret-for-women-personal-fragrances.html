            <li> I am a bit embarrassed to say it&#x27;s Victoria&#x27;s Secret!</li>

            <li> I get my Very Sexy perfume from Victoria&#x27;s Secert at my mall.  I thought, I would give this a try.  It&#x27;s the same for a lot less.  I will be ordering again.  No hassle driving, looking for parking and wasting gas,... it comes right to my house. leaving extra money in my account. :)</li>
