            <li>It smells amazing on me, though, and it adjusts to your body chemistry.</li>
            <li>so i was delighted when I got more.  </li>
            <li>Normally, Truth by Calvin Klein for women is one of the very best fragances in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Not this time.  </li>
            <li>So glad that someone still carries my favorite perfume!  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best perfume I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>This time, it&#x27;s the lily which is amplified on my skin, becoming cloying, sweet, &amp; headache-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, Truth is a superb scent &amp; very under-rated, imo.</li>
            <li>Still searching for the next perfect fragrance to replace this discontinued one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the newer Euphoria or CK one.</li>
            <li>Love most Calvin Klein fragrances and this one is one of them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to locate it again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic fragrance and the price can&#x27;t be beat!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more so have on hand when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li>all my friend s love it</li>
            <li>She loves it and it is her favorite.</li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon still sells it because It isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find Truth by Calvin Kline.  </li>
            <li>That had been my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>She has gotten many complements on it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume Calvin Klein truth</li>
            <li>Calvin Klein is just overall awesome</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s satisfied ,so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to find this perfume again on Amazon, it was like meeting an old friend:)</li>
            <li>Very good value for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but, i think it&#x27;s a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase, no regrets,  </li>
            <li>Honestly, someone says something positive about this scent almost every time I wear it and</li>
            <li>, I think Truth would be fabulous as an office scent in the winter.</li>
            <li>there to my wondering eyes was the product and it was available.  </li>
            <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li>It has a clean topnote and stays with you for hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft and lovely fragrance that gets many compliments.</li>
            <li>It smells very clean, with a greenish floral tone in the beginning, and as it dries down it starts to blend with your own skin chemistry!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most perfumes give me a headache and smell too much like chemicals.</li>
            <li>We count on Amazon to provide the best price and they usually do!  </li>
            <li>All of CK scents are heavy and sexy, and I just simply love them and sniff myself all day when I wear it:)</li>
            <li>and I am happy to say that I found it at half the price on Amazon as opposed to Perfumania at the North Bend Mall.</li>
            <li>It was all I expected it to be: a smooth fragrance, perfect for a lady which is at the same time modest and elegant.</li>
            <li>I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
            <li>Absolutely the same I used to have for years, my favorite!</li>
            <li>There is something about the white florals in many of the CKs that just doesn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li>Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Hard to find item, great price, reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li>Rather, Truth is for those who like classic scents but want something more modern &amp; up-to-date, even a bit atypical and off-center yet not jarring and demanding.</li>
            <li>It was lost during delivery and Amazon shipped back free of charge.</li>
            <li>Very floral and feminine.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Also, if you ever tried and like the scents from Bath and Body Works, Water Blossom Ivy or Green Clover &amp; Aloe and are looking for a long lasting perfume that replicates these scents, you will find it in the beautiful \\&quot;Truth\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>My order came quickly and as soon as I opened the bottle, I felt like I was back on the cruise.  </li>
            <li>It has a deep, strong woodsy floral smell (one squirt is enough for me).  </li>
            <li>is definitely the good stuff , Just remember to buy at least two bottles for her at a time.</li>
            <li>I still have quite a bit of the bottle she gave me left, but when I heard they discontinued it, I ordered another large one.</li>
            <li>Complex &amp; interesting</li>
            <li>However, I have had co-workers and even complete strangers compliment me on the perfume, asking what it is and where they can buy it.  </li>
            <li>I really hope CK brings this one back.  </li>
            <li>My daughter requests this every year as 20 year old now.</li>
            <li>It is neither too light nor too heavy and can be worn in winter, fall, spring, or summer.  </li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and long lasting, I get compliments every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>On the one hand, it&#x27;s a bright green floral; on the other, it&#x27;s a deep woody oriental.</li>
            <li>It is a large amount of high quality fragrance for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>Its not too loud and not too subtle either.&lt;br /&gt;Its been my signature fragrance for so many years</li>
            <li>And again, it&#x27;s a light scent and not very strong--clean and warm--and soft enough to be worn in a medical office.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too heavy and sweet for my liking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you are looking for a fresh, slightly woody, clean scent that has a delicate sweetness to it!</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts until I can find something else I like as much, which will be hard since I&#x27;m very picky.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a floral scent but more of a musky scent which I am very grateful for because I hate the floral scents.  </li>
            <li> It is subtle and &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; for a mature, young woman.</li>
            <li> This is a rather light fragrance that has unfortunately been discontinued by Calvin Klein.  </li>
            <li> and I had been wanting some for a long time.</li>
            <li> This perfume lasts a long time and I always get comments and people ask what the name of it is.  </li>
            <li> Last year my mom gave me half a bottle of this because she didn&#x27;t like it on her.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when it&#x27;s no longer available :(</li>
            <li> And so for years I thought Truth was not available anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I wear Truth everyday.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I could no longer purchase it at department stores, and thought I&#x27;d never be able to wear my \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; again.  </li>
            <li> So sad it&#x27;s discontinued, but it&#x27;s still possible to find here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for the past 12+ years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming and overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, Truth is another in a long line of CK fragrances that I like but can&#x27;t wear.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s Truth, even if it is a pretentious name.</li>
            <li> I have to wear very small puff.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to discover recently that it had been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> but when I found it here, it was a home run, and it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as I though it would be.</li>
            <li> and I was quite sad when I could no longer purchase it in the department stores.  </li>
            <li> Calvin Klein&#x27;s Truth is difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too bad.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to find this perfume again on Amazon, it was like meeting an old friend:) Absolutely the same I used to have for years, my favorite! I was so upset when it was discontinued. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> So glad that someone still carries my favorite perfume!  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when it&#x27;s no longer available :(</li>

            <li> I almost cried in the department store when they told me this had been discontinued.  It is by far the best perfume I have ever worn.  It has a deep, strong woodsy floral smell (one squirt is enough for me).  I really hope CK brings this one back.  It&#x27;s much better than the newer Euphoria or CK one.</li>
            <li> This was a great price and I had been wanting some for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this partum as a gift to my wife. It was lost during delivery and Amazon shipped back free of charge. Even though it is a discontinued fragrance my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts about 5-8 hours!&lt;br /&gt;NOT overpowering!&lt;br /&gt;COMPLIMENTS GALORE!&lt;br /&gt;YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!&lt;br /&gt;If you were wondering if you should get it..&lt;br /&gt;THE ANSWER IS YES!&lt;br /&gt;Buy 2 of them!</li>
            <li> So sad it&#x27;s discontinued, but it&#x27;s still possible to find here. Love most Calvin Klein fragrances and this one is one of them. Very floral and feminine. All of CK scents are heavy and sexy, and I just simply love them and sniff myself all day when I wear it:)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a gift and she loves it.  I would like to have gotten her a larger size but upon my research I discovered that this product has been discontinued. That&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!! I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to locate it again but when I found it here, it was a home run, and it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as I though it would be. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Truth\\&quot; is I love this perfume!! It smells very clean, with a greenish floral tone in the beginning, and as it dries down it starts to blend with your own skin chemistry! I highly recommend it if you are looking for a fresh, slightly woody, clean scent that has a delicate sweetness to it! Also, if you ever tried and like the scents from Bath and Body Works, Water Blossom Ivy or Green Clover &amp; Aloe and are looking for a long lasting perfume that replicates these scents, you will find it in the beautiful \\&quot;Truth\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> We were on an Alaskan cruise for our 25th anniversary in 2001 and my husband bought this for me at the gift shop.  We both loved it!  I was disappointed to discover recently that it had been discontinued.  Fortunately I was able to find it on Amazon.  My order came quickly and as soon as I opened the bottle, I felt like I was back on the cruise.  It&#x27;s a fantastic fragrance and the price can&#x27;t be beat!  ($75 in stores back then!)  I&#x27;ll buy more so have on hand when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> I thought the women&#x27;s fragrance would be as seductive as the men&#x27;s version but I was not too happy with it. It&#x27;s way too heavy and sweet for my liking. The package was shipped on time though so no issues with the seller.</li>
            <li> Always loved the fragrance. Its not too loud and not too subtle either.&lt;br /&gt;Its been my signature fragrance for so many years and I am happy to say that I found it at half the price on Amazon as opposed to Perfumania at the North Bend Mall.</li>
            <li> My daughter requests this every year as 20 year old now. It is subtle and &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; for a mature, young woman.</li>
            <li> Normally, Truth by Calvin Klein for women is one of the very best fragances in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Not this time.  It does not smell the same as it use to.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and great service!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a Christmas present to my mother. It was all I expected it to be: a smooth fragrance, perfect for a lady which is at the same time modest and elegant.</li>
            <li> myn ex boyfriend introduced me to this perfume and so i bought it. its good and smells really good all my friend s love it</li>
            <li> I adore this scent. It is neither too light nor too heavy and can be worn in winter, fall, spring, or summer.  It has a clean topnote and stays with you for hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume for my wife for our anniversary.  She loves it and it is her favorite. Being a guy, I don&#x27;t know a lot about perfumes but this perfume  does smell great.. Very good value for such a quality product. I am glad Amazon still sells it because It isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the good stuff , Just remember to buy at least two bottles for her at a time.

            <li> &#x27;smells great&#x27; That was what my gf&#x27;s mother said. She is very picky with perfumes and this is one of the few that she likes.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find Truth by Calvin Kline.  That had been my favorite fragrance and I was quite sad when I could no longer purchase it in the department stores.  And so for years I thought Truth was not available anywhere.  Just recently I checked Amazon.com and there to my wondering eyes was the product and it was available.  I am so delighted to have found it.  I wear Truth everyday.  Thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy F.&lt;br /&gt;Wilmington, DE</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother in law.. and she loved it.. Its a really great perfume and smells great..</li>
            <li> Definitely a great fragrance to wear.  I am so happy with this purchase, no regrets,  The scent is mild and long lasting, I get compliments every time I use it.  The packaging was excellent, and delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for the past 12+ years.  I heard it was being discontinued so i was delighted when I got more.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It smells good but, i think it&#x27;s a bit too strong for me. I have to wear very small puff.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for selling it!  I know it&#x27;s hard to find.  I love the scent.  It&#x27;s not overwhelming and overpowering.  It&#x27;s not a floral scent but more of a musky scent which I am very grateful for because I hate the floral scents.  This perfume lasts a long time and I always get comments and people ask what the name of it is.  I hope Amazon never stops selling it because they have a permanent buyer for it...me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at best price! We count on Amazon to provide the best price and they usually do!  Love Calvin Klein perfumes too!</li>
            <li> The only perfume my sister will wear.  She has gotten many complements on it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item, great price, reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li> Last year my mom gave me half a bottle of this because she didn&#x27;t like it on her. It smells amazing on me, though, and it adjusts to your body chemistry. I still have quite a bit of the bottle she gave me left, but when I heard they discontinued it, I ordered another large one. I hope it lasts until I can find something else I like as much, which will be hard since I&#x27;m very picky. Most perfumes give me a headache and smell too much like chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume Calvin Klein truth I always order by Amazon I always get compliments how good iT smells On me I order me two bottles I was very satisfied with my order</li>
            <li> Still glad I can get my favorite perfume, and at a great price!</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein is just overall awesome</li>
            <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it!  It is a large amount of high quality fragrance for such a low price.  Does not appear to be a knock off.</li>
            <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend who couldn&#x27;t find it in her area. She&#x27;s satisfied ,so I&#x27;m satisfied. We&#x27;re both happy.</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein&#x27;s Truth is difficult to find.  I was very disappointed when I could no longer purchase it at department stores, and thought I&#x27;d never be able to wear my \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; again.  It&#x27;s a soft and lovely fragrance that gets many compliments.</li>
            <li> I was told years ago that this product was discontinued. On a whim, I did a search on Amazon. Boy was I surprised. This fragrance is my all time favorite. I am so happy to have found it again. Thanks Amazon!</li>
