            <li>..went to go buy more of this..</li>

            <li>Pretty good stuff</li>
            <li>Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s bi-racial hair and my single racial hair.</li>
            <li>Such an incredible value.</li>
            <li>This is one of the MOST important things about this product.</li>
            <li>good product for price, thanks........</li>
            <li>and I need something much more rich to condition them.</li>
            <li>That and plenty of chemical free super filtrated water (Berky) are keeping my long blond locks in great condition!</li>
            <li>I ended up having to CUT OUT two huge chunks of hair.</li>
            <li>Good value for a natural brand shampoo.</li>
            <li>actually makes my scalp feel clean.smells great and not bad for 7bucks</li>
            <li>This product de tangles my thick hair with so much ease, which is very important to maintain healthy beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo my family uses, never going back to top brands, I&#x27;ve converted my sister to it too, lol</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love Renpure shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Fresh fragrance and softer hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I tried many different shampoos and conditioners from Renpure line.  </li>
            <li>That rotation is working really well for me!</li>
            <li>Renpure Aragan Shampoo and Conditioner are my hands down favorite shampoo of all time!</li>
            <li>He has curly hair that is being rescued from being incredibly damaged, long curly dark locks.</li>
            <li>my dry, damaged, kinky hair is now soft with beautiful curls partly (a big partly) in thanks to this product!</li>
            <li>At first, I thought this conditioner wasn&#x27;t doing anything much to moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much Renpure!</li>
            <li>It used to be greasy-dandruff at the top, dry damaged frizzy curls at the bottom.</li>
            <li>My dandruff is gone, my scalp is never itchy, and my hair is super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased this conditioner to use as a cowash since my hair is very curly and drys out easily</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself is fine, nothing to write home about, but does the basic job of conditioning/detangling hair after a shampoo.</li>
            <li>But I believe this product helps with nourishing the hair and helping my hair not look as damaged as it really is, PLUS</li>
            <li>I color my hair and I am exposed to the salt water almost daily and this product keeps it soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Also made my wavy hair super frizzy, so basically the opposite of what Argan Oil is supposed to do...  </li>
            <li>But the scent seems to have been changed - not nearly as spicy and clean smelling anymore.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed that my hair was much more tangled than usual after using this product, and it was dryer and frizzier at the ends but greasier at the roots.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have fine, limp hair, and a ton of it.</li>
            <li>my hair is natural (kinky/ curly)</li>
            <li>SOFT.</li>
            <li>I am protein sensitive and the coconut oil eventually dries my hair out.</li>
            <li>I emailed Renpure and they wrote back offering to refund my $7.29 (which does absolutely nothing to compensate for the fact that I now have two sections of hair that are two feet shorter than the rest of my hair)</li>
            <li>this is a natural product.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh or toxic chemicals and has a simple formula.</li>
            <li>After using this and the argan shampoo for a bit, his hair never looks greasy, his dandruff is gone, and his curls are thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have straight long hair</li>
            <li>Love that it is not full of parabens and other nasties.</li>
            <li>All of them left our scalps dried out and very itchy after the first couple of times we started using these products.</li>
            <li>I have never used a conditioner that left my hair so soft for so long.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You only need a small amount so the large bottle is a bargain and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> , i deserve shiny, soft hair just like every other woman!&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li> It is not as softening as conditioners full of garbage chemicals, but I will trade perfection for not dousing my body with unhealthy chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I am generally a purist when it comes to hair (wash every other day or less, coconut oil treatments, only choose products that are absolutely free of toxins, no hairspray or other products usually, etc).</li>
            <li> I have thin, wavy hair, hers is super curly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several weeks ago in hopes of giving some life to my long, curly, frequently dry hair.</li>
            <li> but if I use it too much it makes my hair hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this stuff is crap and being marketed to a feel good demographic.</li>
            <li> I still prefer their &amp;#34;Amazing Miracle&amp;#34; because my ends are dry</li>
            <li> Adding on to my previous review -- Despite the changed smell, my teenage son says nothing has worked as well for his long ringlet-curl hair.</li>
            <li> He has been using this only for a few weeks</li>
            <li> , when a conditioner is advertising &amp;#34;gluten free&amp;#34; on the front label, it is obvious they are trying way too hard to market to a gullible target audience who are ignorant enough to follow trends mindlessly.  </li>
            <li> It feels slightly thicker as well, compared to other conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> shiny, without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> my curly hair is less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair and scalp</li>
            <li> My hair never looks greasy or dried out.  </li>
            <li> Conditions without leaving it limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> :wavy hair likes the everyday moisture this provides when I use this as my co-wash.</li>
            <li> Too bad - the old one was part of the appeal.  </li>
            <li> Common sense should tell us that.  </li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo/conditioner combo when my sister said she didn&#x27;t like it (she has very heavy water and its difficult for her to find products that work)</li>
            <li> This stuff is thin and runny, like the cheapest conditioner you can get in the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exposing myself (or my septic system) to chemicals unnecessarily, and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Once a week or less in winter, I will use a shampoo without sulfate or all the other nasty stuff to prevent build up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a mediocre conditioner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m an idiot and kept using it and within a week, my hair was developing DREADLOCKS.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my hair is natural (kinky/ curly) This product de tangles my thick hair with so much ease, which is very important to maintain healthy beautiful hair.  This is a great addition to my healthy hair regimen</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this conditioner wasn&#x27;t doing anything much to moisturize my hair.  Now, I suspect that this is actually drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> i have been using this conditioner for years now. it&#x27;s hands-down my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;i have fine, limp hair, and a ton of it. i have to wash it every day because product and oil weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;however, i deserve shiny, soft hair just like every other woman!&lt;br /&gt;after trying EVERYTHING, this is my fail-safe. shiny, without weighing my hair down. SOFT.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!  That&#x27;s all I can say. Love this product!!!! Smells wonderful too</li>
            <li> My hair has been transformed, even my picky husband loves it! This is the only shampoo my family uses, never going back to top brands, I&#x27;ve converted my sister to it too, lol</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell that I had to get used to!</li>
            <li> Good value for a natural brand shampoo. I still prefer their &amp;#34;Amazing Miracle&amp;#34; because my ends are dry and I need something much more rich to condition them. But this is a good staple item for the household, and the large pump bottle is convenient and great value.

            <li> Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s bi-racial hair and my single racial hair. I have thin, wavy hair, hers is super curly. We are both happy - doesn&#x27;t leave a coating, I can use it as a leave in for her (but not for me).</li>

Also made my wavy hair super frizzy, so basically the opposite of what Argan Oil is supposed to do...  Just buy Suave, you&#x27;ll get the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when a conditioner is advertising &amp;#34;gluten free&amp;#34; on the front label, it is obvious they are trying way too hard to market to a gullible target audience who are ignorant enough to follow trends mindlessly.  Unless there is a market for people to drink conditioner and need to avoid gluten?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff is crap and being marketed to a feel good demographic.</li>
            <li> Renpure Aragan Shampoo and Conditioner are my hands down favorite shampoo of all time! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a hear and my hair has never been healthier. I color my hair and I am exposed to the salt water almost daily and this product keeps it soft, shiny and healthy. My stylist said I am doing &amp;#34;something right&amp;#34; and I give the credit to Renpure. I love it! You only need a small amount so the large bottle is a bargain and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair and scalp so I had to send it back</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, great value for the performance.  I add a couple of dissolved biotin pills to the bottle to encourage hair growth.  Love that it is not full of parabens and other nasties.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this. It&#x27;s just a mediocre conditioner. I would rather have Pantene or Loreal. I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I have never used a conditioner that left my hair so soft for so long. It feels slightly thicker as well, compared to other conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo/conditioner combo when my sister said she didn&#x27;t like it (she has very heavy water and its difficult for her to find products that work), I loved it the first time I used it. I am generally a purist when it comes to hair (wash every other day or less, coconut oil treatments, only choose products that are absolutely free of toxins, no hairspray or other products usually, etc). My boyfriend consequently is the same. He has curly hair that is being rescued from being incredibly damaged, long curly dark locks. He has been using this only for a few weeks and we LOVE the results! I have straight long hair so I only use this about once a week and switch between Andalou, Jason and Alba according to mine and my hair&#x27;s mood. That rotation is working really well for me! That and plenty of chemical free super filtrated water (Berky) are keeping my long blond locks in great condition! Namaste!!</li>
            <li> I am livid. I purchased this product several weeks ago in hopes of giving some life to my long, curly, frequently dry hair. I immediately noticed that my hair was much more tangled than usual after using this product, and it was dryer and frizzier at the ends but greasier at the roots. Unfortunately I&#x27;m an idiot and kept using it and within a week, my hair was developing DREADLOCKS. I ended up having to CUT OUT two huge chunks of hair. I have never, in my entire life, had this happen. I discontinued use of the product and switched back to DevaCurl products (which are much more expensive) have not had the same issue since. I emailed Renpure and they wrote back offering to refund my $7.29 (which does absolutely nothing to compensate for the fact that I now have two sections of hair that are two feet shorter than the rest of my hair) and I replied back giving them the information they requested and I have not heard from them since.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, I will be buying more. My hair is so much more &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; - no fly-aways or frizz. Also, I feel good knowing I&#x27;m not exposing myself (or my septic system) to chemicals unnecessarily, and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. Quality product by a quality company.</li>
            <li> I love Renpure -the smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite, but I love how it smells on the hair after washing! Shine comparable to Aveda and cannot beat the &amp;#34;no animal testing or cruelty&amp;#34; stance. This is one of the MOST important things about this product. Plus, made in the USA and safe to use on color-treated hair... oh, and CHEAP! I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Fresh fragrance and softer hair.  Nothing is going to erase all the damage we do to our hair with coloring, highlighting, blow drying, straightening, curling etc...  Common sense should tell us that.  But I believe this product helps with nourishing the hair and helping my hair not look as damaged as it really is, PLUS this is a natural product.  Better for our hair and the environment, not tested on animals.  My hair never looks greasy or dried out.  I will keep buying both the shampoo and the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner that I have ever used. I actually quit using shampoo and starting washing my hair with this....my dry, damaged, kinky hair is now soft with beautiful curls partly (a big partly) in thanks to this product! I love it!!</li>
            <li> Works well for curly hair. Conditions without leaving it limp and greasy. But the scent seems to have been changed - not nearly as spicy and clean smelling anymore. More perfumey. Too bad - the old one was part of the appeal.  Update:  Adding on to my previous review -- Despite the changed smell, my teenage son says nothing has worked as well for his long ringlet-curl hair. It used to be greasy-dandruff at the top, dry damaged frizzy curls at the bottom. After using this and the argan shampoo for a bit, his hair never looks greasy, his dandruff is gone, and his curls are thick and healthy. He says nothing else will do. When I condition my own curly hair, I use this too, and it does work well.</li>
            <li> For the price and the amount, this bottle of conditioner is a steal. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh or toxic chemicals and has a simple formula.</li>
            <li> Definitely a customer for life. My dandruff is gone, my scalp is never itchy, and my hair is super soft and shiny. Thanks so much Renpure!</li>
            <li> good product for price, thanks........</li>
            <li> Love Argan Oil shampoo - great price.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I love this product.  My husband started using it and loves it as well.  Does make a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this conditioner to use as a cowash since my hair is very curly and drys out easily I don&#x27;t use shampoos.it actually makes my scalp feel clean.smells great and not bad for 7bucks</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff my curly hair is less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love this it smells so good..went to go buy more of this..</li>
            <li> I like this. It is not as softening as conditioners full of garbage chemicals, but I will trade perfection for not dousing my body with unhealthy chemicals.  This is the best option that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> My Curly:wavy hair likes the everyday moisture this provides when I use this as my co-wash. Once a week or less in winter, I will use a shampoo without sulfate or all the other nasty stuff to prevent build up.</li>
