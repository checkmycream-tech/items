            <li>I am in direct sales, they are the perfect size for the product &amp; 1 inch stickers on top.</li>
            <li>Plastic was very cheap</li>
            <li>Cute and just what I needed</li>
            <li>They are more than 1/16&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Theses are fantastic truly!</li>
            <li>but in 20 to 30 gram. :)</li>
            <li>these were perfect for putting tiny beads in to make art and craft kits for kids</li>
            <li>Love them for DIY lip balm.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>Will order again  :)</li>
            <li>Over all I am satisfied because I was able to use all the containers :)</li>
            <li>Perfect tiny size for my Rodan+Fields serum capsules to put in mini-facial freebies.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I need a lot more.</li>
            <li>but I need to read more of the details and specs before ordering.</li>
            <li>Being a manager of a medical spa, I have been looking for the perfect size and quality jars for client samples.  </li>
            <li>Would buy again if I needed more.</li>
            <li>If you just want cheap storage containers, they are OK.</li>
            <li>Most of them do stay secure and serve their purpose.</li>
            <li>I ordered more right away!</li>
            <li>For my purposes these containers are fine.</li>
            <li>They work just fine, but I do have a couple of complaints.</li>
            <li>If appearance is important to you, they may not be.</li>
            <li>They are 1 1/16 &amp;#34; across and do not measure up to fit my labels or my needs.  </li>
            <li>and i found the lids and bottoms to fit well</li>
            <li>My customers enjoy getting to try it out before they buy.</li>
            <li>Very much needed :)</li>
            <li>height: 5/8&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I can use them, but not as I&#x27;d originally hoped.</li>
            <li>If you want product containers with a good appearance and of a specific size, you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Overall good.  </li>
            <li>Great value, nice solid little screw top containers.</li>
            <li>Other than that great deal.</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Makes my samples look super professional and best part is I can write on it with a sharpie, unlike other plastic containers where sharpie ink smears off</li>
            <li>Very durable and easy to label.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and was looking for!</li>
            <li>Great little container</li>
            <li>I use them for distributing samples of my skincare products so they were just the right size.</li>
            <li>They are just the right size for candle wax samples.</li>
            <li>Great little plastic containers!  </li>
            <li>These work great for the small samples that I give out.</li>
            <li>Durable and very decent for the price!</li>
            <li>This size actually works better for me, but if you need them for product containers, this could be a problem.</li>
            <li>These came exactly like posted in photo</li>
            <li>i was given exactly 50 tops and 50 bottoms.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to find this exact thing</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was</li>
            <li>Very helpful for many different things.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and lightning fast shipping‼️</li>
            <li>but I did find a good use for them.&lt;br /&gt;Think of a small lip gloss sampler.</li>
            <li>Easy to open and close and holds quite a bit of lip balm!</li>
            <li>they were too large for the bottoms.</li>
            <li>As others mentioned, they are not as large as specified.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t fit the same way into my storage boxes as a result.</li>
            <li>The lids fit well in the bottoms and only one was cracked.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I cannot put as many beads in them as I could in the other containers, so if you are using them for sales, you should be cautious to ensure they hold the amount you expect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously ordered these from DayBeauty and was satisfied with the quality of the jars.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Love this little containers.</li>
            <li>a few would of been ok.</li>
            <li>See through container allows easy visual distribution to a group and holds enough for one application.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a way of assuring that the sellers who attach themselves to another listing are really selling the same item.</li>
            <li>A must-have for those professional presentations.</li>
            <li>The screw lids fit very tightly, and they are professional looking without being glass.</li>
            <li>These are small (I would say 15ml wet, and 2 tsp dry) and are great for multiple uses.  </li>
            <li>Much stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li>Many were broken when I received them.</li>
            <li>Half of them were kind of hard to get unscrewed</li>
            <li>Had a hard time getting the lids to fit the containers properly and struggled to get them on!</li>
            <li>Had more than several broken when arrived</li>
            <li>A few I gave up on...but not a great loss as the cost was good for the number of containers.</li>

            <li> A few I gave up on...but not a great loss as the cost was good for the number of containers.</li>
            <li> Half my bag had cracks in the containers I grabbed a few off the top to show but was bummed when opening the package and half of them look like that</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure how small these guys are, they are very small.</li>
            <li> They were shipped loose in a bag (tops are not attached).</li>
            <li> The jars are slightly different -- a little smaller in diameter and also less tall, and I also feel the lids don&#x27;t seat as snugly.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> The containers are usable, but not not what I expected to receive</li>
            <li> They were exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> The only problem I encountered was that some of the lids were not easy to unscrew...</li>
            <li> During shipping they rub against each other and by the time I received them, every container had some abrasion marks.</li>
            <li> As expected!</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that I had 4 defective lids.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t found any broken ones so far but a lot of scratches and some of the lids don&#x27;t tighten.</li>
            <li> But half is alot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little wider around than a quarter and about 1/2 inch tall.</li>
            <li> These small sample containers worked well for the salve I made.</li>
            <li> I used them for small set screws from 0-80 up through 6-32.  </li>
            <li> While small, you can get 25 set screws in them with no issues,</li>
            <li> It bit small for what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Lip gloss, glitter powder, small pills, spices, seed beads.  </li>
            <li> I received 49 and half of another that was broken.</li>
            <li> The plastic is thick and rigid, it would survive drops to the floor and even someone stepping on it without problems.</li>
            <li> I had one broken lid.</li>
            <li> Some of them come loose, but for the price I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I must have clicked on the wrong size.</li>
            <li> The lids are difficult to screw on, which is concerning when housing liquid or powder cosmetics.</li>

            <li> my only complaint is that I had 4 defective lids. they were too large for the bottoms.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be a little bigger but I did find a good use for them.&lt;br /&gt;Think of a small lip gloss sampler.</li>
            <li> Are the containers airtight?</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price.  Not the greatest quality but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Smaller than listing indicates.&lt;br /&gt;actual diameter: 1 3/16&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;actual height: 5/8&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I can use them, but not as I&#x27;d originally hoped.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time getting the lids to fit the containers properly and struggled to get them on!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and lightning fast shipping‼️</li>
            <li> These small sample containers worked well for the salve I made. The only problem I encountered was that some of the lids were not easy to unscrew...they were off the track and I had to play around with them to get them opened. A few I gave up on...but not a great loss as the cost was good for the number of containers.</li>
            <li> Our expectations were exceeded.</li>
            <li> Cute and just what I needed</li>
            <li> As advertised and perfect for my use.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and the price was great!</li>
            <li> I use these for lip balm containers and they work great</li>
            <li> good quality, excellent value! Makes my samples look super professional and best part is I can write on it with a sharpie, unlike other plastic containers where sharpie ink smears off</li>
            <li> Great little plastic containers!  We used these for DIY lip balm.  These were the perfect size.</li>
            <li> For my purposes these containers are fine. If appearance is important to you, they may not be. They were shipped loose in a bag (tops are not attached). During shipping they rub against each other and by the time I received them, every container had some abrasion marks. I received 50 bottoms, but only 49 tops. As others mentioned, they are not as large as specified. They are more than 1/16&amp;#34; smaller in diameter and close to 1/8&amp;#34; shorter than specified. This size actually works better for me, but if you need them for product containers, this could be a problem. If you just want cheap storage containers, they are OK. If you want product containers with a good appearance and of a specific size, you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> As expected! Great shipping</li>
            <li> These are great for lip balms. Half of them were kind of hard to get unscrewed but I finally realized you just put your nail in between and pop it off. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Theses are fantastic truly! Thank you</li>
            <li> These work great for the small samples that I give out.</li>
            <li> Just the correct size to put my 2 sample bulbs of serum in to give to my prospective customers.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for what I needed.  My only issue is when I received them,  there were several that were cracked.</li>
            <li> They were supposed to be 1 1/4&amp;#34; across.  They are 1 1/16 &amp;#34; across and do not measure up to fit my labels or my needs.  Will need to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Thank you.  These came exactly like posted in photo an I do appreciate the i was given exactly 50 tops and 50 bottoms.  These are perfect for my Skincare samples.  I will definitely order again when I run out as well as refer to others.</li>
            <li> I wanted to rate this because I read mixed rating on it and i found the lids and bottoms to fit well, none were broken.&lt;br /&gt;these are perfect for skin cream samples that I give out.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect product but I must have clicked on the wrong size. I am trying to find this exact thing but in 20 to 30 gram. :)</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my need.</li>
            <li> these were perfect for putting tiny beads in to make art and craft kits for kids</li>
            <li> Some had cracks... check before filling liquid! Other than that great deal. Love them for DIY lip balm.</li>
            <li> the diameter was smaller than listed, and the majority of what I received were scratched. haven&#x27;t found any broken ones so far but a lot of scratches and some of the lids don&#x27;t tighten.</li>
            <li> Love this little containers. Very helpful for many different things.</li>
            <li> Great containers! Easy to open and close and holds quite a bit of lip balm! I use these for samples and people love them!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for shipping cosmetic and skincare samples to customers. Love them!</li>
            <li> These were great. I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> These were some of the cheaper containers on amazon but they did not all match up or close correctly. A couple were even cracked</li>
            <li> These were the perfect size for what I needed. Package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Many were broken when I received them. Plastic was very cheap</li>
            <li> Great value, nice solid little screw top containers. Much stronger than I expected. I used them for small set screws from 0-80 up through 6-32.  While small, you can get 25 set screws in them with no issues, even the 6-32&#x27;s and 6-40&#x27;s. The plastic is thick and rigid, it would survive drops to the floor and even someone stepping on it without problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously ordered these from DayBeauty and was satisfied with the quality of the jars. The last time I ordered they came from CrazyCity, a different supplier in the same listing. The jars are slightly different -- a little smaller in diameter and also less tall, and I also feel the lids don&#x27;t seat as snugly. I don&#x27;t use these for cosmetics, but for jewelry findings and beads. I cannot put as many beads in them as I could in the other containers, so if you are using them for sales, you should be cautious to ensure they hold the amount you expect. The containers are usable, but not not what I expected to receive and they don&#x27;t fit the same way into my storage boxes as a result. I plan to reorder, but will order from DayBeauty in the future. I wish there was a way of assuring that the sellers who attach themselves to another listing are really selling the same item. I guess that is what reviews are for.</li>
            <li> Love these. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure how small these guys are, they are very small. It&#x27;s a little wider around than a quarter and about 1/2 inch tall. Perfect for inexpensive samplers. I will be using them for lip balms and lotions. The threading is good to ensure no leakages.</li>
            <li> The containers were perfect. I use them for distributing samples of my skincare products so they were just the right size.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my lotion samples! I ordered more right away!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great quality and great price! I sell cosmetics and needed these for samples and they are the perfect size. Will order again  :)</li>
            <li> Some people&#x27;s reviews said that there were missing or unmatched containers but all mine arrived well matched and not broken, even though I could understand why some would be broken as they are only shipped in a cheap plastic bag. Over all I am satisfied because I was able to use all the containers :)</li>
            <li> just as stated.  Great little container</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my mini-facials for a skin care line. The lids fit well in the bottoms and only one was cracked. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Worked well to sample out my lotion.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Perfect tiny size for my Rodan+Fields serum capsules to put in mini-facial freebies.</li>
            <li> Half my bag had cracks in the containers I grabbed a few off the top to show but was bummed when opening the package and half of them look like that a few would of been ok. But half is alot.</li>
            <li> I love them. They are just the right size for candle wax samples. I need a lot more. Ty</li>
            <li> Great for putting samples of whatever in it!! Durable and very decent for the price!</li>
            <li> Perfect for sharing my toothpaste and cream samples! The labeled that I piggybacked onto this order are perfect fit as well. I received 49 and half of another that was broken. So I will give 4stars for that.. For the price, I couldn&#x27;t complain! Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipment!! Just what I was needing!</li>
            <li> 5 gram is the perfect size for beauty samples.  Very durable and easy to label.  Would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It bit small for what I was looking for but I need to read more of the details and specs before ordering.</li>
            <li> They were exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> I use these to make samples. I am in direct sales, they are the perfect size for the product &amp; 1 inch stickers on top.</li>
            <li> Had more than several broken when arrived</li>
            <li> Being a manager of a medical spa, I have been looking for the perfect size and quality jars for client samples.  I found these and they are just perfect.  I will order these again!</li>
            <li> I use these for work and they are PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I purchased these containers to give cosmetic samples in. They work just fine, but I do have a couple of complaints. The lids are difficult to screw on, which is concerning when housing liquid or powder cosmetics. Also, mine arrived all scratched up, which is not the look I was going for when giving to potential customers. I probably will not purchase these items again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs, will be ordering again I am sure. Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and was looking for! Quick service, good price!</li>
            <li> Some of them come loose, but for the price I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Most of them do stay secure and serve their purpose. Would buy again if I needed more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was I was looking for in size and quality and value.  These are small (I would say 15ml wet, and 2 tsp dry) and are great for multiple uses.  Lip gloss, glitter powder, small pills, spices, seed beads.  The screw lids fit very tightly, and they are professional looking without being glass.</li>
            <li> They exacly what I order. Perfect. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great!!! Very much needed :)</li>
            <li> These have worked perfectly for my Scentsy hand crème samples. My customers enjoy getting to try it out before they buy. I&#x27;ve actually ordered 3 packs and will continue to do business with this customer.</li>
            <li> Great for preparing samples ahead of time without product getting squished. See through container allows easy visual distribution to a group and holds enough for one application. A must-have for those professional presentations.</li>
            <li> These work perfect for makeup samples for my business!!!</li>
            <li> Overall good.  I had one broken lid.</li>
            <li> great for my lip balms</li>
