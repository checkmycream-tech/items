            <li>I have not found anything more effective in a non-aluminum deodorant and this even beats the aluminum Dove I used to use!!</li>
            <li>Seller is good.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I however love love love it!!!</li>
            <li>Smell is very very potent.  </li>
            <li>Works OKAY, smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells good but not that effective.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, smells nice.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Will be buying again for sure!</li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li>However, deodorant is especially useful for when one does work out.</li>
            <li>and I also both liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, didn&#x27;t get a rash, but found the deodorant to be ineffective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be trying another kind.</li>
            <li>i use this kind of deodorant if i have to use it.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and fresh, and feels good to put on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it, but the next time I will probably try the well reviewed Silver Shield roll-on which may be more effective, unscented, and easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 17 Feb 2013&lt;</li>
            <li>Pump spray does not use carbons in the air, pleasent citrus smell, not over powering and works with most colognes and perfumes, aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;Helps eliminate under arm odors by preventing baterial growth, does not clog pores.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing and earthy scent.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this at Longs but they no longer have it so was glad to find it online.  </li>
            <li>It is better than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and have always been pleased with their products.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear, effective, and no rash.</li>
            <li>you wont be dissapointed :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting more and more concerned about the toxins we use on our bodies.  </li>
            <li>Thsi works ok.  </li>
            <li>More below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is okay</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>So this seems to be the next best thing.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>but I do love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>It acts more like a perfume.  </li>
            <li>I am reviewing these appropriately on how they help eliminate the stink.  </li>
            <li>This one is ok.  </li>
            <li>So glad my Sister told me about this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried many &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and they all cause skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>A couple hours at most</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, no sting, not stickiness, not weird smells, just clean all day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need an antiperspirant or strong deodorant, and this is very effective all day, if not longer.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild nice scent.  </li>
            <li>Great, and natural, product.</li>
            <li>Great natural alternative.</li>
            <li>Very potent....and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t rival popular aromas of Axe or Brut or what have you, but it&#x27;s pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>It quickly turns to a strong herbal sage smell, which I like, but it may be more appropriate for men then women.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They smell great, much better than commercial ones.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use,</li>
            <li>and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Sprays on easy, easy to reapply.</li>
            <li>I can easily see how some people might need to reapply at mid-day, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a non-aerosol spray deodorant with a strong sage scent.  </li>
            <li>I found the smell of this deodorant too strong and manly.  </li>
            <li>I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>I use five sprays and then rub it in to be sure I have full coverage and penetration.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant works fine when my wife isn&#x27;t working out.</li>
            <li>As someone who earns a living sitting in front of a computer, this deodorant spray works just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m fine using this spray since I don&#x27;t tend to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>I think I felt more fresh that night than I ever have with a chemical antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>I am still BO free.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and smells earthy/citrusy as you would expect from the sage and lemon oil mix.</li>
            <li>I pair it with an all-natural odor free deodorant to use under-arm.</li>
            <li>Did not keep either of us odor free all day.  </li>
            <li>We are odor free</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell even after light exercise.</li>
            <li>Works great, but after days of continuous use I get the occasional pit pimple.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use many of them, but this one is not one I&#x27;d buy again, more&#x27;s the pity as I would love to be able to use aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m on the search again for a good natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love using this right before an outdoor activity because the scent reminds me that it is working to fight odor --</li>
            <li>The smell is stronger, but it has an appealing lime undertone, and it is very gentle on the pits.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t necessarily give you that all-day protection from stinky pits, but it&#x27;s a good product, and it&#x27;s easy to refresh if you go out after work...</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this....</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH TRYING!</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant enough when applied.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, plus all natural!</li>
            <li>Works well for odor control, not as good as the mainstream commercial products</li>
            <li>The only deodorant that makes me feel good.  </li>
            <li>But, sweating gets rid of toxins and using the regular antiperspirant/deodorant isn&#x27;t good for you anyways because of all the harmful ingredients used in them.  </li>
            <li>I only have to apply once in the morning, 4 sprays each pit, and I&#x27;m good to go for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>If you liked the smell too, but you found the product ineffective, Old Spice&#x27;s Fresher Collection &amp;#34;Citron&amp;#34; deodorant could work for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly...while I don&#x27;t believe in male and female scents...I do think that what smells good on one person does not smell good on another person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a full 24 hours still no smell.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more of a strong, herbal, masculine scent, but I&#x27;m a woman</li>
            <li>Came quick.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t particularly have stronger odor than most people.</li>
            <li>This was fantastic the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>But if it is a very hot summer&#x27;s day, I suggest throwing it in your bag to reapply at points throughout the day.</li>
            <li>First off, it works!</li>
            <li>It is easy to throw in my purse or diaper bag when I plan to be away from the house for several hours and want to make sure I have added protection close by.</li>
            <li>(A little more citrus would be nice.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I also teach elementary music part-time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for your body.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product for people who can not wear regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>This work well, does not make my skin break out and smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used antiperspirant for years and am always searching for an effective, gentle, natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>To me, the solid crystal rock is still the best, but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li>That being said, it is still better than and lasts longer than the MANY other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I originally got this spray because I wanted to avoid aluminum and aluminum like substances in modern deodorant.</li>
            <li>However, as is true to most all-natural deodorants, it does not last all day.</li>
            <li>no mess, I like the spray and it smells pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li>The smell didn&#x27;t bother me until I attended a parents club meeting at my son&#x27;s school and felt self conscious that the scent of the deodorant may have been strong as I was sitting in a cramped space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of about 3-4 ingredients, it smells VERY much like outdoors/ bug spray.  </li>
            <li>at first.  </li>
            <li>I do mostly office work, and one day while interviewing potential applicants I could smell myself.  </li>
            <li>I tried it out for four more days, but it simply did not work anymore.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are better probably for your overall health.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle worked well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusions:  I will most likely buy this Burt&#x27;s Bees deodorant again.  </li>
            <li>Smelled great but didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>first bottle of Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, but ok.  </li>
            <li>I did not think I would find anything that would keep more dry and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>does have a scent that is very woodsy and some (most) people associate that with men or male scents.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shower daily and find this does a good job when re-applying the next day.</li>
            <li>I have found the scent wears off after a while but leaves you with clean, dry NON-SMELLY pits for a whole day!!!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it had a mild antiseptic mouthwash smell and Not the bug spray smell that another reviewer posted.  </li>
            <li>Definitely smells strongly of herbs.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong initial alcohol smell (and, yes, insecticide)</li>
            <li>Which would explain why it is largely ineffective.</li>
            <li>Yes, It certainly would not spread fragrance</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own natural smells, but this helps and keeps you dry.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m editing this last part a little while later to say that I tried the Crystalux herbal deodorant, and it&#x27;s AWESOME.</li>
            <li>I could go all day without an odor, then....not so much.  </li>
            <li>This has lasted me through intense workouts and runs in 82 degree weather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past.</li>
            <li>I actually really like the woodsy, earthy smell</li>
            <li>I was very underwhelmed by this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>How ever, much to my surprise it does work very well and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>A hair dryer helps, it is very watery.  </li>
            <li>Really keeps bacterial growth at bay.</li>
            <li>So I cant really make a review.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant really keeps the odors at bay.</li>
            <li>It works and is nice as adjunct to Vichy French deodorant since I like to alternate on occasion.</li>
            <li>its herbal and natural!!!</li>
            <li>I do love Berts Bees and will stick with their other products</li>
            <li>As of the end of August, there were very few even potentially good natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li>and I most definitely started getting BO stink only a couple hours after application.</li>
            <li>A decent, all-natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>All natural no aluminum ingredients!!</li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Deodorant wouldn&#x27;t use any other!!</li>
            <li>My husband even teases me at times that I don&#x27;t sweat like a normal person.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for long and had a funny smell at first.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s not laden with chemicals, that alone is worth the extra spray if it&#x27;s required.</li>
            <li>Tried a few other natural deodorants, eh, not so great.</li>
            <li>works pretty well in winter and spring/fall, definitely not a product for high heat or summer</li>
            <li>Within an hour I&#x27;m able to smell my own natural odor, and like other low-star reviewers I noticed that this product smells worse when I&#x27;m perspiring than if I hadn&#x27;t applied it at all.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of the Right Guard aerosol spray deodorant my mom used to buy for the house when I was growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  (1) I felt like I needed to apply this 3 times a day to stay odor free on warm early fall day --</li>
            <li>Better than the other natural deodorant that I got with the same order.</li>
            <li>For the first week or two it seemed to work as a deodorant, and I didn&#x27;t have the residue from my old commercial deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using regular deodorants (not natural)in the past, but I couldn&#x27;t even handle my own smell.  </li>
            <li>I figured out the \\&quot;herby\\&quot; smell, it smells like old spice or something, very masculine.</li>
            <li>I recently reverted back to some classic Old Spice deodorant (anti-perspirant free), and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  </li>
            <li>The spray had a drying property that made me feel dry right after applying it.  </li>
            <li>The search for a natural deodorant continues.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li>I works quite well for a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a number of these natural deodorants, including this one.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give natural deodorant a try and turned to Burt&#x27;s Bees of course.  </li>
            <li>I have an almost six month old baby at home, so you can imagine I don&#x27;t just sit around all day.  </li>
            <li>So far no irritation, been using about a month now.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is all natural and aluminum-free.</li>
            <li>- I was worried it would be too masculine</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s natural and it</li>
            <li>It can be sprayed directly over skin with no rashes, itching and blacking at all.</li>
            <li>early morning, lunch time and evening to get through the night.  </li>
            <li>Wish this came in a travel size since it does require frequent reapplication....</li>
            <li>I bought these the end of November, so I could use each of them for a reasonable amount of time under different circumstances.    </li>
            <li>Surprised at how ineffective this one was because of the minerals.</li>
            <li>but as soon as a pressure situation arises you&#x27;ll be smelling your natural body odor.</li>
            <li>Since sweating if your body&#x27;s natural way of getting rid of toxins, this spray is meant to neutralize odor, not stop you from perspiring.</li>
            <li>I had been using an aluminum crystal deodorant, which was very effective, but I always washed it off with soap after work (which is a hassle) because I&#x27;m afraid of the toxic</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, at the end of the day I can definitely feel its effect fading away, especially during these hot summer days.</li>
            <li>The other times I used it there was no stinging at all because I didn&#x27;t apply it right after showering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My brand new work shirt has giant oil stains anywhere the deodorant touched.</li>
            <li>Dries fairly fast so you&#x27;re not waiting for your pits to dry like</li>
            <li>I prefer to use natural products when possible, but for the longest time, I could not find a natural deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li>This product, like so many aspects of life, is really quite mediocre.</li>
            <li>I can sweat pretty heavily, and this week I put my new deodorant to the test.  </li>
            <li>and I put my shirt on last to give it a chance to dry first.  </li>
            <li>Not well enough to stop my search for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Only natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li>Pretty average.</li>
            <li>but they apparently did not consider their customers.</li>
            <li>As great as it was the first few days was as bad as it was then.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one of those superhumans who endeavors to push their exertion boundaries such as;  mowing a lawn or washing a car, perhaps briefly walking through the neighborhood, this will completely render the deodorant&#x27;s odor suppression effectiveness to zero.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, this great smelling deodorant comes in an aluminum bottle and defeats the purpose of avoiding aluminum :(</li>
            <li>This stuff is simply not worth the cost, and doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>

            <li> I have not found anything more effective in a non-aluminum deodorant and this even beats the aluminum Dove I used to use!!</li>
            <li> Seller is good.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I however love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> Smell is very very potent.  </li>
            <li> Works OKAY, smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not that effective.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Will be buying again for sure!</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> However, deodorant is especially useful for when one does work out.</li>
            <li> and I also both liked the smell.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell, didn&#x27;t get a rash, but found the deodorant to be ineffective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying another kind.</li>
            <li> i use this kind of deodorant if i have to use it.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and fresh, and feels good to put on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it, but the next time I will probably try the well reviewed Silver Shield roll-on which may be more effective, unscented, and easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 17 Feb 2013&lt;</li>
            <li> Pump spray does not use carbons in the air, pleasent citrus smell, not over powering and works with most colognes and perfumes, aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;Helps eliminate under arm odors by preventing baterial growth, does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a refreshing and earthy scent.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Longs but they no longer have it so was glad to find it online.  </li>
            <li> It is better than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and have always been pleased with their products.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear, effective, and no rash.</li>
            <li> you wont be dissapointed :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting more and more concerned about the toxins we use on our bodies.  </li>
            <li> Thsi works ok.  </li>
            <li> More below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is okay</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> So this seems to be the next best thing.</li>
            <li> but I love it</li>
            <li> but I do love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> It acts more like a perfume.  </li>
            <li> I am reviewing these appropriately on how they help eliminate the stink.  </li>
            <li> This one is ok.  </li>
            <li> So glad my Sister told me about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and they all cause skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> A couple hours at most</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, no sting, not stickiness, not weird smells, just clean all day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need an antiperspirant or strong deodorant, and this is very effective all day, if not longer.  </li>
            <li> It has a mild nice scent.  </li>
            <li> Great, and natural, product.</li>
            <li> Great natural alternative.</li>
            <li> Very potent....and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t rival popular aromas of Axe or Brut or what have you, but it&#x27;s pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> It quickly turns to a strong herbal sage smell, which I like, but it may be more appropriate for men then women.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They smell great, much better than commercial ones.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use,</li>
            <li> and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Sprays on easy, easy to reapply.</li>
            <li> I can easily see how some people might need to reapply at mid-day, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a non-aerosol spray deodorant with a strong sage scent.  </li>
            <li> I found the smell of this deodorant too strong and manly.  </li>
            <li> I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I use five sprays and then rub it in to be sure I have full coverage and penetration.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant works fine when my wife isn&#x27;t working out.</li>
            <li> As someone who earns a living sitting in front of a computer, this deodorant spray works just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m fine using this spray since I don&#x27;t tend to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I think I felt more fresh that night than I ever have with a chemical antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> I am still BO free.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and smells earthy/citrusy as you would expect from the sage and lemon oil mix.</li>
            <li> I pair it with an all-natural odor free deodorant to use under-arm.</li>
            <li> Did not keep either of us odor free all day.  </li>
            <li> We are odor free</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell even after light exercise.</li>
            <li> Works great, but after days of continuous use I get the occasional pit pimple.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use many of them, but this one is not one I&#x27;d buy again, more&#x27;s the pity as I would love to be able to use aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m on the search again for a good natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love using this right before an outdoor activity because the scent reminds me that it is working to fight odor --</li>
            <li> The smell is stronger, but it has an appealing lime undertone, and it is very gentle on the pits.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t necessarily give you that all-day protection from stinky pits, but it&#x27;s a good product, and it&#x27;s easy to refresh if you go out after work...</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this....</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH TRYING!</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant enough when applied.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, plus all natural!</li>
            <li> Works well for odor control, not as good as the mainstream commercial products</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that makes me feel good.  </li>
            <li> But, sweating gets rid of toxins and using the regular antiperspirant/deodorant isn&#x27;t good for you anyways because of all the harmful ingredients used in them.  </li>
            <li> I only have to apply once in the morning, 4 sprays each pit, and I&#x27;m good to go for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> If you liked the smell too, but you found the product ineffective, Old Spice&#x27;s Fresher Collection &amp;#34;Citron&amp;#34; deodorant could work for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly...while I don&#x27;t believe in male and female scents...I do think that what smells good on one person does not smell good on another person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a full 24 hours still no smell.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more of a strong, herbal, masculine scent, but I&#x27;m a woman</li>
            <li> Came quick.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t particularly have stronger odor than most people.</li>
            <li> This was fantastic the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> But if it is a very hot summer&#x27;s day, I suggest throwing it in your bag to reapply at points throughout the day.</li>
            <li> First off, it works!</li>
            <li> It is easy to throw in my purse or diaper bag when I plan to be away from the house for several hours and want to make sure I have added protection close by.</li>
            <li> (A little more citrus would be nice.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I also teach elementary music part-time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for your body.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product for people who can not wear regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> This work well, does not make my skin break out and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used antiperspirant for years and am always searching for an effective, gentle, natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> This one is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li> To me, the solid crystal rock is still the best, but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is still better than and lasts longer than the MANY other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I originally got this spray because I wanted to avoid aluminum and aluminum like substances in modern deodorant.</li>
            <li> However, as is true to most all-natural deodorants, it does not last all day.</li>
            <li> no mess, I like the spray and it smells pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t bother me until I attended a parents club meeting at my son&#x27;s school and felt self conscious that the scent of the deodorant may have been strong as I was sitting in a cramped space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of about 3-4 ingredients, it smells VERY much like outdoors/ bug spray.  </li>
            <li> at first.  </li>
            <li> I do mostly office work, and one day while interviewing potential applicants I could smell myself.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out for four more days, but it simply did not work anymore.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are better probably for your overall health.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle worked well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusions:  I will most likely buy this Burt&#x27;s Bees deodorant again.  </li>
            <li> Smelled great but didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> first bottle of Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong, but ok.  </li>
            <li> I did not think I would find anything that would keep more dry and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> does have a scent that is very woodsy and some (most) people associate that with men or male scents.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shower daily and find this does a good job when re-applying the next day.</li>
            <li> I have found the scent wears off after a while but leaves you with clean, dry NON-SMELLY pits for a whole day!!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it had a mild antiseptic mouthwash smell and Not the bug spray smell that another reviewer posted.  </li>
            <li> Definitely smells strongly of herbs.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong initial alcohol smell (and, yes, insecticide)</li>
            <li> Which would explain why it is largely ineffective.</li>
            <li> Yes, It certainly would not spread fragrance</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own natural smells, but this helps and keeps you dry.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m editing this last part a little while later to say that I tried the Crystalux herbal deodorant, and it&#x27;s AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I could go all day without an odor, then....not so much.  </li>
            <li> This has lasted me through intense workouts and runs in 82 degree weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the woodsy, earthy smell</li>
            <li> I was very underwhelmed by this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> How ever, much to my surprise it does work very well and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> A hair dryer helps, it is very watery.  </li>
            <li> Really keeps bacterial growth at bay.</li>
            <li> So I cant really make a review.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant really keeps the odors at bay.</li>
            <li> It works and is nice as adjunct to Vichy French deodorant since I like to alternate on occasion.</li>
            <li> its herbal and natural!!!</li>
            <li> I do love Berts Bees and will stick with their other products</li>
            <li> As of the end of August, there were very few even potentially good natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> and I most definitely started getting BO stink only a couple hours after application.</li>
            <li> A decent, all-natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> All natural no aluminum ingredients!!</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Deodorant wouldn&#x27;t use any other!!</li>
            <li> My husband even teases me at times that I don&#x27;t sweat like a normal person.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for long and had a funny smell at first.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s not laden with chemicals, that alone is worth the extra spray if it&#x27;s required.</li>
            <li> Tried a few other natural deodorants, eh, not so great.</li>
            <li> works pretty well in winter and spring/fall, definitely not a product for high heat or summer</li>
            <li> Within an hour I&#x27;m able to smell my own natural odor, and like other low-star reviewers I noticed that this product smells worse when I&#x27;m perspiring than if I hadn&#x27;t applied it at all.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of the Right Guard aerosol spray deodorant my mom used to buy for the house when I was growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  (1) I felt like I needed to apply this 3 times a day to stay odor free on warm early fall day --</li>
            <li> Better than the other natural deodorant that I got with the same order.</li>
            <li> For the first week or two it seemed to work as a deodorant, and I didn&#x27;t have the residue from my old commercial deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using regular deodorants (not natural)in the past, but I couldn&#x27;t even handle my own smell.  </li>
            <li> I figured out the \\&quot;herby\\&quot; smell, it smells like old spice or something, very masculine.</li>
            <li> I recently reverted back to some classic Old Spice deodorant (anti-perspirant free), and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  </li>
            <li> The spray had a drying property that made me feel dry right after applying it.  </li>
            <li> The search for a natural deodorant continues.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li> I works quite well for a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a number of these natural deodorants, including this one.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give natural deodorant a try and turned to Burt&#x27;s Bees of course.  </li>
            <li> I have an almost six month old baby at home, so you can imagine I don&#x27;t just sit around all day.  </li>
            <li> So far no irritation, been using about a month now.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is all natural and aluminum-free.</li>
            <li> - I was worried it would be too masculine</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s natural and it</li>
            <li> It can be sprayed directly over skin with no rashes, itching and blacking at all.</li>
            <li> early morning, lunch time and evening to get through the night.  </li>
            <li> Wish this came in a travel size since it does require frequent reapplication....</li>
            <li> I bought these the end of November, so I could use each of them for a reasonable amount of time under different circumstances.    </li>
            <li> Surprised at how ineffective this one was because of the minerals.</li>
            <li> but as soon as a pressure situation arises you&#x27;ll be smelling your natural body odor.</li>
            <li> Since sweating if your body&#x27;s natural way of getting rid of toxins, this spray is meant to neutralize odor, not stop you from perspiring.</li>
            <li> I had been using an aluminum crystal deodorant, which was very effective, but I always washed it off with soap after work (which is a hassle) because I&#x27;m afraid of the toxic</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, at the end of the day I can definitely feel its effect fading away, especially during these hot summer days.</li>
            <li> The other times I used it there was no stinging at all because I didn&#x27;t apply it right after showering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My brand new work shirt has giant oil stains anywhere the deodorant touched.</li>
            <li> Dries fairly fast so you&#x27;re not waiting for your pits to dry like</li>
            <li> I prefer to use natural products when possible, but for the longest time, I could not find a natural deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> This product, like so many aspects of life, is really quite mediocre.</li>
            <li> I can sweat pretty heavily, and this week I put my new deodorant to the test.  </li>
            <li> and I put my shirt on last to give it a chance to dry first.  </li>
            <li> Not well enough to stop my search for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Only natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty average.</li>
            <li> but they apparently did not consider their customers.</li>
            <li> As great as it was the first few days was as bad as it was then.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those superhumans who endeavors to push their exertion boundaries such as;  mowing a lawn or washing a car, perhaps briefly walking through the neighborhood, this will completely render the deodorant&#x27;s odor suppression effectiveness to zero.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, this great smelling deodorant comes in an aluminum bottle and defeats the purpose of avoiding aluminum :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply not worth the cost, and doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I have sensitive skin and other deodorants have given me an itchy rash.</li>
            <li> It quickly fades away and left me smelling rank by the end of every day, and it&#x27;s more expensive than other better working options.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange feeling to actually sweat now.  </li>
            <li> But given all the positives, this is the only minor drawback, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> One bottle will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> Does not last long after it is applied</li>
            <li> However, it does not last a long time....</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a more natural deodorant and was getting so frustrated.</li>
            <li> After many disappointing attempts at using a non aluminum deodorant, I came across Burt&#x27;s bees spray sage oil deodorant after reading about it in an online magazine editorial where the writer tried different ones and ranked them.</li>
            <li> One of the few natural deodorants that do work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge buyer of natural or herbal products, but I am a fan of this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I personally think that it is odd to define scents as male and female...</li>
            <li> However, this deodorant and the other ones (Tom&#x27;s, Nature&#x27;s Way) simply do not last long enough.  </li>
            <li> Is your job really that hard?</li>
            <li> I work long hours</li>
            <li> The smell can be rather pungent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger for long.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;No rash, dry skin, or itching</li>
            <li> When my wife works out, she said that the combination of her BO and the deodorant actually smells worse than straight BO.</li>
            <li> :)  Just kidding, even after a work out, it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t quite last all day.</li>
            <li> I was curious to try it after a friend recommended it.</li>
            <li> I bought a few different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants to compare.  </li>
            <li> it was what i expected.</li>
            <li> It does stop odor as advertised, but if you&#x27;re someone who tends to sweat a lot or does physical activity, you may not enjoy staining your shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> last longer than others i have used in the past.</li>
            <li> /swollen lymph nodes from every other deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other hippie deodorants</li>
            <li> (oh,and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few).Give it a shot - you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Reviews on different sites said that they either have nasty ingredients or weren&#x27;t effective.  </li>
            <li> However, even with being a low sweat person, usually this lasts half a day.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that prevents a five star review is the fact that it is a spray, which makes it hard to apply and it stings a bit after shaving.</li>
            <li> However if your physical exertion extends to activities such as vacuuming(a small rug), preparing a (small) meal or strolling through a (small) mall, you&#x27;re pushing the limits of it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> love this product because I hate those aluminum paste deodorants.  </li>
            <li> The product did sting when I applied after a shower once, but I think that was the alcohol penetrating skin that may have gotten slightly abraded by my shower sponge.</li>
            <li> It got rid of the slight BO</li>
            <li> It lasts about half a day before needing to reapply.  </li>
            <li> Typically, once a day is all you need...</li>
            <li> I ordered leaked half its contents</li>
            <li> However, after a few days of use, I get very irritated, uncomfortable skin - it&#x27;s too harsh for me I guess.</li>
            <li> It was pretty much the worst.</li>
            <li> Not just a little, a lot.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little on the manly side for my taste.</li>
            <li> Runs a little.</li>
            <li> Needs to be a little thicker</li>
            <li> GREEN TEA  </li>
            <li> 4 stars because I have to reapply a few times a day.</li>
            <li> However, on hot summer days, it&#x27;s a little annoying having wet armpits.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I was still using aluminum intermittently, if all of the aluminum was not out of my body, or if my body got used to this, but it stopped working after a couple weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Tidings for at least a year now</li>
            <li> I usually get a rash from alcohol products, but not this one.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was one of the worst performers in odor control for me, despite the strong scent.</li>
            <li> But reapplication throughout the day is a must if you&#x27;re a man who works hard.</li>
            <li> yes, I listed the scent as both a negative and a positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but It will not let the body odor go bad for entire day.</li>
            <li> Not pleasant.</li>
            <li> and then I would smell worse than I would if I hadn&#x27;t used anything</li>
            <li> Even if you are a heavy sweater and are very skeptical, try it out.  </li>
            <li> After I exercise in the evening I&#x27;ll reapply so that I don&#x27;t make my husband or cat faint from the odor.</li>
            <li> you are afraid to take the risk, go sample some at a store that has Burt&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too bad since it&#x27;s a healthier option compared to antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Positives:  (1)</li>
            <li> I will keep using it and see if I get used to it, but doubtful.</li>
            <li> HATE</li>
            <li> Too bad it seems to be unavailable now!</li>
            <li> Very bad decision in my view.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was really excited about this....at first.  For the first week or two it seemed to work as a deodorant, and I didn&#x27;t have the residue from my old commercial deodorant.  I could go all day without an odor, then....not so much.  I do mostly office work, and one day while interviewing potential applicants I could smell myself.  Not just a little, a lot.  As great as it was the first few days was as bad as it was then.  I tried it out for four more days, but it simply did not work anymore.  The search for a natural deodorant continues.</li>
            <li> It works and is nice as adjunct to Vichy French deodorant since I like to alternate on occasion. Hope they continue to make this product.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works fine when my wife isn&#x27;t working out. However, deodorant is especially useful for when one does work out. When my wife works out, she said that the combination of her BO and the deodorant actually smells worse than straight BO.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive underarms. When I use regular deodorant, or wear polyester, they swell up and are sore for days. This deodorant is wonderful! It does a great job keeping me smelling good throughout the day and does not have any side effects. I work long hours and I only have to maybe reapply once throughout the day. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a more natural deodorant and was getting so frustrated. I did not think I would find anything that would keep more dry and fresh feeling. And then I found this and I could not be happier. It works so well, even on the hottest days of summer.</li>
            <li> Pump spray does not use carbons in the air, pleasent citrus smell, not over powering and works with most colognes and perfumes, aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;Helps eliminate under arm odors by preventing baterial growth, does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> Works great but stained all of my shirts. My brand new work shirt has giant oil stains anywhere the deodorant touched.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s a refreshing and earthy scent. Smells great! :)</li>
            <li> I was curious to try it after a friend recommended it. It smells really nice and fresh, and feels good to put on. Nevertheless, at the end of the day I can definitely feel its effect fading away, especially during these hot summer days. I would recommend it for the winter or low activity days. Definitely NOT for a night out dancing and sweating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found yet for the &#x27;naturals&#x27;.  I can go all day with working outside and&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t had any complaints!!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Longs but they no longer have it so was glad to find it online.  I works quite well for a natural deodorant.  It is better than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of these natural deodorants, including this one.  I wish I could report any of them work well.  They do not.  They smell great, much better than commercial ones.  The ingredients are better probably for your overall health.  However, this deodorant and the other ones (Tom&#x27;s, Nature&#x27;s Way) simply do not last long enough.  I am not a sweaty person.  My husband even teases me at times that I don&#x27;t sweat like a normal person.  However, even with being a low sweat person, usually this lasts half a day.  In sum, I have gone back to Mitchum.</li>
            <li> Finally, a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.  Works well for odor control, not as good as the mainstream commercial products but then I can&#x27;t wear them anyway.  It does help and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> First off, it works! I put this on and went about my day and then went to the gym. Didn&#x27;t smell after a 30 minute workout, and I didn&#x27;t reapply it before hand either. The only thing that prevents a five star review is the fact that it is a spray, which makes it hard to apply and it stings a bit after shaving. If it came in a roll on container I could deal with the stinging.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that makes me feel good.  I have tried (can&#x27;t even count) all the types of deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  This is great.  Obviously your body secretes it&#x27;s own natural smells, but this helps and keeps you dry.  Will know soon if its the only deodorant I use.  WELL WORTH TRYING!</li>
            <li> I decided to give natural deodorant a try and turned to Burt&#x27;s Bees of course.  I love the scent and it actually works!  It&#x27;s a strange feeling to actually sweat now.  But, sweating gets rid of toxins and using the regular antiperspirant/deodorant isn&#x27;t good for you anyways because of all the harmful ingredients used in them.  I only have to apply once in the morning, 4 sprays each pit, and I&#x27;m good to go for the rest of the day.  After I exercise in the evening I&#x27;ll reapply so that I don&#x27;t make my husband or cat faint from the odor. :)  Just kidding, even after a work out, it&#x27;s not too bad.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and have always been pleased with their products.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use natural products when possible, but for the longest time, I could not find a natural deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash.  Lo, I stumbled upon this product at the local pharmacy, bought it, tried it out, and voila! Comfortable to wear, effective, and no rash. My (now former) girlfriend and I also both liked the smell. The scent doesn&#x27;t rival popular aromas of Axe or Brut or what have you, but it&#x27;s pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> Iwould purchase this product again. last longer than others i have used in the past. you wont be dissapointed :)</li>
            <li> The spraying mechanism is not working. Please check the working for the bottle before shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting more and more concerned about the toxins we use on our bodies.  I&#x27;ve tried using regular deodorants (not natural)in the past, but I couldn&#x27;t even handle my own smell.  I can sweat pretty heavily, and this week I put my new deodorant to the test.  I have an almost six month old baby at home, so you can imagine I don&#x27;t just sit around all day.  I also teach elementary music part-time.  Neither of those things for me caused ANY odor this week.  Friday was the ultimate test - I had a dance lesson in about 80 degree weather (definitely sweat through all of my clothes), gardened in the afternoon (same weather), and then went bowling that night.  I intentionally never showered or changed my clothes.  I think I felt more fresh that night than I ever have with a chemical antiperspirant.  Even if you are a heavy sweater and are very skeptical, try it out.  It&#x27;s worth it for your body.  I just ordered myself a 3-pack so I&#x27;ll have a supply for a while.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but it made my underarms sting on the second day of using it. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use many of them, but this one is not one I&#x27;d buy again, more&#x27;s the pity as I would love to be able to use aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product for people who can not wear regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge buyer of natural or herbal products, but I am a fan of this deodorant! The smell can be rather pungent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger for long. I&#x27;ll use this at the beginning of my day and by the end (including a trip to the gym) I am still BO free. No burning, itching, or anything like that.  --Update-- After some longer, and warmer, days I have noticed that by the end of it I am a bit stinky! However, reapplying this deodorant part way through the day seems to do the trick. I will definitely still purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Deodorant wouldn&#x27;t use any other!! All natural no aluminum ingredients!! Great deodorant for a good price!!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Scent goes away in an hour</li>
            <li> This deodorant seemed to work well. Dries fairly fast so you&#x27;re not waiting for your pits to dry like roll on&#x27;s.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it had a mild antiseptic mouthwash smell and Not the bug spray smell that another reviewer posted.  The first bottle worked well.  The second one I bought did not.  So now I&#x27;m on the search again for a good natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Thsi works ok.  For me I have to apply mote than once a day.  I still smelled a bit but nothing anyone but me knew.  Came quick.  Seller is good.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I have sensitive skin and other deodorants have given me an itchy rash. I liked the smell, didn&#x27;t get a rash, but found the deodorant to be ineffective. More below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like sage and lavender, with undertones of citrus. It is definitely more of a strong, herbal, masculine scent, but I&#x27;m a woman and I really enjoy it. (A little more citrus would be nice. The Body Shop&#x27;s Kistna line--also marketed towards men--is what this product would smell like if they upped the citrus.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN SENSITIVITY&lt;br /&gt;No rash, dry skin, or itching after I used this product. The product did sting when I applied after a shower once, but I think that was the alcohol penetrating skin that may have gotten slightly abraded by my shower sponge. The stinging went away. The other times I used it there was no stinging at all because I didn&#x27;t apply it right after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFECTIVENESS&lt;br /&gt;Basically this is a bottle of essential oils suspended in alcohol--more a perfume than a deodorant. Which would explain why it is largely ineffective. Within an hour I&#x27;m able to smell my own natural odor, and like other low-star reviewers I noticed that this product smells worse when I&#x27;m perspiring than if I hadn&#x27;t applied it at all. If you liked the smell too, but you found the product ineffective, Old Spice&#x27;s Fresher Collection &amp;#34;Citron&amp;#34; deodorant could work for you. The smell is stronger, but it has an appealing lime undertone, and it is very gentle on the pits. It is also marketed for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;I paid about $6 for this and will be using it as a fragrance moving forward--and NOT an armpit fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great product,  I had been getting rashes/swollen lymph nodes from every other deodorant.  This is easy to use, no mess, I like the spray and it smells pleasant enough.  So far no irritation, been using about a month now.</li>
            <li> After many disappointing attempts at using a non aluminum deodorant, I came across Burt&#x27;s bees spray sage oil deodorant after reading about it in an online magazine editorial where the writer tried different ones and ranked them. Bought this at a local grocer for about 7 bucks. So happy I found this!! 2 sprays each underarm and it dries very quickly. The fragrance is light and smells earthy/citrusy as you would expect from the sage and lemon oil mix. I have found the scent wears off after a while but leaves you with clean, dry NON-SMELLY pits for a whole day!!! This has lasted me through intense workouts and runs in 82 degree weather. I have not found anything more effective in a non-aluminum deodorant and this even beats the aluminum Dove I used to use!! Highly recommend!!  Update 4/23/2017: I am not sure if I was still using aluminum intermittently, if all of the aluminum was not out of my body, or if my body got used to this, but it stopped working after a couple weeks and I most definitely started getting BO stink only a couple hours after application. I have been using Green Tidings for at least a year now and I can say THAT is the only non-aluminum deodorant I have found that works for me out of what I have tried.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, it&#x27;s a little on the manly side for my taste. I&#x27;ve needed to re-apply it throughout the work day, and 90 degree summer days? No chance. It works okay... Not well enough to stop my search for a natural deodorant. I&#x27;ll be trying another kind.</li>
            <li> This work well, does not make my skin break out and smells fresh. You must like the scent of sage, which i do, as that is the strongest component to the scent. I will purchase this again. This seller did wrap and protect product and delivery was ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> I bought this essentially to use as a body spray rather than a deodorant. I pair it with an all-natural odor free deodorant to use under-arm. I like the fact that it is all natural and aluminum-free. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past. I think the smell is very good and outdoorsy. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t quite last all day. But given all the positives, this is the only minor drawback, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used antiperspirant for years and am always searching for an effective, gentle, natural deodorant that works. This isn&#x27;t it. But it&#x27;s close. I&#x27;ve tried the jar deodorants that have baking soda - those WORK! However, after a few days of use, I get very irritated, uncomfortable skin - it&#x27;s too harsh for me I guess. So this seems to be the next best thing. Doesn&#x27;t work all day. But it works well enough. I actually really like the woodsy, earthy smell - I was worried it would be too masculine but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> A couple of points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear cologne and deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;This does have a scent that is very woodsy and some (most) people associate that with men or male scents.  I personally think that it is odd to define scents as male and female...but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly...while I don&#x27;t believe in male and female scents...I do think that what smells good on one person does not smell good on another person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are afraid to take the risk, go sample some at a store that has Burt&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product because I hate those aluminum paste deodorants.  One bottle will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.  The spray nozzle also dispenses well.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it works, and it doesn&#x27;t give me a rash even though it&#x27;s alcohol based. . . I usually get a rash from alcohol products, but not this one. Great for sweaty feet, too!</li>
            <li> This was fantastic the first time I used it. It got rid of the slight BO I&#x27;d already worked up and smelled very nice for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem was that it got on my suit jacket -- and the next time I wore my jacket, after about five minutes, it smelled like something was rotting.  It was pretty much the worst.</li>
            <li> mY HUSBAND purchased this for himself but he hates the smell. I however love love love it!!! its herbal and natural!!! i am now using it LOL</li>
            <li> Smells good but not that effective. Does not last long after it is applied</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for long and had a funny smell at first.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever, and you don&#x27;t have to feel like you are blocking your pores from sweating. Too bad it seems to be unavailable now!</li>
            <li> I was very underwhelmed by this deodorant.  It&#x27;s made of about 3-4 ingredients, it smells VERY much like outdoors/ bug spray.  It quickly fades away and left me smelling rank by the end of every day, and it&#x27;s more expensive than other better working options.  I recently reverted back to some classic Old Spice deodorant (anti-perspirant free), and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  This stuff is simply not worth the cost, and doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great, and natural, product. Oils of herbs I cook with-may be why I&#x27;m biased! Seems that Burt&#x27;s Bees may be discontinuing this. Very bad decision in my view. Get them while you can!</li>
            <li> The smell takes getting used to if you don&#x27;t wear a lot of \\&quot;herby\\&quot; things but I love it, it&#x27;s natural and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 9, 2014 Update; It stopped working, it would work for an hour and then I would smell worse than I would if I hadn&#x27;t used anything, so I had to discontinue it. I figured out the \\&quot;herby\\&quot; smell, it smells like old spice or something, very masculine. I&#x27;ll have to find something else but I do love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much. It can be sprayed directly over skin with no rashes, itching and blacking at all.Yes, It certainly would not spread fragrance but It will not let the body odor go bad for entire day. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a non-aerosol spray deodorant with a strong sage scent.  It reminded me of the Right Guard aerosol spray deodorant my mom used to buy for the house when I was growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  (1) I felt like I needed to apply this 3 times a day to stay odor free on warm early fall day -- early morning, lunch time and evening to get through the night.  (2) The smell didn&#x27;t bother me until I attended a parents club meeting at my son&#x27;s school and felt self conscious that the scent of the deodorant may have been strong as I was sitting in a cramped space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:  (1) The spray had a drying property that made me feel dry right after applying it.  (2) I love using this right before an outdoor activity because the scent reminds me that it is working to fight odor -- yes, I listed the scent as both a negative and a positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions:  I will most likely buy this Burt&#x27;s Bees deodorant again.  It is easy to throw in my purse or diaper bag when I plan to be away from the house for several hours and want to make sure I have added protection close by.</li>
            <li> Great natural alternative.</li>
            <li> Smells yum! I have to apply it often, but beats aluminum chloride any day. Wish this came in a travel size since it does require frequent reapplication....hint hint burt&#x27;s bees!</li>
            <li> One of the few natural deodorants that do work! I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure but it didn&#x27;t come with a cap..to seal off the product. How ever, much to my surprise it does work very well and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I bought a few different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants to compare.  I have been using the solid mineral rock.  But, my husband doesn&#x27;t like those; said they do not work for him.  So, I went out on a mission to find one he would like and that I might use as well.  I bought these the end of November, so I could use each of them for a reasonable amount of time under different circumstances.    This is my personal results:    BURT&#x27;S BEES HERBAL DEODORANT    It acts more like a perfume.  However, my husband likes the scent of this one best, so I am giving it 3 stars.  It is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant, as are these others.  I am reviewing these appropriately on how they help eliminate the stink.  Needed to reapply before end of day    I also bought:    TOM&#x27;S OF MAINE, Citrus Zest Crystal Confidence Deodorant - 2.4 oz  This one is ok.  The scent is a little strong, but ok.  Did not keep either of us odor free all day.  Had to reapply 3 times during the day.    CRYSTAL - CRYSTAL BODY SPRAY, 4 FL OZ SPRAY  Surprised at how ineffective this one was because of the minerals. It takes a long time to dry.  A hair dryer helps, it is very watery.  It lasts about half a day before needing to reapply.  It may be because it is in a spray form.    MINERAL DEODORANT ROLL ON CHAMOMILE AND GREEN TEA  This one is my favorite by far.  It dries quickly.  It has a mild nice scent.  We are odor free all do and do not need to reapply.  To me, the solid crystal rock is still the best, but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, no sting, not stickiness, not weird smells, just clean all day. So glad my Sister told me about this stuff. After a full 24 hours still no smell. Really keeps bacterial growth at bay. Will be buying again for sure!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, plus all natural! 4 stars because I have to reapply a few times a day.</li>
            <li> Smell is very very potent.  I think the only thing it does is mask the odor, is all. So I cant really make a review.  I do love Berts Bees and will stick with their other products</li>
            <li> Only natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> works pretty well in winter and spring/fall, definitely not a product for high heat or summer</li>
            <li> Very good. Runs a little. Needs to be a little thicker</li>
            <li> Very potent....and not in a good way. Definitely smells strongly of herbs. Doesn&#x27;t stop sweat, only briefly covers perspiration smell.</li>
            <li> I found the smell of this deodorant too strong and manly.  The smell still lingered in my clothing days after using it.</li>
            <li> The deodorant stings when I apply it, and it also has a not-so-pleasing smell to it.  I will keep using it and see if I get used to it, but doubtful.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I don&#x27;t smell even after light exercise.And no aluminum, no propylene glycol, no animal testing. It&#x27;s not like other hippie deodorants (oh,and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few).Give it a shot - you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and they all cause skin irritation.  This is the only one that consistantly performs well adn never bothers my skin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Good but as soon as a pressure situation arises you&#x27;ll be smelling your natural body odor.</li>
            <li> Better than the other natural deodorant that I got with the same order. However, it does not last a long time....A couple hours at most and I don&#x27;t like the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees! HATE the company who sent it to me, sent me THE WRONG ITEM!!!! UGH. I received Crystalux Herbal deodorant instead. Is your job really that hard? cuz you suck at it. Now I&#x27;m editing this last part a little while later to say that I tried the Crystalux herbal deodorant, and it&#x27;s AWESOME. Love it. Kinda glad they sent me the wrong item. lol</li>
            <li> I started with Schmidts. Works great, but after days of continuous use I get the occasional pit pimple. Not pleasant. Tried a few other natural deodorants, eh, not so great. This stuff smells awesome. Sprays on easy, easy to reapply. I don&#x27;t shower daily and find this does a good job when re-applying the next day.</li>
            <li> it was what i expected. i use this kind of deodorant if i have to use it. personally i prefer crystals to deoderant</li>
            <li> Only deodorant that works!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees needs to get production of this item started. My son has used this product for 15 to 20 years.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really keeps the odors at bay. I have done almost every activity while wearing the deodorant, not once have I had an odor or irritation.</li>
            <li> I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees deodorant with Oil of Sage I have use it for years. I love it is great</li>
            <li> Quality product. prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Works OKAY, smells great. But reapplication throughout the day is a must if you&#x27;re a man who works hard. I originally got this spray because I wanted to avoid aluminum and aluminum like substances in modern deodorant. HOWEVER, this great smelling deodorant comes in an aluminum bottle and defeats the purpose of avoiding aluminum :(</li>
            <li> Smelled great but didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was one of the worst performers in odor control for me, despite the strong scent. After a couple of hours it did not work. And I don&#x27;t particularly have stronger odor than most people. Pretty average. So I don&#x27;t recommend this deodorant.  Too bad since it&#x27;s a healthier option compared to antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Wore for 2 hours and I stunk. Smells like a guy</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and works great.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant that&#x27;s no longer on the market!  Don&#x27;t know why Burts Bees would cease production but they apparently did not consider their customers.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, smells nice. Doesn&#x27;t necessarily give you that all-day protection from stinky pits, but it&#x27;s a good product, and it&#x27;s easy to refresh if you go out after work... I like it and would buy it again. I like the fact that it&#x27;s not laden with chemicals, that alone is worth the extra spray if it&#x27;s required. Typically, once a day is all you need...</li>
            <li> works great...just have to reapply every 6 hours</li>
            <li> As of the end of August, there were very few even potentially good natural deodorants.  Reviews on different sites said that they either have nasty ingredients or weren&#x27;t effective.  I had been using an aluminum crystal deodorant, which was very effective, but I always washed it off with soap after work (which is a hassle) because I&#x27;m afraid of the toxic aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first bottle of Burt&#x27;s Bees I ordered leaked half its contents but I was sent a replacement bottle.  I use five sprays and then rub it in to be sure I have full coverage and penetration.  It does have a strong initial alcohol smell (and, yes, insecticide) and I put my shirt on last to give it a chance to dry first.  It quickly turns to a strong herbal sage smell, which I like, but it may be more appropriate for men then women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in an air conditioned office and I just need to cover up my human scent, so I don&#x27;t really need an antiperspirant or strong deodorant, and this is very effective all day, if not longer.  I can easily see how some people might need to reapply at mid-day, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it, but the next time I will probably try the well reviewed Silver Shield roll-on which may be more effective, unscented, and easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 17 Feb 2013&lt;br /&gt;The Silver Shield roll-on stings if used daily, so I ordered a 3-pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> A decent, all-natural deodorant. The smell is pleasant enough when applied. However, as is true to most all-natural deodorants, it does not last all day. That being said, it is still better than and lasts longer than the MANY other brands I have tried. But if it is a very hot summer&#x27;s day, I suggest throwing it in your bag to reapply at points throughout the day.</li>
            <li> As someone who earns a living sitting in front of a computer, this deodorant spray works just fine. Since sweating if your body&#x27;s natural way of getting rid of toxins, this spray is meant to neutralize odor, not stop you from perspiring. However, on hot summer days, it&#x27;s a little annoying having wet armpits. It does stop odor as advertised, but if you&#x27;re someone who tends to sweat a lot or does physical activity, you may not enjoy staining your shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m fine using this spray since I don&#x27;t tend to sweat a lot. However, on hot days or when I know I&#x27;m going to be doing a lot of physical activity, I switch to Tom&#x27;s Unscented Deodorant stick as that seems to stop excessive moisture.</li>
            <li> This a great very effective product. This is a second time purchase and didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Comme ci&#x27; &#x27;Comme Ca&#x27;  This product, like so many aspects of life, is really quite mediocre. It works quite well for television viewing, reading e-mail and even writing product reviews. However if your physical exertion extends to activities such as vacuuming(a small rug), preparing a (small) meal or strolling through a (small) mall, you&#x27;re pushing the limits of it&#x27;s effectiveness. If you&#x27;re one of those superhumans who endeavors to push their exertion boundaries such as;  mowing a lawn or washing a car, perhaps briefly walking through the neighborhood, this will completely render the deodorant&#x27;s odor suppression effectiveness to zero.  -C&#x27;est  la Vie-</li>
