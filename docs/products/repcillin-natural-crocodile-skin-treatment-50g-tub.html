    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Repcillin is probably the best moisturizer I have used on my son.</li>
            <li>Me, wife, and my mom tried it on our skin and we all felt some heaviness on our skin (good moisturizer at best).   </li>
            <li>Being a chef, I have seen my fair share of burns in the kitchen, after always using repcillin on my children I used the repcillin on a burn that I had got from boiling water.</li>
            <li>When I showed it to my dermatologist, he laughed and said, \\&quot;What do you expect?  </li>
            <li>I emailed them and they basically laughed at me when I told them I wanted a refund.  </li>
            <li>Also, great people to deal with, they love to be in touch by e-mail and help with any questions.</li>
            <li>It made my skin burn, irritated and MORE itchy!  </li>
            <li>It has been amazing, as soon as I applied the cream to my sons eczema, I noticed the redness going away, it helped heal his skin</li>
            <li>but it is a nice moisturiser.  </li>
            <li>Buy this product at your own risk.</li>
            <li>As with any aliment I always try and pursue the more holistic of treatments as I do believe these are the best way to go, so when I first heard of Repcillin</li>
            <li>It was amazing, the burn ended up not leaving a scar (and i scar easily).</li>
            <li>I have had eczema for almost a year and have tried many products.</li>
            <li>Bought it twice to give it a chance but you may be better off visiting  a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>It was great to find out that there is something out there that is 100% natural with no side effects.</li>
            <li>I bought Repcillin because my 4 years old daughter has eczema, and the review is good.</li>
            <li>but I did not see a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>It has been amazing for my Eczema, thank you Amazon for listing a natural product for this skin disease, I recommend this product to anyone who has eczema or if their children have eczema, it is very gentle.</li>

            <li>If you want the real thing, go to Repcillin.com, the shipping from South Africa is worth it for a product that gets results.</li>
            <li>I strongly beleive that is why there are so many negative comments on this product.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to put on and does not make the skin itch or irritated.</li>
            <li>This product did not do anything at all for the fairly intense eczema that my son has.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this from Amazon and also a sample from the REAL repcillin site, repcillin.com.  </li>
            <li>It is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I have probably tried every product that is available in regular pharmacies.</li>
            <li>Maybe it calms very severe excema</li>
            <li>I waited until we finished the whole jar, but has no any improvement at all, nothing.     </li>
            <li>It has worked very well for my children.</li>
            <li>It had ZERO effect on my skin problems but my wallet is much lighter.  </li>
            <li>Product really works.  </li>
            <li>After he applied the Repcillin daily for about a week, I saw significant improvement in his problem areas (feet, legs, arms).</li>
            <li>Good product but not exceptional.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a few days ago and saw how it helped withing minutes of using the product, litte Carter is so much happier (he is 5 months) and does not cry as much any more.</li>
            <li>Now if it weren&#x27;t for all the positive feedback which I have read before writing this review, I would say that Repcillin is a complete scam however</li>
            <li>The repcillin has worked for me, I have been using it for the past 10 days and it has shown the most results out of anything I have used...</li>
            <li>it might work with a mild skin problem but not so good with people with bad skin problems.</li>

            <li>, I perhaps maybe believe that this product is good for someone with chronic dry skin, or maybe even a mild form of eczema, but for someone like me who suffers from severe flare ups, it does next to nothing.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try something new for my eczema and even further elated at the idea that I would be able to do so without the use of any harsh chemicals such as my usual steroidal creams which is my normal \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for treating my harsh flare ups.</li>

            <li> I want to first say that I have had eczema pretty much throughout my entire teenage to adult life with varying degrees of severity - with the worst of the flare ups occurring during the spring/summer months.</li>
            <li> Long time psoriasis sufferer here.  </li>
            <li> but so does just plain old olive oil.</li>
            <li> Repcillin actually helps the skin repair itself rather than just offer a protection layer like other products.</li>
            <li> So I thought I would tell the other moms out there not only to use the Repcillin for your babies, use it yourself,</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product to anyone who has dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> The skin is no longer inflammed, itchy or dry and cracking.  </li>
            <li> Also It seems to not have that burning feeling when applying moisturizer to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say that after treating a bad flare up for a week with only Repcillin, it caused me to go right back to my steroidal ointments, this product does make for a halfway decent moisturizer, but no more than say Burts Bee&#x27;s hand salve which is also quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> This product help my dry skin heal in a matter of days!</li>
            <li> It is much safer than using harsh steroid creams that will only make it worse.</li>
            <li> In only a few days, it is in healing mode....</li>
            <li> I wanted to compare the difference because the official Repcillin site states other products produced under that name are forgeries.</li>
            <li> Repcillin helps keep my son&#x27;s dry skin moist for at least 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> I thought I would also throw my little comment towards what it did for my burn.    </li>
            <li> I have been using the repcillin for a few months for my childrens eczema and any rashes they might get.</li>
            <li> I have a very difficult time dealing with this condition and an even more difficult time treating it.</li>
            <li> It does not contain any of the chemicals I have come across in the past.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for minimal results.</li>
            <li> Yes, its expensive without insurance but works 100% don&#x27;t waste your money with this product..</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my sons eczema, whenever the doctor gives my son a cream, it always helps and then the eczema returns worse than before.    </li>
            <li> I think this product is expensive and useless.</li>
            <li> Very, very expensive product</li>
            <li> My son have a really, really bad eczema and this product did not deliver.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as it is quite expensive :(</li>
            <li> They both hated the feeling of croc oil on their skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Both my sons (2 &amp; 3) have severe eczema, tried it on both for 4 weeks. No change in their flare up or the skin breakages.   They both hated the feeling of croc oil on their skin. Watching their strict diet was the only way out to reduce the frequency of flare ups.  Me, wife, and my mom tried it on our skin and we all felt some heaviness on our skin (good moisturizer at best).   Once I burned my finger i applied it for a week it seems that it healed the skin faster.</li>
            <li> This product help my dry skin heal in a matter of days! It is very soothing to put on and does not make the skin itch or irritated. I would recomend this product to anyone who has dry skin or eczema. It is much safer than using harsh steroid creams that will only make it worse.</li>
            <li> There are mixed reivews of this product on many sites.  We ordered and hoped to have good/great results.  This product did not do anything at all for the fairly intense eczema that my son has.  Very disappointed as it is quite expensive :(</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon and also a sample from the REAL repcillin site, repcillin.com.  I have had eczema for almost a year and have tried many products. I wanted to compare the difference because the official Repcillin site states other products produced under that name are forgeries. They are 100% right. The so-called Repcillin from African Cures  didn&#x27;t even come close. It made my skin burn, irritated and MORE itchy!  The real thing from south Africa (Repcillin NOT African Cures!)felt soothing and stopped the itch IMMEDIATELY. The skin is no longer inflammed, itchy or dry and cracking.  In only a few days, it is in healing mode....finally.  African cures should not be allowed to use the Repcillin brand name and logo. It is not the real thing. I strongly beleive that is why there are so many negative comments on this product. It is unfortunate because the genuine Repcillin product is awesome. If you want the real thing, go to Repcillin.com, the shipping from South Africa is worth it for a product that gets results. Also, great people to deal with, they love to be in touch by e-mail and help with any questions.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with my eczema at all but it is a nice moisturiser.  Would recommend it for its moisturising qualities but not to deal with skin complaints.</li>
            <li> I want to first say that I have had eczema pretty much throughout my entire teenage to adult life with varying degrees of severity - with the worst of the flare ups occurring during the spring/summer months. I have a very difficult time dealing with this condition and an even more difficult time treating it. As with any aliment I always try and pursue the more holistic of treatments as I do believe these are the best way to go, so when I first heard of Repcillin I was very excited to try something new for my eczema and even further elated at the idea that I would be able to do so without the use of any harsh chemicals such as my usual steroidal creams which is my normal \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for treating my harsh flare ups.

            <li> [[ASIN:B001JEE5RK Dr Croc&#x27;s Repcillin Natural Skin Treatment 100g Tub]]    It was great to find out that there is something out there that is 100% natural with no side effects. I have had problems with my sons eczema, whenever the doctor gives my son a cream, it always helps and then the eczema returns worse than before.    I ordered the repcillin after reading about it on [...], the product came in about 3 days. It has been amazing, as soon as I applied the cream to my sons eczema, I noticed the redness going away, it helped heal his skin and now I use the spray every day after his bath to keep the eczema at bay.    I would like to thank Amazon for offering this product in the States.</li>
            <li> My son has severe eczema. Repcillin is probably the best moisturizer I have used on my son. I have probably tried every product that is available in regular pharmacies. Repcillin helps keep my son&#x27;s dry skin moist for at least 4-5 hours. Aquafor only lasts about 2hrs. Repcillin actually helps the skin repair itself rather than just offer a protection layer like other products. Also It seems to not have that burning feeling when applying moisturizer to dry skin. My son hates when we apply moisturizers. But my son will say \\&quot;Awigator\\&quot; which stands for alligator that looks like a crocodile and ask for me to apply Repcillin on itchy areas.  Thank you Repcillin me and my wife get at least 2 more hours of sleep at night because of it lasts longer till he wakes up itching.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for my sons eczema and it has worked wonders, thank you African Cures, I hope to see this product in my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few days ago and saw how it helped withing minutes of using the product, litte Carter is so much happier (he is 5 months) and does not cry as much any more. Thank you for a natural product, I will back in the future.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for minimal results. Maybe it calms very severe excema but I did not see a significant improvement. Bought it twice to give it a chance but you may be better off visiting  a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Made my skin worse...made my face burn, gave me what looks like HERPES ON MY FACE AND BODY!  Buy this product at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I bought Repcillin because my 4 years old daughter has eczema, and the review is good. I waited until we finished the whole jar, but has no any improvement at all, nothing.     I think this product is expensive and useless.</li>
            <li> Good product but not exceptional. Soothes and softens but so does just plain old olive oil.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001JEE5RK Dr Croc&#x27;s Repcillin Natural Skin Treatment 50g Tub]]    I have been using the repcillin for a few months for my childrens eczema and any rashes they might get. It has worked very well for my children. I thought I would also throw my little comment towards what it did for my burn.    Being a chef, I have seen my fair share of burns in the kitchen, after always using repcillin on my children I used the repcillin on a burn that I had got from boiling water. It was amazing, the burn ended up not leaving a scar (and i scar easily). So I thought I would tell the other moms out there not only to use the Repcillin for your babies, use it yourself,</li>
            <li> Long time psoriasis sufferer here.  I saw this product and a video (which in retrospect looks faked) and bought almost $100 worth of the product.  It had ZERO effect on my skin problems but my wallet is much lighter.  When I showed it to my dermatologist, he laughed and said, \\&quot;What do you expect?  All it consists of is beeswax, and a couple of seed oils. Probably a dollars worth of materials sold for 40 times that amount.  Crocodiles are not people and their \\&quot;oil\\&quot; has never been scientifically tested. You got taken by a snake oil con man.\\&quot;  Boy, was he right.  Note too that the \\&quot;manufacturer\\&quot; (an unlicensed company out of South Africa, no less) has no money back guarantee. I emailed them and they basically laughed at me when I told them I wanted a refund.  Somebody (like the food and drug administration) should investigate these scammers.  If I could rate this product no stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acute eczema for the past 16 years and was looking online for a natural product that could help me with my eczema, I had tried using steriods and other water based products but after reading information on the AlligatorOil,com website I thought I would try Repcillin. It has been amazing for my Eczema, thank you Amazon for listing a natural product for this skin disease, I recommend this product to anyone who has eczema or if their children have eczema, it is very gentle. It does not contain any of the chemicals I have come across in the past.</li>
            <li> The repcillin has worked for me, I have been using it for the past 10 days and it has shown the most results out of anything I have used...Josh</li>
            <li> Product really works.  My husband has had skin rashes/blotchiness/eczema symptoms for last 2 years.  Numerous trips to family doctor and dermatologist, with prescription lotions, ointments and medications have not worked.  After he applied the Repcillin daily for about a week, I saw significant improvement in his problem areas (feet, legs, arms).</li>
            <li> My son have a really, really bad eczema and this product did not deliver. This was just a big hype! Very, very expensive product but does not work it might work with a mild skin problem but not so good with people with bad skin problems. I suggest going to your doctor to get the steroid .05% cream! Even if you dont have insurance a tube of the steroid cream will cost you about $85.00 but it works so well. Yes, its expensive without insurance but works 100% don&#x27;t waste your money with this product..</li>
