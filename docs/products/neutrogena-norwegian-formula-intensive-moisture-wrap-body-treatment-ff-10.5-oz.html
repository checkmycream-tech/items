            <li>Our favorite hand cream!  </li>
            <li>The Neutogena Intense Moisture Treatment was best thing on the market</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m just going to attempt to make my own body butter since everything else I&#x27;ve tried has been to naught.</li>
            <li>Good product, will continue to use and purchase, hope to have more benefits, I will continue to focus on, thank you.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize though and it is nice on sensitive/dry kin</li>
            <li>It felt wonderful going on, smooth, light.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best lotion on the market.</li>
            <li>This lotion does nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>Nice non greasy lotion.  </li>
            <li>You know the kind....</li>
            <li>Lightweight, effective, and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily after it dries.</li>
            <li>honestly will never stop buying this.</li>
            <li>Sure I did - why not spread the love!</li>
            <li>I also loved the light fragrance since I&#x27;m not one for perfumes</li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, skin soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is just perfect as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>This product is the kind of product that you&#x27;d wake up one morning and go all &amp;#34;dang, my skin is smooth!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight and not sticky at all like some others.  </li>
            <li>Better price than Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Walgreen&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t, CVS never carries more than a couple of bottles, and WalMart sells out as soon as they get the product.  </li>
            <li>This product, despite being a body moisturizer, helped treat my cracked hands magically.</li>
            <li>and I have to order more.  </li>
            <li>If it does - please give me a Helpful Review CLICK below :)</li>
            <li>Delivery was on time and product  was okay</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion of all time.</li>
            <li>became watery, no longer really satisfying to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know of any brand that works better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it for my hands.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena lotion and this was cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li>NOTHING worked better for me.</li>
            <li>it seem just OK.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still better than the rest...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many others over the years.</li>
            <li>If you were pleased with body emulsion, don&#x27;t hesitate to try this now.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I can still find it online.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Like so many companies, they make a winner into a cheaper product and charge more for it.  </li>
            <li>While it works ok, it is overpriced.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My daughters also use this and love it.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to reapply my moisturizer more than two times a day.</li>
            <li>have used many products by Neutrogena before, and most of these products were meant for people with eczema.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this isn&#x27;t good for that.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry skin especially in the winter but great year round with an excellent texture and the product feels great</li>
            <li>This lotion for dry skin is the very best  for my husband to use...</li>
            <li>When they stopped carrying the product in the stores, I was thrilled  to find it on Amazon at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>I still use what is availablet because it is available in no-fragrance, and is still better than most I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Fast absorbing, excellent skin moisture and no greasy after feel.</li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>best moisture we use to keep skin wet and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I switched to using it on myself and have never used anything else.</li>
            <li>always loved it and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great investment in healthy, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>, the scented is way too strong, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I regret that Nertrogena is now catering to the &amp;#34;gotta-stay-young&amp;#34; crowd instead of just putting out fine products for</li>
            <li>Always best result for super dry skin!</li>
            <li>so I am only too happy to order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Except this and Neutrogena&#x27;s fragrance free hand</li>
            <li>Fortunately, he gave me a sample.  </li>
            <li>I think this ultra healing lotion is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has no discernible smell/aroma/odor and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>However, no longer available in my area</li>
            <li>Great product that actually works!</li>
            <li>This is a great product that is the only lotion that keeps my wife&#x27;s skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Like fragrance free, can&#x27;t always find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all greasy and gives you a smooth comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of deeply moisturizing my skin without leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>my skin always feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>makes your feet really smooth</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive to any kind of scent, I can&#x27;t even use most soaps or detergents without triggering a breakout on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to find this product at Amazon.com for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This is still a good product, works all day, just not as well as the old product.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free, easy on, non-greasy, easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known that the original Body Emulsion was going to be discontinued.  </li>
            <li>It also works great for any dry skin.</li>
            <li>So nice, not messy.  </li>
            <li>I bought a big bottle then and loved the way it felt.  </li>
            <li>The company changed the formula recently and it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be.</li>
            <li>Purchase price is fair and simple to buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years and with gegular usage the skin really improves.</li>
            <li>Nothing was good enough, not even things that people have said &amp;#34;cured their children&#x27;s eczema&amp;#34; or are &amp;#34;miracle workers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion on the market for severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>But again, if you or someone you care about has severely dry skin and/or eczema, I can confidently say that this worked amazingly well for both me and the lady on the YouTube</li>
            <li>right now I can still comfortably use this lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to apply moisturizer right after you shower, because your skin is still absorbing all of the moisture from the shower.</li>
            <li>as described with quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy, and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>this helps tremendously and it isn&#x27;t greasy...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and does not evaporate quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sharing the YouTube video here, because I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to look like a sponsored review if I post a link on here, but if you are interested in watching that video as well, you can just comment on my review</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sharing the YouTube video here, because I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to look like a sponsored review if I post a link on here, but if you are interested in watching that video as well, you can just comment on my review</li>
            <li>I purchased several bottles of the original product on Ebay for much more than they originally sold for.  </li>
            <li>This new formula is no where near as good.</li>
            <li>its great for the dried out cracked and crumbly skin on the body.</li>
            <li>Works very well, fragrance free, not for use on face as moisturizes well but would clog pores.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, and its quality has been consistant over the years.  </li>
            <li>My legs feel like soft, smooth, youthful looking skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like \\&quot;just like the dollar store lotion you normally pass by, except this time we&#x27;ve packaged it all pretty and even put it in a cardboard box</li>
            <li>But honestly, I can only assume that the feeling of instant relief comes at a cost in the long-term, having to continue reapplying over and over again, kind of like some lip balms out there.</li>
            <li>even though I&#x27;ve tried many different ways to stop my skin from itching, that does not mean that I won&#x27;t try more — I have to keep trying in order to stop this madness.</li>
            <li>I worried when I saw it, but Neutrogena&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>I saw results right away.</li>
            <li>used this product twice a day — right after the shower, and as I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>But most important is thpe difference it made to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was using Neutrogena body emulsion for years, and considered  that product the best on the market for dry rough skin.</li>
            <li>Right after the first day I tried it, I went out and bought the three bottles CVS had on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy, quick absorbing, doesn&#x27;t clog pores at all.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, flakey skin (sexy, right?!)</li>
            <li>Most lotions are the same.  </li>
            <li>and I got it very quickly thanks!</li>
            <li>You can definitely tell you have a lotion on, but it is not as greasy as many lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same formula.  </li>
            <li>like many deep moisturizing products often have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different lotions over the years...</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like that goo stuff</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena light sesamie body lotion for my whole body when I get out if the shower because it quickly absorbs and does not feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>i am very annoyed by the fact that Neutrogena company took off the market one of their best products.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the extra, and is ways available at Amazon whereas not always in the stores.</li>
            <li>b/c the reviews of it were overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li>Completely cures mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It feels greasy and feels less effective.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m not exaggerating) pretty much hundreds of oils, lotions, ointments, antihistamines, gels — anything, really, to stop the dryness and the itching.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use a drop of water with it to cover a large area.  </li>
            <li>one day a couple of weeks ago I ran into a little video on YouTube of a woman (completely unsponsored, in her home, just talking to the camera from her own experience, about her own experience) discussing how she got rid of her dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It will be perfect now that the season is getting chilly.</li>
            <li>As a child I can still recall how she pronounced the name in her light Norwegian accent.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave you greasy, I really feel the lotion moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>High quality moisture cream!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin very greasy.  </li>
            <li>did I really just say that?)</li>
            <li>Come real summer-time, I&#x27;ll have to find something lighter because it&#x27;s humid here</li>
            <li>Too much fragrance is off-putting to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is light enough for me to use on both, absorbs well, does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>When all my reserves finished I bought this intense Moisture wrap on advise of</li>
            <li>When they took Body Emulsion off the market I was very worried.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve marketed this product to be \\&quot;intense moisture</li>
            <li>yeah, not so much.</li>
            <li>Yes, it indeed wraps your whole body in intense moisture that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I absolutely MUST go with the unscented though</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for what you get.</li>
            <li>Really does the trick to moisturize.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into your skin really fast.</li>
            <li>A terrific standard body lotion that is as effective as a cream.  </li>
            <li>A non-greasy, long lasting, very effective moisturizing lotion which I use as a hand lotion but can be used as a total body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I know you&#x27;re probably thinking that I sound like an infomercial, but this video was so clearly not an infomercial that I thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Now,</li>
            <li>It was the first time in my life that I was able to use a lotion while my hands were raw which didn&#x27;t make me almost weep with pain.  </li>
            <li>My new go-to product!</li>
            <li>Good cleansing wrap that works extremely well on perpetually dry and cracking skin.</li>
            <li>and this particular formula doesnt deserve the hype.  </li>
            <li>I have never been that pleased, but this specific project is very different.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and they are too oily or hard, this is just right.</li>
            <li>At the end of her video, the woman posted before and after pictures: her flaky, dry skin had turned to normal, smooth skin within about two weeks.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve had a very hard time finding a good all day lotion that soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>It really keeps my skin soft and supple without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to apply a whole lot to my skin for it to naturally change it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>This new one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I could use the emulsion in the morning and really not require anything more until the following morning.</li>
            <li>Having said that, it still works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used out there and the only reason why it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because I&#x27;m leaving that empty in memory of the Body</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it if you want silky soft skin all over.</li>
            <li>I’d also like to note that I have very sensitive skin, and this formula does not irritate my skin, nor does it have an obnoxious fragrance (or chemical odor)</li>
            <li>I would have preferred to pay normal inflationary increases in order to keep the old formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well and quickly absorbed and has a long and efficient effect on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so smooth going on and felt as if it really penetrated my skin but left absolutely no greasy residue!</li>
            <li>My skin is 78 yr old and it just loves this lotion, does not need the new stuff.</li>
            <li>I live in an arid climate, and this product relieves my discomfort and leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>It prevents dry skin and the itchies that go with it, has a nice consistency, and little ,if any, odor.</li>
            <li>This reformulation is not as rich or as long lasting.  </li>
            <li>As someone who uses lotion every day, I was looking for a product to show a little extra love to my legs, feet, knees, and elbows.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned I will purchase this lotion the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>and I paniced when it was no longer being carried in my local stores, but thanks to amazon, I found it even if .  </li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t even compare to their old product.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is the replacement for the old Neutrogena Body Emulsion which they&#x27;ve discontinued.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day I have some skin dry-ness with this one whereas there was none with the old one.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this lotion has never caused redness, rash, dryness, etc. or been been a problem in any way.</li>
            <li>light enough to use as an all purpose around the clock lotion, yet still moisturizes extremely well and is not oily.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s the exact same stuff, at least in the fragrance free formula.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product, same ingredients (I had an old Body Emulsion box).  </li>
            <li>Hope Neutrogena will continue producing this amazing product or else I&#x27;ll have to start a new frustrating search for my next hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  Neutrogena Norwegian Intensive Moisture Formula for skin care.  </li>
            <li>The weather here in Florida is different from in Turkey, and I think that makes a little difference in the way products perform, but it has been fine.</li>
            <li>Apparently their old product worked wonders.</li>
            <li>This product really hydrates and protects dry skin.</li>
            <li>my last dermatologist recommended these two products, I rolled my eyes and almost didn&#x27;t try it because I&#x27;ve dumped so much money into various moisturizers over the years.  </li>
            <li>When I contacted Neutrogena, they gave me the usual \\&quot;try it, you&#x27;ll like it,\\&quot; without coming out and saying why they had discontinued the original formula.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to people who suffer from severely dry skin, eczema, who feel that they need to reapply moisturizer constantly, and to people with children who suffer from child eczema, because I do believe that the right moisturizer could actually fix the skin from the inside as well as from the outside; I do believe that it could prevent your child from having eczema as an adult, but I&#x27;m no pro,</li>
            <li>I am very glad that Amazon has this product because I am unable to find it in my local pharmacies.</li>
            <li>BUT I regret the small 1/2 oz size is available only in the scented version now.  </li>
            <li>This is the only lotion that helps my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this for a while, I can definitely conclude the old Emulsion worked and</li>
            <li>She talked about several different things that she tried to do and use, but she was absolutely ecstatic talking about this specific product.</li>
            <li>After I use this moisturizer, my hands are in perfect condition in frigid winters.</li>
            <li>The neutrogena formula has contained my dry skin problem and I would highly recommend its use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone with persistently problematic dry skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find out about this product from Neutrogena, so my hands were in pretty bad shape by the time my daughter found this new generation of the product for me.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea, because my issue is exactly the opposite, but this is obviously for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin, I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin (i.e.  eczema or other skin issues).</li>
            <li>Really the only lotion that works for my dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Norwegian Formula for decades as no other lotion really works on my very dry hands.</li>
            <li>No other products have caused such an improvement and I tried dozens.</li>
            <li>But this Neutrogena Moisture Wrap can help keep my skin soft all day long.</li>
            <li>Works very very well on extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have 72 year old dry sun and burn damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>But decided to apply some to my face (I have extremely sensitive and dry skin) and I got pimples that would not go away for 4-5 days</li>
            <li>I first used this Norwegian Formula when I was in Turkey a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>I guess they wanted to go cheaper and make more money, because there new product stinks.</li>
            <li>have severe lifelong atopic dermatitis (eczema), making my skin exceptionally sensitive and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I get very allergic to random things very quickly, and it all appears as rashes, itching, dry, flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin (and also some eczema and ichthyosis) .  </li>
            <li>We get the extreme weather conditions where we live.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried it, from vitamins to every other company&#x27;s guaranteed-to-work lotions for sensitive, dry skin, to natural</li>

            <li> Our favorite hand cream!  </li>
            <li> The Neutogena Intense Moisture Treatment was best thing on the market</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just going to attempt to make my own body butter since everything else I&#x27;ve tried has been to naught.</li>
            <li> Good product, will continue to use and purchase, hope to have more benefits, I will continue to focus on, thank you.</li>

            <li> This is absolutely the best lotion on the market.</li>
            <li> This lotion does nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Nice non greasy lotion.  </li>
            <li> You know the kind....</li>
            <li> Lightweight, effective, and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily after it dries.</li>
            <li> honestly will never stop buying this.</li>
            <li> Sure I did - why not spread the love!</li>
            <li> I also loved the light fragrance since I&#x27;m not one for perfumes</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, skin soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is just perfect as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> This product is the kind of product that you&#x27;d wake up one morning and go all &amp;#34;dang, my skin is smooth!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight and not sticky at all like some others.  </li>
            <li> Better price than Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Walgreen&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t, CVS never carries more than a couple of bottles, and WalMart sells out as soon as they get the product.  </li>
            <li> This product, despite being a body moisturizer, helped treat my cracked hands magically.</li>
            <li> and I have to order more.  </li>
            <li> If it does - please give me a Helpful Review CLICK below :)</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and product  was okay</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion of all time.</li>
            <li> became watery, no longer really satisfying to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know of any brand that works better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it for my hands.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena lotion and this was cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li> NOTHING worked better for me.</li>
            <li> it seem just OK.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still better than the rest...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many others over the years.</li>
            <li> If you were pleased with body emulsion, don&#x27;t hesitate to try this now.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I can still find it online.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Like so many companies, they make a winner into a cheaper product and charge more for it.  </li>
            <li> While it works ok, it is overpriced.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My daughters also use this and love it.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to reapply my moisturizer more than two times a day.</li>
            <li> have used many products by Neutrogena before, and most of these products were meant for people with eczema.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this isn&#x27;t good for that.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin especially in the winter but great year round with an excellent texture and the product feels great</li>
            <li> This lotion for dry skin is the very best  for my husband to use...</li>
            <li> When they stopped carrying the product in the stores, I was thrilled  to find it on Amazon at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> I still use what is availablet because it is available in no-fragrance, and is still better than most I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Fast absorbing, excellent skin moisture and no greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> best moisture we use to keep skin wet and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I switched to using it on myself and have never used anything else.</li>
            <li> always loved it and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great investment in healthy, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> , the scented is way too strong, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I regret that Nertrogena is now catering to the &amp;#34;gotta-stay-young&amp;#34; crowd instead of just putting out fine products for</li>
            <li> Always best result for super dry skin!</li>
            <li> so I am only too happy to order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Except this and Neutrogena&#x27;s fragrance free hand</li>
            <li> Fortunately, he gave me a sample.  </li>
            <li> I think this ultra healing lotion is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has no discernible smell/aroma/odor and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> However, no longer available in my area</li>
            <li> Great product that actually works!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is the only lotion that keeps my wife&#x27;s skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Like fragrance free, can&#x27;t always find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all greasy and gives you a smooth comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of deeply moisturizing my skin without leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> my skin always feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> makes your feet really smooth</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive to any kind of scent, I can&#x27;t even use most soaps or detergents without triggering a breakout on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this product at Amazon.com for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This is still a good product, works all day, just not as well as the old product.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, easy on, non-greasy, easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known that the original Body Emulsion was going to be discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It also works great for any dry skin.</li>
            <li> So nice, not messy.  </li>
            <li> I bought a big bottle then and loved the way it felt.  </li>
            <li> The company changed the formula recently and it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Purchase price is fair and simple to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and with gegular usage the skin really improves.</li>
            <li> Nothing was good enough, not even things that people have said &amp;#34;cured their children&#x27;s eczema&amp;#34; or are &amp;#34;miracle workers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion on the market for severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> But again, if you or someone you care about has severely dry skin and/or eczema, I can confidently say that this worked amazingly well for both me and the lady on the YouTube</li>
            <li> right now I can still comfortably use this lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to apply moisturizer right after you shower, because your skin is still absorbing all of the moisture from the shower.</li>
            <li> as described with quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy, and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> this helps tremendously and it isn&#x27;t greasy...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and does not evaporate quickly</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sharing the YouTube video here, because I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to look like a sponsored review if I post a link on here, but if you are interested in watching that video as well, you can just comment on my review</li>

            <li> I purchased several bottles of the original product on Ebay for much more than they originally sold for.  </li>
            <li> This new formula is no where near as good.</li>
            <li> its great for the dried out cracked and crumbly skin on the body.</li>
            <li> Works very well, fragrance free, not for use on face as moisturizes well but would clog pores.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, and its quality has been consistant over the years.  </li>
            <li> My legs feel like soft, smooth, youthful looking skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like \\&quot;just like the dollar store lotion you normally pass by, except this time we&#x27;ve packaged it all pretty and even put it in a cardboard box</li>
            <li> But honestly, I can only assume that the feeling of instant relief comes at a cost in the long-term, having to continue reapplying over and over again, kind of like some lip balms out there.</li>
            <li> even though I&#x27;ve tried many different ways to stop my skin from itching, that does not mean that I won&#x27;t try more — I have to keep trying in order to stop this madness.</li>
            <li> I worried when I saw it, but Neutrogena&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> I saw results right away.</li>
            <li> used this product twice a day — right after the shower, and as I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> But most important is thpe difference it made to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was using Neutrogena body emulsion for years, and considered  that product the best on the market for dry rough skin.</li>
            <li> Right after the first day I tried it, I went out and bought the three bottles CVS had on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy, quick absorbing, doesn&#x27;t clog pores at all.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, flakey skin (sexy, right?!)</li>
            <li> Most lotions are the same.  </li>
            <li> and I got it very quickly thanks!</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell you have a lotion on, but it is not as greasy as many lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same formula.  </li>
            <li> like many deep moisturizing products often have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different lotions over the years...</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like that goo stuff</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena light sesamie body lotion for my whole body when I get out if the shower because it quickly absorbs and does not feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> i am very annoyed by the fact that Neutrogena company took off the market one of their best products.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the extra, and is ways available at Amazon whereas not always in the stores.</li>
            <li> b/c the reviews of it were overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li> Completely cures mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It feels greasy and feels less effective.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m not exaggerating) pretty much hundreds of oils, lotions, ointments, antihistamines, gels — anything, really, to stop the dryness and the itching.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a drop of water with it to cover a large area.  </li>
            <li> one day a couple of weeks ago I ran into a little video on YouTube of a woman (completely unsponsored, in her home, just talking to the camera from her own experience, about her own experience) discussing how she got rid of her dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It will be perfect now that the season is getting chilly.</li>
            <li> As a child I can still recall how she pronounced the name in her light Norwegian accent.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave you greasy, I really feel the lotion moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> High quality moisture cream!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin very greasy.  </li>
            <li> did I really just say that?)</li>
            <li> Come real summer-time, I&#x27;ll have to find something lighter because it&#x27;s humid here</li>
            <li> Too much fragrance is off-putting to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is light enough for me to use on both, absorbs well, does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> When all my reserves finished I bought this intense Moisture wrap on advise of</li>
            <li> When they took Body Emulsion off the market I was very worried.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve marketed this product to be \\&quot;intense moisture</li>
            <li> yeah, not so much.</li>
            <li> Yes, it indeed wraps your whole body in intense moisture that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely MUST go with the unscented though</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Really does the trick to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into your skin really fast.</li>
            <li> A terrific standard body lotion that is as effective as a cream.  </li>
            <li> A non-greasy, long lasting, very effective moisturizing lotion which I use as a hand lotion but can be used as a total body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re probably thinking that I sound like an infomercial, but this video was so clearly not an infomercial that I thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Now,</li>
            <li> It was the first time in my life that I was able to use a lotion while my hands were raw which didn&#x27;t make me almost weep with pain.  </li>
            <li> My new go-to product!</li>
            <li> Good cleansing wrap that works extremely well on perpetually dry and cracking skin.</li>
            <li> and this particular formula doesnt deserve the hype.  </li>
            <li> I have never been that pleased, but this specific project is very different.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and they are too oily or hard, this is just right.</li>
            <li> At the end of her video, the woman posted before and after pictures: her flaky, dry skin had turned to normal, smooth skin within about two weeks.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve had a very hard time finding a good all day lotion that soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> It really keeps my skin soft and supple without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to apply a whole lot to my skin for it to naturally change it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> This new one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I could use the emulsion in the morning and really not require anything more until the following morning.</li>
            <li> Having said that, it still works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used out there and the only reason why it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because I&#x27;m leaving that empty in memory of the Body</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it if you want silky soft skin all over.</li>
            <li> I’d also like to note that I have very sensitive skin, and this formula does not irritate my skin, nor does it have an obnoxious fragrance (or chemical odor)</li>
            <li> I would have preferred to pay normal inflationary increases in order to keep the old formula.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is well and quickly absorbed and has a long and efficient effect on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so smooth going on and felt as if it really penetrated my skin but left absolutely no greasy residue!</li>
            <li> My skin is 78 yr old and it just loves this lotion, does not need the new stuff.</li>
            <li> I live in an arid climate, and this product relieves my discomfort and leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> It prevents dry skin and the itchies that go with it, has a nice consistency, and little ,if any, odor.</li>
            <li> This reformulation is not as rich or as long lasting.  </li>
            <li> As someone who uses lotion every day, I was looking for a product to show a little extra love to my legs, feet, knees, and elbows.  </li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned I will purchase this lotion the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> and I paniced when it was no longer being carried in my local stores, but thanks to amazon, I found it even if .  </li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t even compare to their old product.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is the replacement for the old Neutrogena Body Emulsion which they&#x27;ve discontinued.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day I have some skin dry-ness with this one whereas there was none with the old one.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this lotion has never caused redness, rash, dryness, etc. or been been a problem in any way.</li>
            <li> light enough to use as an all purpose around the clock lotion, yet still moisturizes extremely well and is not oily.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s the exact same stuff, at least in the fragrance free formula.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product, same ingredients (I had an old Body Emulsion box).  </li>
            <li> Hope Neutrogena will continue producing this amazing product or else I&#x27;ll have to start a new frustrating search for my next hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  Neutrogena Norwegian Intensive Moisture Formula for skin care.  </li>
            <li> The weather here in Florida is different from in Turkey, and I think that makes a little difference in the way products perform, but it has been fine.</li>
            <li> Apparently their old product worked wonders.</li>
            <li> This product really hydrates and protects dry skin.</li>
            <li> my last dermatologist recommended these two products, I rolled my eyes and almost didn&#x27;t try it because I&#x27;ve dumped so much money into various moisturizers over the years.  </li>
            <li> When I contacted Neutrogena, they gave me the usual \\&quot;try it, you&#x27;ll like it,\\&quot; without coming out and saying why they had discontinued the original formula.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to people who suffer from severely dry skin, eczema, who feel that they need to reapply moisturizer constantly, and to people with children who suffer from child eczema, because I do believe that the right moisturizer could actually fix the skin from the inside as well as from the outside; I do believe that it could prevent your child from having eczema as an adult, but I&#x27;m no pro,</li>
            <li> I am very glad that Amazon has this product because I am unable to find it in my local pharmacies.</li>
            <li> BUT I regret the small 1/2 oz size is available only in the scented version now.  </li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that helps my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for a while, I can definitely conclude the old Emulsion worked and</li>
            <li> She talked about several different things that she tried to do and use, but she was absolutely ecstatic talking about this specific product.</li>
            <li> After I use this moisturizer, my hands are in perfect condition in frigid winters.</li>
            <li> The neutrogena formula has contained my dry skin problem and I would highly recommend its use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone with persistently problematic dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find out about this product from Neutrogena, so my hands were in pretty bad shape by the time my daughter found this new generation of the product for me.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea, because my issue is exactly the opposite, but this is obviously for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin, I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin (i.e.  eczema or other skin issues).</li>
            <li> Really the only lotion that works for my dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Norwegian Formula for decades as no other lotion really works on my very dry hands.</li>
            <li> No other products have caused such an improvement and I tried dozens.</li>
            <li> But this Neutrogena Moisture Wrap can help keep my skin soft all day long.</li>
            <li> Works very very well on extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have 72 year old dry sun and burn damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> But decided to apply some to my face (I have extremely sensitive and dry skin) and I got pimples that would not go away for 4-5 days</li>
            <li> I first used this Norwegian Formula when I was in Turkey a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I guess they wanted to go cheaper and make more money, because there new product stinks.</li>
            <li> have severe lifelong atopic dermatitis (eczema), making my skin exceptionally sensitive and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I get very allergic to random things very quickly, and it all appears as rashes, itching, dry, flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin (and also some eczema and ichthyosis) .  </li>
            <li> We get the extreme weather conditions where we live.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried it, from vitamins to every other company&#x27;s guaranteed-to-work lotions for sensitive, dry skin, to natural</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a normal lotion, just a little pricier.</li>
            <li> I had very dry, scaley and itchy skin on my legs and have tried numerous lotions to no long term effect.</li>
            <li> Not enough for my horribly dry skin, especially now that winter&#x27;s on us.</li>
            <li> When your hands are so dry and raw that just flexing them to type makes them crack and bleed, putting on standard lotion feels like pouring straight alcohol on a cut.  </li>
            <li> Intensive moisture wrap body treatment is not the same thing by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still shopping.</li>
            <li> Is also long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written a long, extensive review about it on another purchase I&#x27;ve made of a pack of three of these, so I&#x27;ll just paste it here, because it&#x27;s about the product, not the pack of three, so</li>
            <li> It is the only moisturizer that takes care of dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> It is the only thing that helps my dry skin</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that can heal my dry, cracked, wind burned skin.</li>
            <li> That was the only lotion that worked for the problem dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that moisturizes my extremely dry skin and keeps it moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> Only stuff that works on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this product, the red patches were clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive than other brands</li>
            <li> I have tried many other expensive lotions that are for extremely dry skin but this product outshines all of them.</li>
            <li> Instead, it felt dry and wet at the same time.</li>
            <li> With regular use, it has erased the dry, flaky feeling I used to get after shaving my legs and has eliminated the rough spots on my heels.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other products have tried, this product does not feel like a miracle — you don&#x27;t feel instant relief of anything.</li>
            <li> Will eliminate dry skin in one application.</li>
            <li> I have severe eczema on my hands and extremely dry skin otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wait for my skin to absorb it or for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have particularly dry skin</li>
            <li> I am diabetic &amp; skin gets really dry...</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> This is my go to dry skin cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cracked dry skin on my hands for about 30 years.  </li>
            <li> that takes care of my dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate and makes dry patches go away.</li>
            <li> no issues with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My dry skin loves this.</li>
            <li> Once you let this lotion dry and absorb into your skin, it does wonders.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my skin is so severely dry, I would assume that if you have a combination or oily skin – this probably is going to do a lot of damage.</li>
            <li> I swear, within only a few days of using it my skin looks younger and healthier.</li>
            <li> Also keeps wrinkles down &amp; stops flaking, itching, and dry white lines from appearing.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to reapply my moisturizers in the middle of the night (yes, that would mean waking up, especially because my skin is itching) and then also multiple times during the day.</li>
            <li> No flaky dry skin this winter!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and their former version of it, the emulsion, for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and with hard water in our area; I mix this with a drop of tea tree oil and serves as moisturizer and antiseptic.</li>
            <li> Because I have very dry skin with eczema.</li>
            <li> In addition I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin - try this product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin-especially on my hands and face.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and cracked skin, and this product helps it stay moisturized for the day.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and other moisturizer barely last half a day.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin due to my eczema and I use this after a shower every day.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Also, there is absolutely no odor, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I only wish that the price would come down a little or</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need to use a lot either, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The other Neutrogena products, including the &amp;#34;hand cream&amp;#34;, will NOT work like this product does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try other products before buying this again.</li>
            <li> Skin especially dry, wrinkly, and flaky during winter.  </li>
            <li> I have used it immediately on small burns &amp; cuts &amp; cold sores and heal up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer that said this is just like any other lotion out there</li>
            <li> Not too pricey either, although not economical.</li>
            <li> Every other lotion I tried would work for a few hours and than need to be reapplied - this stuff lasts all day.</li>
            <li> If you apply it at night before bed, you will still feel it slightly in the morning.</li>
            <li> (typically this type of reaction to a lotion would go away in 24 hrs) which makes me believe that it stays under your skin for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> No greasy mess.</li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> I swim three times a week in a heavily chlorinated pool.  </li>
            <li> In the dry, cold winters, this is the only product that keeps my hands from cracking and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure why the previous reviewer complained about the change from emulsion to moisture wrap.  </li>
            <li> it splits open and bleeds all Winter long, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to heal.  </li>
            <li> This item is sometimes difficult to find in our local stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your ordinary moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> However, it is a bit expensive and there are no store brand &#x27;compare to Neutrogena Norwegian Formula&#x27; product!</li>
            <li> the past I have tried</li>
            <li> Very thick, just need a little.</li>
            <li> You know, common sense stuff</li>
            <li> Seriously makes me nauseous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been to dermatologists since I was four, but occasionally, my skin would get so bad nothing at all would help.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how thin this is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been increasingly difficult to find over the years, and I have no idea</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well without weird residues or odors</li>
            <li> Sad that none of the stores in our area carry this product any longer.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually sorry.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the feeling that my hands are dirty</li>
            <li> I, too, feel frustrated that they no longer make the emulsion formula.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> as described with quick delivery.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that helps my skin feels soft. Because I have very dry skin with eczema. This works wonders!</li>
            <li> A terrific standard body lotion that is as effective as a cream.  I couldn&#x27;t find any in my local drugstore (CVS) so I am only too happy to order it from Amazon.  It will be perfect now that the season is getting chilly.</li>
            <li> Terrific lotion.  I use it as a face and hand cream at night.  It is not greasy, and it absorbs quickly.  An excellent product, well packaged.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion , for YEARS!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  The only moisture cream I use.  Fragrance free, easy on, non-greasy, easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  I have a bottle in all bathrooms, the kitchen, the car, etc.  So nice, not messy.  Sometimes I use a drop of water with it to cover a large area.  Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this....been trying to find the one that is not longer made...this is that replacement and she loves it!!!!</li>
            <li> My Grandmother introduced me to Neutrogena products.  As a child I can still recall how she pronounced the name in her light Norwegian accent.  As a mother I used the baby soap on my babies.  As a grandmother now I am still using this wonderful product.  Along with the nostalgia it is the best of products.  Just wish they would quit messing around with it referring to intensive moisture wrap, aka, body emulsion.  I also loved the light fragrance since I&#x27;m not one for perfumes but I can&#x27;t find that either.  So this is progress?</li>
            <li> I guess they wanted to go cheaper and make more money, because there new product stinks. The Neutogena Intense Moisture Treatment was best thing on the market and I have used for close to 2 decades. I was so happy to be able to get the product online, since it is no longer sold in stores!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever purchased. I use it on my face and body. It does not leave you greasy, I really feel the lotion moisturizing my skin. As far as I am concerned I will purchase this lotion the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> High quality moisture cream!</li>
            <li> I swim three times a week in a heavily chlorinated pool.  In addition I have very dry skin.  The neutrogena formula has contained my dry skin problem and I would highly recommend its use.</li>
            <li> been usuing this lotion for about 15 yrs. and I paniced when it was no longer being carried in my local stores, but thanks to amazon, I found it even if .  It is worth every penny, and its quality has been consistant over the years.  My skin is 78 yr old and it just loves this lotion, does not need the new stuff.</li>
            <li> I used to get patches of red skin that itched on my face below my eyes. Within a few days of using this product, the red patches were clear. If I stop using this product they come back so I stocked up with several bottles and will continue to purchase this until they stop making it.  No other products have caused such an improvement and I tried dozens. It also works great for any dry skin. If you apply it at night before bed, you will still feel it slightly in the morning.</li>
            <li> The best lotion available on the market. Will eliminate dry skin in one application. Cured cradle cap on my youngest son. Completely cures mild psoriasis. No Oder. No greasy mess. The only lotion to buy.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter and I.  It is the only moisturizer that takes care of dry, itchy skin.  It relieves the itch like nothing else.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Better price than Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve been using this and their former version of it, the emulsion, for the past several years.  I have severe eczema on my hands and extremely dry skin otherwise.  My skin is so sensitive to any kind of scent, I can&#x27;t even use most soaps or detergents without triggering a breakout on my hands.  Most lotions are the same.  I&#x27;d been to dermatologists since I was four, but occasionally, my skin would get so bad nothing at all would help.  When your hands are so dry and raw that just flexing them to type makes them crack and bleed, putting on standard lotion feels like pouring straight alcohol on a cut.  You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it, from vitamins to every other company&#x27;s guaranteed-to-work lotions for sensitive, dry skin, to natural stuff--  none of it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this and Neutrogena&#x27;s fragrance free hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my last dermatologist recommended these two products, I rolled my eyes and almost didn&#x27;t try it because I&#x27;ve dumped so much money into various moisturizers over the years.  Fortunately, he gave me a sample.  Right after the first day I tried it, I went out and bought the three bottles CVS had on the shelf.  It was the first time in my life that I was able to use a lotion while my hands were raw which didn&#x27;t make me almost weep with pain.  It didn&#x27;t aggravate the itching, and it WORKED.  I can&#x27;t begin to describe the relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one and only fear is that they&#x27;ll discontinue the product.  It&#x27;s been increasingly difficult to find over the years, and I have no idea why.  Walgreen&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t, CVS never carries more than a couple of bottles, and WalMart sells out as soon as they get the product.  Thank goodness I can buy it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I&#x27;m not sure why the previous reviewer complained about the change from emulsion to moisture wrap.  That change happened *three years ago*.  I worried when I saw it, but Neutrogena&#x27;s right - it&#x27;s the exact same stuff, at least in the fragrance free formula. Believe me, with my skin, I would know immediately if it wasn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve used it every day since the name changed.  It&#x27;s just a difference in packaging and name.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this product at Amazon.com for such a reasonable price.  The stores in my area no longer carry this product.  It is the only thing that helps my dry skin and I&#x27;ve tried everything out there on the market.</li>
            <li> I, too, feel frustrated that they no longer make the emulsion formula.  They say this is the same, but it&#x27;s not.  I could use the emulsion in the morning and really not require anything more until the following morning. I wrote customer service and they told me this was the same stuff just renamed.  Not true.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t even compare to their old product.  I agree with the previous reviewer that said this is just like any other lotion out there and this particular formula doesnt deserve the hype.  They&#x27;ve lost me as a customer...</li>
            <li> I think this ultra healing lotion is fantastic. I put it on in the morning and it lasts all day.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin very greasy.  As soon as I put it on, I can immediately carry on with my day.  I don&#x27;t have to wait for my skin to absorb it or for it to dry.  It&#x27;s very light weight and not sticky at all like some others.  I have particularly dry skin and I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing lotion ever!! I am diabetic &amp; skin gets really dry...this helps tremendously and it isn&#x27;t greasy...&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena is a great brand, the Norwegian formula is the best of the best</li>
            <li> this is very good hand lotion. Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Mom&#x27;s happy-- when mom is happy everybody wins</li>
            <li> I used to have cracked hands in winter and have tried various creams, lotions, oils and didn&#x27;t notice a tiny improvement. I have tried Neutragena&#x27;s hand cream as well but it didn&#x27;t help. This product, despite being a body moisturizer, helped treat my cracked hands magically. After I use this moisturizer, my hands are in perfect condition in frigid winters. I am very glad that Amazon has this product because I am unable to find it in my local pharmacies. Hope Neutrogena will continue producing this amazing product or else I&#x27;ll have to start a new frustrating search for my next hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Its a great product and I got it very quickly thanks!</li>
            <li> I first used this Norwegian Formula when I was in Turkey a few years ago.  I bought a big bottle then and loved the way it felt.  It was so smooth going on and felt as if it really penetrated my skin but left absolutely no greasy residue! It was perfect! The weather here in Florida is different from in Turkey, and I think that makes a little difference in the way products perform, but it has been fine.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! It is the only thing that can heal my dry, cracked, wind burned skin. You don&#x27;t even need to use a lot either, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion almost a decade ago per our pediatrician&#x27;s recommendation for my son&#x27;s ongoing eczema battles. I was using it on him when he was just a newborn, forgoing all the baby products. I loved it so much, I switched to using it on myself and have never used anything else. Almost a decade later, I am using it on both my kids now to manage their eczema outbreaks and on myself as well! Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin (and also some eczema and ichthyosis) .  This lotion is amazing! It moisturizes well without weird residues or odors - I&#x27;ve had a very hard time finding a good all day lotion that soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothing.  Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin, I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin (i.e.  eczema or other skin issues).</li>
            <li> In the dry, cold winters, this is the only product that keeps my hands from cracking and bleeding.  Now my family has discovered it and I have to order more.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t make it anymore. It&#x27;s the only thing I can use on my face. Non-greasy, quick absorbing, doesn&#x27;t clog pores at all. And a dab&#x27;ll do ya. Why they stopped making this product, I&#x27;ll never know. Buy them while they&#x27;re still in stock. (Oh, wait - did I really just say that?) Sure I did - why not spread the love! Hope this review helps you make an informed decision about your next purchase. If it does - please give me a Helpful Review CLICK below :)</li>
            <li> I believe this is the replacement for the old Neutrogena Body Emulsion which they&#x27;ve discontinued. I don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;d do that but I&#x27;m not going to belabor something I have no control over. This is still a good product, works all day, just not as well as the old product. By the end of the day I have some skin dry-ness with this one whereas there was none with the old one. Having said that, it still works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used out there and the only reason why it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because I&#x27;m leaving that empty in memory of the Body Emulsion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a while, I can definitely conclude the old Emulsion worked and this one just kinda doesn&#x27;t. Not enough for my horribly dry skin, especially now that winter&#x27;s on us. Now I&#x27;m just going to attempt to make my own body butter since everything else I&#x27;ve tried has been to naught.</li>
            <li> Our family has used this product for years. It is perfect. Excellent for dry skin especially in the winter but great year round with an excellent texture and the product feels great</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and product  was okay</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry.  I have been using this product for years and have seen a difference in my skin.  When they stopped carrying the product in the stores, I was thrilled  to find it on Amazon at such a great price.  Thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li> For the money, nothing beats this.  If you have very dry skin - try this product. Best to use right out of shower.</li>
            <li> Good product, will continue to use and purchase, hope to have more benefits, I will continue to focus on, thank you.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion of all time.</li>
            <li> its great for the dried out cracked and crumbly skin on the body. captez</li>
            <li> It contains lanolin which I like but this does not work for hand lotion. Leaves the feeling that my hands are dirty and I need to wash them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best hand lotion I have used is Neutrogena Body Moisturizer Daily Therapeutic lotion. It disappeared. Now it is on Amazon for $45 bucks a bottle. Whoa! Intensive moisture wrap body treatment is not the same thing by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still shopping.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and with hard water in our area; I mix this with a drop of tea tree oil and serves as moisturizer and antiseptic.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin due to my eczema and I use this after a shower every day. It&#x27;s moisturizing and does not evaporate quickly but my skin needs that level of moisturization, especially in winter in Maine. Come real summer-time, I&#x27;ll have to find something lighter because it&#x27;s humid here but it&#x27;s spring and 60 degrees out right now I can still comfortably use this lotion every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has no discernible smell/aroma/odor and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena hand cream and body lotions for years - but when the company was sold (as I understand it, to J&amp;J)  the lotions began to deteriorate ..... became watery, no longer really satisfying to the skin.  the best ones discontinued.  I still use what is availablet because it is available in no-fragrance, and is still better than most I&#x27;ve tried.  I regret that Nertrogena is now catering to the &amp;#34;gotta-stay-young&amp;#34; crowd instead of just putting out fine products for every-day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hand cream, tho, is still great. BUT I regret the small 1/2 oz size is available only in the scented version now.  Too much fragrance is off-putting to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;Sadly</li>
            <li> I bout it b/c the reviews of it were overwhelmingly positive. I prefer the neutrogena hand cream. I don&#x27;t like how thin this is. With a name like body wrap, I was expecting to feel luxurious and protected with it on. Instead, it felt dry and wet at the same time. It does moisturize though and it is nice on sensitive/dry kin</li>
            <li> I had very dry, scaley and itchy skin on my legs and have tried numerous lotions to no long term effect. I was looking for one of those creams/balms advertised for Norwegian fishermen when I decided to buy this. It felt wonderful going on, smooth, light. You can definitely tell you have a lotion on, but it is not as greasy as many lotions I have tried. But most important is thpe difference it made to my dry skin. My legs feel like soft, smooth, youthful looking skin! And the effects  last even when I don&#x27;t use it for days. I am amazed! I am going to try the daily lotion next and see if it will maintain the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product...it has made me a happy lady!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have very dry skin-especially on my hands and face. This is light enough for me to use on both, absorbs well, does not cause breakouts. I swear, within only a few days of using it my skin looks younger and healthier. My new go-to product!</li>
            <li> I have 72 year old dry sun and burn damaged skin.  Skin especially dry, wrinkly, and flaky during winter.  Applied right after a bath or shower, this product best I&#x27;ve found for keeping skin plumped up &amp; retaining moisture.  Also keeps wrinkles down &amp; stops flaking, itching, and dry white lines from appearing.  Is also long lasting.  However, no longer available in my area so I have to by it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good cleansing wrap that works extremely well on perpetually dry and cracking skin. Don&#x27;t know of any brand that works better.</li>
            <li> Always best result for super dry skin!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it for my hands. But decided to apply some to my face (I have extremely sensitive and dry skin) and I got pimples that would not go away for 4-5 days (typically this type of reaction to a lotion would go away in 24 hrs) which makes me believe that it stays under your skin for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer that I have ever used. My skin is extremely dry and other moisturizer barely last half a day. But this Neutrogena Moisture Wrap can help keep my skin soft all day long.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for my wife again (Not a present) as she loves it and uses it every day. Sad that none of the stores in our area carry this product any longer. She has tried a number of so-called hand creams but likes this best.</li>
            <li> The best lotion ever!  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Great product that actually works!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I love Neutrogena lotion and this was cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li> Our favorite hand cream!  We get the extreme weather conditions where we live.  This lotion works well.  But, don&#x27;t forget the gloves!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  Neutrogena Norwegian Intensive Moisture Formula for skin care.  It&#x27;s the best skin care product I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used it for many, many years</li>
            <li> I only wish that the price would come down a little or I would like to see it sold in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best lotion on the market.</li>
            <li> I was using Neutrogena body emulsion for years, and considered  that product the best on the market for dry rough skin. NOTHING worked better for me. When Body emulsion was taken off the market I was devastated. When all my reserves finished I bought this intense Moisture wrap on advise of Neutrogena customer service rep. it seem just OK. i am very annoyed by the fact that Neutrogena company took off the market one of their best products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Norwegian Formula for decades as no other lotion really works on my very dry hands. The company changed the formula recently and it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be. But it&#x27;s still better than the rest... and I&#x27;ve tried many others over the years. Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent too. The price hasn&#x27;t changed in decades! I guess they changed the formula to keep it that way. I would have preferred to pay normal inflationary increases in order to keep the old formula. Still, this is very good and I signed up for regular shipments. But I agree with those who say, Bring back Body Emulsion!</li>
            <li> I have very dry and cracked skin, and this product helps it stay moisturized for the day.  It&#x27;s thicker, creamier, and lasts longer than Cetaphil.  And it is not greasy like Eucerin.  Also, there is absolutely no odor, which I like.  Great mosturizer!</li>
            <li> When they took Body Emulsion off the market I was very worried. That was the only lotion that worked for the problem dry skin on my face. But thankfully this Moisture Wrap works the same. If you were pleased with body emulsion, don&#x27;t hesitate to try this now.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is the only lotion that keeps my wife&#x27;s skin moisturized.  We have tried different lotions before, but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Looking to continue using this marvelous product. Best for my skin type and not oily. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like fragrance free, can&#x27;t always find it in the stores.  Purchase price is fair and simple to buy.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion on the market for severely dry skin.  I live in an arid climate, and this product relieves my discomfort and leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.  I also appreciate that it is fragrance-free; the scented version is a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Recomended by dermatologists.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have used</li>
            <li> This is my go to dry skin cream.  Nothing has ever worked as well for me as this does.  I have tried many and they are too oily or hard, this is just right.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing, excellent skin moisture and no greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> This lotion does nothing spectacular. I have extremely dry, flakey skin (sexy, right?!) and this does nothing to help. It&#x27;s like a normal lotion, just a little pricier. Don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s a fuss over it. Apparently their old product worked wonders. This new one doesn&#x27;t. They&#x27;ve marketed this product to be \\&quot;intense moisture wrap\\&quot; and \\&quot;body treatment\\&quot;---- yeah, not so much. It&#x27;s more like \\&quot;just like the dollar store lotion you normally pass by, except this time we&#x27;ve packaged it all pretty and even put it in a cardboard box so it makes it look like it&#x27;s prescription strength and from a brand you trust. Yes, we&#x27;re fooling you, but come on, buy it anyway.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Awesome product, skin soft, not greasy. Love it.</li>
            <li> A non-greasy, long lasting, very effective moisturizing lotion which I use as a hand lotion but can be used as a total body lotion.  Good price on Amazon when using the subscribe &amp; save program.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever had, for hands, body, feet.  I have used it immediately on small burns &amp; cuts &amp; cold sores and heal up very quickly.  I recommend it every chance I get.</li>
            <li> Item was received promptly and was well packaged. This is the best hand/body lotion I have found. It really keeps my skin soft and supple without any greasy feeling. I have tried many other expensive lotions that are for extremely dry skin but this product outshines all of them. This item is sometimes difficult to find in our local stores so I was very pleased to find it here on Amazon. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product really hydrates and protects dry skin. It&#x27;s not at all greasy and gives you a smooth comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> Nice non greasy lotion.  I saw results right away.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for skin you can use!</li>
            <li> So good! I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years.  It does a great job of deeply moisturizing my skin without leaving it feeling greasy. my skin always feels silky smooth. I highly recommend this product to everyone. it&#x27;s a great investment in healthy, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my dry skin. The only issue is it is no longer in stores but I&#x27;m glad I can still find it online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your ordinary moisturizing lotion. It is a moisture wrap. Yes, it indeed wraps your whole body in intense moisture that lasts all day. Would highly recommend it if you want silky soft skin all over.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite moisturizers. Works very very well on extreme dry skin. I absolutely MUST go with the unscented though, the scented is way too strong, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Difficult to find in stores, but that&#x27;s why we have Amazon.  This is the only product that moisturizes my extremely dry skin and keeps it moisturized all day.  Not too pricey either, although not economical.</li>
            <li> makes your feet really smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cracked dry skin on my hands for about 30 years.  You know the kind....it splits open and bleeds all Winter long, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to heal.  I&#x27;ve tried every prescription the dermatologist gave me, all to no avail.  I&#x27;ve now been using this product for about 10 years and it is the only thing that has ever worked.  It used to be called &amp;#34;emulsion&amp;#34; - they changed the name, but it still works the same.  Once my hands are healed, I use it every night before bed, to keep my skin from cracking again.  If I miss a day....I&#x27;m usually sorry.  The other Neutrogena products, including the &amp;#34;hand cream&amp;#34;, will NOT work like this product does.  Don&#x27;t bother with them.  This is the stuff that will save you lots of pain, and lots of blood!</li>
            <li> This is the only body lotion I use and have for years.  It calms skin allergies and keeps the skin moist on my hands. elbows and legs on contact.  The fragrance is light and not overpowering.  No need to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Everything was as advertised. In my opinion, this is one of the best products on the market!  It works great!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena moisture wrap is one of the best body cream I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It is well and quickly absorbed and has a long and efficient effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it is relatively cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Most recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for YEARS and it&#x27;s the only lotion (and I&#x27;ve tried them ALL) that takes care of my dry skin issues. Love love love this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  So happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works great at keeping my knuckles from cracking and bleeding during winter.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years with my supersensitive skin. It does not irritate and makes dry patches go away.</li>
            <li> This is as close as I&#x27;ve found to the discontinued Neutrogena Body Emulsion.  It&#x27;s not quite the same, but almost.  Why Neutrogena discontinued the best lotion in the world is beyond me.</li>
            <li> This is a great body lotion. It moisturizes without being goopy or sticky. I can just put it on after my shower and I&#x27;m good to go--no issues with dry skin. Reasonable price for what you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this product to my friends, co-workers, and neighbors.  No flaky dry skin this winter!  Especially effective on elbows!</li>
            <li> Great for skin care etc...</li>
            <li> I now use this product after the Neutorgena Emulsion product was discontinued.  I purchased several bottles of the original product on Ebay for much more than they originally sold for.  I now mix both products together to stretch my supply.  It works for my skin but not as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff! I use it all year but daily in the winter. It&#x27;s like putting on a layer of skin protection. It prevents dry skin and the itchies that go with it, has a nice consistency, and little ,if any, odor. I have sensitive skin and this lotion has never caused redness, rash, dryness, etc. or been been a problem in any way. It&#x27;s more expensive than other brands but it&#x27;s worth the extra, and is ways available at Amazon whereas not always in the stores.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known that the original Body Emulsion was going to be discontinued.  I would have bought all that I could find.  This reformulation is not as rich or as long lasting.  Like so many companies, they make a winner into a cheaper product and charge more for it.  While it works ok, it is overpriced.  When I contacted Neutrogena, they gave me the usual \\&quot;try it, you&#x27;ll like it,\\&quot; without coming out and saying why they had discontinued the original formula.  This is an emulsion; it is a medium weight lotion.</li>
            <li> I had been using Neutrogena Body lotion for over 10 years and had been very happy with it. This new formula is no where near as good. It feels greasy and feels less effective. I&#x27;m going to try other products before buying this again.</li>
            <li> always loved it and delivery was fast. used prime shippping</li>
            <li> Very good! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> best moisture we use to keep skin wet and not sticky.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product, same ingredients (I had an old Body Emulsion box).  Just like the Body Emulsion, it is wonderful and helps me keep my eczema at bay.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find out about this product from Neutrogena, so my hands were in pretty bad shape by the time my daughter found this new generation of the product for me.  It&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the replacement for the Neutrogena Body Emulsion cream that was discontinued.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same formula.  Only stuff that works on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well, fragrance free, not for use on face as moisturizes well but would clog pores.</li>
            <li> Used this for years and plan to keep using this. My dry skin loves this.</li>
            <li> This lotion for dry skin is the very best  for my husband to use...He has tried many brands and this works the best for him.My daughters also use this and love it.</li>
            <li> As someone who uses lotion every day, I was looking for a product to show a little extra love to my legs, feet, knees, and elbows.  Once you let this lotion dry and absorb into your skin, it does wonders.  With regular use, it has erased the dry, flaky feeling I used to get after shaving my legs and has eliminated the rough spots on my heels.  I’d also like to note that I have very sensitive skin, and this formula does not irritate my skin, nor does it have an obnoxious fragrance (or chemical odor) like many deep moisturizing products often have. Once again, the Neutrogena Norwegian line does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and with gegular usage the skin really improves. However, it is a bit expensive and there are no store brand &#x27;compare to Neutrogena Norwegian Formula&#x27; product!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this lotion! Very thick, just need a little. Really does the trick to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different lotions over the years...nothing lives up to this one.  It moisturizes without being overly greasy.  Especially great for your knees and elbows!</li>
            <li> I have lost track of how many years I&#x27;ve loved this lotion! It is just perfect as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Please don &#x27;t ever change it!</li>
            <li> Really the only lotion that works for my dry, itchy skin. Every other lotion I tried would work for a few hours and than need to be reapplied - this stuff lasts all day. Lightweight, effective, and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily after it dries. Highly recommended to anyone with persistently problematic dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena light sesamie body lotion for my whole body when I get out if the shower because it quickly absorbs and does not feel heavy on the skin. But that said, this product is great for aging hands or those in and out of water all day. I keep a bottle in my bathroom dink and apply several times during the day if I am home, keep one in my desk and use every night before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written a long, extensive review about it on another purchase I&#x27;ve made of a pack of three of these, so I&#x27;ll just paste it here, because it&#x27;s about the product, not the pack of three, so it&#x27;s relevant:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have severe lifelong atopic dermatitis (eczema), making my skin exceptionally sensitive and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I get very allergic to random things very quickly, and it all appears as rashes, itching, dry, flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have tried (and I&#x27;m not exaggerating) pretty much hundreds of oils, lotions, ointments, antihistamines, gels — anything, really, to stop the dryness and the itching. Nothing was good enough, not even things that people have said &amp;#34;cured their children&#x27;s eczema&amp;#34; or are &amp;#34;miracle workers&amp;#34;. Nothing worked, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day a couple of weeks ago I ran into a little video on YouTube of a woman (completely unsponsored, in her home, just talking to the camera from her own experience, about her own experience) discussing how she got rid of her dry, itchy skin. She talked about several different things that she tried to do and use, but she was absolutely ecstatic talking about this specific product. At the end of her video, the woman posted before and after pictures: her flaky, dry skin had turned to normal, smooth skin within about two weeks. I know you&#x27;re probably thinking that I sound like an infomercial, but this video was so clearly not an infomercial that I thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Now, even though I&#x27;ve tried many different ways to stop my skin from itching, that does not mean that I won&#x27;t try more — I have to keep trying in order to stop this madness. I immediately purchased this product to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product twice a day — right after the shower, and as I go to sleep. I used to have to reapply my moisturizers in the middle of the night (yes, that would mean waking up, especially because my skin is itching) and then also multiple times during the day. I no longer have to reapply my moisturizer more than two times a day. It&#x27;s very important to apply moisturizer right after you shower, because your skin is still absorbing all of the moisture from the shower. The sleep thing is just so I could sleep at night without unconsciously scratching at my skin; it&#x27;s a habit, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly will never stop buying this. I recommend this to people who suffer from severely dry skin, eczema, who feel that they need to reapply moisturizer constantly, and to people with children who suffer from child eczema, because I do believe that the right moisturizer could actually fix the skin from the inside as well as from the outside; I do believe that it could prevent your child from having eczema as an adult, but I&#x27;m no pro, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many products by Neutrogena before, and most of these products were meant for people with eczema. I have never been that pleased, but this specific project is very different. I don&#x27;t even have to apply a whole lot to my skin for it to naturally change it. Unlike other products have tried, this product does not feel like a miracle — you don&#x27;t feel instant relief of anything. But honestly, I can only assume that the feeling of instant relief comes at a cost in the long-term, having to continue reapplying over and over again, kind of like some lip balms out there. This product is the kind of product that you&#x27;d wake up one morning and go all &amp;#34;dang, my skin is smooth! Awesome!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my skin is so severely dry, I would assume that if you have a combination or oily skin – this probably is going to do a lot of damage. I have no idea, because my issue is exactly the opposite, but this is obviously for dry skin. Don&#x27;t use it if you have, say, body acne. I am pretty sure this isn&#x27;t good for that. You know, common sense stuff :) But again, if you or someone you care about has severely dry skin and/or eczema, I can confidently say that this worked amazingly well for both me and the lady on the YouTube video.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sharing the YouTube video here, because I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to look like a sponsored review if I post a link on here, but if you are interested in watching that video as well, you can just comment on my review and I will look for it online and find it for you.h me and the lady on the YouTube video.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sharing the YouTube video here, because I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to look like a sponsored review if I post a link on here, but if you are interested in watching that video as well, you can just comment on my review and I will look for it online and find it for you.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best body lotion money can buy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even speak to how this works because the smell makes me gag.  It smells exactly like that goo stuff kids get in an egg from a quarter vending machine.  Seriously makes me nauseous.</li>
            <li> light enough to use as an all purpose around the clock lotion, yet still moisturizes extremely well and is not oily.  Absorbs into your skin really fast.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST moisturizer in the history of moisturizers!</li>
