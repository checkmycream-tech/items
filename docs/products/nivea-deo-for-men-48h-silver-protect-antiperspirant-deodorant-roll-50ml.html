            <li>It seems to be a best selling product across the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Latest batch I have received is made in Thailand.</li>

            <li>excelent product, smell really good .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Got some in Thailand and nice to get it in US.</li>
            <li>how awesome it is in that it doesn&#x27;t make my sweat smell funny (and most deodorants do).  </li>
            <li>Best deodorant I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>Great to still be able to buy them and look forward to remaining fresh.</li>
            <li>this was a great deal for a large amount of them, at the time i write this review</li>
            <li>Fragrance leans more towards eau de toilette then Mennen, but I like it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic antiperspirant!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be glad you &amp;#34;switched&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>Take it from a real &amp;#34;stinker&amp;#34;, this stuff is great</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Most deodorants will either irritate my skin or not prevent the stank.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works great and keeps me dry and smelling good all day.  </li>
            <li>The Silver Protect scent is even better than the Cool Kick one in my opinion, it is a very unique, clean smell.</li>
            <li>However, given the other benefits mentioned, it&#x27;s one of the best options available in the US.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll even forget to put it on some days, but my wife says I smell fine (it is rated for 48 hours after all).  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product but wish it was odorless.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why that is but thank you Amazon and thank you Nieva for making such a great product..</li>
            <li>This is an excellent deodorant, I&#x27;ve tried a few of the Nivea roll-on deodorants</li>
            <li>: The sent is perfect, masculine and strong enough to notice without being overpowering</li>
            <li>Nivea roll-on by far better than this ...won&#x27;t buy any more</li>
            <li>Great scent, very clean to use, great protection, and one bottle lasts a long time (at least a month).</li>
            <li>He says it smells good, drys quickly when applied,so it does not get on clothes and last all day into the evening.</li>
            <li>With diet and  exercise my testosterone level is now normal and I have a healthy 4.5 month baby</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it more highly, well worth the premium.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea certainly makes very good male hygiene products, for the past year I have been using their products and have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Spray version is also effective, but I prefer the roll on as it does not waft around the entire room when</li>
            <li>Current favorite product for keeping my pits smelling clean.</li>
            <li>Superior to all other deodorants/</li>
            <li>The label is right and it even lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>These worked great for me, no more irritations</li>
            <li>however this one to me has the most pleasing smell and performs very well as far as perspiration</li>
            <li>pretty much year round, this was a great buy for someone looking for a cheap, great smelling, long lasting deodorant AND antiperspirant (which is most important to me because deodorant can only mask body odor for so long and doesn&#x27;t help with sweaty pits)</li>
            <li>first saw the Silver Protect style products about 14 years ago in Japan when experiencing the &#x27;Ag+ Silver Ion&#x27; range by Shiseido.</li>
            <li>and I still have yet to finish the first roll on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since the first time I purchased it.</li>
            <li>The good news is that  the smell diminishes over a few hours  or so, and is virtually unnoticeable by the evening.</li>
            <li>It really does work for 48 hrs (assuming you didn&#x27;t shower</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t end up slathering it on like other deodorants in order to be sure it&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li>and I smell clean all day long.</li>
            <li>(Old Spice, Axe, and most other &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This particular product goes on well, a single bottle lasts a long time, and it keeps me dry and smelling pleasant all day and night.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve found that the quality of their products easily competes with or bests other leading brands, without paying the pricey natural goods premium either.</li>
            <li>The smell is arguably &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; (whatever that means) but has a powerfully alcoholy aroma that reminds me of the old aerosol cans of deodorant from back in the day.  </li>
            <li>AND I have very sensitive underarms</li>
            <li>It has a stickiness to it that can annoy at first; however, it definitely dries and reduces odor in perspiration.  </li>
            <li>It also lasts significantly longer than other deodorants I have tried.</li>
            <li>applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I received locally is near identical in container and front label packaging as shown on Amazon photo but with a UPC code of 4005808307272 and manufactured in Germany.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it now for nearly a year and not one rash under the arms.</li>
            <li>Even deodorants that supposedly last 48 hours didn&#x27;t last 6 here in the hot and humid climate of Mississippi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I almost gave it 4.5 stars because the scent is a little musky, but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>Burns less than most every other deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This rolls on dry and odorless; but after about 5 seconds, it really starts to smell.  </li>
            <li>Also, as dumb as this is, I love putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quality as I expected and very grateful for this buy</li>
            <li>this does not change my overall satisfaction with the product, service, shipping, or order in general!</li>

            <li> Been using these for years in Hong Kong where it is very humid and very sweaty, these kept me fresh, so was disappointed not to find them in CVS or Walgreens when I arrived in the US.  </li>
            <li> Any other deodorants I have used, by the end of the day I can start to smell myself a bit and notice it is starting to not work anymore.</li>
            <li> I also used to get irritations from standard deodorants probably from all the other stuff they have in them.</li>
            <li> This product is fake not the original...</li>
            <li> The trick is to let it dry before you put your shirt on.</li>

            <li> Other products just do not compare in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The problem with other roll-ons was that they would stain my shirts.</li>

            <li> Down here in the south</li>
            <li> Cannot discern the difference from the previous manufacture.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, similar to all Nivea men products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s muggy and hot</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the roller ball application of this deodorant, which is why I gave this product 4 stars (I used a spray application in Spain</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not strong.</li>
            <li> keep in mind they are a little small, but they seem to never run out.</li>
            <li> This one takes care of both problems and is small and portable.</li>
            <li> one was cracked during transit, they are in glass, and I was forced to discard it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I am unable to wear conventional deodorants because of the alumina; I&#x27;m allergic or something.  </li>

            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Product shipped on time... quality as I expected and very grateful for this buy</li>
            <li> Works great and good price. The trick is to let it dry before you put your shirt on. I like the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Superior to all other deodorants/anti perspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first saw the Silver Protect style products about 14 years ago in Japan when experiencing the &#x27;Ag+ Silver Ion&#x27; range by Shiseido. Finally a company has brought a similar technology to the West and made it available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts all day, even in humid environments&lt;br /&gt;- Does not stain clothes&lt;br /&gt;- Other products just do not compare in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;- Spray version is also effective, but I prefer the roll on as it does not waft around the entire room when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I received locally is near identical in container and front label packaging as shown on Amazon photo but with a UPC code of 4005808307272 and manufactured in Germany. It is contained in a glass bottle with silver screw cap 50g. I note that the product being offered for sale is made in Thailand, though appears to be same product and branding. It seems to be a best selling product across the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Latest batch I have received is made in Thailand. Cannot discern the difference from the previous manufacture. identical in looks and usage/effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Works as described would recommend</li>
            <li> One of the few deodorants that keep me dry, don&#x60;t stain my clothes and last for a long time!</li>
            <li> I work alot delivering. Down here in the south it&#x27;s muggy and hot pretty much year round, this was a great buy for someone looking for a cheap, great smelling, long lasting deodorant AND antiperspirant (which is most important to me because deodorant can only mask body odor for so long and doesn&#x27;t help with sweaty pits) this was a great deal for a large amount of them, at the time i write this review i&#x27;ve had them for quite some time and I still have yet to finish the first roll on. keep in mind they are a little small, but they seem to never run out. one was cracked during transit, they are in glass, and I was forced to discard it. this does not change my overall satisfaction with the product, service, shipping, or order in general!</li>
            <li> Great scent, very clean to use, great protection, and one bottle lasts a long time (at least a month). Great buy</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant/anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ll even forget to put it on some days, but my wife says I smell fine (it is rated for 48 hours after all).  I forget some times how awesome it is in that it doesn&#x27;t make my sweat smell funny (and most deodorants do).  Also, for some reason I sweat a lot on plane rides, and not at all with this stuff.  AND I have very sensitive underarms and this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all.  Also, as dumb as this is, I love putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strange though, the actual product just says that it is an anti-perspirant (and not deodorant), however I think it works for both.</li>
            <li> Current favorite product for keeping my pits smelling clean.</li>
            <li> Any other deodorants I have used, by the end of the day I can start to smell myself a bit and notice it is starting to not work anymore. With this silver deodorant I have no issues whatsoever of smelling like pit stains at the end of the day. I also used to get irritations from standard deodorants probably from all the other stuff they have in them. These worked great for me, no more irritations and I smell clean all day long.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve used so far! Non roll-on deodorants tend to give me rashes so I just use roll-ons. The problem with other roll-ons was that they would stain my shirts. No stains with Nivea!</li>
            <li> This deo doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I started using Nivea products because they don&#x27;t test on animals and avoid using animal products when possible. But I&#x27;ve found that the quality of their products easily competes with or bests other leading brands, without paying the pricey natural goods premium either. This particular product goes on well, a single bottle lasts a long time, and it keeps me dry and smelling pleasant all day and night. I almost gave it 4.5 stars because the scent is a little musky, but it&#x27;s not bad and it&#x27;s not strong. I&#x27;ve been using this product since the first time I purchased it. Hey, also, it is a cool-looking glass bottle that looks chic among my toiletries.</li>
            <li> 1) This rolls on dry and odorless; but after about 5 seconds, it really starts to smell.  The smell is arguably &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; (whatever that means) but has a powerfully alcoholy aroma that reminds me of the old aerosol cans of deodorant from back in the day.  The good news is that  the smell diminishes over a few hours  or so, and is virtually unnoticeable by the evening. It has a stickiness to it that can annoy at first; however, it definitely dries and reduces odor in perspiration.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product but wish it was odorless.</li>
            <li> I started using Nivea deodorants while living in Spain. I don&#x27;t know how I lived my life before discovering them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The sent is perfect, masculine and strong enough to notice without being overpowering (Old Spice, Axe, and most other &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; deodorants gave me a headache and made me feel like I had entered into an Ambercrombie &amp; Fitch store). The Silver Protect scent is even better than the Cool Kick one in my opinion, it is a very unique, clean smell. It also lasts significantly longer than other deodorants I have tried. Even deodorants that supposedly last 48 hours didn&#x27;t last 6 here in the hot and humid climate of Mississippi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the roller ball application of this deodorant, which is why I gave this product 4 stars (I used a spray application in Spain and it is easier to apply). However, given the other benefits mentioned, it&#x27;s one of the best options available in the US.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Burns less than most every other deodorant I&#x27;ve used. Fragrance leans more towards eau de toilette then Mennen, but I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. Works well. Roller could work smoother.</li>
            <li> Fantastic antiperspirant! I have fairly sensitive skin but this works with no irritation. Subtle scent, similar to all Nivea men products. Can&#x27;t recommend it more highly, well worth the premium.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps me dry and smelling good all day.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> excelent product, smell really good . Item arrived in time.</li>
            <li> Got some in Thailand and nice to get it in US.</li>
            <li> If regular deodorants make you &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34;...try this stuff and you&#x27;ll be glad you &amp;#34;switched&amp;#34;...LOL.  Seriously, I am unable to wear conventional deodorants because of the alumina; I&#x27;m allergic or something.  This deodorant is only required to be used every 48+ hours of so, like the label says.  The label is right and it even lasts longer.  Take it from a real &amp;#34;stinker&amp;#34;, this stuff is great and I no longer itch.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years in Hong Kong where it is very humid and very sweaty, these kept me fresh, so was disappointed not to find them in CVS or Walgreens when I arrived in the US.  Great to still be able to buy them and look forward to remaining fresh.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I now order it regularly. Wish it would be Prime shipping...</li>
            <li> My son introduced this deodorant to my husband and now he will use nothing else. He says it smells good, drys quickly when applied,so it does not get on clothes and last all day into the evening.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant. It won&#x27;t damage your liver and endocrine system so if you have low testosterone or your sperm isn&#x27;t swimming give it a try!!. With diet and  exercise my testosterone level is now normal and I have a healthy 4.5 month baby</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It really does work for 48 hrs (assuming you didn&#x27;t shower but then you may be stinky in other places). I highly recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently had issues finding a deodorant that works all day this does</li>
            <li> Most deodorants will either irritate my skin or not prevent the stank. This one takes care of both problems and is small and portable. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> This product is fake not the original...Nivea roll-on by far better than this ...won&#x27;t buy any more</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Lasts all day. Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a deodorant that didn&#x27;t give me a rash. I&#x27;ve always had to use a medicated powder. Until this product. It&#x27;s the best. I&#x27;ve used it now for nearly a year and not one rash under the arms. I believe it has something to do with the silver particles. Just my opinion. I bought three sets of three. So I wouldn&#x27;t run out.  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else but Amazon. I don&#x27;t know why that is but thank you Amazon and thank you Nieva for making such a great product..</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deodorant, I&#x27;ve tried a few of the Nivea roll-on deodorants however this one to me has the most pleasing smell and performs very well as far as perspiration goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea certainly makes very good male hygiene products, for the past year I have been using their products and have been very satisfied. I find the roll-on&#x27;s to last forever because you can feel when you&#x27;ve put on enough and you don&#x27;t end up slathering it on like other deodorants in order to be sure it&#x27;ll do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever, no aluminum :-) and it works great !</li>
