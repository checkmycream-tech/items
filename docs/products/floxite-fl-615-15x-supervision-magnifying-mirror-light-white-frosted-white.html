            <li>Good Afternoon Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perfect light and mirror size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost too good.  </li>
            <li>So good in fact that I no longer have it.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, and magnification is wonderful!</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to get use to it, which I am.10 inch is a good size mirror.</li>
            <li>light on this mirror is located in the perfect spot for chin plucking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good quality mirror.  </li>
            <li>did not work as good as I thougth</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is good however the lightbulb began flickering after a month of use-</li>

            <li>The mirror is excellent but the light is not so good.  </li>
            <li>The magnification mirror is great and, if the lighting worked (which it did for awhile on my first one), it gives excellent viewing.</li>
            <li>If you learn forward to pluck your eyebrows you will have the most perfect eyebrows in town. :)</li>
            <li>It is great for every day use, but is also wonderful for travel because it folds up to be very compact.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is a good size, happy with it mostly except for it tips over a lot...i&#x27;m  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent mirror and in a couple years worth of using it about once a week I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li>The distortion is so great that you have to almost have your face touching it to make it usable.</li>
            <li>Not the most attractive looking, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror and was happy to see they are still making it.  </li>
            <li>Can see more than I need to and great for home or travel.</li>

            <li>It has 15X Magnification and a light that is bright and shines where you want it!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!!</li>
            <li>You will see way more than you probably want to!</li>
            <li>Not any more with this mirror!</li>

            <li>I love this mirror!</li>
            <li>I am glad I could find it on amazon!</li>

            <li>I LOVE this mirror!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the magnification in this mirror!  </li>
            <li>At my age, I had difficulty tweezing my eyebrows using most magnifying mirrors but this did the trick!  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror!  </li>
            <li>but I love this product!</li>
            <li>The magnification is amazing.</li>
            <li>I think this mirror does an amazing job of magnifying without distortion.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is amazing.  </li>
            <li>so are great precise tweezers......</li>
            <li>I gave 5 stars because it&#x27;s amazing for makeup applying.</li>
            <li>light in the mirror adds great versatility.  </li>
            <li>but the light is not in a great position.</li>
            <li>So nice, I bought it twice.</li>
            <li>I am going to return it and buy another kind.   </li>
            <li>This one is durable, has good magnification, and the light is good quality.</li>
            <li>but it is really nice and the light works great too.</li>
            <li>Gets warm and you should not leave plugged in when not in use.</li>
            <li>daylight mirror, which (surprisingly) shows much more than this advertised 15x.</li>
            <li>Yep, handy mirror, I use it a lot.</li>
            <li>Good and truthful product.  </li>
            <li>Nice have 15x magnification</li>
            <li>Every woman - any age - should own this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Works well, takes up some room, wish it had a mounting to the wall option but for the most part it is a good product</li>
            <li>It is the best mirror I have ever used, but you need to be ready to see EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to travel with.</li>
            <li>This one is more powerful (magnification) and is great for what I need and use it for!!!</li>
            <li>I am confident that I look good at all times.</li>
            <li>I liked this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product with super strong magnify.</li>
            <li>great magnification, good light, easy to fold and carry.</li>
            <li>Even more then it&#x27;s power, the Floxite is lite, portable and has a great light.</li>
            <li>it is not as  strong nor as bright  </li>
            <li>Can use successfully without my glasses and is travel friendly as a foldup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Just whar I needed,  and wanted  Great, good size and love the large magnifacation.</li>
            <li>Large, great light, great mirror...feel helpless applying makeup, tweezing eyebrows, etc., without it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the light is as bright as the others I have been.  </li>
            <li>The light, even with the filters, is so bright that it is blinding.</li>
            <li>- So far, I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Switch is shorting out and light isn&#x27;t that bright</li>
            <li>This is the greatest for my old eyes.  </li>
            <li>My old mirror was suffering from the problems of age - cracking at the edges of the rim - but otherwise was in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>15X is so easy to see even the smallest hairs to pluck!</li>
            <li>and now the light is on top which is great for casting light when using the mirror, nice that it can be changed if I should choose to.  </li>
            <li>This product was great for the first couple of months.  </li>
            <li>, I could see every hair that needed plucking, but like another person commented, they are made very cheaply.  </li>
            <li>Works well and very light weight.  </li>
            <li>and it works great on my upper face, no problems, honest!  </li>
            <li>The good part of that is that we can eradicate the said flaw quickly ;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34; and my eyesight isn&#x27;t as great as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I have to be on top of it to see.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my sister loves the one I gave her.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the design</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this mirror for many years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>No, it is not a makeup mirror, but is excellent for grooming - when you want to make sure you&#x27;ve gotten every last stray eyebrow hair, THIS is the mirror you want.  </li>
            <li>2nd one and works awesome!</li>
            <li>Love the increased power although it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>I call it my magic mirror.</li>
            <li>so trying one more time.</li>
            <li>up-right begins to flop and won&#x27;t hold the mirror up any more.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I had a 5x mirror for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I can see my face better with that option.  </li>
            <li>I love my  15x lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li>I simply mounted it on the wall in the bathroom and it is perfect!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to put on my eye makeup without this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I really love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>also it increases my ability to see more detail.  </li>
            <li>but I think that will be the best way to use this item as the stand is short.  </li>
            <li>so I am glad to see they have increased the magnification on this model.  </li>
            <li>I would love to return it to the seller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend as the best mirror to purchase.</li>
            <li>To get 4 more days of use out of it?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 4 of them 1 as a gift and we love it.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this product, and would order from company again.  </li>
            <li>but I sure do.  </li>
            <li>THIS DEFINATELY LIGHTS UP THE FACE AND BRINGS THINGS INTO FOCUS FOR THOSE OF US WHO NEED TO SEE BETTER TO PUT ON OUR MAKE-UP AND GROOM</li>
            <li>However, for what it is it works very well and the light on the bottom is incredibly helpful for highlighting stay hairs</li>
            <li>Great mirror for very closeup.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful, two things I would change is for it to be bigger and taller.</li>
            <li>Never have to worry about not being able to see all the things that need attention.  </li>
            <li>Just love this mirror  </li>
            <li>and I have had many</li>
            <li>I love the magnification on this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I do like it better than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love makeup mirrors.  </li>
            <li>This mirror lets me get a much better look at my face and makeup than I could get with a pair of glasses.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I like the realization sinking in, however with this mirror I&#x27;m able to see wrinkles</li>
            <li>This mirror does have fantastic, bright light, from the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Love this makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>This is an okay product...</li>
            <li>Love this mirror to get my eyebrows without my glasses on.</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS MIRROR.  </li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>perfect for chin and upper lip area.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love how compact it is and how the mirror moves for better</li>
            <li>The light is nice but it does make me see spots after using it for alittle while.</li>
            <li>and they love it too.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t as many choices when looking for a 15X magnification style.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>It works great for real close up.</li>
            <li>How&#x27;s yours? :-)</li>
            <li>Love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ve had many mirrors that could drop two feet without breaking.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I love the 15x magnification on this mirror</li>
            <li>The thought to test my latest purchase never entered my mind because</li>
            <li>(most of the time).</li>
            <li>The lighting is okay.</li>
            <li>I tend to use it next my window on a sunny day to get best results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It helps me cover my flaws and feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Love this mirror and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>Love Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>BUT THAT&#x27;S THE IDEA :)</li>
            <li>downside is that I look at it every AM and PM now, to make sure I dont miss anything.</li>
            <li>This mirror will make you see more than you want to</li>
            <li>I love this magnifying mirror and have more than one.  </li>
            <li>I am now able to remove and apply my makeup correctly once again.</li>
            <li>Great price, great delivery and can&#x27;t go wrong in keeping the wife happy.</li>
            <li>My son loved mine so much, I had to get another one!</li>
            <li>The best thing is the mirror with the cut out that allows the beam of light to actually hit the area.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I can send it back with Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy.</li>
            <li>old was was great for many years</li>
            <li>The price was very good and the mirror is terrific.  </li>
            <li>Very very cool.</li>
            <li>So far this is great.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the hunt for a brighter bulb that will fit (safely, of course).</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for this fabulous item, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to put on my eye makeup since having cataract surgery; it improved my distance vision but practically lost my close-up</li>
            <li>The light is okay.</li>
            <li>But none I found had this strength of magnification and that was what was most important to me for my use of it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it because I wear glasses, and it enables me to see so much better.</li>
            <li>WOW this is great.</li>
            <li>I need and appreciate the magnification, but wish the light was brighter...or that my eyes worked better.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it does a good job, helps me keep my chin smooth, and I would recommend it for anyone who needs a good lighted magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>Super magnification that only a brave woman can take!</li>
            <li>Our eyes are getting older along with the rest of the body and this is perfect for old eyes being able to see what we are doing.</li>
            <li>With a 15x magnification this isn&#x27;t the best mirror for makeup application other than eye makeup.</li>
            <li>This is my third mirror over many years and am mostly happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s so easy to take when traveling.</li>
            <li>to any angel for easy viewing&amp;#60;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;ANGEL</li>
            <li>or angle??&lt;br /&gt;Mirror detaches and folds for easy travel and storage&lt;</li>
            <li>they were very quick to send a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I bought two; wish I had bought a few more at this incredible price!!!!</li>
            <li>it is so easy to see and take care of.  </li>
            <li>Having 15X makes it easy to see even without glasses.</li>
            <li>Plus it is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I when out an bought a 12 or 15 magnified, portable mirror, easy, I can sit by a sunny window</li>
            <li>It provided easy viewing for close-up tweezing since I can&#x27;t see close up without my readers.  </li>
            <li>The mirror can easily be adjusted for height.</li>
            <li>Need to find something easy</li>
            <li>The mirror detaches easily for travel.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>had to send this back.&lt;br /&gt;Way too strong.  </li>
            <li>High magnification, good lighting, and it comes apart and folds up for easy traveling.</li>
            <li>I use a 5x magnification for foundation and general review, but this is great for what needs detail.  </li>
            <li>I liked my first one</li>
            <li>I looked at several but this one still had the 15X magnification I like and the light is good too!</li>
            <li>It was packed very well in the box and came in excellent condition with extra bulbs and three lighting effect lenses which you should try to see which is most comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I believe that when you get used to it will do the work just fine.</li>
            <li>The bonus is that it easily snaps apart for traveling and it&#x27;s so light weight that I can carry it in my shoulder bag with no problem.  </li>
            <li>it is not as light or as easy to travel with as I was led to believe.</li>
            <li>The Floxite Magnifying Mirror Light is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Can see everything fine.</li>
            <li>Mirrors worked fine for awhile and then sporadically or not at all.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these mirrors years and years ago, it was still working fine</li>
            <li>mirror was more than adequate to see what I needed to see.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and recommend this mirror highly.</li>
            <li>Kinda cheap.</li>
            <li>and I can see inside my eyes and easy to clean my eyes with mirror.</li>
            <li>Also the light.</li>
            <li>The light gets in my eyes...</li>
            <li>I could say I like this mirror, but for the price, it&#x27;s unacceptable that the light fixture stops working after a while.</li>
            <li>Just be prepared for what you are going to see when you look in this fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li>The light makes it so convenient.  </li>
            <li>I wish the light was brighter.  </li>
            <li>Great visualization for eyebrow, upper lip, and chin hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Baby Boomers NEED better selection of these type of products - this is a rare find ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this magnification light for years</li>
            <li>I like the light</li>
            <li>Well, they show two mirrors, I didnt understand I was purchasing the one with the covered light.  </li>
            <li>The light shines in your eyes while you are trying to use it up close..</li>
            <li>The mirror will come off for travel without the light, but you would have to wrap it securely.  </li>
            <li>I can not comment about the light because I have not had to use it as of yet.  </li>
            <li>this model has the light below the mirror which puts the light where you need it for plucking, etc.  </li>
            <li>The problem with the light, is that a defuser disk is inserted in front of the light and there is no way to remove it.  </li>
            <li>If you can use another light source or daylight there is no problem.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend product to others seeking a distortion free magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it came with three bulbs -</li>
            <li>Your make up really shows up nicely, and you can even do your eye brows nicley</li>
            <li>I wish that the light was a bit brighter though.</li>
            <li>I just wish the light were brighter.</li>
            <li>The light did NOT stay on.  </li>
            <li>I had to take off the mirror and &amp;#34;jiggle&amp;#34; the light bulb.  </li>
            <li>I find as my vision is poorer that I could use brighter or wider light</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>I bought this to keep my face and neck free from unsightly hair.  </li>
            <li>My light did not work at all.</li>
            <li>Would have preferred a mirror with light all around the sides like some have.</li>
            <li>The magnification was great for eyebrows and facial hair.  </li>
            <li>have no use for the amber light diffuser.</li>
            <li>When I try to use the mirror the light shines in my eyes because of the size of the mirror.</li>
            <li>Light has delayed &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch.  </li>
            <li>light - worked</li>
            <li>The light is while and illuminating,</li>
            <li>I often use it without the light, too.</li>
            <li>My eyeliner is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Now the light doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>Ok,  not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>The light at the bottom is distracting when you look in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li>You need to take some time to figure out how to position the mirror so that the light doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes while you are trying to tweeze.</li>
            <li>so the light was not in my eye.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my old model, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Well lit, good clear mirror, filters are accurate and helpful-</li>
            <li>The price for the mirror is good because it is a clear mirror</li>
            <li>I finally figured I needed a real close-up mirror to do it and this one is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Now that my eyes are getting older, I can&#x27;t see the close stuff any more!  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of magnification to assist appropriate application of makeup.</li>
            <li>you use it correctly and tilt the mirror right,  you will love it</li>
            <li>So - if you need high magnification and good lighting of the center of your face, this is a great mirror.  </li>
            <li>I find it very useful in applying make up, tweezing, or anytime</li>
            <li>Floxite is a great brand, but the bulb area of this particular mirror takes up too much space, so visibility is measurably compromised.</li>
            <li>This is such a good quality distortion free mirror, light weight, and has a strong light.</li>
            <li>The light on the bottom of the mirror is very strong, yet very concentrated.    </li>
            <li>This mirror is too small and the bright light is too bright.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy, throws good light and really helps to see what you&#x27;d rather not see!</li>
            <li>Eyes need more magnification - notice first light made in U.S. - this light made in China.  </li>
            <li>You can see every pore on your face and every hair in your eyebrows, which makes removing blackheads or tweezing your eyebrows super easy.  </li>
            <li>This one does not have an optional battery power source which I had found a nice feature in the past, but still a great product.  </li>
            <li>On the original one I had, the lighting just quit working (and it wasn&#x27;t the bulb).  </li>
            <li>I still have the original bulb in this mirror.  </li>
            <li>So I just call the friendly company and they mail a replacement to me.  </li>
            <li>Just friendly, helpful people.</li>
            <li>Works great for plucking whiskers, but I really wish it had a non-magnifying mirror as well (some mirrors are able to be flipped 180 degrees and have a non-magnifying mirror on the opposite side).  </li>
            <li>So far i am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The price is well worth it!</li>
            <li>or I may still have the original one.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Replacing the original with the replacement bulb did not resolve the problem.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find the exact mirror on Amazon because it is a great mirror that makes finding and plucking hairs so much easier for the visually challenged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Minuses - if you are a klutz, it does break pretty spectacularly / having said that, must also add that I&#x27;ve klutzed out before w/my mirror with no ill effects...but that time ;-(  So, it is made well.  </li>
            <li>I would much prefer light at the sides or top of the mirror.</li>
            <li>The light is bright enough for seeing just about every hair on your face!</li>
            <li>And I liked it since it had absolutely no distortion anywhere on the mirror and was so handy to use for finding even the tiniest defect on my face or eye.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be built better and is much easier to use with both hand free.  </li>
            <li>The light was to bright for me, even after I tried the different lenses.</li>
            <li>In addition, while using the mirror, with the light turned on, the light is shinning right in your eyes.</li>
            <li>Packed very secure and fast ship.</li>
            <li>The center magnification is great</li>
            <li>It is bright enough to use though.</li>
            <li>I had the larger two sided 9x mirror they used to offer and my sister loved it</li>
            <li>It is a shame to throw a good lighted mirror away, just because one piece is a defect but a piece that is essential to the use of the product !!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think this was a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>Quality is good but it&#x27;s magnification is too big for comfort and that makes it not practical.</li>
            <li>The light is nice, but it really only light up the mirror for one angle, when I try to turn the mirror, it just gives me a shadow where I&#x27;m trying to get to.</li>
            <li>It is NOT for applying full face makeup.  </li>
            <li>10x just isn&#x27;t good enough</li>
            <li>so this is a true bonus device for me.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good buy.</li>
            <li>This mirror was a good price, and is compact enough that I can put it under my sink when it&#x27;s not in use</li>
            <li>love this light and mirror, this is my second one, even pack it in the suitcase for vacation, love it</li>
            <li>I had one of these mirrors (same brand and model) for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I consider this mirror essential for good grooming.  </li>
            <li>The light is strong and really helps.</li>
            <li>Also, when switching on the light it doesn&#x27;t come on right away, there is a time lag.</li>
            <li>Why strain when the right tool is available?</li>
            <li>At home I have a lighted 15x Conair (pretty one with brushed nickel) in my bathroom and this light is nearly as bright.  </li>
            <li>I almost did not purchase this based on other reviews I read, but I am so happy I did.  </li>
            <li>The image is clear and the light makes it even better.  </li>
            <li>Luckily Bed Bath and Beyond started carrying the replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li>this mirror is great for seeing things really up close only.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon&#x27;s free shipping offers and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>So, I quickly reordered a replacement from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I tried every which way to use it, thinking if others liked it, then maybe I was not positioning myself close enough/far enough away from it to stop the light from zapping my eyeballs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the high magnification of this mirror.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not good for applying makeup, best used for tweezing or close inspection of your face.</li>
            <li>Great mirror, small enough to fit an any bathroom, and its magnification is especially handy for putting on makeup and removing facial hair!!  </li>
            <li>Oh, and I was thrilled to see that the bottom has a place where you can hang the mirror on the wall, - this will be appreciated when I get the new one for the bathroom!</li>
            <li>On this particular purchase: The light flickered, had to be wiggled to make it light up.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to replace it with a new model.  </li>
            <li>New and improved with more magnification.</li>
            <li>I love my new Floxite 15x makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>This was a great price, much less than I paid for the one it is replacing.</li>
            <li>As my eyesight dims, actually I&#x27;m becoming more far-sighted, I needed to see close up to pluck my eyebrows and such.  </li>
            <li>Would have liked more versatility as the mirror only allows for the high powered magnification.</li>
            <li>Chose this rating because it was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I was actually pretty excited to get this mirror because it was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s daunting to find facial hairs that I barely suspected existed, but the good news is that I can keep on top of them before anyone else knows.</li>
            <li>It is 110V ONLY, (after I fried mine not knowing), so I had to order another one because I love it!</li>
            <li>The mirror is bigger than the first one which I had for MANY years before it died on me and offers good viewing.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a good size, it&#x27;s large enough I can see, can stand on my vanity top while I tweeze, and I can easily carry it downstairs and outside to see makeup colors/tones in a variety of lighting conditions (when I&#x27;m carrying it around, it&#x27;s unplugged, of course).  </li>
            <li>For women over a certain age with unwanted hair growth, that would primarily be the chin area.  </li>
            <li>A great little 15x mirror for my desktop.</li>
            <li>The mirror is a great size and there is little to no distortion.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one I have purchased and I like it because it is good for travel as it folds up and is not too large.</li>
            <li>recommend it to everybody, specially those who wants to keep unwanted hair under control!</li>
            <li>The light is in the mirror and very distracting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need the light because it is sitting on a shelf at the bathroom window, but after reading reviews ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and very portable.</li>
            <li>Came with 2 light bulbs and different lenses for light diffusion (daylight and office light).  </li>
            <li>And the light is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>The light really does make a difference in the clarity.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This Foxlite is much better designed and made than our old one.</li>
            <li>&quot; you can change out; clear for brighter light and amber for a softer light.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Price is somewhat steep but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it--it does what I expected and does it well.</li>
            <li>It serves as a fine replacement for that older mirror.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to replace an older Floxite Magnifying Mirror that finally died on me after many, many years.  </li>
            <li>Other mirrors I have tried were good for applying make-up, but this one sees every mark and hair, and allows my removal of them.  </li>
            <li>I lost right eye to see.</li>
            <li>Not the right mirror for makeup since you have to get so close.</li>
            <li>I also think you have to be to close to the mirror to see all right.</li>
            <li>I will say right after purchasing this</li>
            <li>you are certain you have not plucked in 10 years (true)</li>
            <li>This is a great mirror for seeing just a small portion of your face at a time.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does have great magnification, but the mirror itself is so small</li>
            <li>I had the original Floxite 15X mirror, which I loved, this mirror is so small</li>
            <li>One of the very few with 15X so bought one and it was great</li>
            <li>It distorts the image and you have to have your face in exactly the right distance to see.</li>
            <li>The mirrow is smaller than I thought and the light seems like a spot light and my eyes can&#x27;t focas well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, it&#x27;s great for plucking eyebrows, applying eye makeup and &#x27;taking care of&#x27; some gross facial issues.  </li>
            <li>My second one, liked it so much I got one for another room.</li>
            <li>I have owned this item previously and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The only reason this product doesn&#x27;t merit 5 stars is that the light comes solely from the bottom, so you really need some decent room lighting from overhead or the side in order to be able to see well; however, the only mirrors I&#x27;ve been able to find with surround lighting had a maximum magnification of 10X, and the greater magnification of this mirror is much better when what you have to look at is small and you need to be precise.  </li>
            <li>This one is a lot larger and has a white frosted light for an even more detailed view.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for zeroing in on hard to see areas with middle-aged eyes.</li>
            <li>Great mirror for getting those hard to see chin hairs.  </li>
            <li>Also, 15X mag is WAY too much!  </li>
            <li>First one came cracked, they did replace it, which is always a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li>This mirror was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The first mirror I bought lasted about two months.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that if I used it daily, it would be inoperable by now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this same mirror for many years and dropped it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get a replacement part but decided to buy an extra one just to have on hand.  </li>
            <li>The first one I had for about 10 yrs.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for up close makeup, tweezer grooming.  </li>
            <li>After more than 5 years, it finally died.</li>
            <li>I have actually had more than 2 of these, and eventually the arm that hold the mirror</li>
            <li>I ordered replacement bulbs and was sure to order EXTRA.</li>
            <li>Though this was perfect for very close work - I saw EVERY pore up close and personal - you have to stay just a few inches from the mirror or the distortion makes it unusable.  </li>
            <li>If you need a distortion free, clear magnifying mirror, this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is not a mirror to use to comb your hair.  </li>
            <li>Thank you ever so much!  </li>
            <li>The first one had a damaged cord so I had to replace it.  </li>
            <li>The first one I purchased wouldn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>This mirror does exactly what I ordered it for.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I attempt to make it higher on the counter by putting things under it.</li>
            <li>I needed a higher magnification for applying eye makeup.</li>
            <li>This is the best mirror I have ever found for tweezing my eyebrows and those random stray hairs.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>But even though I never looked directly into the LED light, it hurt my eyes and gave me a headache every time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I always look on Amazon first when I need to make a purchase.</li>
            <li>Many women said it only lighted the bottom of their faces....</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>My first purchase was a mirror with 8X magnification, but returned it for the 15X. I fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Product worked for the first four times being turned on.</li>
            <li>She accidentally dropped the first one and it broke</li>
            <li>Will use it until I find exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>I would try there first.</li>
            <li>For many, many years this Floxite lighted magnifying mirror has been absolutely essential for my daily grooming.</li>
            <li>As subconscious as I felt, I did my best to cope with the thought of looking like a porcupine with too many stray hairs in the wrong places.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m home and have replaced the bulb, the magnifying mirror deserves a 10 or higher.</li>
            <li>I looked on amazon, and sure enough there it was.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this one because the magnification power is lower but the larger size seems to make up for it.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I rarely change the position of the mirror, so I was surprised it broke so quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one of same Floxite is superior in every way to many of the big name cosmetic companies</li>
            <li>Other people complain that the light is only on the lower part of their face...twist the mirror and the light will be on the upper face!I&#x27;m a dude and figured that out!!!!It has better magnification than most mirrors.</li>
            <li>This is my second one and the only one I will buy at a good price.</li>
            <li>The maginfication is great, but the one light at the bottom makes it difficult to see certain parts of my face.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to find at local retail stores but now is only available to purchase on line.  </li>
            <li>Great for extreme closeup work such as plucking.</li>
            <li>The light bulbs that come with the mirror only last about two weeks; I have now run out of bulbs and cannot find any more bulbs.</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered this magnifying mirror light for tweezing my eyebrows after noticing in a store just how many hairs were left because I had been using a regular mirror.</li>
            <li>At first it worked fine, then only some of the time, and then it was just \\&quot;dead\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Folds down nicely for travel.  </li>
            <li>This little lighted mirror sure does the job!  </li>
            <li>The light didn&#x27;t work after the first time I turned it on (and again, it wasn&#x27;t the bulb as I tried several).  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is small, and I can fit it in my suitcase when traveling.  </li>
            <li>As is normal with age, my eyes are worsening and this light allows me to see clearly when doing eyebrows or putting on make-up.  </li>
            <li>I use mine everyday and it is especially great for plucking my dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its just a single mirror.</li>
            <li>I would give it five stars but for the limited viewing angels and positions that it is able to move into.</li>
            <li>Had I not thrown the box away, I would have certainly returned it.  </li>
            <li>anyways, it tips over at a certain point</li>
            <li>Not long after purchasing it, the light began to flicker.</li>
            <li>I tried switching the bulb from my old one to the new one, but it didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>The bulbs are fine, it&#x27;s the connector that is obviously faulty.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older lamp!</li>
            <li>Every mirror I looked at was a 8x or 10x and was very high in cost.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice little mirror.  </li>
            <li>I would still like a little larger however, great mirror for the money.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough to see your face, magnifies by 15 which is helpful and the light just helps with the whole process.</li>
            <li>From the outside this new mirror looks pretty with the light at the bottom, but it certainly does not measure up to its claims.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is great, but in my case it&#x27;s prolly bad because I find myself picking at my imperfections more than I should.</li>
            <li>The light intensity is much too low.</li>
            <li>Although the mirror is 6.5 inches the light is imbedded in the mirror and the light is 2 inches round.</li>
            <li>but it is larger &amp; the light is around the whole outer surface of the mirror.</li>
            <li>Second one the light bulb flickered.</li>
            <li>The light flickers constantly.</li>
            <li>It magnifies so much you can see things you never saw before.  </li>
            <li>Extra bulbs for the light are a plus too.  </li>
            <li>Very close up inspection capabilities.</li>
            <li>she thanks me.  </li>
            <li>so you didn&#x27;t need to buy the whole thing when you break the mirror.</li>
            <li>The light works well, came with extra bulbs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I like this mirror because I can apply my eye makeup and not worry about applying too much or leaving mascara blobs under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>So much for switching out the lenses for varied lighting.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really underdstand the bulbs, but I guess I will in time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for VERY closeup reconnaissance.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
            <li>I payed way to much money for this item.</li>
            <li>Comes assembled and ready to use and is lighted that plugs into 120 volt outlet.</li>
            <li>Supervision Magnifying Mirror Light, White, Frosted White&gt;</li>
            <li>There was too much glare, so it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I find very distracting..</li>
            <li>I can tweeze my eyebrows and put on my mascara and really see what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li>Yes, If you try and look at the WHOLE face and not spot areas, it is not the mirror for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mirror</li>
            <li>It really magnifies so be</li>
            <li>and it gets very close up</li>
            <li>i really like it</li>
            <li>The light is of no use - does not give enough illumination.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Not only did it come with one light bulb, it came with two replacements.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this mirror to anyone who wants a closer look at their skin.</li>
            <li>I dont like it much and wiykdnt buy again</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>It takes getting really close and then:</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this mirror as a make up mirror, so I can&#x27;t really give an opinion on that aspect.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really do much else with it.</li>
            <li>I purchased to do by brows, but found myself giving my  face a whole critique....</li>
            <li>I really should have returned it.</li>
            <li>Supervision Magnifying Mirror Light, White, Frosted...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost too much.  </li>
            <li>so much I bought one for each bathroom and also gave 2 as gifts...</li>
            <li>Hopefully they will appreciate it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>The magnification is almost too much.</li>
            <li>REALLY???</li>
            <li>You will not see your whole face at one time.</li>
            <li>Although the mirror size of the 10x mirror is only 5 inches the light is below the mirror.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>It says it has different light filters that go with this mirror, but I didn&#x27;t see them in the box, and again it is portable so this isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li>The light shines in your face, and you have to almost put your nose on the mirror to avoid the distortion mentioned by numerous reviewers.</li>
            <li>I only wished the light was brighter.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes this one for its magnification and portability.</li>
            <li>I like the larger one because the light is not so concentrated in one area.</li>
            <li>I like the portability of this one and the fact that the whole mirror is magnified.</li>
            <li>It could be a whole lot brighter than it is.  </li>
            <li>so it is very flexible.</li>
            <li>This is probably because of the intense magnification.</li>
            <li>first of all, this mirror was so distorted that I could hardly find an area that didn&#x27;t have a great deal of distortion on it, like one of those sideshow mirrors at the fair; and secondly, when I compared this new mirror with my old 10x mirror I found that there was absolutely NO difference in magnification between the two - they were identical!  </li>
            <li>After using it for a few months we&#x27;ve come to appreciate its bright light and sharp reflected images.</li>
            <li>face that other wise you would miss on a regular mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is lighter in weight and much more stable than the other but does not have the swivel mirror I had come to rely on.  </li>
            <li>I put the clear in first and it absolutely will not come out.  </li>
            <li>It is much lighter and smaller than the full sized tri-fold lighted mirror that i have been carrying in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>I actually find it fun once again to get ready!  </li>
            <li>I have had other Floxite magnifying mirrors in the past and the light on this one isn&#x27;t as bright as the others.</li>
            <li>BUT it would be greater with the halo around it instead of a TINY little light toward the bottom of the mirror</li>
            <li>The bulb on my old one was much brighter - I miss the extra light.</li>
            <li>You really see things that you normally don&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a regular mirror with 1x and 5-7x&#x27;s for putting on full face makeup.  </li>
            <li>The mirror does not work very well, poor visibility, and the light broke within the first month, Save your money!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered the 15x rather than my previous 10x and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Less clothes, more confidence in applying makeup</li>
            <li>Your previous design model was much much better.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this particular mirror to anyone.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a replacement under the warranty for my third mirror, got the fourth.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone whose eyesight is getting older like mine.  </li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>As you get older it is a must.</li>
            <li>As I get older</li>
            <li>I just got this particular model, so</li>
            <li>Mirror does NOT come close to providing adequate lighting necessary for use.</li>
            <li>This not only gives you 5 inches of viewable mirror the light isn&#x27;t shinning directly into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As eyes grow older we need help for close up makeup, tweezing, etc.  </li>
            <li>it is at best only 10x and a poor one at that!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for us older folk whose eyes need help.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Likes the high magnification.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a non-expensive mirror with high magnification</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mirror for those of you who need to tweeze eye brows or whiskers from chin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>to anyone wanting a high quality mirror.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend the 15x magnification.</li>
            <li>design should just be a little better.</li>
            <li>my old Floxite magnifying mirror shorted out at the cord (where I always pulled on it to pick it up!!).</li>
            <li>Even if I have 5-6 other lights on in my bedroom, this mirror still does NOT provide adequate lighting for necessary light.</li>
            <li>but the light is in the lower center of the mirror instead of around the outer edge.</li>
            <li>I expected the light to be brighter.</li>
            <li>Just like my old one but not broken........</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that you have to get real close to the mirror before you can get a good view of your face.</li>
            <li>Allows you to see 15xs the normal eye.  </li>
            <li>Be forewarned: You will see your facial pores as the craters of the moon, your facial hairs as a tropical rain forest, any capillaries as rivers, and any wrinkles as the Grand Canyon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first receiving it and setting it up (very simple)</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t stand firmly and would work better if you have the place to sit while using it.  </li>
            <li>Good lighting and small enough to pack on trips.</li>
            <li>In any case, I thought that I would buy a new mirror with a little more power, and this so-called 15x mirror seemed to be just what I would need.  </li>
            <li>mirror is perfect for people with not so sharp eyesight, and for people in places with ill lighting.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the process of plucking go so much quicker and</li>
            <li>I should have focused more on the negative reviews than the positive ones.</li>
            <li>The light really helps see all those little hairs that you would miss without it.</li>
            <li>I was going to returned it because it hurts my eyes, but I could not find an other one for that price that will have the 15x mirror and with light</li>
            <li>Since I had had it for 2 years, I ordered a new one.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought me this new mirror to replace one I bought about 15 years ago...</li>
            <li>I would have returned  the new mirror immediately  </li>
            <li>I got this new one as a spare for when she and my brother visit and stay with us.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased a new one to travel with me.</li>
            <li>and I cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li>New mirror design - need to get used to it -</li>
            <li>THIS MIRROR CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT,</li>
            <li>everything is super big and super sharp.  </li>
            <li>But out of the box, the light only worked on a total of two occasions (it would flicker and I would have to shake the mirror to get it to stay lit).  </li>
            <li>I hope it lasts as long as the first one I had!</li>
            <li>I have owned other Floxite mirrors, most recently the 7\\&quot; Magnifying mirror, and never had any problems.  </li>
            <li>Wore first one out and finally broke it</li>
            <li>I love the mirror, but changing the bulb is most difficult!</li>
            <li>No more standing at the window with a magnifying mirror entertaining the neighbors.  </li>
            <li>Started digging and found that the contact from the bulb to the socket either wears down or is so cheap that the connection no longer works.</li>
            <li>with any magnifying mirror, most people have to be within a very few inches to see without distortion.</li>
            <li>but, the new mirror does not have the strength,  nor the brightness that my old one had  ....</li>
            <li>but  as soon as I assembled it  I put my old mirror in the new box and tossed it out...</li>
            <li>next day I turned on the new mirror to discover  for certain</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that the mirror size could be somewhat larger; other than that a very good product!</li>
            <li>This mirror has more than enough light (I haven&#x27;t tried the other lens&#x27;s yet) and is much larger in diameter than I expected.</li>
            <li>But everything else about this mirror is better than my previous one (a Sharper Image in a similar style).</li>
            <li>The fit was so loose that the second time I used it, when I picked it up to put it on the shelf, the mirror flew off, landed on the floor and smashed to pieces.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the reason for having the lighting below and having a smaller mirror surface where you can zero in on certain areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fantastic to catch those little hairs on you</li>
            <li>Love this little mirror, but thought it would be a bit larger than it is....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hard on myself too :)</li>
            <li>like the mirror, alittle tough to see what i want it for but overall ok, the light in your eyes is hard to stand, espically if you have light sensitive as i do.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this product again and would recommend buyers to steer clear.</li>
            <li>It is clearly faulty --</li>
            <li>It is extremely clear and accurate--I see all of my flaws.  </li>
            <li>My old one bit the dust, it was given to me by my mother.  </li>
            <li>I believe the material the mirror is made of is like bakelite, what the old phones were made of.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not particularly heavy and folds up well for travel.</li>
            <li>The only problem with this mirror is that you must get  very close to it to see anything.</li>
            <li>But it really isn&#x27;t bright enough and adding the CLEAR diffuser, just made it worse.</li>
            <li>Ordered replacement direct from Floxite at twice the price</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife because her old mirror broke.</li>
            <li>as my old mirror  was you changed the  product somehow  </li>
            <li>I feel completely ripped off</li>
            <li>Replaced my old floxite (had it for over 10 years) with this one.</li>
            <li>You can really focus on specific areas -</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I have used it exclusively to highlight facial hair for tweezing and it does it really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never changed the bulb in my old one</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>Am attempting repairs but the baseline is so far below non-horror that I am not optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed with caution.  </li>
            <li>After looking for the mirrior that would let me do my makeup without my glasses I finally found it, thanks.</li>
            <li>Only buy this is you really need to see every pore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 years old and my eyesight is not what it used to be.  </li>
            <li>So...I ordered this mirror directly from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a magnifying mirror for a few months now, mostly for tweezing facial hair, and wanted a mirror with sufficient magnification that could also be put away.</li>
            <li>Scary good.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t survive without the mirror with such power, especially since my eyes are much weaker as I get older</li>
            <li>However, those are small issues that are easy to get used to and to work around.</li>
            <li>I have carried it on trips and all, can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the main part of the product.</li>
            <li>I thought the first one was defective, when the same thing happened to the 2nd mirror I realized  </li>
            <li>When you need to see something that close, there is no other way; this is a replacement for one that is 10 years old and got knocked over.</li>
            <li>according to the information in the box the new mirror was supposed to be the same as the old one...</li>
            <li>No other lighted mirror comes close to seeing all the things on your face that you don&#x27;t want any one else to see!</li>
            <li>- Spent over $40 for something that was poorly made (very cheap feeling) and so flimsy it broke right away.  </li>
            <li>No more red spots because you didn&#x27;t squeeze in exactly the right place or you missed a hair and tweezed skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; is it possible to return the new mirror without the box???</li>
            <li>It was actually cheaper to purchase a new unit on Amazon than to replace the mirror at the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>This new mirror is definitely NOT 15x ...</li>
            <li>The new bulbs I ordered last forever.</li>
            <li>With my bad eyesight I am able to apply light make up@</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re old enough to know bakelite, then you know that you could beat someone to death with one of those old phones they were so tough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sitting back in your chair to apply makeup to your whole face will just be a big blurry blog in place of your face.  </li>
            <li>I had it for at least 10 years and it still worked, but this 15x mirror has better magnification and is a bit larger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a few months and the light bulb is already out.</li>
            <li>I had one of these that I loved to use for eyebrow plucking especially, so when I dropped the mirror and it cracked into pieces you can imagine how sad I was.  </li>
            <li>You can really see close up with this mirror but it is hard to focus things in the right spot</li>
            <li>However, there is some major design flaw with the electrical system.  </li>
            <li>love this mirror small but big enough for what I need it for.</li>
            <li>so I have not other choice but keep it.</li>
            <li>Is a little tricky to use but definite worth the money!</li>
            <li>Switch on light is not good, guess I will live with that because, I can&#x27;t see with out this mirror</li>
            <li>And further, this new mirror is smaller than my old one.  </li>
            <li>I find the new design (more magnification-good) with the light is really annoying to use.  </li>
            <li>The viewing area is not large due to the magnification, but this is the strongest mirror I have found, even if the light just comes from the bottom.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap and a 15X magnified mirror is hard to find.</li>
            <li>Supposedly you can change the brightness on the light, but it is really hard to do so.</li>
            <li>Replacing an old 5x magnification that finally died.  </li>
            <li>Too far back to the store I bought it at to return it</li>
            <li>This company used to make quality Magnifying Mirror lights and apparently is now in it to rip people off.</li>
            <li>Much smaller footprint than her old mirror.</li>
            <li>And if you look at it the wrong way, it kind of blinds you.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ve accidentally broken the mirror so to be on the safe side before a recent trip to Israel, I ordered a new one to use as a back-up.</li>
            <li>so you wont need to purchase a new one for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have to hold it right up to my face and it gets heavy to hold.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get used to it as it made me feel &amp;#34;cross-eyed&amp;#34; at first due to the magnificant magnification, but i finally got used to it.</li>
            <li>Bad contacts, cheap design!!!</li>
            <li>The mirror is hard to clean and the surface is streaky .</li>
            <li>The light did not stay on and having to take the thing apart to use it was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>placement of light makes it difficult for viewing much of face.  </li>
            <li>guessing it&#x27;s to either top heavy or bottom heavy.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a number of years ago, only to be VERY disappointed in the fact that the very bright light, which is a small bulb at the bottom of the mirror, shines directly into my eyes, thus practically \\&quot;blinding\\&quot; me.</li>
            <li>Reading these reviews, I see that the less positive ones are from people who don&#x27;t understand the purpose of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth no more than $15-20.  </li>
            <li>As you get older your eyes aren&#x27;t as sharp.</li>
            <li>The bulbs are hard to change &amp; go out quickly.</li>
            <li>Imagine my disappointment when I reached my destination and realized my new mirror didn&#x27;t light!</li>
            <li>Will see how long the new one works - delay in starting seems strange.</li>
            <li>The light is not bright enough and the mirror is so concave that focus is only possible in the very middle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good product, good value.</li>
            <li> I had a mirror I loved from the Sharper Image.</li>

            <li> Good mirror</li>
            <li> Oh man that show is so good.</li>
            <li> Lighting is good for both daytime and nightime.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for make-up applcation as the up close view allows for smooth finish of the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly compact</li>
            <li> magnification and good lighting lets you find even the tiniest chin whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Good make up mirror</li>
            <li> good price  </li>
            <li> this is a good mirror</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD MIRROR.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous product for an amazing price!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> The magnification is wonderful, add the light</li>
            <li> Good Afternoon Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perfect light and mirror size.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost too good.  </li>
            <li> So good in fact that I no longer have it.  </li>
            <li> Light weight, and magnification is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to get use to it, which I am.10 inch is a good size mirror.</li>
            <li> light on this mirror is located in the perfect spot for chin plucking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good quality mirror.  </li>
            <li> did not work as good as I thougth</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is good however the lightbulb began flickering after a month of use-</li>
            <li> I can pluck eyebrows and know that I&#x27;ve done a good job at it - no stray hairs.</li>
            <li> This was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good magnification.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> The mirror does a good job.</li>
            <li> The light is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the mirror is not as good as the 1st one I owned.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is excellent but the light is not so good.  </li>
            <li> The magnification mirror is great and, if the lighting worked (which it did for awhile on my first one), it gives excellent viewing.</li>
            <li> If you learn forward to pluck your eyebrows you will have the most perfect eyebrows in town. :)</li>
            <li> It is great for every day use, but is also wonderful for travel because it folds up to be very compact.  </li>
            <li> Mirror is a good size, happy with it mostly except for it tips over a lot...i&#x27;m  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent mirror and in a couple years worth of using it about once a week I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> The distortion is so great that you have to almost have your face touching it to make it usable.</li>
            <li> Not the most attractive looking, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror and was happy to see they are still making it.  </li>
            <li> Can see more than I need to and great for home or travel.</li>
            <li> mirror has just the right magnification and excellent clarity.</li>
            <li> It has 15X Magnification and a light that is bright and shines where you want it!</li>
            <li> Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> You will see way more than you probably want to!</li>
            <li> Not any more with this mirror!</li>
            <li> I love it and my eyebrow plucking has never been easier!</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!  </li>
            <li> Love this mirror!  </li>
            <li> I love this magnifier morrow!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!</li>
            <li> I am glad I could find it on amazon!</li>
            <li> this mirror allowed me to see everything I had hoped was not there  and more some!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this mirror!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the magnification in this mirror!  </li>
            <li> At my age, I had difficulty tweezing my eyebrows using most magnifying mirrors but this did the trick!  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  </li>
            <li> but I love this product!</li>
            <li> The magnification is amazing.</li>
            <li> I think this mirror does an amazing job of magnifying without distortion.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is amazing.  </li>
            <li> so are great precise tweezers......</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars because it&#x27;s amazing for makeup applying.</li>
            <li> light in the mirror adds great versatility.  </li>
            <li> but the light is not in a great position.</li>
            <li> So nice, I bought it twice.</li>
            <li> I am going to return it and buy another kind.   </li>
            <li> This one is durable, has good magnification, and the light is good quality.</li>
            <li> but it is really nice and the light works great too.</li>
            <li> Gets warm and you should not leave plugged in when not in use.</li>
            <li> daylight mirror, which (surprisingly) shows much more than this advertised 15x.</li>
            <li> Yep, handy mirror, I use it a lot.</li>
            <li> Good and truthful product.  </li>
            <li> Nice have 15x magnification</li>
            <li> Every woman - any age - should own this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Works well, takes up some room, wish it had a mounting to the wall option but for the most part it is a good product</li>
            <li> It is the best mirror I have ever used, but you need to be ready to see EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to travel with.</li>
            <li> This one is more powerful (magnification) and is great for what I need and use it for!!!</li>
            <li> I am confident that I look good at all times.</li>
            <li> I liked this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product with super strong magnify.</li>
            <li> great magnification, good light, easy to fold and carry.</li>
            <li> Even more then it&#x27;s power, the Floxite is lite, portable and has a great light.</li>
            <li> it is not as  strong nor as bright  </li>
            <li> Can use successfully without my glasses and is travel friendly as a foldup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Just whar I needed,  and wanted  Great, good size and love the large magnifacation.</li>
            <li> Large, great light, great mirror...feel helpless applying makeup, tweezing eyebrows, etc., without it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the light is as bright as the others I have been.  </li>
            <li> The light, even with the filters, is so bright that it is blinding.</li>
            <li> - So far, I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Switch is shorting out and light isn&#x27;t that bright</li>
            <li> This is the greatest for my old eyes.  </li>
            <li> My old mirror was suffering from the problems of age - cracking at the edges of the rim - but otherwise was in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> 15X is so easy to see even the smallest hairs to pluck!</li>
            <li> and now the light is on top which is great for casting light when using the mirror, nice that it can be changed if I should choose to.  </li>
            <li> This product was great for the first couple of months.  </li>
            <li> , I could see every hair that needed plucking, but like another person commented, they are made very cheaply.  </li>
            <li> Works well and very light weight.  </li>
            <li> and it works great on my upper face, no problems, honest!  </li>
            <li> The good part of that is that we can eradicate the said flaw quickly ;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34; and my eyesight isn&#x27;t as great as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I have to be on top of it to see.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my sister loves the one I gave her.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the design</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this mirror for many years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> No, it is not a makeup mirror, but is excellent for grooming - when you want to make sure you&#x27;ve gotten every last stray eyebrow hair, THIS is the mirror you want.  </li>
            <li> 2nd one and works awesome!</li>
            <li> Love the increased power although it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I call it my magic mirror.</li>
            <li> so trying one more time.</li>
            <li> up-right begins to flop and won&#x27;t hold the mirror up any more.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I had a 5x mirror for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I can see my face better with that option.  </li>
            <li> I love my  15x lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li> I simply mounted it on the wall in the bathroom and it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to put on my eye makeup without this mirror.  </li>
            <li> I really love this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> also it increases my ability to see more detail.  </li>
            <li> but I think that will be the best way to use this item as the stand is short.  </li>
            <li> so I am glad to see they have increased the magnification on this model.  </li>
            <li> I would love to return it to the seller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend as the best mirror to purchase.</li>
            <li> To get 4 more days of use out of it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 4 of them 1 as a gift and we love it.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this product, and would order from company again.  </li>
            <li> but I sure do.  </li>
            <li> THIS DEFINATELY LIGHTS UP THE FACE AND BRINGS THINGS INTO FOCUS FOR THOSE OF US WHO NEED TO SEE BETTER TO PUT ON OUR MAKE-UP AND GROOM</li>
            <li> However, for what it is it works very well and the light on the bottom is incredibly helpful for highlighting stay hairs</li>
            <li> Great mirror for very closeup.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful, two things I would change is for it to be bigger and taller.</li>
            <li> Never have to worry about not being able to see all the things that need attention.  </li>
            <li> Just love this mirror  </li>
            <li> and I have had many</li>
            <li> I love the magnification on this product.  </li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I do like it better than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love makeup mirrors.  </li>
            <li> This mirror lets me get a much better look at my face and makeup than I could get with a pair of glasses.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I like the realization sinking in, however with this mirror I&#x27;m able to see wrinkles</li>
            <li> This mirror does have fantastic, bright light, from the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Love this makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> This is an okay product...</li>
            <li> Love this mirror to get my eyebrows without my glasses on.</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MIRROR.  </li>
            <li> and I love them</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> perfect for chin and upper lip area.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love how compact it is and how the mirror moves for better</li>
            <li> The light is nice but it does make me see spots after using it for alittle while.</li>
            <li> and they love it too.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t as many choices when looking for a 15X magnification style.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> It works great for real close up.</li>
            <li> How&#x27;s yours? :-)</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve had many mirrors that could drop two feet without breaking.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love the 15x magnification on this mirror</li>
            <li> The thought to test my latest purchase never entered my mind because</li>
            <li> (most of the time).</li>
            <li> The lighting is okay.</li>
            <li> I tend to use it next my window on a sunny day to get best results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It helps me cover my flaws and feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Love this mirror and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> BUT THAT&#x27;S THE IDEA :)</li>
            <li> downside is that I look at it every AM and PM now, to make sure I dont miss anything.</li>
            <li> This mirror will make you see more than you want to</li>
            <li> I love this magnifying mirror and have more than one.  </li>
            <li> I am now able to remove and apply my makeup correctly once again.</li>
            <li> Great price, great delivery and can&#x27;t go wrong in keeping the wife happy.</li>
            <li> My son loved mine so much, I had to get another one!</li>
            <li> The best thing is the mirror with the cut out that allows the beam of light to actually hit the area.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I can send it back with Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy.</li>
            <li> old was was great for many years</li>
            <li> The price was very good and the mirror is terrific.  </li>
            <li> Very very cool.</li>
            <li> So far this is great.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the hunt for a brighter bulb that will fit (safely, of course).</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this fabulous item, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to put on my eye makeup since having cataract surgery; it improved my distance vision but practically lost my close-up</li>
            <li> The light is okay.</li>
            <li> But none I found had this strength of magnification and that was what was most important to me for my use of it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it because I wear glasses, and it enables me to see so much better.</li>
            <li> WOW this is great.</li>
            <li> I need and appreciate the magnification, but wish the light was brighter...or that my eyes worked better.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it does a good job, helps me keep my chin smooth, and I would recommend it for anyone who needs a good lighted magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Super magnification that only a brave woman can take!</li>
            <li> Our eyes are getting older along with the rest of the body and this is perfect for old eyes being able to see what we are doing.</li>
            <li> With a 15x magnification this isn&#x27;t the best mirror for makeup application other than eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This is my third mirror over many years and am mostly happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s so easy to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> to any angel for easy viewing&amp;#60;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;ANGEL</li>
            <li> or angle??&lt;br /&gt;Mirror detaches and folds for easy travel and storage&lt;</li>
            <li> they were very quick to send a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I bought two; wish I had bought a few more at this incredible price!!!!</li>
            <li> it is so easy to see and take care of.  </li>
            <li> Having 15X makes it easy to see even without glasses.</li>
            <li> Plus it is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I when out an bought a 12 or 15 magnified, portable mirror, easy, I can sit by a sunny window</li>
            <li> It provided easy viewing for close-up tweezing since I can&#x27;t see close up without my readers.  </li>
            <li> The mirror can easily be adjusted for height.</li>
            <li> Need to find something easy</li>
            <li> The mirror detaches easily for travel.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> had to send this back.&lt;br /&gt;Way too strong.  </li>
            <li> High magnification, good lighting, and it comes apart and folds up for easy traveling.</li>
            <li> I use a 5x magnification for foundation and general review, but this is great for what needs detail.  </li>
            <li> I liked my first one</li>
            <li> I looked at several but this one still had the 15X magnification I like and the light is good too!</li>
            <li> It was packed very well in the box and came in excellent condition with extra bulbs and three lighting effect lenses which you should try to see which is most comfortable.</li>
            <li> and I believe that when you get used to it will do the work just fine.</li>
            <li> The bonus is that it easily snaps apart for traveling and it&#x27;s so light weight that I can carry it in my shoulder bag with no problem.  </li>
            <li> it is not as light or as easy to travel with as I was led to believe.</li>
            <li> The Floxite Magnifying Mirror Light is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Can see everything fine.</li>
            <li> Mirrors worked fine for awhile and then sporadically or not at all.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these mirrors years and years ago, it was still working fine</li>
            <li> mirror was more than adequate to see what I needed to see.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and recommend this mirror highly.</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap.</li>
            <li> and I can see inside my eyes and easy to clean my eyes with mirror.</li>
            <li> Also the light.</li>
            <li> The light gets in my eyes...</li>
            <li> I could say I like this mirror, but for the price, it&#x27;s unacceptable that the light fixture stops working after a while.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared for what you are going to see when you look in this fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li> The light makes it so convenient.  </li>
            <li> I wish the light was brighter.  </li>
            <li> Great visualization for eyebrow, upper lip, and chin hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Baby Boomers NEED better selection of these type of products - this is a rare find ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this magnification light for years</li>
            <li> I like the light</li>
            <li> Well, they show two mirrors, I didnt understand I was purchasing the one with the covered light.  </li>
            <li> The light shines in your eyes while you are trying to use it up close..</li>
            <li> The mirror will come off for travel without the light, but you would have to wrap it securely.  </li>
            <li> I can not comment about the light because I have not had to use it as of yet.  </li>
            <li> this model has the light below the mirror which puts the light where you need it for plucking, etc.  </li>
            <li> The problem with the light, is that a defuser disk is inserted in front of the light and there is no way to remove it.  </li>
            <li> If you can use another light source or daylight there is no problem.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend product to others seeking a distortion free magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it came with three bulbs -</li>
            <li> Your make up really shows up nicely, and you can even do your eye brows nicley</li>
            <li> I wish that the light was a bit brighter though.</li>
            <li> I just wish the light were brighter.</li>
            <li> The light did NOT stay on.  </li>
            <li> I had to take off the mirror and &amp;#34;jiggle&amp;#34; the light bulb.  </li>
            <li> I find as my vision is poorer that I could use brighter or wider light</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my face and neck free from unsightly hair.  </li>
            <li> My light did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred a mirror with light all around the sides like some have.</li>
            <li> The magnification was great for eyebrows and facial hair.  </li>
            <li> have no use for the amber light diffuser.</li>
            <li> When I try to use the mirror the light shines in my eyes because of the size of the mirror.</li>
            <li> Light has delayed &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch.  </li>
            <li> light - worked</li>
            <li> The light is while and illuminating,</li>
            <li> I often use it without the light, too.</li>
            <li> My eyeliner is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Now the light doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> Ok,  not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> The light at the bottom is distracting when you look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li> You need to take some time to figure out how to position the mirror so that the light doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes while you are trying to tweeze.</li>
            <li> so the light was not in my eye.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old model, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Well lit, good clear mirror, filters are accurate and helpful-</li>
            <li> The price for the mirror is good because it is a clear mirror</li>
            <li> I finally figured I needed a real close-up mirror to do it and this one is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Now that my eyes are getting older, I can&#x27;t see the close stuff any more!  </li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of magnification to assist appropriate application of makeup.</li>
            <li> you use it correctly and tilt the mirror right,  you will love it</li>
            <li> So - if you need high magnification and good lighting of the center of your face, this is a great mirror.  </li>
            <li> I find it very useful in applying make up, tweezing, or anytime</li>
            <li> Floxite is a great brand, but the bulb area of this particular mirror takes up too much space, so visibility is measurably compromised.</li>
            <li> This is such a good quality distortion free mirror, light weight, and has a strong light.</li>
            <li> The light on the bottom of the mirror is very strong, yet very concentrated.    </li>
            <li> This mirror is too small and the bright light is too bright.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy, throws good light and really helps to see what you&#x27;d rather not see!</li>
            <li> Eyes need more magnification - notice first light made in U.S. - this light made in China.  </li>
            <li> You can see every pore on your face and every hair in your eyebrows, which makes removing blackheads or tweezing your eyebrows super easy.  </li>
            <li> This one does not have an optional battery power source which I had found a nice feature in the past, but still a great product.  </li>
            <li> On the original one I had, the lighting just quit working (and it wasn&#x27;t the bulb).  </li>
            <li> I still have the original bulb in this mirror.  </li>
            <li> So I just call the friendly company and they mail a replacement to me.  </li>
            <li> Just friendly, helpful people.</li>
            <li> Works great for plucking whiskers, but I really wish it had a non-magnifying mirror as well (some mirrors are able to be flipped 180 degrees and have a non-magnifying mirror on the opposite side).  </li>
            <li> So far i am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The price is well worth it!</li>
            <li> or I may still have the original one.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Replacing the original with the replacement bulb did not resolve the problem.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the exact mirror on Amazon because it is a great mirror that makes finding and plucking hairs so much easier for the visually challenged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Minuses - if you are a klutz, it does break pretty spectacularly / having said that, must also add that I&#x27;ve klutzed out before w/my mirror with no ill effects...but that time ;-(  So, it is made well.  </li>
            <li> I would much prefer light at the sides or top of the mirror.</li>
            <li> The light is bright enough for seeing just about every hair on your face!</li>
            <li> And I liked it since it had absolutely no distortion anywhere on the mirror and was so handy to use for finding even the tiniest defect on my face or eye.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be built better and is much easier to use with both hand free.  </li>
            <li> The light was to bright for me, even after I tried the different lenses.</li>
            <li> In addition, while using the mirror, with the light turned on, the light is shinning right in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Packed very secure and fast ship.</li>
            <li> The center magnification is great</li>
            <li> It is bright enough to use though.</li>
            <li> I had the larger two sided 9x mirror they used to offer and my sister loved it</li>
            <li> It is a shame to throw a good lighted mirror away, just because one piece is a defect but a piece that is essential to the use of the product !!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think this was a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> Quality is good but it&#x27;s magnification is too big for comfort and that makes it not practical.</li>
            <li> The light is nice, but it really only light up the mirror for one angle, when I try to turn the mirror, it just gives me a shadow where I&#x27;m trying to get to.</li>
            <li> It is NOT for applying full face makeup.  </li>
            <li> 10x just isn&#x27;t good enough</li>
            <li> so this is a true bonus device for me.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good buy.</li>
            <li> This mirror was a good price, and is compact enough that I can put it under my sink when it&#x27;s not in use</li>
            <li> love this light and mirror, this is my second one, even pack it in the suitcase for vacation, love it</li>
            <li> I had one of these mirrors (same brand and model) for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I consider this mirror essential for good grooming.  </li>
            <li> The light is strong and really helps.</li>
            <li> Also, when switching on the light it doesn&#x27;t come on right away, there is a time lag.</li>
            <li> Why strain when the right tool is available?</li>
            <li> At home I have a lighted 15x Conair (pretty one with brushed nickel) in my bathroom and this light is nearly as bright.  </li>
            <li> I almost did not purchase this based on other reviews I read, but I am so happy I did.  </li>
            <li> The image is clear and the light makes it even better.  </li>
            <li> Luckily Bed Bath and Beyond started carrying the replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li> this mirror is great for seeing things really up close only.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon&#x27;s free shipping offers and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> So, I quickly reordered a replacement from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I tried every which way to use it, thinking if others liked it, then maybe I was not positioning myself close enough/far enough away from it to stop the light from zapping my eyeballs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the high magnification of this mirror.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for applying makeup, best used for tweezing or close inspection of your face.</li>
            <li> Great mirror, small enough to fit an any bathroom, and its magnification is especially handy for putting on makeup and removing facial hair!!  </li>
            <li> Oh, and I was thrilled to see that the bottom has a place where you can hang the mirror on the wall, - this will be appreciated when I get the new one for the bathroom!</li>
            <li> On this particular purchase: The light flickered, had to be wiggled to make it light up.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to replace it with a new model.  </li>
            <li> New and improved with more magnification.</li>
            <li> I love my new Floxite 15x makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> This was a great price, much less than I paid for the one it is replacing.</li>
            <li> As my eyesight dims, actually I&#x27;m becoming more far-sighted, I needed to see close up to pluck my eyebrows and such.  </li>
            <li> Would have liked more versatility as the mirror only allows for the high powered magnification.</li>
            <li> Chose this rating because it was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I was actually pretty excited to get this mirror because it was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s daunting to find facial hairs that I barely suspected existed, but the good news is that I can keep on top of them before anyone else knows.</li>
            <li> It is 110V ONLY, (after I fried mine not knowing), so I had to order another one because I love it!</li>
            <li> The mirror is bigger than the first one which I had for MANY years before it died on me and offers good viewing.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a good size, it&#x27;s large enough I can see, can stand on my vanity top while I tweeze, and I can easily carry it downstairs and outside to see makeup colors/tones in a variety of lighting conditions (when I&#x27;m carrying it around, it&#x27;s unplugged, of course).  </li>
            <li> For women over a certain age with unwanted hair growth, that would primarily be the chin area.  </li>
            <li> A great little 15x mirror for my desktop.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a great size and there is little to no distortion.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I have purchased and I like it because it is good for travel as it folds up and is not too large.</li>
            <li> recommend it to everybody, specially those who wants to keep unwanted hair under control!</li>
            <li> The light is in the mirror and very distracting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need the light because it is sitting on a shelf at the bathroom window, but after reading reviews ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and very portable.</li>
            <li> Came with 2 light bulbs and different lenses for light diffusion (daylight and office light).  </li>
            <li> And the light is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> The light really does make a difference in the clarity.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This Foxlite is much better designed and made than our old one.</li>
            <li> &quot; you can change out; clear for brighter light and amber for a softer light.  </li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Price is somewhat steep but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it--it does what I expected and does it well.</li>
            <li> It serves as a fine replacement for that older mirror.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to replace an older Floxite Magnifying Mirror that finally died on me after many, many years.  </li>
            <li> Other mirrors I have tried were good for applying make-up, but this one sees every mark and hair, and allows my removal of them.  </li>
            <li> I lost right eye to see.</li>
            <li> Not the right mirror for makeup since you have to get so close.</li>
            <li> I also think you have to be to close to the mirror to see all right.</li>
            <li> I will say right after purchasing this</li>
            <li> you are certain you have not plucked in 10 years (true)</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for seeing just a small portion of your face at a time.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have great magnification, but the mirror itself is so small</li>
            <li> I had the original Floxite 15X mirror, which I loved, this mirror is so small</li>
            <li> One of the very few with 15X so bought one and it was great</li>
            <li> It distorts the image and you have to have your face in exactly the right distance to see.</li>
            <li> The mirrow is smaller than I thought and the light seems like a spot light and my eyes can&#x27;t focas well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, it&#x27;s great for plucking eyebrows, applying eye makeup and &#x27;taking care of&#x27; some gross facial issues.  </li>
            <li> My second one, liked it so much I got one for another room.</li>
            <li> I have owned this item previously and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The only reason this product doesn&#x27;t merit 5 stars is that the light comes solely from the bottom, so you really need some decent room lighting from overhead or the side in order to be able to see well; however, the only mirrors I&#x27;ve been able to find with surround lighting had a maximum magnification of 10X, and the greater magnification of this mirror is much better when what you have to look at is small and you need to be precise.  </li>
            <li> This one is a lot larger and has a white frosted light for an even more detailed view.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for zeroing in on hard to see areas with middle-aged eyes.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for getting those hard to see chin hairs.  </li>
            <li> Also, 15X mag is WAY too much!  </li>
            <li> First one came cracked, they did replace it, which is always a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The first mirror I bought lasted about two months.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that if I used it daily, it would be inoperable by now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same mirror for many years and dropped it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get a replacement part but decided to buy an extra one just to have on hand.  </li>
            <li> The first one I had for about 10 yrs.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for up close makeup, tweezer grooming.  </li>
            <li> After more than 5 years, it finally died.</li>
            <li> I have actually had more than 2 of these, and eventually the arm that hold the mirror</li>
            <li> I ordered replacement bulbs and was sure to order EXTRA.</li>
            <li> Though this was perfect for very close work - I saw EVERY pore up close and personal - you have to stay just a few inches from the mirror or the distortion makes it unusable.  </li>
            <li> If you need a distortion free, clear magnifying mirror, this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not a mirror to use to comb your hair.  </li>
            <li> Thank you ever so much!  </li>
            <li> The first one had a damaged cord so I had to replace it.  </li>
            <li> The first one I purchased wouldn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> This mirror does exactly what I ordered it for.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I attempt to make it higher on the counter by putting things under it.</li>
            <li> I needed a higher magnification for applying eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This is the best mirror I have ever found for tweezing my eyebrows and those random stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> But even though I never looked directly into the LED light, it hurt my eyes and gave me a headache every time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I always look on Amazon first when I need to make a purchase.</li>
            <li> Many women said it only lighted the bottom of their faces....</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> My first purchase was a mirror with 8X magnification, but returned it for the 15X. I fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product worked for the first four times being turned on.</li>
            <li> She accidentally dropped the first one and it broke</li>
            <li> Will use it until I find exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I would try there first.</li>
            <li> For many, many years this Floxite lighted magnifying mirror has been absolutely essential for my daily grooming.</li>
            <li> As subconscious as I felt, I did my best to cope with the thought of looking like a porcupine with too many stray hairs in the wrong places.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m home and have replaced the bulb, the magnifying mirror deserves a 10 or higher.</li>
            <li> I looked on amazon, and sure enough there it was.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this one because the magnification power is lower but the larger size seems to make up for it.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I rarely change the position of the mirror, so I was surprised it broke so quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one of same Floxite is superior in every way to many of the big name cosmetic companies</li>
            <li> Other people complain that the light is only on the lower part of their face...twist the mirror and the light will be on the upper face!I&#x27;m a dude and figured that out!!!!It has better magnification than most mirrors.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and the only one I will buy at a good price.</li>
            <li> The maginfication is great, but the one light at the bottom makes it difficult to see certain parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to find at local retail stores but now is only available to purchase on line.  </li>
            <li> Great for extreme closeup work such as plucking.</li>
            <li> The light bulbs that come with the mirror only last about two weeks; I have now run out of bulbs and cannot find any more bulbs.</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered this magnifying mirror light for tweezing my eyebrows after noticing in a store just how many hairs were left because I had been using a regular mirror.</li>
            <li> At first it worked fine, then only some of the time, and then it was just \\&quot;dead\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Folds down nicely for travel.  </li>
            <li> This little lighted mirror sure does the job!  </li>
            <li> The light didn&#x27;t work after the first time I turned it on (and again, it wasn&#x27;t the bulb as I tried several).  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is small, and I can fit it in my suitcase when traveling.  </li>
            <li> As is normal with age, my eyes are worsening and this light allows me to see clearly when doing eyebrows or putting on make-up.  </li>
            <li> I use mine everyday and it is especially great for plucking my dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that its just a single mirror.</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars but for the limited viewing angels and positions that it is able to move into.</li>
            <li> Had I not thrown the box away, I would have certainly returned it.  </li>
            <li> anyways, it tips over at a certain point</li>
            <li> Not long after purchasing it, the light began to flicker.</li>
            <li> I tried switching the bulb from my old one to the new one, but it didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> The bulbs are fine, it&#x27;s the connector that is obviously faulty.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older lamp!</li>
            <li> Every mirror I looked at was a 8x or 10x and was very high in cost.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice little mirror.  </li>
            <li> I would still like a little larger however, great mirror for the money.  </li>
            <li> It is large enough to see your face, magnifies by 15 which is helpful and the light just helps with the whole process.</li>
            <li> From the outside this new mirror looks pretty with the light at the bottom, but it certainly does not measure up to its claims.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is great, but in my case it&#x27;s prolly bad because I find myself picking at my imperfections more than I should.</li>
            <li> The light intensity is much too low.</li>
            <li> Although the mirror is 6.5 inches the light is imbedded in the mirror and the light is 2 inches round.</li>
            <li> but it is larger &amp; the light is around the whole outer surface of the mirror.</li>
            <li> Second one the light bulb flickered.</li>
            <li> The light flickers constantly.</li>
            <li> It magnifies so much you can see things you never saw before.  </li>
            <li> Extra bulbs for the light are a plus too.  </li>
            <li> Very close up inspection capabilities.</li>
            <li> she thanks me.  </li>
            <li> so you didn&#x27;t need to buy the whole thing when you break the mirror.</li>
            <li> The light works well, came with extra bulbs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like this mirror because I can apply my eye makeup and not worry about applying too much or leaving mascara blobs under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> So much for switching out the lenses for varied lighting.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really underdstand the bulbs, but I guess I will in time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s for VERY closeup reconnaissance.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
            <li> I payed way to much money for this item.</li>
            <li> Comes assembled and ready to use and is lighted that plugs into 120 volt outlet.</li>
            <li> Supervision Magnifying Mirror Light, White, Frosted White&gt;</li>
            <li> There was too much glare, so it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I find very distracting..</li>
            <li> I can tweeze my eyebrows and put on my mascara and really see what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li> Yes, If you try and look at the WHOLE face and not spot areas, it is not the mirror for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was appreciated.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mirror</li>
            <li> It really magnifies so be</li>
            <li> and it gets very close up</li>
            <li> i really like it</li>
            <li> The light is of no use - does not give enough illumination.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Not only did it come with one light bulb, it came with two replacements.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this mirror to anyone who wants a closer look at their skin.</li>
            <li> I dont like it much and wiykdnt buy again</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> It takes getting really close and then:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this mirror as a make up mirror, so I can&#x27;t really give an opinion on that aspect.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really do much else with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased to do by brows, but found myself giving my  face a whole critique....</li>
            <li> I really should have returned it.</li>
            <li> Supervision Magnifying Mirror Light, White, Frosted...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost too much.  </li>
            <li> so much I bought one for each bathroom and also gave 2 as gifts...</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will appreciate it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> The magnification is almost too much.</li>
            <li> REALLY???</li>
            <li> You will not see your whole face at one time.</li>
            <li> Although the mirror size of the 10x mirror is only 5 inches the light is below the mirror.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> It says it has different light filters that go with this mirror, but I didn&#x27;t see them in the box, and again it is portable so this isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li> The light shines in your face, and you have to almost put your nose on the mirror to avoid the distortion mentioned by numerous reviewers.</li>
            <li> I only wished the light was brighter.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes this one for its magnification and portability.</li>
            <li> I like the larger one because the light is not so concentrated in one area.</li>
            <li> I like the portability of this one and the fact that the whole mirror is magnified.</li>
            <li> It could be a whole lot brighter than it is.  </li>
            <li> so it is very flexible.</li>
            <li> This is probably because of the intense magnification.</li>
            <li> first of all, this mirror was so distorted that I could hardly find an area that didn&#x27;t have a great deal of distortion on it, like one of those sideshow mirrors at the fair; and secondly, when I compared this new mirror with my old 10x mirror I found that there was absolutely NO difference in magnification between the two - they were identical!  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few months we&#x27;ve come to appreciate its bright light and sharp reflected images.</li>
            <li> face that other wise you would miss on a regular mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is lighter in weight and much more stable than the other but does not have the swivel mirror I had come to rely on.  </li>
            <li> I put the clear in first and it absolutely will not come out.  </li>
            <li> It is much lighter and smaller than the full sized tri-fold lighted mirror that i have been carrying in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> I actually find it fun once again to get ready!  </li>
            <li> I have had other Floxite magnifying mirrors in the past and the light on this one isn&#x27;t as bright as the others.</li>
            <li> BUT it would be greater with the halo around it instead of a TINY little light toward the bottom of the mirror</li>
            <li> The bulb on my old one was much brighter - I miss the extra light.</li>
            <li> You really see things that you normally don&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a regular mirror with 1x and 5-7x&#x27;s for putting on full face makeup.  </li>
            <li> The mirror does not work very well, poor visibility, and the light broke within the first month, Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 15x rather than my previous 10x and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Less clothes, more confidence in applying makeup</li>
            <li> Your previous design model was much much better.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this particular mirror to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a replacement under the warranty for my third mirror, got the fourth.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone whose eyesight is getting older like mine.  </li>
            <li> The older</li>
            <li> As you get older it is a must.</li>
            <li> As I get older</li>
            <li> I just got this particular model, so</li>
            <li> Mirror does NOT come close to providing adequate lighting necessary for use.</li>
            <li> This not only gives you 5 inches of viewable mirror the light isn&#x27;t shinning directly into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As eyes grow older we need help for close up makeup, tweezing, etc.  </li>
            <li> it is at best only 10x and a poor one at that!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for us older folk whose eyes need help.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Likes the high magnification.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a non-expensive mirror with high magnification</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this mirror for those of you who need to tweeze eye brows or whiskers from chin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> to anyone wanting a high quality mirror.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend the 15x magnification.</li>
            <li> design should just be a little better.</li>
            <li> my old Floxite magnifying mirror shorted out at the cord (where I always pulled on it to pick it up!!).</li>
            <li> Even if I have 5-6 other lights on in my bedroom, this mirror still does NOT provide adequate lighting for necessary light.</li>
            <li> but the light is in the lower center of the mirror instead of around the outer edge.</li>
            <li> I expected the light to be brighter.</li>
            <li> Just like my old one but not broken........</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you have to get real close to the mirror before you can get a good view of your face.</li>
            <li> Allows you to see 15xs the normal eye.  </li>
            <li> Be forewarned: You will see your facial pores as the craters of the moon, your facial hairs as a tropical rain forest, any capillaries as rivers, and any wrinkles as the Grand Canyon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first receiving it and setting it up (very simple)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stand firmly and would work better if you have the place to sit while using it.  </li>
            <li> Good lighting and small enough to pack on trips.</li>
            <li> In any case, I thought that I would buy a new mirror with a little more power, and this so-called 15x mirror seemed to be just what I would need.  </li>
            <li> mirror is perfect for people with not so sharp eyesight, and for people in places with ill lighting.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the process of plucking go so much quicker and</li>
            <li> I should have focused more on the negative reviews than the positive ones.</li>
            <li> The light really helps see all those little hairs that you would miss without it.</li>
            <li> I was going to returned it because it hurts my eyes, but I could not find an other one for that price that will have the 15x mirror and with light</li>
            <li> Since I had had it for 2 years, I ordered a new one.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought me this new mirror to replace one I bought about 15 years ago...</li>
            <li> I would have returned  the new mirror immediately  </li>
            <li> I got this new one as a spare for when she and my brother visit and stay with us.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased a new one to travel with me.</li>
            <li> and I cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li> New mirror design - need to get used to it -</li>
            <li> THIS MIRROR CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT,</li>
            <li> everything is super big and super sharp.  </li>
            <li> But out of the box, the light only worked on a total of two occasions (it would flicker and I would have to shake the mirror to get it to stay lit).  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as the first one I had!</li>
            <li> I have owned other Floxite mirrors, most recently the 7\\&quot; Magnifying mirror, and never had any problems.  </li>
            <li> Wore first one out and finally broke it</li>
            <li> I love the mirror, but changing the bulb is most difficult!</li>
            <li> No more standing at the window with a magnifying mirror entertaining the neighbors.  </li>
            <li> Started digging and found that the contact from the bulb to the socket either wears down or is so cheap that the connection no longer works.</li>
            <li> with any magnifying mirror, most people have to be within a very few inches to see without distortion.</li>
            <li> but, the new mirror does not have the strength,  nor the brightness that my old one had  ....</li>
            <li> but  as soon as I assembled it  I put my old mirror in the new box and tossed it out...</li>
            <li> next day I turned on the new mirror to discover  for certain</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the mirror size could be somewhat larger; other than that a very good product!</li>
            <li> This mirror has more than enough light (I haven&#x27;t tried the other lens&#x27;s yet) and is much larger in diameter than I expected.</li>
            <li> But everything else about this mirror is better than my previous one (a Sharper Image in a similar style).</li>
            <li> The fit was so loose that the second time I used it, when I picked it up to put it on the shelf, the mirror flew off, landed on the floor and smashed to pieces.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the reason for having the lighting below and having a smaller mirror surface where you can zero in on certain areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is fantastic to catch those little hairs on you</li>
            <li> Love this little mirror, but thought it would be a bit larger than it is....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on myself too :)</li>
            <li> like the mirror, alittle tough to see what i want it for but overall ok, the light in your eyes is hard to stand, espically if you have light sensitive as i do.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again and would recommend buyers to steer clear.</li>
            <li> It is clearly faulty --</li>
            <li> It is extremely clear and accurate--I see all of my flaws.  </li>
            <li> My old one bit the dust, it was given to me by my mother.  </li>
            <li> I believe the material the mirror is made of is like bakelite, what the old phones were made of.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly heavy and folds up well for travel.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this mirror is that you must get  very close to it to see anything.</li>
            <li> But it really isn&#x27;t bright enough and adding the CLEAR diffuser, just made it worse.</li>
            <li> Ordered replacement direct from Floxite at twice the price</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because her old mirror broke.</li>
            <li> as my old mirror  was you changed the  product somehow  </li>
            <li> I feel completely ripped off</li>
            <li> Replaced my old floxite (had it for over 10 years) with this one.</li>
            <li> You can really focus on specific areas -</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I have used it exclusively to highlight facial hair for tweezing and it does it really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never changed the bulb in my old one</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> Am attempting repairs but the baseline is so far below non-horror that I am not optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed with caution.  </li>
            <li> After looking for the mirrior that would let me do my makeup without my glasses I finally found it, thanks.</li>
            <li> Only buy this is you really need to see every pore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old and my eyesight is not what it used to be.  </li>
            <li> So...I ordered this mirror directly from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a magnifying mirror for a few months now, mostly for tweezing facial hair, and wanted a mirror with sufficient magnification that could also be put away.</li>
            <li> Scary good.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t survive without the mirror with such power, especially since my eyes are much weaker as I get older</li>
            <li> However, those are small issues that are easy to get used to and to work around.</li>
            <li> I have carried it on trips and all, can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the main part of the product.</li>
            <li> I thought the first one was defective, when the same thing happened to the 2nd mirror I realized  </li>
            <li> When you need to see something that close, there is no other way; this is a replacement for one that is 10 years old and got knocked over.</li>
            <li> according to the information in the box the new mirror was supposed to be the same as the old one...</li>
            <li> No other lighted mirror comes close to seeing all the things on your face that you don&#x27;t want any one else to see!</li>
            <li> - Spent over $40 for something that was poorly made (very cheap feeling) and so flimsy it broke right away.  </li>
            <li> No more red spots because you didn&#x27;t squeeze in exactly the right place or you missed a hair and tweezed skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; is it possible to return the new mirror without the box???</li>
            <li> It was actually cheaper to purchase a new unit on Amazon than to replace the mirror at the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> This new mirror is definitely NOT 15x ...</li>
            <li> The new bulbs I ordered last forever.</li>
            <li> With my bad eyesight I am able to apply light make up@</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re old enough to know bakelite, then you know that you could beat someone to death with one of those old phones they were so tough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sitting back in your chair to apply makeup to your whole face will just be a big blurry blog in place of your face.  </li>
            <li> I had it for at least 10 years and it still worked, but this 15x mirror has better magnification and is a bit larger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few months and the light bulb is already out.</li>
            <li> I had one of these that I loved to use for eyebrow plucking especially, so when I dropped the mirror and it cracked into pieces you can imagine how sad I was.  </li>
            <li> You can really see close up with this mirror but it is hard to focus things in the right spot</li>
            <li> However, there is some major design flaw with the electrical system.  </li>
            <li> love this mirror small but big enough for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> so I have not other choice but keep it.</li>
            <li> Is a little tricky to use but definite worth the money!</li>
            <li> Switch on light is not good, guess I will live with that because, I can&#x27;t see with out this mirror</li>
            <li> And further, this new mirror is smaller than my old one.  </li>
            <li> I find the new design (more magnification-good) with the light is really annoying to use.  </li>
            <li> The viewing area is not large due to the magnification, but this is the strongest mirror I have found, even if the light just comes from the bottom.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheap and a 15X magnified mirror is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Supposedly you can change the brightness on the light, but it is really hard to do so.</li>
            <li> Replacing an old 5x magnification that finally died.  </li>
            <li> Too far back to the store I bought it at to return it</li>
            <li> This company used to make quality Magnifying Mirror lights and apparently is now in it to rip people off.</li>
            <li> Much smaller footprint than her old mirror.</li>
            <li> And if you look at it the wrong way, it kind of blinds you.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ve accidentally broken the mirror so to be on the safe side before a recent trip to Israel, I ordered a new one to use as a back-up.</li>
            <li> so you wont need to purchase a new one for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have to hold it right up to my face and it gets heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to it as it made me feel &amp;#34;cross-eyed&amp;#34; at first due to the magnificant magnification, but i finally got used to it.</li>
            <li> Bad contacts, cheap design!!!</li>
            <li> The mirror is hard to clean and the surface is streaky .</li>
            <li> The light did not stay on and having to take the thing apart to use it was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> placement of light makes it difficult for viewing much of face.  </li>
            <li> guessing it&#x27;s to either top heavy or bottom heavy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a number of years ago, only to be VERY disappointed in the fact that the very bright light, which is a small bulb at the bottom of the mirror, shines directly into my eyes, thus practically \\&quot;blinding\\&quot; me.</li>
            <li> Reading these reviews, I see that the less positive ones are from people who don&#x27;t understand the purpose of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth no more than $15-20.  </li>
            <li> As you get older your eyes aren&#x27;t as sharp.</li>
            <li> The bulbs are hard to change &amp; go out quickly.</li>
            <li> Imagine my disappointment when I reached my destination and realized my new mirror didn&#x27;t light!</li>
            <li> Will see how long the new one works - delay in starting seems strange.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright enough and the mirror is so concave that focus is only possible in the very middle.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed; bulbs burn out very fast and have to be reordered often--not a good buy.</li>
            <li> hairs that have decided to sprout now that I&#x27;m a little older.  </li>
            <li> As you get older it is harder &amp; harder to see eyebrows that need plucking &amp; OMG....</li>
            <li> completely obscures other portions of face...useless.</li>
            <li> It is also small enough that it takes up little space on my vanity; leaving room for many other items, including a make-up mirror.</li>
            <li> When I bought it, it came with two mirrors, one large and one small one for travel.  </li>
            <li> , I at first had a hard time getting my face into focus.  </li>
            <li> It cost as much to buy a new one as to replace a broken part.</li>
            <li> This one works much better although the light is a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> Found one &amp; had the new one in my bathroom in a few days - yay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light on the mirror is at the worst location it would shine in your eyes and on top of that the darn thing broke.</li>
            <li> The light is definitely in the wrong place.  </li>
            <li> You do have to get close due to the high magnification, but you can look down every pore with this mirror or get something out of your eye easier.  </li>
            <li> You will also notice other facial hairs that need to be removed ..i.e. above your lip.</li>
            <li> for someone thats getting older and not able to see as well</li>
            <li> It is hard to see because the available space is so small.</li>
            <li> HAD TO GET USED TO THE AMOUNT OF MAGNIFICATION, BUT WITHIN TWO MONTHS, LIGHT FAILED.  </li>
            <li> The light is useless....</li>
            <li> found this mirror useless, even when not using the light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned mine a long time and never even had to change the bulb.  </li>
            <li> comes w/extra bulb for long life.</li>
            <li> The additional bulb did not&lt;br /&gt;last long either.</li>
            <li> the first didn&#x27;t work (would flash on, but not stay lit); a second was broken in the box.  </li>
            <li> No old lady chin hairs or other unwanted facial hair can escape the tweezers now.</li>
            <li> The light at the bottom is very irritating.  </li>
            <li> nothing helped with the fact the light is very poorly placed in this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and after buying a couple of other types of lighted mirrors that were put back in the boxes they came in - we have a winner with this one .</li>
            <li> I also use mine to tweeze eyebrows and other unwanted facial</li>
            <li> this changes that - you can see even the tinniest hair, where it is, and just exactly how to pluck that sucker out!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a challenge to see to the extreme sides of my face (next to ears, for example), again because of the magnifying distortion.</li>
            <li> I should probably rate this five stars, but as the viewing area is smaller then the mirror surface due to the magnification,  I&#x27;ll leave it at four.</li>
            <li> The only reason it needed replacing was due to my dropping it on a tiled floor.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be pretty grossed out when you look into this bad boy for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s very lightweight and seems poorly made.  </li>
            <li> It sits on a base a lot better than the old one</li>
            <li> This gives you an up close view to see EVERY single hair.</li>
            <li> I have limited area on my walls in the bathroom</li>
            <li> For you woman out there with problems some dark facial hair (lip and chip)</li>
            <li> I am replacing a 10x one by Floxite only because the plastic hinge holding the mirror in position has worn out and it keeps flopping down.  </li>
            <li> (I gave it a 3 because I was totally let down while traveling.)</li>
            <li> I only have to tweeze once a week and touch up one other time because I am getting all of the hairs I was missing with a regular mirror.</li>
            <li> I get the less I can see in a regular mirror</li>
            <li> the numerous Floxite Fl-615 lights I&#x27;ve previously purchased from Bed, Bath and Beyond</li>
            <li> I had a larger three-pane lighted mirror with less magnification.  </li>
            <li> Also, until recently it has been almost impossible to find the light bulbs.  </li>
            <li> Also, the light bulbs are impossible to find, I finally them at an automotive parts store.</li>
            <li> you can only see a little around your mouth and brows...</li>
            <li> hairs(which is great because I have those nasty chin hairs).</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the negative comments here about this mirror.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the bulbs that came with the mirror burned out in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> the plastic aged, so did my eyes</li>
            <li> Not me watching the last few eps of BB.</li>
            <li> It gets blurry if you aren&#x27;t looking at the center of the mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror is not as expected.</li>
            <li> This mirror reveals all with absolutely no mercy.</li>
            <li> Be careful with it.  </li>
            <li> oh, no, I have to put it together, but was simple and instructions were plain.  </li>
            <li> , she felt bad but most of all had grown quite accustomed to this lighted mirror and didn&#x27;t want any other.  </li>
            <li> even though the mirror light seemed like it was going to be small and not very helpful, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I also miss the 1x mirror that was on the other side.  </li>
            <li> Got one for a girlfriend and every time we see each other</li>
            <li> My other mirror did not do this</li>
            <li> , you can only see a small portion of your face.  </li>
            <li> My other mirror was made by Sharper Image</li>
            <li> I broke my other one and went on line to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> and it also failed after first day of use.</li>
            <li> It is to locate hair and blemishes on your face that you can&#x27;t see in any other mirror.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a regular makeup area and the lighting in my small bathroom</li>
            <li> I tried other types but found the lighting insufficient due to lights around the rim-</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found any other company that sells a mirror with this close a reflection.</li>
            <li> on my chin that I was not aware of ... and  the coup&#x27; de&#x27; grace was  &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is small enough to carry on trips (wish it came with a case) - it is said you can mount it on the wall.  </li>
            <li> and they are extremely diffiicult to put in.  </li>
            <li> This magnification is unmatched by any other mirrors out there.  </li>
            <li> Just remember you can not use it in other countries.</li>
            <li> BUT OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> I tried two other mirrors that I did not like.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the magnifier is less than 15x, but it could just be that the mirror is larger than my small 15x compact.</li>
            <li> It was so hard to use because of distortion and constantly had to adjust mirror to get away from the distortion.  </li>
            <li> The actual focus area is a little too small.  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT worth the expense.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT worth the amount of money they are selling it for.  </li>
            <li> did I realize I had been in the dark with my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and the light is awkwardly placed so that it creates shadows.</li>
            <li> This mirror makes it difficult to really see.</li>
            <li> The only negative is I wish there were a way to keep the mirror on permanently.</li>
            <li> product is not worth the bulk and plug in hassle.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Paired with a quality tweezer, you can at least fight back with confidence.  </li>
            <li> but frankly, it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle of boxing it up and taking it to the post office.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, the lighting was always poor--even near windows.</li>
            <li> I like the way the extender that holds the mirror folds up and down.</li>
            <li> chose to put the mirror on upside down</li>
            <li> I just fold the mirror flat-ish and turn it upside down</li>
            <li> This magnifies to the extreme!</li>
            <li> My husband can see very well in this magnifier (very poor vision).  </li>
            <li> There is only a very small area that you can see anything  in the  mirror.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the mirror less than a month</li>
            <li> Previously had Floxite 8x magnifying</li>
            <li> I found it for $12 less at Bed, Bath and Beyond.  </li>
            <li> My previous one broke</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little disappointed with the actual size of the mirror, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>
            <li> Not Bright Enough  </li>
            <li> and it is stuck in there tight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the 5\\&quot; half round 15X model for years, which they don&#x27;t appear to make any longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pluses - magnifies our skin 15x, so we can see every little flaw.  </li>
            <li> I just have to struggle a little with it.</li>
            <li> those little chin hairs.....</li>
            <li> However, what I DO use it for, is getting those pesky little &amp;#34;whisker&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It shows every little flaw even those that aren&#x27;t visible to the eye without magnification.  </li>
            <li> Can be taken apart for travel, but a little heavy now that there are weight restrictions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yep... I look into it just for fun to see my ugly pores.</li>
            <li> Cheap Chinese Crap!</li>
            <li> Also it is a bit difficult to position you face the correct distance from the mirror so that you can see clearly.</li>
            <li> I should have returned it - unfortunately my investment spent years tucked away in my vanity cabinet until I finally gave it to</li>
            <li> but I use it everyday while sitting at my vanity.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll show you the harsh reality.</li>
            <li> The base of teh mirror does not hold stay on securely.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but, when you have trouble seeing up close, and need to pluck some chin hairs or something....</li>
            <li> You will need to get within a few inches of this mirror to avoid distortion.  </li>
            <li> I hope I don&#x27;t have any trouble with bulbs burning out or anything.  </li>
            <li> Years ago, my father bought a few of them for all the girls at a remainder warehouse place.  </li>
            <li> One of the few I found that was lighted.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to put on my makeup and plucking as needed.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> After wiggling the base, the light would come on.  </li>
            <li> Have trouble getting eyelashes out of your eye?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line ... don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I went to the nearby store to take a look.....holy cow!!</li>
            <li> Little to small for me.</li>
            <li> I have gotten 2 of these now and within less than one month the bulb burned out and the entire product then failed because a replacement bulb did not solve the problem.</li>
            <li> Very little distortion.  </li>
            <li> They mirror is too small</li>
            <li> In the past 4 months I have had to purchase two Floxite FI-615 15X mirrors.  </li>
            <li> I think the fact that they&#x27;re still around, after all these years,  says a lot about the quality of this small mirror.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the mirror broke on a trip, so I bought a 2nd one.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I like how it is lighted - would prefer lights around the frame, I think.</li>
            <li> I am unable to get the bulb out to replace it; it&#x27;s stuck despite following the directions.</li>
            <li> The mirror is way too small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the 15x magnification</li>
            <li> I gave up and sent it back, sadly.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t using one,  you will be amazed at what you are missing!  </li>
            <li> but the mirror is too small.</li>
            <li> Can see small items in my eye without using reading glasses.</li>
            <li> agree with others about the distortion from the mirror itself - it&#x27;s not a top notch product, but then again, I guess you get what you pay for when it comes to mirrors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very confused why it shows two mirrors, but they are different models</li>
            <li> Adding the other filters even made it worse.</li>
            <li> Horrible mirror,save your money, the light at bottom creates a blind spot, and you can only see yourself clearly in a small section of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the mirror makes you think you are at the circus looking in one of those funny mirrors :(</li>
            <li> With the second unit, the unit virtually exploded and blew the power chord out of the back of the base and tripped the breaker in our home.  </li>
            <li> the design is not very good.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for shaving or any activity that involves movement, even applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> They must be aware of the issue as they sell the base separately at $25 on their website.</li>
            <li> However, when this new mirror arrived I was very disappointed in several ways ...</li>
            <li> My previous mirror had broken and I needed another.  </li>
            <li> Well at first, I hated it because I could not believe all the hairs I was missing on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Found it hard to focus in to mirror.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find bulb for it because they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is strong magnification; however, the mirror constantly comes off of the base and the base drops.</li>
            <li> This is for zeroing in on those hard to see areas.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law broke hers and was devastated because she was finding a hard time replacing it.  </li>
            <li> Wife says hard to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> It took a little time to get used to the magnification, but if this lighted mirror was lost or broken, I would replace it in a minute.</li>
            <li> My mother and I have been looking for a magnifying make-up mirror that was at least a 10x, and didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I was going to try for a replacement, but it&#x27;s too late.  </li>
            <li> I then use the bathroom mirror or a common Makeup mirror to reference how the makeup is coming along.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the mirror because it is a slip fit onto the base and if it hits ceramic tile it will shatter.  :(</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t stay in this very small area you can&#x27;t see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> The reviews that say you see your self upside down are using it wrong...</li>
            <li> However, the 15x magnification distorts the reflected image so badly at the periphery of your face, that it is useless for what I need it for: tweezing chin &amp; neck area (one of the curses of reaching \\&quot;a certain age\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE HALF BLIND LIKE ME</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Lighting base failed after first use.  </li>
            <li> We had previously used this product for several years before the base failed due to a leak inside the base from unknown cause.</li>
            <li> I would never leave home without looking in this mirror at least once a week!</li>
            <li> Find it very hard to find replacement bulbs, though.</li>
            <li> Had a very hard time applying makeup and seeing eyebrows that needed plucking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the chin hairs - OMG - no more Nair for me!!  </li>
            <li> Now at 47, it&#x27;s even worse.</li>
            <li> I just bought a second base and mirror</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely the worst!</li>
            <li> Over the years my eyesight has gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> and it got broken-</li>
            <li> She opened the box, slipped the mirror onto the base, turned it on to see how it worked and immediately saw a lot of facial flaws that needed attention..........</li>
            <li> I have had one of these mirrors before, and when mine got broken, I wanted another one.  </li>
            <li> Poor lighting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the physics of mirrors, but this one is not great.</li>
            <li> I had one for years and it was broken on a flight.</li>
            <li> Poor design</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not beautiful, but is so functional.  </li>
            <li> Their home office is in New Jersey and don&#x27;t worry they are nothing like those terrible Jersey Housewives or Jersey shore people.  </li>
            <li> Hi,I hope the adage abour bad luck is not true.</li>
            <li> I broke my previous Floxite mirror and was desperate to get my replacement!  </li>
            <li> For this reason I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Probably something wrong in the electrical dept.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it broke.</li>
            <li> Obsessed.</li>
            <li> however bulb blew after two uses would like to see that bulb has longer life as they are expensive</li>
            <li> (My fault, packed wrong).  </li>
            <li> Yes, you can see all your pores and it can be a scary sight.</li>
            <li> it arrived broken !</li>
            <li> However it states that there is no distortion and unfortunately there is.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what the product is...</li>
            <li> Scary truth.</li>
            <li> It is alittle difficult to look into the mirror and try to focus.  </li>
            <li> The screen is distorted making it difficult to use it as intended.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of the Floxite 15x Magnifying Mirror -- both failed.  </li>
            <li> We are unable to remove the bulb.  </li>
            <li> but it met  with an unfortunate accident</li>
            <li> I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating to feel it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible because it shows EVERY flaw, on the other hand once you see the flaws (hairs, zits, etc.)</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled by the other reviews, this product is awful.</li>
            <li> disappointed in Amazon for the poor quality customer service.</li>
            <li> I had a family reunion at my beach house and my guests all went crazy over the mirror as they found hair on their face</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It is however get for plucking eyebrows and that crazy stray hair.</li>
            <li> This mirror works so well that it&#x27;s scary!  </li>
            <li> tried replacing the bulb which was very difficult however did not help the problem.</li>
            <li> The 15x magnification of this mirror is almost impossible for my eyes to focus in.  </li>
            <li> When I went to replace the bulb the connection was bad, not the bulb.</li>
            <li> Bad mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Terribly</li>
            <li> UGLY</li>
            <li> that said, I am disappointed with the lighting.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed...</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> None of the three bulbs worked so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think I just got a defective bad base unit this time.</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t even look through the mirror , very disappointing  and…expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!  </li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> The company sent me a replacement base and after 2 times of turning it on, it quit working too, so I just gave up.  </li>
            <li> so I could use it on the lighted base.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really annoying.</li>
            <li> When used, the mirror keeps detaching from the base and hitting the tile floor in my bathroom and shattering immediately on contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mirror slides off of the base for packing.  </li>
            <li> I would hate to try to put on makeup without it.</li>
            <li> I was appalled and HAD to purchase this mirror on the spot (</li>
            <li> but this mirror is UGLY!  </li>

            <li> Kinda cheap. Also, 15X mag is WAY too much!  TMI!</li>
            <li> First one came cracked, they did replace it, which is always a bit of a hassle. Second one the light bulb flickered. When I went to replace the bulb the connection was bad, not the bulb. I&#x27;m giving up on this mirror!</li>
            <li> I love it and I can see inside my eyes and easy to clean my eyes with mirror. Also the light. I lost right eye to see.</li>
            <li> like the mirror, alittle tough to see what i want it for but overall ok, the light in your eyes is hard to stand, espically if you have light sensitive as i do. wish it was bigger</li>
            <li> I had the larger two sided 9x mirror they used to offer and my sister loved it so I gave it to her.  I thought I would be able to replace it with a new model.  WRONG!!  They mirror is too small and I have to be on top of it to see.  The light is in the mirror and very distracting. I also miss the 1x mirror that was on the other side.  I&#x27;m glad my sister loves the one I gave her.  Maybe someday the company will offer it again to the public.</li>
            <li> HAD TO GET USED TO THE AMOUNT OF MAGNIFICATION, BUT WITHIN TWO MONTHS, LIGHT FAILED.  REPLACEMENT OF BULBS DID NOT FIX.  COULD NOT RETURN BECAUSE OF TIME ELEMENT.</li>
            <li> Found it hard to focus in to mirror.</li>
            <li> I hate it &amp; I love it.  My old one bit the dust, it was given to me by my mother.  It&#x27;s horrible because it shows EVERY flaw, on the other hand once you see the flaws (hairs, zits, etc.) then you can do something about them - yay!  So, when mine hit the floor, I was horrified...didn&#x27;t remember the name of it, couldn&#x27;t find the name on the remains &amp;#60;awww&amp;#62;, so started looking on Amazon (of course).  Found one &amp; had the new one in my bathroom in a few days - yay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses - magnifies our skin 15x, so we can see every little flaw.  The good part of that is that we can eradicate the said flaw quickly ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses - if you are a klutz, it does break pretty spectacularly / having said that, must also add that I&#x27;ve klutzed out before w/my mirror with no ill effects...but that time ;-(  So, it is made well.  I believe the material the mirror is made of is like bakelite, what the old phones were made of.  And if you&#x27;re old enough to know bakelite, then you know that you could beat someone to death with one of those old phones they were so tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside - if your bulb has burned out, go to the auto store &amp; ask for a G55 (GE bulb), that&#x27;s the replacement.  Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> The light gets in my eyes...a glare. I would much prefer light at the sides or top of the mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I was looking for. The 15X magnification is perfect for up close make up application and tweezing. The lighting is good also.  It&#x27;s not particularly heavy and folds up well for travel. Comes with replacement bulb. Recommended.</li>
            <li> The magnification is amazing. You can see things in detail that can&#x27;t even be seen at all with a regular mirror. Being a smaller mirror, it won&#x27;t take the place of a larger mirror for a bigger overall view, but it can&#x27;t be beat for close-up views.  I bought this for my daughter and now I will be ordering one for me also.</li>
            <li> In the past 4 months I have had to purchase two Floxite FI-615 15X mirrors.  The first mirror I bought lasted about two months.  At first it worked fine, then only some of the time, and then it was just \\&quot;dead\\&quot;.  I have owned other Floxite mirrors, most recently the 7\\&quot; Magnifying mirror, and never had any problems.  Therefore, I assumed this was a fluke, and reordered the same mirror.  This one lasted only one month and then stopped working.  I have since sent it back and have chosen not to purchase another of this style.  I even wrote Floxite a letter informing them that there seemed to be a design defect and never heard back from them.  I would not recommend this particular mirror to anyone.</li>
            <li> I could say I like this mirror, but for the price, it&#x27;s unacceptable that the light fixture stops working after a while. The bulbs are fine, it&#x27;s the connector that is obviously faulty. I am on my third mirror. It&#x27;s the last one I will buy.  Update: I was able to get a replacement under the warranty for my third mirror, got the fourth. I use it at the most once every two weeks, and the bulb connector is already starting to fail. The light flickers constantly. I am sure that if I used it daily, it would be inoperable by now. I love the design and I just wish that they would fix the problem with it.</li>
            <li> The magnification mirror is great and, if the lighting worked (which it did for awhile on my first one), it gives excellent viewing. However, there is some major design flaw with the electrical system.  On the original one I had, the lighting just quit working (and it wasn&#x27;t the bulb).  Since I had had it for 2 years, I ordered a new one.  The light didn&#x27;t work after the first time I turned it on (and again, it wasn&#x27;t the bulb as I tried several).  The company sent me a replacement base and after 2 times of turning it on, it quit working too, so I just gave up.  Would never order one of these again.</li>
            <li> Great for plucking as the 15X allows one to see every pore and/or hair. Not the right mirror for makeup since you have to get so close.</li>
            <li> I think this mirror does an amazing job of magnifying without distortion.  The 15x power makes every last hair visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this mirror for many years, and I love it.  No, it is not a makeup mirror, but is excellent for grooming - when you want to make sure you&#x27;ve gotten every last stray eyebrow hair, THIS is the mirror you want.  I&#x27;ve owned mine a long time and never even had to change the bulb.  Absolutely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> So nice, I bought it twice. My mother and I have been looking for a magnifying make-up mirror that was at least a 10x, and didn&#x27;t break the bank. Every mirror I looked at was a 8x or 10x and was very high in cost. I came across this mirror that was 15x and even though the mirror light seemed like it was going to be small and not very helpful, I was wrong. This mirror has more than enough light (I haven&#x27;t tried the other lens&#x27;s yet) and is much larger in diameter than I expected. I love the fact that its just a single mirror. Just be prepared for what you are going to see when you look in this fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li> love this mirror small but big enough for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> placement of light makes it difficult for viewing much of face.  The degree of difficulty in returning it caused me to keep it.  I don&#x27;t use it.  I do not  like it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed; bulbs burn out very fast and have to be reordered often--not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Little to small for me.</li>
            <li> Like another purchaser, my mirror also has a distorted lens.  Had I not thrown the box away, I would have certainly returned it.  Definitely NOT worth the expense.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same mirror for many years and dropped it.  I was able to get a replacement part but decided to buy an extra one just to have on hand.  The price was very good and the mirror is terrific.  I recommend it for anyone whose eyesight is getting older like mine.  The light is strong and really helps.</li>
            <li> I liked my first one so well I bought a second one to have in a different location in the house!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice little mirror.  It magnifies so much you can see things you never saw before.  Perfect for makeup or hair removal.  Extra bulbs for the light are a plus too.  Good product, good value.</li>
            <li> OMG!  This mirror is amazing.  Rec&#x27;d it today - used it today.  Can&#x27;t believe I can tweeze my eyebrows without my reading glasses.  And the chin hairs - OMG - no more Nair for me!!  Very happy with this gem.</li>
            <li> This is not what I wanted. It is hard to see because the available space is so small.</li>
            <li> You will see way more than you probably want to! Very close up inspection capabilities. Find it very hard to find replacement bulbs, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of these.  The first one I had for about 10 yrs.  I think the fact that they&#x27;re still around, after all these years,  says a lot about the quality of this small mirror.</li>
            <li> 2nd one and works awesome!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for up close makeup, tweezer grooming.  I don&#x27;t really need the light because it is sitting on a shelf at the bathroom window, but after reading reviews ordered it.  Opened the box and thought oh, no, I have to put it together, but was simple and instructions were plain.  We&#x27;re talking one minute assembly here.  I use a 5x magnification for foundation and general review, but this is great for what needs detail.  Also great for (ahem) these baby boomer eyes.</li>
            <li> Replacing an old 5x magnification that finally died.  Love the increased power although it took some getting used to.  Rather than makeup application, I use it for facial hair removal.....there is lots to remove.  I&#x27;m very pleased and recommend this mirror highly.</li>
            <li> I have gotten 2 of these now and within less than one month the bulb burned out and the entire product then failed because a replacement bulb did not solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she likes it. The reviews that say you see your self upside down are using it wrong...you must have your face close to the mirror for it to work. It&#x27;s not good for applying makeup, best used for tweezing or close inspection of your face. Other people complain that the light is only on the lower part of their face...twist the mirror and the light will be on the upper face!I&#x27;m a dude and figured that out!!!!It has better magnification than most mirrors. Yep... I look into it just for fun to see my ugly pores.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror is the best ever.  Got one for a girlfriend and every time we see each other she thanks me.  Our eyes are getting older along with the rest of the body and this is perfect for old eyes being able to see what we are doing.</li>
            <li> Update: I&#x27;ve had the mirror less than a month and it no longer works. I thought it was the bulb and used one of the replacement bulbs-it still didn&#x27;t work. I am going to return it and buy another kind.   This mirror is awesome. It shows every stray hair. My husband calls it the \\&quot;hairy beast\\&quot; mirror, because you can see all of your hairs(which is great because I have those nasty chin hairs). I had a mirror I loved from the Sharper Image. It was hard to find bulb for it because they discontinued it. After more than 5 years, it finally died. This mirror is a perfect replacement. Buy it; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this mirror. It is perfect for travel but I use it everyday while sitting at my vanity. I use it to tweeze and to apply make-up!</li>
            <li> My eye sight has been diminishing (I&#x27;m 49) and plucking those chin hairs has been a challenge. Not any more with this mirror! It works great! It is large enough to see your face, magnifies by 15 which is helpful and the light just helps with the whole process. I strongly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this mirror is that you must get  very close to it to see anything.</li>
            <li> I was going to returned it because it hurts my eyes, but I could not find an other one for that price that will have the 15x mirror and with light so I have not other choice but keep it. The 15x is very good and I believe that when you get used to it will do the work just fine.</li>
            <li> The light is useless....</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for seeing just a small portion of your face at a time. You can definitely see every pore, every blemish on your face with this mirror. I call it my magic mirror.</li>
            <li> I had it for about 2  months and the mirror cracked. I didn&#x27;t even do anything to it. It just snapped. Can&#x27;t get a replacement as they don&#x27;t sell just the head, and I doubt the company will do anything about it. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can see everything!  The image is clear and the light makes it even better.  When I turned 40, my eyesight began to decline. Now at 47, it&#x27;s even worse. I would never leave home without looking in this mirror at least once a week!</li>
            <li> One of the very few with 15X so bought one and it was great but unfortunately the mirror broke on a trip, so I bought a 2nd one. This one is distorted ie you can&#x27;t just look into the mirror and see what you&#x27;re trying to see. Too far back to the store I bought it at to return it so I&#x27;ve been using a larger but only 10X but I can&#x27;t stand it anymore so trying one more time. Figure I&#x27;ve got a 50:50 chance of getting one constructed correctly. But ordering online this time, so will be easier to send back if defective.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. The mirror is hard to clean and the surface is streaky . There is only a very small area that you can see anything  in the  mirror. The rest of the mirror is distorted and you can&#x27;t see anything. If you don&#x27;t stay in this very small area you can&#x27;t see what you are doing. I would not buy this product again and would recommend buyers to steer clear.</li>
            <li> As another customer reviewed the item:  Not Bright Enough  Also, when switching on the light it doesn&#x27;t come on right away, there is a time lag. Probably something wrong in the electrical dept. But it really isn&#x27;t bright enough and adding the CLEAR diffuser, just made it worse. Returning.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is strong magnification; however, the mirror constantly comes off of the base and the base drops. I have actually had more than 2 of these, and eventually the arm that hold the mirror up-right begins to flop and won&#x27;t hold the mirror up any more. But it&#x27;s cheap and a 15X magnified mirror is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great service. Only wish the made a replacement mirror so you didn&#x27;t need to buy the whole thing when you break the mirror.</li>
            <li> So far this is great.The light works well, came with extra bulbs. 15X is so easy to see even the smallest hairs to pluck! I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this newer version of this mirror that she had from this same company.  She wishes that she bought it earlier.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old model, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! This is my second one of same Floxite is superior in every way to many of the big name cosmetic companies Id tried before. You&#x27;ll wonder how you got along without this. I highly recommend this product! Well lit, good clear mirror, filters are accurate and helpful- comes w/extra bulb for long life.</li>
            <li> We had a 15X illuminated mirror for several years but the section that holds the mirror finally cracked so it was time for a replacement. This Foxlite is much better designed and made than our old one. After using it for a few months we&#x27;ve come to appreciate its bright light and sharp reflected images. Of course if you&#x27;ve never used one of these high-powered magnifiers, be prepared to see things that you never knew were there!</li>
            <li> I had a 5x mirror for many years.  I saw this at amazon and wanted something stronger.  It is an excellent mirror.  I like the way the extender that holds the mirror folds up and down. My other mirror did not do this and I can see my face better with that option.  I would recommend this mirror to anyone and everyone that needs to see  every knook and cranny on your face.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror because I can apply my eye makeup and not worry about applying too much or leaving mascara blobs under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I am disappointed with the lighting. Not long after purchasing it, the light began to flicker. The additional bulb did not&lt;br /&gt;last long either. I ordered replacement bulbs and was sure to order EXTRA. That would be my recommendation.....purchase replacement&lt;br /&gt;bulbs so you have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> I love my  15x lighted mirror.  I can refine my make-up in a way not possible without a magnification mirror.  The light makes it so convenient.  I simply mounted it on the wall in the bathroom and it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this mirror today and I am returning it tomorrow.  Yes, it does have great magnification, but the mirror itself is so small, you can only see a small portion of your face.  The light at the bottom is very irritating.  It comes with 2 \\&quot;lenses\\&quot; you can change out; clear for brighter light and amber for a softer light.  I put the clear in first and it absolutely will not come out.  I have tried everything to get it out and it is stuck in there tight.  So much for switching out the lenses for varied lighting.  This product is worth no more than $15-20.  It is NOT worth the amount of money they are selling it for.  Save your money and get something else.</li>
            <li> When you need to see something that close, there is no other way; this is a replacement for one that is 10 years old and got knocked over. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and after buying a couple of other types of lighted mirrors that were put back in the boxes they came in - we have a winner with this one . It does everything the others couldn&#x27;t do !</li>
            <li> Magnification of 15X shows everything, even without reading glasses.  You can see every pore on your face and every hair in your eyebrows, which makes removing blackheads or tweezing your eyebrows super easy.  No more red spots because you didn&#x27;t squeeze in exactly the right place or you missed a hair and tweezed skin.  The only reason this product doesn&#x27;t merit 5 stars is that the light comes solely from the bottom, so you really need some decent room lighting from overhead or the side in order to be able to see well; however, the only mirrors I&#x27;ve been able to find with surround lighting had a maximum magnification of 10X, and the greater magnification of this mirror is much better when what you have to look at is small and you need to be precise.  If you want a mirror for makeup or shaving, get one with lower magification and lights that go all the way around, but for plucking or squeezing, this is the one.</li>
            <li> This is my third mirror over many years and am mostly happy with it.  I don&#x27;t think the light is as bright as the others I have been.  I tried switching the bulb from my old one to the new one, but it didn&#x27;t fit.  I wish the light was brighter.  I wouldn&#x27;t be able to put on my eye makeup without this mirror.  Plus it&#x27;s so easy to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> My other mirror was made by Sharper Image and I had it for years. Unfortunately, it broke. This model is very similar. I like how this model has the detachable parts. I don&#x27;t really underdstand the bulbs, but I guess I will in time. For me, a good buy.</li>
            <li> I really love this mirror.  I can now see things on my face that I never knew existed.  Other mirrors I have tried were good for applying make-up, but this one sees every mark and hair, and allows my removal of them.  I love the fact that it is small, and I can fit it in my suitcase when traveling.  It is also small enough that it takes up little space on my vanity; leaving room for many other items, including a make-up mirror.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with super strong magnify. Packed very secure and fast ship.</li>
            <li> The 15x magnification of this mirror is almost impossible for my eyes to focus in.  I wish I had ordered a lesser magnification and/or that I could purchase the mirror part separately so I could use it on the lighted base.  If someone from the company would contact me I would appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Horrible mirror,save your money, the light at bottom creates a blind spot, and you can only see yourself clearly in a small section of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the mirror makes you think you are at the circus looking in one of those funny mirrors :((&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box one day after the return policy allows a refund, so I am out the money and still need to buy another mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in Amazon for the poor quality customer service.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for years and it finally broke.  Can&#x27;t survive without the mirror with such power, especially since my eyes are much weaker as I get older</li>
            <li> Though this was perfect for very close work - I saw EVERY pore up close and personal - you have to stay just a few inches from the mirror or the distortion makes it unusable.  Not suitable for shaving or any activity that involves movement, even applying makeup.  Great for tweezing though.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.  I broke my other one and went on line to find a replacement.  If you need a distortion free, clear magnifying mirror, this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> Obsessed. You think you&#x27;re looking good? Take a look in this mirror and it&#x27;ll show you the harsh reality. I love it and my eyebrow plucking has never been easier!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful mirror for plucking those nasty varmint hairs that seem to appear everywhere they shouldn&#x27;t after you hit 50.  Great visualization for eyebrow, upper lip, and chin hair removal.  With a great tweezer and THIS mirror, you&#x27;re &#x27;in business&#x27; !!!!  I bought 3, one to travel with, one for home use, and a &#x27;spare&#x27; ..... just in case........  I&#x27;ve had for about 2 years now and have NO complaints........ This mirror is NOT for applying makeup - HELLO - it&#x27;s for VERY closeup reconnaissance.  Manufacturers &#x27;out there&#x27; - \\&quot;get on it&#x27; .... Baby Boomers NEED better selection of these type of products - this is a rare find ... so are great precise tweezers......</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!  Especially for close up viewing.  The older I get the less I can see in a regular mirror so this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  This is my second one and I will continue to use this product.  Light weight and very portable. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this magnification light for years I love it</li>
            <li> The mirror does not work very well, poor visibility, and the light broke within the first month, Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> With this 15X magnification mirror I can see even the smallest hairs in my brows.  I can&#x27;t do waxing because it tears my skin, so this is great for me.  At first, I was a little disappointed with the actual size of the mirror, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and it works great.  The bonus is that it easily snaps apart for traveling and it&#x27;s so light weight that I can carry it in my shoulder bag with no problem.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have had a magnifying mirror from the time I turned 40. As you get older it is a must. BUT, it was not until my girlfriend told me about the Floxite 15x did I realize I had been in the dark with my face. I went to the nearby store to take a look.....holy cow!! I could not believe what you can see! Even more then it&#x27;s power, the Floxite is lite, portable and has a great light. I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
            <li> Great mirror however bulb blew after two uses would like to see that bulb has longer life as they are expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this item because of the reviews, was very disappointed with this mirror. It was so hard to use because of distortion and constantly had to adjust mirror to get away from the distortion.  My daughter used and she is 20 years younger and had issues as well. The light on the mirror is at the worst location it would shine in your eyes and on top of that the darn thing broke. I did not send back, but I will never by a product from this company again. I payed way to much money for this item. Do not be fooled by the other reviews, this product is awful.</li>
            <li> A great little 15x mirror for my desktop. I have eye lashes that grow inward to the eyeball that I have to pluck and this mirror fits that purpose perfectly. Comes assembled and ready to use and is lighted that plugs into 120 volt outlet. No complaints, great mirror.</li>
            <li> Lighting base failed after first use.  Returned to Amazon.  Ordered replacement direct from Floxite at twice the price and it also failed after first day of use. Returned item to Amazon was refunded.  Return item to Floxite still waiting for a response. May be manufacturing defect.  We had previously used this product for several years before the base failed due to a leak inside the base from unknown cause.</li>
            <li> I just have to contradict the reviews on here.  I have this makeup mirror in the 10x magnifying, not 15 listed here.  You can order it that way.  First of all, this is not a mirror to use to comb your hair.  It is to locate hair and blemishes on your face that you can&#x27;t see in any other mirror.  It is used to apply make-up.  You need to put it in front of your bathroom mirror and use it the way it is intended.  I have had this mirror for over 10 years.  I still have the original bulb in this mirror.  When I bought it, it came with two mirrors, one large and one small one for travel.  I never leave home without it.  One mirror was stolen out of my hotel room in Indiana, one broke in my luggage on the way home from Mexico.  (My fault, packed wrong).  So I just call the friendly company and they mail a replacement to me.  I just bought a second base and mirror (it uses a battery and a plug) to travel with and I am leaving it in my beach home.  I had a family reunion at my beach house and my guests all went crazy over the mirror as they found hair on their face they had never seen before.  Ugh.  This company bends over backwards to see that you are happy.  Their phone number is on the web.  Replacement parts are listed there so you do not have to replace everything.  They are happy to address your concerns over the phone.  Their home office is in New Jersey and don&#x27;t worry they are nothing like those terrible Jersey Housewives or Jersey shore people.  Just friendly, helpful people.</li>
            <li> Good mirror but the light is in the lower center of the mirror instead of around the outer edge.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.  I carry it with me whenever I go overnight anywhere.  It is positively great.</li>
            <li> As I get older my vision seems to be decreasing, especially without glasses.  It is in these cases, for make-up that I need the magnifying mirror.  I like the light also it increases my ability to see more detail.  I haven&#x27;t installed it on the wall yet but I think that will be the best way to use this item as the stand is short.  &lt;Floxite Fl-615 15x Supervision Magnifying Mirror Light, White, Frosted White&gt;</li>
            <li> This gives you an up close view to see EVERY single hair. Great for travel and I LOVE the light.</li>
            <li> My husband can see very well in this magnifier (very poor vision).  But - wish it was lighter for travelling.  We do like the magnifying aspect though.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the negative comments here about this mirror. I am replacing a 10x one by Floxite only because the plastic hinge holding the mirror in position has worn out and it keeps flopping down.  Mind you, I have been using it for probably 10 years so the plastic has gotten brittle. I think I got my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;While the plastic aged, so did my eyes so I am glad to see they have increased the magnification on this model.  Yes, you can see all your pores and it can be a scary sight. I have a regular makeup mirror for applying makup but this is imperative for plucking and for applying eyeliner, unless I want to look like a streetwalker. (no offense to your streetwalkers out there.)</li>
            <li> This version of the Floxite mirror is not what is pictured. Well, they show two mirrors, I didnt understand I was purchasing the one with the covered light.  The best thing is the mirror with the cut out that allows the beam of light to actually hit the area. It is basically a lighted mirror. I am very confused why it shows two mirrors, but they are different models</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely the worst! The light shines in your eyes while you are trying to use it up close..I would love to return it to the seller.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because her old mirror broke. This one is durable, has good magnification, and the light is good quality. She uses it to pick at her face in bed at night. It&#x27;s really annoying. But she says it&#x27;s great so I guess that&#x27;s what matters. Not me watching the last few eps of BB. Oh man that show is so good.</li>
            <li> Floxite magnifying mirror is great for makeup application.  Lighting is good for both daytime and nightime.  Would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I actually returned this make-up mirror.  The photo looked like one I had, but it was quite different.  The light on the bottom of the mirror is very strong, yet very concentrated.    There was too much glare, so it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great lighted mirror and I have owned two.  The one I have now will be my last.  The joint (screw) at where the mirror meets broke on both units I have owned. The mirror flops forward.  Also, until recently it has been almost impossible to find the light bulbs.  Luckily Bed Bath and Beyond started carrying the replacement bulb.  This is an obvious defect in the product which wasn&#x27;t tested.  It is a shame to throw a good lighted mirror away, just because one piece is a defect but a piece that is essential to the use of the product !!  I rarely change the position of the mirror, so I was surprised it broke so quickly.  I&#x27;m hopeful another company will copy the mirror/light idea but perfect the unit.  My search for another magnifying mirror has been dismal.</li>
            <li> This is the best magnifying mirror I have purchased. I have always bought Floxite mirrors, but wanted a larger mirror.  This one is a lot larger and has a white frosted light for an even more detailed view. Perfect for make-up applcation as the up close view allows for smooth finish of the eye area.  I also use mine to tweeze eyebrows and other unwanted facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend as the best mirror to purchase.</li>
            <li> This company used to make quality Magnifying Mirror lights and apparently is now in it to rip people off. I bought mine Feb. 2012 and it is now April 2012 and when I plugged it in this morning (Having only used a couple times) it no longer works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is conveniently 12 days outside of the return policy here on Amazon, I would have to mail it to the company (also paying the return shipping) Why? To get 4 more days of use out of it?</li>
            <li> Over the years my eyesight has gotten worse.  I can&#x27;t see anything up close without this mirror.  I&#x27;ve bought 4 of them 1 as a gift and we love it.  You can see everything on your face, etc. before someone else points it out!!</li>
            <li> Hi,I hope the adage abour bad luck is not true. I have managed to break 2 of these mirrors in a year&#x27;s time and both times the same way. The base of teh mirror does not hold stay on securely. I store the mirror in its box when not in use. When used, the mirror keeps detaching from the base and hitting the tile floor in my bathroom and shattering immediately on contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with all the posters though. This s one of the best mirrors for examining your face close up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design should just be a little better. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t bother with anything but 15x mag for tweezing/picking/applying. This is an excellent mirror and in a couple years worth of using it about once a week I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> Not well made at all.  This is my second try and both broke off of the stand.</li>
            <li> You do have to get close due to the high magnification, but you can look down every pore with this mirror or get something out of your eye easier.  The mirror will come off for travel without the light, but you would have to wrap it securely.  Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great! It has 15X Magnification and a light that is bright and shines where you want it! It&#x27;s fairly compact so you can take it with you too!</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this was a good purchase.  My only complaint is that you have to get real close to the mirror before you can get a good view of your face.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this product, and would order from company again.  My husband does not like it but I sure do.  I can not comment about the light because I have not had to use it as of yet.  I wear glasses and do not have to have them on while using this mirror and that works great for me.</li>
            <li> The lite at the bottom I find very distracting..it is not as light or as easy to travel with as I was led to believe.</li>
            <li> Quality is good but it&#x27;s magnification is too big for comfort and that makes it not practical. My 7 times magnification mirror is perfect, thought that more is merrier, not in this case.</li>
            <li> Scary good.  Trust me?.you can see every wrinkle and every blemish you didn&#x27;t even know you had. This is my second one. Wore first one out and finally broke it</li>
            <li> FINALLY, I CAN SEE TO PLUCK MY EYEBROWS...AND ALL THE WRINKLES I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW I HAD. THIS DEFINATELY LIGHTS UP THE FACE AND BRINGS THINGS INTO FOCUS FOR THOSE OF US WHO NEED TO SEE BETTER TO PUT ON OUR MAKE-UP AND GROOM WITHOUT GUESSING.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this new mirror to replace one I bought about 15 years ago... according to the information in the box the new mirror was supposed to be the same as the old one... but, the new mirror does not have the strength,  nor the brightness that my old one had  .... I would have returned  the new mirror immediately  but  as soon as I assembled it  I put my old mirror in the new box and tossed it out... next day I turned on the new mirror to discover  for certain it is not as  strong nor as bright  as my old mirror  was you changed the  product somehow  I am disappointed...&lt;br /&gt; is it possible to return the new mirror without the box??? How???</li>
            <li> it arrived broken ! so i can&#x27;t even look through the mirror , very disappointing  and…expensive</li>
            <li> I bought it because I am having eye issues and need the magnification.  I have limited area on my walls in the bathroom so bought a counter model as I thought this might be best.  Find that I probably should have bought one for the wall and MADE room as with my eye issues the counter model makes me stoop over the mirror and I have problems getting shadows over the parts of my face I&#x27;m trying to make-up!  I don&#x27;t have a regular makeup area and the lighting in my small bathroom is the brightest lighting I have.  I just have to struggle a little with it.</li>
            <li> 08.03.2015 My mirror was delivered.  I am so happy!  Thank you ever so much!  With my bad eyesight I am able to apply light make up@</li>
            <li> This is my second Floxite magnifying mirror.  This one does not have an optional battery power source which I had found a nice feature in the past, but still a great product.  The mirror is bigger than the first one which I had for MANY years before it died on me and offers good viewing.  I tried other types but found the lighting insufficient due to lights around the rim-this model has the light below the mirror which puts the light where you need it for plucking, etc.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very little distortion.  Great for traveling</li>
            <li> it only lasted two months</li>
            <li> Works great for plucking whiskers, but I really wish it had a non-magnifying mirror as well (some mirrors are able to be flipped 180 degrees and have a non-magnifying mirror on the opposite side).  However, for what it is it works very well and the light on the bottom is incredibly helpful for highlighting stay hairs</li>
            <li> Best mirror ever.  You can see everything, even the stuff you don&#x27;t want to see</li>
            <li> The mirror is excellent but the light is not so good.  The problem with the light, is that a defuser disk is inserted in front of the light and there is no way to remove it.  The manufacture should have left it off.  If you can use another light source or daylight there is no problem.  The price for the mirror is good because it is a clear mirror and I haven&#x27;t found any other company that sells a mirror with this close a reflection. I hope this info was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  My mirror came with 3 bulbs.</li>
            <li> OMG! This mirror will definitely show you every pore, pimple, hair, mole, wrinkle. This mirror is great, but in my case it&#x27;s prolly bad because I find myself picking at my imperfections more than I should. It is great for eyebrows though. The light is nice, but it really only light up the mirror for one angle, when I try to turn the mirror, it just gives me a shadow where I&#x27;m trying to get to. I gave 5 stars because it&#x27;s amazing for makeup applying.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for very closeup.  Can use successfully without my glasses and is travel friendly as a foldup.&lt;br /&gt;The light in the mirror adds great versatility.  Price is somewhat steep but well worth it.  This is my&lt;br /&gt;3rd mirror in 15 years.</li>
            <li> Switch on light is not good, guess I will live with that because, I can&#x27;t see with out this mirror.......it&#x27;s my second one.</li>
            <li> This is my second Floxite. I wonder how I ever  managed without it.  I can tweeze my eyebrows and put on my mascara and really see what I&#x27;m doing.  Why strain when the right tool is available?</li>
            <li> Chose this rating because it was exactly what I was looking for!  Used to be able to find at local retail stores but now is only available to purchase on line.  Was needing to replace one that broke.  Would recommend product to others seeking a distortion free magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> You can really see close up with this mirror but it is hard to focus things in the right spot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not beautiful, but is so functional.  15x magnification and good lighting lets you find even the tiniest chin whiskers.  I knocked off one star because the bulbs that came with it were not reliable:  the first didn&#x27;t work (would flash on, but not stay lit); a second was broken in the box.  Fortunately, it came with three bulbs - but now I have no spare.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!  Allows you to see 15xs the normal eye.  Durable and great quality. It comes with additional bulbs so you wont need to purchase a new one for a long time.</li>
            <li> I expected the light to be brighter. The mirror is a great size and there is little to no distortion. I feel like the magnifier is less than 15x, but it could just be that the mirror is larger than my small 15x compact. I wish they would make this with a light/lights around the mirror instead of at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have had a 10x from this company for over 15-20 years. I have carried it on trips and all, can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the main part of the product. However it states that there is no distortion and unfortunately there is.</li>
            <li> I love this magnifier morrow! I have seen things on my face I had never seen before!!</li>
            <li> Was using a smaller 12X mirror, but ordered this as soon as I saw it.  Came with 2 light bulbs and different lenses for light diffusion (daylight and office light).  Can be taken apart for travel, but a little heavy now that there are weight restrictions.&lt;br /&gt;I chose to put the mirror on upside down and now the light is on top which is great for casting light when using the mirror, nice that it can be changed if I should choose to.  Great for close up eye makeup and eyebrow tweasing as well as skin care, however I have to use a larger mirror to ensure I don&#x27;t over indulge in blush etc.  I plan to buy a second one to use in my bathroom and keep this one for my dressing table in my bedroom.  Oh, and I was thrilled to see that the bottom has a place where you can hang the mirror on the wall, - this will be appreciated when I get the new one for the bathroom!</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror. It allows you to view all of your flaws close up. I plan to purchases a smaller version to take on vacation with me.</li>
            <li> This is the Second mirror I&#x27;ve purchased.  The first one had a damaged cord so I had to replace it.  I looked at several but this one still had the 15X magnification I like and the light is good too!</li>
            <li> Works well for the sight impaired.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment. The distortion is so great that you have to almost have your face touching it to make it usable. The light, even with the filters, is so bright that it is blinding. Finally, seems to make it usable at all, you have to tilt it backward. Problem here is that when you tilt it, the who thing topples over as improperly weighted for the tilted feature. Stay away from this mirror as nothing but frustration and ultimately unusable.</li>
            <li> This is a great lighted mirror.  Your make up really shows up nicely, and you can even do your eye brows nicley</li>
            <li> Best magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> had to send this back.&lt;br /&gt;Way too strong.  Made me dizzy.</li>
            <li> I had one for 5 yrs and it got broken-I love this mirror! I am glad I could find it on amazon!</li>
            <li> Cheap Chinese Crap! Couldn&#x27;t get the bulb in and quality was just not there.</li>
            <li> She opened the box, slipped the mirror onto the base, turned it on to see how it worked and immediately saw a lot of facial flaws that needed attention..........that is when I left the room.&lt;g&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact in size and great to travel with.  Likes the high magnification.  Seems to be built well.  Much smaller footprint than her old mirror.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, two things I would change is for it to be bigger and taller. but it is really nice and the light works great too.</li>
            <li> I use the mirror daily, sometimes multiple times a day.  It has just the right amount of magnification to assist appropriate application of makeup.</li>
            <li> Never have to worry about not being able to see all the things that need attention.  Just love this mirror  and I have had many</li>
            <li> The mirrow is smaller than I thought and the light seems like a spot light and my eyes can&#x27;t focas well. I have to hold it right up to my face and it gets heavy to hold. I tried to put it on the wall and that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Price was right and it&#x27;s the best cosmetic magnifying mirror made today; no distortions - just great!!!</li>
            <li> bought for myself and a friend.&lt;br /&gt;One did not come with the lenses or bulbs - one simple call to the company and I received everything I needed asap. Very very cool. PS the mirror was usable with out the extra bulbs or lenses, by the way</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a non-expensive mirror with high magnification so I can spot those ever elusive rogue hairs over the lip or on the chin.  Keeping in mind that I have used it once ... this mirror allowed me to see everything I had hoped was not there  and more some!  I had hair clumps on the upper lip in places I had no idea were there.  I have lots of hair (albeit &#x27;blonde&#x27;) on my chin that I was not aware of ... and  the coup&#x27; de&#x27; grace was  &amp;#34;How come no one ever told me that I had to trim my nose hair!&amp;#34;  I could have braided what I saw!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror was more than adequate to see what I needed to see.  Yes, If you try and look at the WHOLE face and not spot areas, it is not the mirror for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small enough to carry on trips (wish it came with a case) - it is said you can mount it on the wall.  - So far, I am very happy with it.  It is perfect for us baby boomers!</li>
            <li> I love the magnification on this product.  I wish that the light was a bit brighter though.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for tweezing; you can see everything on your face up close.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This mirror has everything. High magnification, good lighting, and it comes apart and folds up for easy traveling. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a 2 piece mirror - the mirror fits onto the stand (and the bulb is part of the stand.  The fit was so loose that the second time I used it, when I picked it up to put it on the shelf, the mirror flew off, landed on the floor and smashed to pieces.  I feel completely ripped off - Spent over $40 for something that was poorly made (very cheap feeling) and so flimsy it broke right away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Had to return it. The light is not bright enough and the mirror is so concave that focus is only possible in the very middle.</li>
            <li> It is all it was described to be and do</li>
            <li> Great mirror, small enough to fit an any bathroom, and its magnification is especially handy for putting on makeup and removing facial hair!!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best mirror around! You will not miss anything with the wonderful magnification, and the portability during travel is fabulous! I now have three, and I think I may go back for another one for yet another bathroom! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lighted mirror with three lighting effects&lt;br /&gt;15x maginifaction for viewing without eyeglasses&amp;#60;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;MAGINIFACTION or Magnification?&lt;br /&gt;Adjusts to any angel for easy viewing&amp;#60;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;ANGEL or angle??&lt;br /&gt;Mirror detaches and folds for easy travel and storage&lt;br /&gt;6.5-inch mirror</li>
            <li> this is the perfect mirror for plucking eyebrows and putting on your make up. Gets warm and you should not leave plugged in when not in use.</li>
            <li> Floxite is a great brand, but the bulb area of this particular mirror takes up too much space, so visibility is measurably compromised. I chose instead the Floxite 10x daylight mirror, which (surprisingly) shows much more than this advertised 15x.</li>
            <li> Was everything it was susposed to be. The only thing....it is not for dual voltage. But this not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and it was appreciated.  I am not sure I like how it is lighted - would prefer lights around the frame, I think.</li>
            <li> I bought this Mirror to replace my 10x magnification mirror that I have had for years that died.  I like the extra manification and the compact size.  I just wish the light were brighter.</li>
            <li> I needed to return this item, but left the country. The light did NOT stay on.  I had to take off the mirror and &amp;#34;jiggle&amp;#34; the light bulb.  The light did not stay on and having to take the thing apart to use it was ridiculous.  The third day I owned it I had to take the mirror off four times and the bulb still did not stay lit.  At that point the mirror broke when I pulled it off.  Not good.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old floxite (had it for over 10 years) with this one. New and improved with more magnification. Still sturdy and reliable. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I have purchased and I like it because it is good for travel as it folds up and is not too large. I find as my vision is poorer that I could use brighter or wider light but I do like it better than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror, I could see every hair that needed plucking, but like another person commented, they are made very cheaply.  I have had 2 now, and neither lasted 2 years. They just stopped working? The first one I purchased wouldn&#x27;t work at all they were very quick to send a replacement.  Also, the light bulbs are impossible to find, I finally them at an automotive parts store.</li>
            <li> Good make up mirror but the light is not in a great position.</li>
            <li> If you need a lighted, magnifying mirror-this one is for you.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it with great delight  Helps her with her contact lenses  great value  good price  do not hesitate to buy</li>
            <li> Love this little mirror, but thought it would be a bit larger than it is....but, when you have trouble seeing up close, and need to pluck some chin hairs or something....this works great!!</li>
            <li> It really magnifies so be prepared!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for a trip travelling and it was great to use for applying makeup.  You can really focus on specific areas - I used it mostly for eyes and it was perfect.  I even ended up using it at home.</li>
            <li> My son loved mine so much, I had to get another one!</li>
            <li> I received the mirror and the bulb that was in place did not turn on.  I tried replacing the bulb twice and they are extremely diffiicult to put in.  Unheard of.  I returned the item and reordered from Amazon.  The 2nd one works and no problems.</li>
            <li> work well, but wish I would have gotten the 10x instead of 15x for makeup</li>
            <li> This mirror does exactly what I ordered it for.  As you get older it is harder &amp; harder to see eyebrows that need plucking &amp; OMG....those little chin hairs.....we women all get them as we age.  So if you need help seeing specific areas, this mirror does the trick.  If you want an all over face makeup mirror....keep searching.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these mirrors before, and when mine got broken, I wanted another one.  It is so great for tweezing!</li>
            <li> I love makeup mirrors.  You really see things that you normally don&#x27;t see.  You&#x27;ll be pretty grossed out when you look into this bad boy for the first time.  OMG where did THAT come from?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it&#x27;s great for plucking eyebrows, applying eye makeup and &#x27;taking care of&#x27; some gross facial issues.  It is NOT for applying full face makeup.  You will need to get within a few inches of this mirror to avoid distortion.  Sitting back in your chair to apply makeup to your whole face will just be a big blurry blog in place of your face.  If you learn forward to pluck your eyebrows you will have the most perfect eyebrows in town. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great mirror.  It&#x27;s bright and sturdy.  Not the most attractive looking, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.  I actually keep this in a drawer and pull it out when needed.  I prefer a regular mirror with 1x and 5-7x&#x27;s for putting on full face makeup.  That one stays out on my vanity at all times.</li>
            <li> the reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars this is a good mirror BUT it would be greater with the halo around it instead of a TINY little light toward the bottom of the mirror</li>
            <li> My wife loves this she uses it ecery day beforework and it gets very close up i really like it</li>
            <li> I CAN SEE MY FACE AGAIN!</li>
            <li> As my eyesight dims, actually I&#x27;m becoming more far-sighted, I needed to see close up to pluck my eyebrows and such.  This little lighted mirror sure does the job!  Talk about a close up!  Wow.  And the light is very helpful.  They even sent an extra bulb for it.  Yep, handy mirror, I use it a lot.</li>
            <li> Big mirror, shows anything you need to see. It gets blurry if you aren&#x27;t looking at the center of the mirror.</li>
            <li> The center magnification is great but it is warped around the edges.  The light is of no use - does not give enough illumination.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace an older Floxite Magnifying Mirror that finally died on me after many, many years.  It serves as a fine replacement for that older mirror.  It is lighter in weight and much more stable than the other but does not have the swivel mirror I had come to rely on.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Best mirror around!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD MIRROR.  BUY IT.</li>
            <li> The bulb on my old one was much brighter - I miss the extra light. But everything else about this mirror is better than my previous one (a Sharper Image in a similar style). I&#x27;m on the hunt for a brighter bulb that will fit (safely, of course).</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty excited to get this mirror because it was just what I was looking for. Not only did it come with one light bulb, it came with two replacements. None of the three bulbs worked so I was disappointed. Sent it back and did not care to reorder another one.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Poor lighting. Bad mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Terribly overpriced!&lt;br /&gt;If I can&#x27;t find someone to give it to, I&#x27;m throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I went to several stores trying magnifying mirrors before ordering this. It is very sturdy, throws good light and really helps to see what you&#x27;d rather not see! Also great for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Does not meet expectations as described so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these mirrors for years. It is the best purchase I have made. As you get older your eyes aren&#x27;t as sharp. This mirror lets me get a much better look at my face and makeup than I could get with a pair of glasses.  I recently dropped my mirror. It didn&#x27;t break but made me think how dependent I was on it. So, a backup is now in the draw.  Thank you for offering such dependable products.  I would recommend this mirror to anyone who wants a closer look at their skin. You&#x27;ll see things you&#x27;ve never noticed before. It travels well too.</li>
            <li> I dont like it much and wiykdnt buy again</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this lighted mirror!  I bought it for travel and it seems like it will work great.  It is much lighter and smaller than the full sized tri-fold lighted mirror that i have been carrying in my suitcase.  At home I have a lighted 15x Conair (pretty one with brushed nickel) in my bathroom and this light is nearly as bright.  So far i am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the mirror size could be somewhat larger; other than that a very good product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and the light is awkwardly placed so that it creates shadows. Supposedly you can change the brightness on the light, but it is really hard to do so. Too expensive for what the product is...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I like the realization sinking in, however with this mirror I&#x27;m able to see wrinkles I never knew I had before!  Highly recommend this mirror for those of you who need to tweeze eye brows or whiskers from chin.</li>
            <li> The bulbs are hard to change &amp; go out quickly. Costly to replace too.</li>
            <li> Nothing escapes this terrific magnifying mirror.  I have used it exclusively to highlight facial hair for tweezing and it does it really well.</li>
            <li> If you can handle seeing every pore on your face, buy this mirror!  You will never miss a unwanted facial hair!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks</li>
            <li> I broke my former lighted mirror and have been searching for another like it - with BOTTOM lighting rather than the \\&quot;halo\\&quot; type, which is inadequate for my needs.  This mirror does have fantastic, bright light, from the bottom.  However, the 15x magnification distorts the reflected image so badly at the periphery of your face, that it is useless for what I need it for: tweezing chin &amp; neck area (one of the curses of reaching \\&quot;a certain age\\&quot;).  So - if you need high magnification and good lighting of the center of your face, this is a great mirror.  If you need to see your chin &amp; neck.... not so much.</li>
            <li> Reading these reviews, I see that the less positive ones are from people who don&#x27;t understand the purpose of the mirror.  This is not a make-up or shaving mirror.  Get a larger halo lighted mirror if that&#x27;s what you need.  This is for zeroing in on those hard to see areas.  For women over a certain age with unwanted hair growth, that would primarily be the chin area.  That&#x27;s the reason for having the lighting below and having a smaller mirror surface where you can zero in on certain areas.  This mirror works GREAT for that.  I just got this particular model, so I hope I don&#x27;t have any trouble with bulbs burning out or anything.  I&#x27;ve had the 5\\&quot; half round 15X model for years, which they don&#x27;t appear to make any longer.  Years ago, my father bought a few of them for all the girls at a remainder warehouse place.  My sister-in-law broke hers and was devastated because she was finding a hard time replacing it.  I got this new one as a spare for when she and my brother visit and stay with us.  I&#x27;ve never changed the bulb in my old one and it&#x27;s about 10 years old.  It&#x27;s a great product for zeroing in on hard to see areas with middle-aged eyes.</li>
            <li> As is normal with age, my eyes are worsening and this light allows me to see clearly when doing eyebrows or putting on make-up.  I wore out my last Floxite mirror....I had it for at least 10 years and it still worked, but this 15x mirror has better magnification and is a bit larger.</li>
            <li> If you wish to have an existential encounter with your face, this is your item.  Be forewarned: You will see your facial pores as the craters of the moon, your facial hairs as a tropical rain forest, any capillaries as rivers, and any wrinkles as the Grand Canyon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first receiving it and setting it up (very simple), I at first had a hard time getting my face into focus.  It takes getting really close and then: GAAAH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to send flowers to my dentist and dental hygienists who have been seeing this phantasmagoria for years.  I cannot imagine not being traumatized.  Am attempting repairs but the baseline is so far below non-horror that I am not optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed with caution.  Good and truthful product.  Scary truth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few months and the light bulb is already out. I am unable to get the bulb out to replace it; it&#x27;s stuck despite following the directions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this mirror as a make up mirror, so I can&#x27;t really give an opinion on that aspect.  However, what I DO use it for, is getting those pesky little &amp;#34;whisker&amp;#34; hairs that have decided to sprout now that I&#x27;m a little older.  Very frustrating to feel it but don&#x27;t see it......this changes that - you can see even the tinniest hair, where it is, and just exactly how to pluck that sucker out!  It&#x27;s also great for eyebrows!  I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it!!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for an amazing price!!!!!!!!!  I bought two; wish I had bought a few more at this incredible price!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a an identical Floxite mirror with 10X magnification that I used for many years; unfortunately, it was knocked off my bathroom counter and the mirror broke.  In looking for a replacement, I tried the 15X mangification this time, and it is perfect for my needs. I hope it lasts as long as the first one I had!</li>
            <li> This mirror purchase was to replace one just like it that I have had for five years because I dropped the mirror part and it broke.  I was thrilled to find the exact mirror on Amazon because it is a great mirror that makes finding and plucking hairs so much easier for the visually challenged.</li>
            <li> The magnification is wonderful, add the light and it&#x27;s the perfect beauty item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i keep dropping them and breaking the glass, wish they would make it of something else.</li>
            <li> this mirror is great for seeing things really up close only. Great for working on your eyes .  Can&#x27;t really do much else with it. For this reason I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Floxite Magnifying Mirror Light is so easy to use.  When putting on make up or seeing any facial blemishes or hairs it is so easy to see and take care of.  The price is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased five of these over time--two for me and three for gifts. It&#x27;s a great magnifying mirror for my vision. 10x just isn&#x27;t good enough anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any magnifying mirror, most people have to be within a very few inches to see without distortion. It&#x27;s also a challenge to see to the extreme sides of my face (next to ears, for example), again because of the magnifying distortion. However, those are small issues that are easy to get used to and to work around. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it--it does what I expected and does it well.</li>
            <li> I love my new Floxite 15x makeup mirror.  I don&#x27;t  have to use my contacts to see to put my eye makeup on.  This is awesome!! I have used a Floxite 10x makeup mirror for years now, but I also had to use my contacts to put on the eye makeup.  Love this makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Perfect size and great light.</li>
            <li> The mirror is way too small.  I do not like it at all.</li>
            <li> The  reflective part of the mirror is starting to wear away.  I would order a smaller size mirror if I needed another.  One of the few I found that was lighted.</li>
            <li> This mirror works so well that it&#x27;s scary!  It&#x27;s daunting to find facial hairs that I barely suspected existed, but the good news is that I can keep on top of them before anyone else knows.</li>
            <li> i have one and bought this for my daughter. She loves it, too. Perfect level of magnifying in this mirror.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to put on my makeup and plucking as needed. It is perfect don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Just whar I needed,  and wanted  Great, good size and love the large magnifacation. Just the ticket for any lady.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  For you woman out there with problems some dark facial hair (lip and chip) it&#x27;s a must!  Works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my face and neck free from unsightly hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the 15x magnification that&#x27;s the problem or the rounded glass.  But, I cannot get it to focus on my underchin and upper neck.  The view is so &amp;#34;warped&amp;#34; that my eyes can&#x27;t focus on a hair for the life of me!</li>
            <li> Good Afternoon Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;I brought mirror for my wife because she was always staring in this tiny mirror. I decided to do something about it and I got her this wonderful mirror and she loves it! She uses it everyday. I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product...it doesn&#x27;t stand firmly and would work better if you have the place to sit while using it.  Since I stand while putting on make-up I attempt to make it higher on the counter by putting things under it. and it keeps falling over.</li>
            <li> Perfect light and mirror size.  You can see every detail of your skin.  It&#x27;s almost too good.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for extreme closeup work such as plucking. I am farsighted with astigmatism so this is an issue for me.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this one as well, says it works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent for putting on your makeup</li>
            <li> Love this mirror to get my eyebrows without my glasses on. Is a little tricky to use but definite worth the money!</li>
            <li> Having 15X makes it easy to see even without glasses. Plus it is easy to travel with. For years I have used the Floxite magnifying mirror at 10X and have upgraded to the 15X…so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Would buy fron them again  order was recieved when it said it would be just as advertised&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;chuck</li>
            <li> Bad contacts, cheap design!!! Took it 2 hours to work, then it stopped working b/c of the bad contacts!!!</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this fabulous item, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to put on my eye makeup since having cataract surgery; it improved my distance vision but practically lost my close-up so this is a true bonus device for me.</li>
            <li> Nice have 15x magnification but this mirror is UGLY!  You can&#x27;t keep it on the counter....it is an eye sore.UGLY</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.  The light bulbs that come with the mirror only last about two weeks; I have now run out of bulbs and cannot find any more bulbs.</li>
            <li> I finally bought contact lens.  What a pain to put them in. I finally figured I needed a real close-up mirror to do it and this one is excellent.  So good in fact that I no longer have it.  My girlfriend appropriated it. Looks like I will have to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I broke my previous Floxite mirror and was desperate to get my replacement!  This is such a good quality distortion free mirror, light weight, and has a strong light.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror....comes with 2 replacement bulbs and lens. Warning, your face looks a lot different in 15x !!!! I purchased to do by brows, but found myself giving my  face a whole critique....I&#x27;m hard on myself too :)</li>
            <li> Every woman - any age - should own this mirror.  My daughter runs to this mirror, in my bedroom, after entering my door.  I find it immensely helpful when putting on makeup, plucking etc.  Just Get It!</li>
            <li> Works well, takes up some room, wish it had a mounting to the wall option but for the most part it is a good product</li>
            <li> My eye hurts when look at the mirror.</li>
            <li> My light did not work at all. I also think you have to be to close to the mirror to see all right.</li>
            <li> I needed a higher magnification for applying eye makeup. This mirror makes it difficult to really see. It distorts the image and you have to have your face in exactly the right distance to see. I don&#x27;t understand the physics of mirrors, but this one is not great.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MIRROR.  IF YOU ARE HALF BLIND LIKE ME THIS WILL SHOW YOU ALL THE WRINKLES IN YOUR FACE YOU DIDN&#x27;T KNOW WERE THERE,  BUT YOU GET TO SEE EVERYTHING ELSE ALSO.  WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MIRROR.</li>
            <li> This is the best mirror I have ever found for tweezing my eyebrows and those random stray hairs.  THIS MIRROR IS NOT INTENDED FOR MAKE-UP APPLICATION.  With a 15X lense, it is too distorted to use for make-up.  I have had my mirror for over 10 years and am buying this one for a gift.</li>
            <li> Switch is shorting out and light isn&#x27;t that bright</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup mirror I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I have had 4 of these and I love them, I use them for travel and at home.  Can see everything fine.</li>
            <li> Great Mirror! Light weight, and magnification is wonderful! THANKS! HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> The light intensity is much too low. Adding the other filters even made it worse. I really should have returned it.</li>
            <li> The mirror is lighted which is great! Use it for my brows. Don&#x27;t need waxing anymore! Not very big and not double sided so you cannot do overall makeup with it.</li>
            <li> The magnification is perfect for my use. I would give it five stars but for the limited viewing angels and positions that it is able to move into. The light is okay. Would have preferred a mirror with light all around the sides like some have. But none I found had this strength of magnification and that was what was most important to me for my use of it.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife. She says she loves it. It is perfect for seeing details.</li>
            <li> Takes seconds to get adjusted to the mirror and light.great product</li>
            <li> Ideal size, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of room. Enjoy it because I wear glasses, and it enables me to see so much better.</li>
            <li> This mirror is made so well, and I can take it on vacation. Fits perfectly in any carry on suitcase.. The 15X is just awesome. I would recommend this to anyone..</li>
            <li> It is alittle difficult to look into the mirror and try to focus.  It takes awhile to get use to it, which I am.10 inch is a good size mirror. I had that size and it worked great. If you want one this size it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I love the high magnification of this mirror.  The light is bright enough for seeing just about every hair on your face!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mirror!  Great magnification.</li>
            <li> The mirror is not as expected. The screen is distorted making it difficult to use it as intended.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. Well at first, I hated it because I could not believe all the hairs I was missing on my eyebrows. It is the best mirror I have ever used, but you need to be ready to see EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> I read All the reviews, &amp; Still Bought.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Glad I Did!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Very Pleased with Product &amp; Sellers Delivery!</li>
            <li> The magnification was great for eyebrows and facial hair.  Finally, I could see!  But even though I never looked directly into the LED light, it hurt my eyes and gave me a headache every time I used it.  I gave up and sent it back, sadly.</li>
            <li> It was between this mirror and another 15x magnifying mirror that was not lighted.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is perfect for people with not so sharp eyesight, and for people in places with ill lighting.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the process of plucking go so much quicker and easier.&lt;br /&gt;The light on this mirror is located in the perfect spot for chin plucking.&lt;br /&gt;It does not do so well for eyebrows or neck viewing.&lt;br /&gt;But perfect for chin and upper lip area.&lt;br /&gt;I love how compact it is and how the mirror moves for better viewing.&lt;br /&gt;I have no use for the amber light diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror. The magnification is perfect and so is the lighting. This can be used at home and it&#x27;s nice to travel with. The mirror is essential for applying eye liner, plucking eyebrows. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;up close and personal&amp;#34;. I love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for traveling.  The mirror slides off of the base for packing.  This is a good quality mirror.  The magification is very good, more than I would ever need.  The light is nice but it does make me see spots after using it for alittle while. However,  I like this mirror and will be ordering one for a friend.  I would definitely recommend this mirror.  The seller did an excellent job of getting it to me on time and in perfect condition.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have owned three of these through the years. The only negative is I wish there were a way to keep the mirror on permanently. The mirror has fallen off and shattered or I may still have the original one. It was actually cheaper to purchase a new unit on Amazon than to replace the mirror at the manufacturer&#x27;s website. I have been an Amazon customer for years. I love Amazon&#x27;s free shipping offers and speedy delivery. I always look on Amazon first when I need to make a purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the magnification in this mirror!  It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older lamp! This one is more powerful (magnification) and is great for what I need and use it for!!! Again, I&#x27;d recommend this to any of my friends!</li>
            <li> product is not worth the bulk and plug in hassle. I when out an bought a 12 or 15 magnified, portable mirror, easy, I can sit by a sunny window an tweeze my eye brows</li>
            <li> This mirror is too small and the bright light is too bright. When I try to use the mirror the light shines in my eyes because of the size of the mirror. I didn&#x27;t realize how distorted the 15x magnifying would be either.  My previous mirror had broken and I needed another.  This is not worth the money I paid for it.  I&#x27;m very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Dropped the mirror portion of my make-up mirror while on vacation, so ordered replacement which was on my doorstep when I returned.  I find it very useful in applying make up, tweezing, or anytime I need a close inspection.  I ordered the 15x rather than my previous 10x and am glad I did.  If you aren&#x27;t using one,  you will be amazed at what you are missing!  It is great for every day use, but is also wonderful for travel because it folds up to be very compact.  Just be careful with the mirror because it is a slip fit onto the base and if it hits ceramic tile it will shatter.  :(</li>
            <li> Floxite Fl-615 15x Supervision Magnifying Mirror Light, White, Frosted...  HORRIBLE.... Mirror does NOT come close to providing adequate lighting necessary for use. Even if I have 5-6 other lights on in my bedroom, this mirror still does NOT provide adequate lighting for necessary light.</li>
            <li> This product was great for the first couple of months.  It provided easy viewing for close-up tweezing since I can&#x27;t see close up without my readers.  The problem is, it quit working after 4 months - this was using it only 4-6 times.  I was going to try for a replacement, but it&#x27;s too late.  Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> Light has delayed &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch.  Some distortion in magnified image.  Previously had Floxite 8x magnifying light - worked great - still&lt;br /&gt;works great.  Eyes need more magnification - notice first light made in U.S. - this light made in China.  Will see how long the new one works - delay in starting seems strange.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of these mirrors and each time the mirror fell off and shattered into a million pieces. I thought the first one was defective, when the same thing happened to the 2nd mirror I realized  this is must be how they are made, you should put some sort of warning on the box or on the mirror..</li>
            <li> After looking for the mirrior that would let me do my makeup without my glasses I finally found it, thanks.</li>
            <li> This magnifies to the extreme! It&#x27;s almost too much.  No glasses necessary.  If you want to see your pores, this is the mirror for you!!! The viewing area is not large due to the magnification, but this is the strongest mirror I have found, even if the light just comes from the bottom.  I should probably rate this five stars, but as the viewing area is smaller then the mirror surface due to the magnification,  I&#x27;ll leave it at four.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for getting those hard to see chin hairs.  I like that it has different lens for night and day.  Folds down nicely for travel.  This is my second one and the only one I will buy at a good price.</li>
            <li> I was on line today to replace aone of these mirrors that I have had at our second home.  Amazon told me that I purchased it in 2006!  It is a great mirror for plucking and getting blackheads.  Many women said it only lighted the bottom of their faces....I just fold the mirror flat-ish and turn it upside down and it works great on my upper face, no problems, honest!  I love this mirror and was happy to see they are still making it.  No other lighted mirror comes close to seeing all the things on your face that you don&#x27;t want any one else to see!</li>
            <li> I like this mirror so much I bought one for each bathroom and also gave 2 as gifts...and they love it too.</li>
            <li> I love the mirror, but changing the bulb is most difficult!</li>
            <li> An excellent makeup mirror. There aren&#x27;t as many choices when looking for a 15X magnification style. I use mine everyday and it is especially great for plucking my dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> did not work as good as I thougth</li>
            <li> Saw things wasn&#x27;t prepared for. WOW this is great. I highly recommend this for us older folk whose eyes need help.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed, works great and I can see my face and eyebrows now. I am confident that I look good at all times.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to replace one similar to it that I dropped and broke.  I need and appreciate the magnification, but wish the light was brighter...or that my eyes worked better.  :)  Overall, it does a good job, helps me keep my chin smooth, and I would recommend it for anyone who needs a good lighted magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> ....to see things you had no idea were on your face and neck! This mirror reveals all with absolutely no mercy. Paired with a quality tweezer, you can at least fight back with confidence.  Ignorance is no longer an option.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is good however the lightbulb began flickering after a month of use- tried replacing the bulb which was very difficult however did not help the problem. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> It really works!  No more standing at the window with a magnifying mirror entertaining the neighbors.  Hopefully they will appreciate it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Large, great light, great mirror...feel helpless applying makeup, tweezing eyebrows, etc., without it. The light is while and illuminating, not that off putting blue tint.</li>
            <li> Works well and very light weight.  Overall, a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest for my old eyes.  Had a very hard time applying makeup and seeing eyebrows that needed plucking.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it correctly and tilt the mirror right,  you will love it</li>
            <li> At my age, I had difficulty tweezing my eyebrows using most magnifying mirrors but this did the trick!  A bonus is that it is portable  and totally great for travel, too</li>
            <li> I take this 15X mirror on all trips... wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It took a little time to get used to the magnification, but if this lighted mirror was lost or broken, I would replace it in a minute. I can pluck eyebrows and know that I&#x27;ve done a good job at it - no stray hairs. I often use it without the light, too. The mirror can easily be adjusted for height. My first purchase was a mirror with 8X magnification, but returned it for the 15X. I fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The magnification is almost too much. Wife says hard to put on makeup.It works great for real close up. There</li>
            <li> I had one for years and it was broken on a flight. It cost as much to buy a new one as to replace a broken part.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these mirrors; 1 15x and one travel 5x. Same issue with both. Mirrors worked fine for awhile and then sporadically or not at all. Replaced bulb and that wasn&#x27;t it. Started digging and found that the contact from the bulb to the socket either wears down or is so cheap that the connection no longer works. Even took it to a repair man to see if he could fix it. No luck. They must be aware of the issue as they sell the base separately at $25 on their website. REALLY??? Such a shame because I truly do like the mirror.</li>
            <li> Best makeup mirror i have ever had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written about the Floxite lamps before. I just purchased a new one to travel with me. It&#x27;s a bit big for travel but I don&#x27;t care. I can&#x27;t be without my Floxite for my eye makeup application. Less clothes, more confidence in applying makeup well while on vacation. I am keeping it in the box it came in as it is well cushioned. Just a note based on some critical comments I&#x27;ve seen...this is a MAGNIFYING mirror for a close look at a section of the face. You will not see your whole face at one time. I then use the bathroom mirror or a common Makeup mirror to reference how the makeup is coming along. My eyeliner is fabulous. How&#x27;s yours? :-)</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. I&#x27;ve owned three of them. Can see more than I need to and great for home or travel.</li>
            <li> Product worked for the first four times being turned on. (It came with a replacement light-bulb. The light-bulb does not appear to be defective. [Filament intact.]) Replacing the original with the replacement bulb did not resolve the problem.</li>
            <li> The mirror is what I ordered, I can see to put my make-up on now and to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror I can see every blemish I have and am able to apply makeup flawlessly. Very nice mirror</li>
            <li> Talk about see it now</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect.</li>
            <li> The magnification is great...everything is super big and super sharp.  But out of the box, the light only worked on a total of two occasions (it would flicker and I would have to shake the mirror to get it to stay lit).  Now the light doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I&#x27;ve tried replacing the bulb, but it doesn&#x27;t seat correctly into the socket.  Overall, it&#x27;s very lightweight and seems poorly made.  I would return it but frankly, it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle of boxing it up and taking it to the post office.  I just know to stay away from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I had these magnifying mirrors before. They are very good and helpful!  I remember when I started with a #7, then a #10, and now a #15 x.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, vision changes with age.&lt;br /&gt;It is fantastic to catch those little hairs on you face that other wise you would miss on a regular mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everybody, specially those who wants to keep unwanted hair under control!</li>
            <li> The mirror head is not attached to the stand. The mirror part fell off from the stand and shattered. Poor design; I&#x27;ve had many mirrors that could drop two feet without breaking.</li>
            <li> I like the compactness of this mirror.  Find it perfrect for what I need.  Would like the mirror part to be just a bit&lt;br /&gt;bigger but don&#x27;t know how that would affect the compactness overall.  Works great for me.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect mirror for those of us who are in need of glasses for close viewing. Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love the 15x magnification on this mirror but the mirror is too small. Although the mirror is 6.5 inches the light is imbedded in the mirror and the light is 2 inches round. This decreases what you can view in the mirror. In addition, while using the mirror, with the light turned on, the light is shinning right in your eyes. I bought 2 of these mirrors for my daughters, for Mother&#x27;s Day, and returned them today. I purchased two 10x mirrors to replace them. Although the mirror size of the 10x mirror is only 5 inches the light is below the mirror. This not only gives you 5 inches of viewable mirror the light isn&#x27;t shinning directly into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the manufacturer where to redesign the 15x mirror to the same specs as the 10x mirror I would not hesitate to purchase the mirror again. Hope this helps you with your purchase.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of the Floxite 15x Magnifying Mirror -- both failed.  The electrical chord separated from the based on both units.  With the second unit, the unit virtually exploded and blew the power chord out of the back of the base and tripped the breaker in our home.  The unit burned.  It is clearly faulty --</li>
            <li> Been ordering/using this product for years.  I find the new design (more magnification-good) with the light is really annoying to use.  It shines in your eyes as you look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> great magnification, good light, easy to fold and carry.My second one, liked it so much I got one for another room.</li>
            <li> I like the mirror but the bulb went out after 2 months.  Only used it maybe 2 times a week.  We are unable to remove the bulb.  Would not buy this again.  Note:  you can only see a little around your mouth and brows...the design is not very good.</li>
            <li> Ok,  not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I had cataract surgery this year and I cannot live without this product.  It is extremely clear and accurate--I see all of my flaws.  I already had one, but my movers didn&#x27;t deliver it with the bulb intact so I promptly ordered another one.</li>
            <li> Just like my old one but not broken........</li>
            <li> Bought this one for my wife.  She absolutely loves it.  She accidentally dropped the first one and it broke, she felt bad but most of all had grown quite accustomed to this lighted mirror and didn&#x27;t want any other.  I was very happy to find that Amazon still carried it and immediately ordered another.  Great price, great delivery and can&#x27;t go wrong in keeping the wife happy.</li>
            <li> Not  big enough to see what I am trying to achieve with this product.  The actual focus area is a little too small.  Will use it until I find exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I had one of these and accidentally broke it, so this was a replacement.  I will say right after purchasing this I found it for $12 less at Bed, Bath and Beyond.  I would try there first.</li>
            <li> Hated it!  Could not see anything.  The light is definitely in the wrong place.  Your previous design model was much much better.</li>
            <li> I wish it was larger than my hand. The magnification is excellent and I knew before I purchased it that you have to be up close to the mirror to actually see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very bright and can see everything on my face.  This was a good buy. I would recommend this mirro.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product and would recommend  Yes. without a doubt she would recommend this product and will purchase another if ever needed.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two different floxite 15x mirrors.  One I use when traveling. Then I have one like this for my vanity.  As eyes grow older we need help for close up makeup, tweezing, etc.  This is perfect.  I accidentally knocked mine off the vanity and broke the plastic covering the edge.  So, I quickly reordered a replacement from Amazon.  I would hate to try to put on makeup without it.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!!!  No old lady chin hairs or other unwanted facial hair can escape the tweezers now.</li>
            <li> For many, many years this Floxite lighted magnifying mirror has been absolutely essential for my daily grooming. I&#x27;d never survive without it . . . or so I thought. Occasionally I&#x27;ve accidentally broken the mirror so to be on the safe side before a recent trip to Israel, I ordered a new one to use as a back-up. The thought to test my latest purchase never entered my mind because the numerous Floxite Fl-615 lights I&#x27;ve previously purchased from Bed, Bath and Beyond always worked perfectly and never ever needed a bulb replacement. Imagine my disappointment when I reached my destination and realized my new mirror didn&#x27;t light! To make matters worse, the lighting was always poor--even near windows. As subconscious as I felt, I did my best to cope with the thought of looking like a porcupine with too many stray hairs in the wrong places. Now that I&#x27;m home and have replaced the bulb, the magnifying mirror deserves a 10 or higher. (I gave it a 3 because I was totally let down while traveling.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34; and my eyesight isn&#x27;t as great as it used to be.  I have been looking for a magnifying mirror for a few months now, mostly for tweezing facial hair, and wanted a mirror with sufficient magnification that could also be put away. Another qualification is it had to have &amp;#34;real light&amp;#34; so I could see what I would look like when I leave the house.  This mirror was a good price, and is compact enough that I can put it under my sink when it&#x27;s not in use (most of the time). The lighting is okay. It uses a bulb - I purchased a replacement so I&#x27;ll have one on hand if I need it in the future.  Because it&#x27;s a good size, it&#x27;s large enough I can see, can stand on my vanity top while I tweeze, and I can easily carry it downstairs and outside to see makeup colors/tones in a variety of lighting conditions (when I&#x27;m carrying it around, it&#x27;s unplugged, of course).  It says it has different light filters that go with this mirror, but I didn&#x27;t see them in the box, and again it is portable so this isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I should have focused more on the negative reviews than the positive ones. The light shines in your face, and you have to almost put your nose on the mirror to avoid the distortion mentioned by numerous reviewers. Fortunately I can send it back with Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy.</li>
            <li> I have a Floxite ten-power (10x) magnifying mirror that I bought years ago and have used ever since.  My old mirror was suffering from the problems of age - cracking at the edges of the rim - but otherwise was in perfect condition.  And I liked it since it had absolutely no distortion anywhere on the mirror and was so handy to use for finding even the tiniest defect on my face or eye.  In any case, I thought that I would buy a new mirror with a little more power, and this so-called 15x mirror seemed to be just what I would need.  However, when this new mirror arrived I was very disappointed in several ways ... first of all, this mirror was so distorted that I could hardly find an area that didn&#x27;t have a great deal of distortion on it, like one of those sideshow mirrors at the fair; and secondly, when I compared this new mirror with my old 10x mirror I found that there was absolutely NO difference in magnification between the two - they were identical!  This new mirror is definitely NOT 15x ... it is at best only 10x and a poor one at that!  And further, this new mirror is smaller than my old one.  From the outside this new mirror looks pretty with the light at the bottom, but it certainly does not measure up to its claims.  I definitely would not recommend this Floxite FI-615 15x Supervision Magnifying Mirror to anyone wanting a high quality mirror.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  Now that my eyes are getting older, I can&#x27;t see the close stuff any more!  This magnification is unmatched by any other mirrors out there.  I only wished the light was brighter.  I tend to use it next my window on a sunny day to get best results.</li>
            <li> love this light and mirror, this is my second one, even pack it in the suitcase for vacation, love it</li>
            <li> Love it. But it works only for nose aria and brows.</li>
            <li> Used once THREW IN TRASH...highlights hair you are certain you have not plucked in 10 years (true) completely obscures other portions of face...useless.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same model that had an &#x27;accident&#x27;. My wife really likes this one for its magnification and portability.</li>
            <li> I had the original Floxite 15X mirror, which I loved, this mirror is so small I can&#x27;t even get both eyes in at the same time. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This mirror shows EVERYTHING . . . every flaw you have.  I can&#x27;t put my makeup without this mirror.  It helps me cover my flaws and feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> You can SEE EVERY PORE on your face.  You see stuff you wished you hadnt!  I recommend for tweezing as you can see every hair before it comes to the surface!</li>
            <li> could notsee this magnificatrion</li>
            <li> I have another Floxite mirror but it is larger &amp; the light is around the whole outer surface of the mirror. I like the larger one because the light is not so concentrated in one area. The light at the bottom is distracting when you look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I had a larger three-pane lighted mirror with less magnification.  I like the portability of this one and the fact that the whole mirror is magnified.</li>
            <li> New mirror design - need to get used to it - but I love this product!</li>
            <li> Good magnification. Light is insufficient for my poor sight.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for every day use and traveling.  It works great, as it does come apart for packing.  Lighting and magnification are perfect for me. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I had one of these that I loved to use for eyebrow plucking especially, so when I dropped the mirror and it cracked into pieces you can imagine how sad I was.  I looked on amazon, and sure enough there it was.  LOVE THIS MIRROR CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT,</li>
            <li> Fantastic mirror. Just remember you can not use it in other countries. It is 110V ONLY, (after I fried mine not knowing), so I had to order another one because I love it!</li>
            <li> Quality mirror. Super magnification that only a brave woman can take! Have tweezers handy if you purchase this mirror! Good buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this mirror after buying a different brand that was twice the cost.  This one works much better although the light is a little annoying.  It could be a whole lot brighter than it is.  And if you look at it the wrong way, it kind of blinds you.  But at least the mirror does work for someone like myself who can&#x27;t see worth a darn anymore without reading glasses on.</li>
            <li> I have had other Floxite magnifying mirrors in the past and the light on this one isn&#x27;t as bright as the others. It is bright enough to use though. With a 15x magnification this isn&#x27;t the best mirror for makeup application other than eye makeup. It is however get for plucking eyebrows and that crazy stray hair.</li>
            <li> I have used the smaller blue fold up version of this for years but the arm hinge on last two I ordered broke within a month.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about this one because the magnification power is lower but the larger size seems to make up for it.  This seems to be built better and is much easier to use with both hand free.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  Thinking about ordering a spare in case they discontinue them.</li>
            <li> Mirror is a good size, happy with it mostly except for it tips over a lot...i&#x27;m  guessing it&#x27;s to either top heavy or bottom heavy. anyways, it tips over at a certain point so i have to prop it with something in the back to hold it up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product following cataract surgery.  The maginfication is great, but the one light at the bottom makes it difficult to see certain parts of my face. Lighting around the circumference would have made it perfect.</li>
            <li> On this particular purchase: The light flickered, had to be wiggled to make it light up.  I tried changing the bulb, but that didn&#x27;t fix it. After wiggling the base, the light would come on.  I had one of these mirrors (same brand and model) for years and loved it.  I think I just got a defective bad base unit this time.</li>
            <li> my old Floxite magnifying mirror shorted out at the cord (where I always pulled on it to pick it up!!). I ordered a replacement mirror and I am very happy with it. It sits on a base a lot better than the old one so I don&#x27;t pull it to me by the cord!!</li>
            <li> My second one for travel!  Love this mirror and use it every day.  The light really helps see all those little hairs that you would miss without it.</li>
            <li> Great to use!  Magnifies well for cleaning up your eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these mirrors years and years ago, it was still working fine but it met  with an unfortunate accident and I had to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror has just the right magnification and excellent clarity. The light really does make a difference in the clarity. This was a great price, much less than I paid for the one it is replacing.</li>
            <li> I liked this mirror.  I would still like a little larger however, great mirror for the money.  I travel with it and packs easily.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy.  Delivered on time.  Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have trouble getting eyelashes out of your eye?  This mirror is just what you need.  Can see small items in my eye without using reading glasses.</li>
            <li> This mirror is GREAT!  You can see evey pore.</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered this magnifying mirror light for tweezing my eyebrows after noticing in a store just how many hairs were left because I had been using a regular mirror. You need to take some time to figure out how to position the mirror so that the light doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes while you are trying to tweeze. The mirror portion turns 360 degrees and the arm is adjustable so it is very flexible. Also it is a bit difficult to position you face the correct distance from the mirror so that you can see clearly. This is probably because of the intense magnification. It was packed very well in the box and came in excellent condition with extra bulbs and three lighting effect lenses which you should try to see which is most comfortable. Using the lens makes a big difference. The mirror does a good job. I only have to tweeze once a week and touch up one other time because I am getting all of the hairs I was missing with a regular mirror. I had been tweezing almost every day! You will also notice other facial hairs that need to be removed ..i.e. above your lip. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I consider this mirror essential for good grooming.  It shows every little flaw even those that aren&#x27;t visible to the eye without magnification.  The light is wonderful.  The only complaint I have is that the bulbs that came with the mirror burned out in a very short time.  The new bulbs I ordered last forever.</li>
            <li> Would have liked more versatility as the mirror only allows for the high powered magnification. Good lighting and small enough to pack on trips.</li>
            <li> Wife said great product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. No eye glasses needed.</li>
            <li> I HAD CATARACT SURGERY ON BOTH EYES. IT WILLTAKE ABOUT SIX MONTHS FOR THE CLOSE ONE TO CLICK IN. THIS  MAGNIFICATION IS JUST THE THING I NEED TO SEE TO PUT ON MY EYE MAKE-UP!. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT EVEN AFTER THAT TO PERFECT MY EYE MAKE-UP!</li>
            <li> Best magnifying mirror !</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It is great!</li>
            <li> Great for trimming eyelashes</li>
            <li> The light was to bright for me, even after I tried the different lenses. I have arthritis in my hands, so it was also difficulty to adjust the mirror so the light was not in my eye.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a number of years ago, only to be VERY disappointed in the fact that the very bright light, which is a small bulb at the bottom of the mirror, shines directly into my eyes, thus practically \\&quot;blinding\\&quot; me. I tried every which way to use it, thinking if others liked it, then maybe I was not positioning myself close enough/far enough away from it to stop the light from zapping my eyeballs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a frosted-type lens cover that goes over the bulb&#x27;s housing - I tried removing it, replacing it ... nothing helped with the fact the light is very poorly placed in this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with others about the distortion from the mirror itself - it&#x27;s not a top notch product, but then again, I guess you get what you pay for when it comes to mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this mirror useless, even when not using the light. I should have returned it - unfortunately my investment spent years tucked away in my vanity cabinet until I finally gave it to Goodwill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line ... don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have had of these and I love them.  Need to find something easy this is it.  We use this alot.  It also shows you alot you don&#x27;t want to see.  LOL</li>
            <li> I already broke one of these because the mirror just pulls off.  Be careful with it.  Only buy this is you really need to see every pore.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S KINDA SMALLER THAN I&#x27;D LIKE BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT&#x27;S A GREAT PRODUCT.  YOU WILL SEE THINGS ON YOUR SKIN YOU NEVER THOUGHT WERE THERE... BUT THAT&#x27;S THE IDEA :)</li>
            <li> Actually, this is a replacement mirror for one I&#x27;d had over 15 years.  The only reason it needed replacing was due to my dropping it on a tiled floor.  The 15x magnification is perfect for tweezing and finding any area of your face that may need attention. The mirror detaches easily for travel.</li>
            <li> I went into a store and saw this mirror...when I turned it on and looked at my face I realized just how much facial hair I had missed in my mirrors at home.  I was appalled and HAD to purchase this mirror on the spot (because I knew I would go home and not see the hair that I saw in this mirror).  Everyone who see&#x27;s it in my bathroom asks where I got it. My sister got this one for christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that I look at it every AM and PM now, to make sure I dont miss anything. I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old and my eyesight is not what it used to be.  This mirror will make you see more than you want to but it saves a lot of embarrasement from unwanted hairs coming out in places that you never imagined!&lt;br /&gt;I dropped the mirror and it broke into a million pieces.  I immediatly ordered another one before my face got out of hand!&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t see being without it.  I would give it a 10 star if I could!</li>
            <li> The mirror is great if you need to put on eye makeup without your reading glasses!  It took me a while to get used to it as it made me feel &amp;#34;cross-eyed&amp;#34; at first due to the magnificant magnification, but i finally got used to it.</li>
            <li> for someone thats getting older and not able to see as well perfix.the cost was the best i was able to find,just the right size!!!!</li>
            <li> I have owned this item previously and loved it.  I was so upset when I broke the mirror.  I could not find the same item in any of my local stores.  I tried two other mirrors that I did not like.  So...I ordered this mirror directly from the manufacturer.  The quality of the mirror is not as good as the 1st one I owned.  There is quite a bit of distortion that I never saw in the one I owned before.  I&#x27;m not too happy about needing to replace this again.</li>
            <li> I love this magnifying mirror and have more than one.  It is now a necessity and I highly recommend the 15x magnification.</li>
            <li> My previous one broke and I wanted something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;Same company just a stronger magnification.&lt;br /&gt;My old was was great for many years so I went with the same thing.</li>
            <li> I almost did not purchase this based on other reviews I read, but I am so happy I did.  This mirror is exactly what I was looking for.  It has made such a big difference. I am now able to remove and apply my makeup correctly once again. I actually find it fun once again to get ready!  Yeah!</li>
