            <li>Works great, exactly what my guy wanted and needed.  </li>
            <li>I am the not-so-proud owner of a Remington R3130 shaver (see my review, not so kind), and while the shaver cut pretty good it had a fatal flaw.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Love the Titanium Replacement Blades.</li>
            <li>and I have tried most of them.</li>

            <li>Worth getting the replacements since this is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>This set works better than the ones with the heads without a groove to me.</li>
            <li>I have found that the R-7130 gives me a close uniform shave which is the equal of the best that I have had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>And I got a better than ever shave from the start.</li>
            <li>Five more words are required.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are reasonable in price and work great.  </li>
            <li>Was glad that I decided on this one.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement head after my cat knocked the shaver onto the floor one too many times and broke the attaching pieces.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t realize thee wear out anyway</li>
            <li>but my husband is pleased with them :)</li>
            <li>Glad I found this.  </li>
            <li>I wish my razor was better labeled so I could be sure that it would work.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>works great and is sure cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li>VERY INTERESTING AND COLORFUL</li>
            <li>VERY INTERESTING AND COLORFUL</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement shaver head, I actually like the replacement head better than the original head.</li>
            <li>bought this for my 89 year old dad who was able to change the head with no problems and says it shaves great.</li>
            <li>THANKS A LOT AND GOOD PRICE AND BETTER CUALITY</li>
            <li>Works fine, what more do I need to say.</li>
            <li>The original is okay, just wanted to try the replacement, just in case it wasn&#x27;t okay.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, good price.</li>
            <li>I love the cutters..however the price is rich.  </li>
            <li>Both of the original blade sets lasted a year or better.</li>
            <li>Better than the original, a closer, smoother, shave.</li>
            <li>these are better than the original blades.</li>
            <li>Even better then the original blades on the shaver</li>
            <li>It is better quality than the original head on the PR1260.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to labor the motor much more than the original.  </li>
            <li>Easy to change.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Received very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li>easy .....</li>
            <li>Except, the design twists out too easily to remove the blades.</li>
            <li>They snap out easily and are replaceable.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace, but no instructions included.</li>
            <li>Was easy to snap on and replace.  </li>
            <li>Easy to attach.</li>
            <li>The spring isn&#x27;t as strong as the Titanium replacement heads but that doesn&#x27;t affect the preformance in any way.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this shaver head,  was easy to replace, does the job very well.</li>
            <li>the way, many people do not know this but the big brand manual razors are actually good for many shaves.</li>
            <li>A Good Price , I need a new one anyway</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>So I ordered it and it works fine.</li>
            <li>PR1260.&lt;br /&gt;The SPR works fine for both models, even though it is not listed as a replacement for the PR1260 head.  </li>
            <li>The blades do work fine when shaving the problem is when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>Luckily I haven&#x27;t lost anything to date, though, so I Love It and gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It fit fine and works fine.</li>
            <li>This product was a perfect fit to the Remmington shaver and was super nice change to my dull shaver.</li>
            <li>whereas, when I bought this electric shaver, it was supposed to be this comfortable already.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend didnt think it was going to fit it</li>

            <li>Fit perfect on my model device, runs smooth and no hair pulling (use another machine to reduce length b4 using if ure hair is too long, will pull ure hair if it&#x27;s too long)</li>
            <li>Now the shaver works better than when it was new!</li>
            <li>it works great and was much cheaper than those sold in the big box retailers.</li>
            <li>so the same goes what more can I say except that I love them both</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and performs well in my razor.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as advertized.</li>
            <li>product as described shipped quickly</li>
            <li>This shaving head works adequately with the Remington R-7130.  </li>
            <li>and it snapped right on it just like the original piece.</li>
            <li>This order came in super fast, and this replacement head is super easy and quick to change.</li>
            <li>It is my very first time using it as well.</li>
            <li>I looked all over the product information to make sure this replacement would fit my husband&#x27;s electric and I couldn&#x27;t find any restrictions or specific models it fit</li>
            <li>This shaver head has worked great, far better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Not a hard job, but a product should be able to be shipped without shaking apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fit perfectly and getting many close shaves with this, had to replace broken clips on old head.</li>
            <li>it works better,shaves better than it did brand new.</li>
            <li>much better operformance of razor with new blades</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s ONE PIECE!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To start with, I absolutely did not have to take it apart to clean it; pulling the latch was all I had to do before brushing it clean.</li>
            <li>I received the blades quickly and they are the right size.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product probably works just fine if the replacement actually fits on the shaver</li>
            <li>Been using it for a few months now and works great.</li>
            <li>It works better than the old one.</li>
            <li>Not as good as expected</li>
            <li>but I believe now it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Nothing exciting about this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying for.......</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It works great and the only thing I can complain about is it doesn&#x27;t look the same as the original.  </li>
            <li>They are other Remington shavers really nice and cheap.</li>
            <li>Better than buying a whole new shaver since they are pretty costly!</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s the way it should be done, right?)</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>This head works snaps right into place and performs as advertised.</li>
            <li>I looked up the part on Amazon and it was the right one.</li>
            <li>Did not receive right product.</li>
            <li>It met all my needs, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>The heads snapped right into place</li>
            <li>the replacement head was easy to replace and it works very well as expectedit is so much easier than just replacing the blades</li>
            <li>No more cutters to fly off.  </li>
            <li>As stated this is a universal head for Remington, it fit my Titanium just fine.</li>
            <li>It would be just as cheap to buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to attach to my old shaver with easy.  </li>
            <li>Work just as good as ones that came on the previous razor head.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace the old one with this.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but the life isn&#x27;t near what I expected it would be.</li>
            <li>Very easy to exhange your old head for a new one.</li>
            <li>You forget how awesome brand new blades can be when it cuts down your shaving time by half. :)</li>
            <li>this is just as they said it was sharp and wonderful nice shiney head and is universal way less than the store.</li>
            <li>Received them very fast.</li>
            <li>New design then what I had on my razor originally</li>
            <li>(It is funny that this convenience amazes me now;</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described</li>
            <li>These do not last more than a month for me before they start making noise and must be replaced.  </li>
            <li>My old shaver blades were taking 4 or 5 passes before my face felt smooth.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>head got hot</li>
            <li>it was exactly as described and well packaged.</li>
            <li>It is the part exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>But everything is exactly as it should be; even an updated design.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the piece it was replacing</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>noticeable one is that the individual razor disks cannot be separately taken out from the top of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last more than 4 months.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>thanks! ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;  ;</li>
            <li>I found that the Remington razor is better if you have a heavy beard and Norelco is better if you want to shave really close</li>
            <li>Cuts pretty close, without pulling.</li>
            <li>Maybe the shave isn&#x27;t quite what it was when I first bought it</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than anywhere else!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I thought the replacement blades would install as original but they didn&#x27;t, blades fall out when I open the shaver head to clean.</li>
            <li>It remains to be seen how long this new model lasts, but so far I am happy with them.</li>
            <li>took the new blades from the assembly and replaced the three old blades, but that seems a lot to pay when I&#x27;m throwing away most of the parts in the package.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my original shaving head.</li>
            <li>Why buy blades, often at a higher price when you can buy the whole assembly.</li>
            <li>no more to say  good bye folks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to replace the heads, especially as compared to the old method of replacing each blade separately.</li>
            <li>Have to say that there was a vast difference in closeness compared to the old head and it was very easy to install.  </li>
            <li>It fit perfectly, fast delivery and no other issue to report.</li>
            <li>This is exactly like the original; it was trivial to remove the old head and replace with the new one.  </li>
            <li>Sharp blades, quick shipment, easy transaction.</li>
            <li>so I get new heads more often and don&#x27;t take 18 months to order the next one.</li>
            <li>Note that maybe is better to get a new one instead of only the shaver head.</li>
            <li>Replacement shaver head arrived right away and is working like a new razor.  </li>
            <li>My old shaver head is like a year old, but it still works better than this new one.</li>
            <li>I used a toothpick and my wife&#x27;s toothbrush to dislodge debris and clean crevices, being carefully to not damage anything.</li>
            <li>So nice to have a sharp new replacement head.</li>
            <li>Recently purchased as replacement head on my Remington electric shaver and leaves face smooth without undo pulling and nicking.</li>
            <li>I just replaced with this shaver head, this one is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>try gently rocking the head from side to side while pulling it up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, highly recommend this as a replacement!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I now realize I can rinse the whole thing with water</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>Should have done this much sooner.</li>
            <li>DEALER FAST AND  </li>
            <li>DEALER FAST AND  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I should have posted this much sooner than today but just never thought about it or did not have the time.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>&quot; the carriage and free each individual razor</li>
            <li>simply pull the head unit free before shaking the trimmings.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A word of caution: I was fooled by the pictures on the instructions, thinking that I have remove the triangular cutter carrier before installing the whole assembly on to my shaver.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t catch very well</li>
            <li>Also much faster than with the worn heads.</li>
            <li>What can you really say about electric shaver heads?</li>
            <li>and then don&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li>Took much longer to get it out of the plastic vault in which it was encased.  </li>
            <li>A quick wash in mild detergent, rinse, dry and a squirt of shaver lube, reassemble and Voila</li>
            <li>On the down side, it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut my beard as easily as the original head did when it was new.</li>
            <li>Only problem is original  head guard does not fit this replacement head and does not come with its own cover.</li>
            <li>It snapped right into place, replacing the old one.</li>
            <li>fits the old razor and is being as it is all one unit, is easier to clean that the old head.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp, but works ok.</li>
            <li>The head that originally came with my Remington lasted for well over a year before is starting pulling hairs.  </li>
            <li>The design is clearly different than the original I&#x27;m replacing.  </li>
            <li>It is very different from the original head on the razor I bought.</li>
            <li>The original head for my shaver had individual blades that could be removed.</li>
            <li>Wish I bought a whole new razor!</li>
            <li>Took a while to figure out how to clean the individual blades.</li>
            <li>So far this one has done exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>not a bad replacement head, but it was almost the same price as buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper then A new one !</li>
            <li>Like having a new electric razor!</li>
            <li>Makes it like new again!</li>
            <li>.... cuts like new!</li>
            <li>When you need a new shaver head can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>Greetings, This new style head is a big improvement from the original.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed new blades until I got them.</li>
            <li>Still cheaper and easier than buying a whole new razor</li>
            <li>Beats buying a whole new razor every 6 months or so..</li>
            <li>Thanks to seller and amazon saved me cost of buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Popped right in, but doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the original when new.</li>
            <li>I agree with most reviewers that it is a good fix to a fundamentally bad design.</li>
            <li>Little-by-little it seems to cut less and pull more.</li>
            <li>I made sure as suggested in previous reviews that the replacement head I needed was for my razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The replacement fit the shaver and worked properly but it doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as my old Philips shaver.</li>
            <li>I thought once the cutters wore out I would throw it away and try another brand, or search ebay for one of the older better-designed models.  </li>
            <li>I bought my Remington shaver in 2010 to replace an older Remington.</li>
            <li>My Remington 5150 was a decent electric razor.</li>
            <li>This shaver head is more similar to the Norelco models where you remove the shavers from the inside and not the outside.  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised, decent life.</li>
            <li>Got a decent price for them and will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li>I could not find any replacement Remington parts in my local bog box stores and did not want to spend the money on a new razor while my old one charged and worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li>so it is of high quality</li>
            <li>This new shaver head model is much better than the previous version.  </li>
            <li>I did end up with a little bit of razor burn, but I attribute this to not having been able to use the shaver for quite some time and needing to readjust after using a razor.</li>
            <li>It does a good job as long as the heads are replaced every few months.</li>
            <li>I was ready to throw out my old shaver, now it shaves like new again, at a fraction of the cost of a ne shaver.</li>
            <li>The ones I kept for right next to the owners manual for my lawn rake....</li>
            <li>The Rotary Razor replacements were priced right, arrived earlier than promised and work well.</li>
            <li>Blades do no rotate as rapidly as original shaver head and tends to run hot after shaving for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for exactly that product and was beginning to think of buying another electric razor.. and a friend of mine said &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>Works like new.  </li>
            <li>I did not want to throw it away and buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>My husband has new shaver...</li>
            <li>Now the shaver shaves like new.</li>
            <li>It got so it would not stay latched, so I ordered this new replacement unit.  </li>
            <li>Now I need to buy a new razor, I can&#x27;t stand this thing any longer.</li>
            <li>With the new blades, one or 2 passes is all it takes.</li>
            <li>My shaver is like new now.</li>
            <li>Kinda like having a new shaver all over again.  </li>
            <li>he says it is just like a new shaver.</li>
            <li>it works like a new razor now.</li>
            <li>I can notbe happer if I had bought a new razor.</li>
            <li>The new heads go in from the backside, when the razor is opened.  </li>
            <li>its like my husband has a new razor now.</li>
            <li>It now shaves like new again.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper to replace the blades than buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I can forget about buying a new shaver for now.</li>
            <li>Assuming you don&#x27;t need a new charging stand, it beats the of buying a new razor by ~$20.</li>
            <li>nothing beats a new blade.</li>
            <li>New head came within 3 days, switched head in 5 seconds,  </li>
            <li>made my shave like new</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t include and new one.</li>
            <li>The new one wasn&#x27;t as good as the old one as it pulled hairs even worse.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove each cutter and clean them.</li>
            <li>The shave is pretty much the same as the original it takes a little while to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>WOW, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>Mine was over a year old and tearing my face up!</li>
            <li>I probably will go for the higher priced replacement next time.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>They are also very sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>He was pleasantly surprised at the price and the fact that it worked like a new razor.</li>
            <li>Turned my old shaver into a new product again this is something we should all remember to do once a year</li>
            <li>Pop the old one off, clip the new one on.</li>
            <li>, I popped off the old one put on this replacement and had a new razor.......</li>
            <li>It works greats and was a direct replacement so there was no fooling around, just used the tab to push the new head and blades into the razor and a cleaner cut I now have.</li>
            <li>The old one snaps off, and in literally 30 seconds, you have the new head installed.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is to pop out the old shaver head, then snap on the new one.</li>
            <li>Works great, I usually get a few months out of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty quiet like the old one.</li>
            <li>What the makers do is intentionally use metal that corrodes quickly from being wet.</li>
            <li>Old blade was over a year old and instead of buying a new shaver, getting this head saved time and money.  </li>
            <li>Actually it&#x27;s easy: Open the head, no need to remove it, rotate the center three legged &#x27;spider&#x27; about 1/8 inch counter-clockwise and pull it off.</li>
            <li>We will see how long the blades last, Appears to be identical to the original shaver head.</li>
            <li>Definite improvement over the original which I used WAY too long</li>
            <li>I waited way to long to replace this like many other people mentioned.</li>
            <li>It actually only replaces the head on certain newer models.  </li>
            <li>instead it has a piece inside when you open it up that you just set in place and turn a little to lock them all in place which is better</li>
            <li>I love this shave and when the blades were getting dull</li>
            <li>I do wish they&#x27;d offer a discounted trade-in program for loyal yet disgruntled owners of this and other models plagued with the flying cutters, as a sign of goodwill.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;During the shaving (with the old head) one of the blades might fall out.</li>
            <li>The Universal Replacement head is an improvement over the rotary heads that preceeded it, and Amazon has it at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again when I am ready for my next blade.</li>
            <li>My old razor head unit kept unlatching, dumping whiskers on me and the sink.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cut as well as my old blades.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my old 5150 had a coating on the head, this one is just metal.</li>
            <li>but you might want to keep the old head and just swap out the blades.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than my old one that was over one year old.</li>
            <li>this replacement does not mimic the old one it replaces.&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a complete head unit replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the old type.  </li>
            <li>I have used the old ones for twice that time.</li>
            <li>It re-vitalized the old unit.  </li>
            <li>Just slipped off the old unit and slipped this one on.</li>
            <li>I purchased the panasonic shaver and on my wife&#x27;s recommendation, I got this replacement head for my old remington.</li>
            <li>no wasted time.</li>
            <li>my old one wore out and you get used to how it feels when I put this in you</li>
            <li>Makes major  difference like a new machine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little noisier than the original part</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m thrilled with my \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; shaving experience, I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed (by comparison) with the shaving head that originally came with my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not smooth on the skin as the original.</li>
            <li>I think Remington makes a fine product, I usually go about 2 years between changing blades.</li>
            <li>but pretty  much rely on the razor for everyday shaves.</li>
            <li>I was able to disassemble both heads and use the blades and foils but the shave is not very good!</li>
            <li>I had to remove the blades and put them in my old holder because it did not function properly with the new head holder</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the instructions that come with it are sparse, but most people can figure out how to remove the old shaver head and install this one.</li>
            <li>This shaver head works just like the original one that it replaced, which is to say that it shaves very close and can give an occasional nick if I push too hard.  </li>
            <li>new head is designed in such a way that the blades will never fall out during the shaving procedure.</li>
            <li>Would probably get a new shaver next time.</li>
            <li>I need it because i lost one of the heads, But the price almost the same as a new shaver...</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the plastic protective top no longer fits on the razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh, and I almost forgot, replacing the old head took about 5 seconds, just lift the old one straight up at the hinge and slide the new one down, simple as that.  </li>
            <li>Yet the old one I had to take apart to have it cleaned prior to every shaving.</li>
            <li>Had to put it all back together by looking at the old one.</li>
            <li>I bought this rotary replacement, apparently made by Remington.</li>
            <li>Was much different then the old ones.  </li>
            <li>Got these newbies for my old razor and yelped as tiny hairs got ripped out of my face.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price to have a close shave everyday.</li>
            <li>I now love my old 3130, of course this new head cost almost as much as the original shaver, but at least Remington recognized and corrected the horrible design of the original cutter head.  </li>
            <li>After wasting money on this replacement head, I think it&#x27;s time to just buy a new razor from a different manufacturer entirely.</li>
            <li>So I switched to another brand, straight cutters, three rows, and now my facial skin is like a lustrous field of swaying dandelions on a spring morning, or some other analogy that might make you think of soft.</li>
            <li>I still use it periodially for a quick touch-up or a lazy Saturday</li>
            <li>Really, a five-star product -- except that in shipping the head assembly shook loose and I had to put the pieces back together.</li>
            <li>the head is as simple as opening the package, locking the loose parts together, pulling the old head off your razor, snapping the new head on.  </li>
            <li>As usual, by the time I needed to replace my razor&#x27;s blades, a new razor costs only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>The original blades were very difficult to take apart &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>I got a replacement head long before I should have needed one after using my Remington razor for three months because the old one started pulling a lot hairs which hurt.</li>
            <li>Wow, wish I had replaced the blades a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>So, I can get to work a few minutes earlier, or maybe better, sleep a few minutes</li>
            <li>Worked as expected and a decent price, but a plus that I could find it on Amazon as Iit was getting more difficult to find at local stores.</li>
            <li>First of all it fits really tight, which I don&#x27;t care about as long as it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>though this was new and sealed in box, it felt like it was extremely used from the beginning.</li>
            <li>Lots of pulling or snagging on whiskers instead of a crisp clean cutting.</li>

            <li> I am the not-so-proud owner of a Remington R3130 shaver (see my review, not so kind), and while the shaver cut pretty good it had a fatal flaw.  </li>

            <li> my original head i had on it.</li>
            <li> This product came within the time promised and is an original manufacturers equipment.</li>
            <li> downside is that the original shaver came with a protective cover that snapped onto the three heads.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> THE ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a closer shave than I was getting after three years using the original.  </li>
            <li> The original latch is longer than this &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to be just like the factory original.</li>
            <li> Just like the original</li>
            <li> The original did not fall out.</li>
            <li> It fits well but running slower than the original</li>
            <li> Returned shaver to original performance.</li>
            <li> is original cap</li>
            <li> The blades keep coming apart when you clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> Falls apart when trying to clean.</li>
            <li> Durable and provides a clean cut.</li>
            <li> price was better than what I was able to get ordering direct from the manufacturer .</li>
            <li> no problem installing on razor, and it sure was better than my old</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed to make the shaver work as good as new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does provide the same good, close shave as the original head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to take apart for cleaning, since it can be disassemble from the bottom, rather than the top like the original.</li>
            <li> Snapped right on and worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> Yeah, right!</li>
            <li> I should have noticed the rpms had dropped, even at full charge.</li>
            <li> This is the second time we&#x27;ve bought replacements and have had good luck.</li>
            <li> Fair enough !</li>
            <li> and you can get several weeks of good use from each &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It fit right in to the model that I have.</li>
            <li> easy to replace on my Remington razor, fits exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original blades Pulls on your beard if you let it get too long.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect on my model device, runs smooth and no hair pulling (use another machine to reduce length b4 using if ure hair is too long, will pull ure hair if it&#x27;s too long)</li>
            <li> Now the shaver works better than when it was new!</li>
            <li> it works great and was much cheaper than those sold in the big box retailers.</li>
            <li> so the same goes what more can I say except that I love them both</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and performs well in my razor.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as advertized.</li>
            <li> product as described shipped quickly</li>
            <li> This shaving head works adequately with the Remington R-7130.  </li>
            <li> and it snapped right on it just like the original piece.</li>
            <li> This order came in super fast, and this replacement head is super easy and quick to change.</li>
            <li> It is my very first time using it as well.</li>
            <li> I looked all over the product information to make sure this replacement would fit my husband&#x27;s electric and I couldn&#x27;t find any restrictions or specific models it fit</li>
            <li> This shaver head has worked great, far better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not a hard job, but a product should be able to be shipped without shaking apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fit perfectly and getting many close shaves with this, had to replace broken clips on old head.</li>
            <li> it works better,shaves better than it did brand new.</li>
            <li> much better operformance of razor with new blades</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s ONE PIECE!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To start with, I absolutely did not have to take it apart to clean it; pulling the latch was all I had to do before brushing it clean.</li>
            <li> I received the blades quickly and they are the right size.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product probably works just fine if the replacement actually fits on the shaver</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months now and works great.</li>
            <li> It works better than the old one.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected</li>
            <li> but I believe now it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting about this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying for.......</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It works great and the only thing I can complain about is it doesn&#x27;t look the same as the original.  </li>
            <li> They are other Remington shavers really nice and cheap.</li>
            <li> Better than buying a whole new shaver since they are pretty costly!</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s the way it should be done, right?)</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> This head works snaps right into place and performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> I looked up the part on Amazon and it was the right one.</li>
            <li> Did not receive right product.</li>
            <li> It met all my needs, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The heads snapped right into place</li>
            <li> the replacement head was easy to replace and it works very well as expectedit is so much easier than just replacing the blades</li>
            <li> No more cutters to fly off.  </li>
            <li> As stated this is a universal head for Remington, it fit my Titanium just fine.</li>
            <li> It would be just as cheap to buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to attach to my old shaver with easy.  </li>
            <li> Work just as good as ones that came on the previous razor head.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the old one with this.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but the life isn&#x27;t near what I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> Very easy to exhange your old head for a new one.</li>
            <li> You forget how awesome brand new blades can be when it cuts down your shaving time by half. :)</li>
            <li> this is just as they said it was sharp and wonderful nice shiney head and is universal way less than the store.</li>
            <li> Received them very fast.</li>
            <li> New design then what I had on my razor originally</li>
            <li> (It is funny that this convenience amazes me now;</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described</li>
            <li> These do not last more than a month for me before they start making noise and must be replaced.  </li>
            <li> My old shaver blades were taking 4 or 5 passes before my face felt smooth.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> head got hot</li>
            <li> it was exactly as described and well packaged.</li>
            <li> It is the part exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> But everything is exactly as it should be; even an updated design.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the piece it was replacing</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> noticeable one is that the individual razor disks cannot be separately taken out from the top of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last more than 4 months.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> thanks! ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;  ;</li>
            <li> I found that the Remington razor is better if you have a heavy beard and Norelco is better if you want to shave really close</li>
            <li> Cuts pretty close, without pulling.</li>
            <li> Maybe the shave isn&#x27;t quite what it was when I first bought it</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than anywhere else!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I thought the replacement blades would install as original but they didn&#x27;t, blades fall out when I open the shaver head to clean.</li>
            <li> It remains to be seen how long this new model lasts, but so far I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> took the new blades from the assembly and replaced the three old blades, but that seems a lot to pay when I&#x27;m throwing away most of the parts in the package.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my original shaving head.</li>
            <li> Why buy blades, often at a higher price when you can buy the whole assembly.</li>
            <li> no more to say  good bye folks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to replace the heads, especially as compared to the old method of replacing each blade separately.</li>
            <li> Have to say that there was a vast difference in closeness compared to the old head and it was very easy to install.  </li>
            <li> It fit perfectly, fast delivery and no other issue to report.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the original; it was trivial to remove the old head and replace with the new one.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades, quick shipment, easy transaction.</li>
            <li> so I get new heads more often and don&#x27;t take 18 months to order the next one.</li>
            <li> Note that maybe is better to get a new one instead of only the shaver head.</li>
            <li> Replacement shaver head arrived right away and is working like a new razor.  </li>
            <li> My old shaver head is like a year old, but it still works better than this new one.</li>
            <li> I used a toothpick and my wife&#x27;s toothbrush to dislodge debris and clean crevices, being carefully to not damage anything.</li>
            <li> So nice to have a sharp new replacement head.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased as replacement head on my Remington electric shaver and leaves face smooth without undo pulling and nicking.</li>
            <li> I just replaced with this shaver head, this one is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> try gently rocking the head from side to side while pulling it up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, highly recommend this as a replacement!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I now realize I can rinse the whole thing with water</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Should have done this much sooner.</li>
            <li> DEALER FAST AND  </li>
            <li> DEALER FAST AND  </li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I should have posted this much sooner than today but just never thought about it or did not have the time.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> &quot; the carriage and free each individual razor</li>
            <li> simply pull the head unit free before shaking the trimmings.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A word of caution: I was fooled by the pictures on the instructions, thinking that I have remove the triangular cutter carrier before installing the whole assembly on to my shaver.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t catch very well</li>
            <li> Also much faster than with the worn heads.</li>
            <li> What can you really say about electric shaver heads?</li>
            <li> and then don&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li> Took much longer to get it out of the plastic vault in which it was encased.  </li>
            <li> A quick wash in mild detergent, rinse, dry and a squirt of shaver lube, reassemble and Voila</li>
            <li> On the down side, it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut my beard as easily as the original head did when it was new.</li>
            <li> Only problem is original  head guard does not fit this replacement head and does not come with its own cover.</li>
            <li> It snapped right into place, replacing the old one.</li>
            <li> fits the old razor and is being as it is all one unit, is easier to clean that the old head.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp, but works ok.</li>
            <li> The head that originally came with my Remington lasted for well over a year before is starting pulling hairs.  </li>
            <li> The design is clearly different than the original I&#x27;m replacing.  </li>
            <li> It is very different from the original head on the razor I bought.</li>
            <li> The original head for my shaver had individual blades that could be removed.</li>
            <li> Wish I bought a whole new razor!</li>
            <li> Took a while to figure out how to clean the individual blades.</li>
            <li> So far this one has done exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> not a bad replacement head, but it was almost the same price as buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper then A new one !</li>
            <li> Like having a new electric razor!</li>
            <li> Makes it like new again!</li>
            <li> .... cuts like new!</li>
            <li> When you need a new shaver head can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Greetings, This new style head is a big improvement from the original.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed new blades until I got them.</li>
            <li> Still cheaper and easier than buying a whole new razor</li>
            <li> Beats buying a whole new razor every 6 months or so..</li>
            <li> Thanks to seller and amazon saved me cost of buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Popped right in, but doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the original when new.</li>
            <li> I agree with most reviewers that it is a good fix to a fundamentally bad design.</li>
            <li> Little-by-little it seems to cut less and pull more.</li>
            <li> I made sure as suggested in previous reviews that the replacement head I needed was for my razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacement fit the shaver and worked properly but it doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as my old Philips shaver.</li>
            <li> I thought once the cutters wore out I would throw it away and try another brand, or search ebay for one of the older better-designed models.  </li>
            <li> I bought my Remington shaver in 2010 to replace an older Remington.</li>
            <li> My Remington 5150 was a decent electric razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver head is more similar to the Norelco models where you remove the shavers from the inside and not the outside.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised, decent life.</li>
            <li> Got a decent price for them and will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> I could not find any replacement Remington parts in my local bog box stores and did not want to spend the money on a new razor while my old one charged and worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> so it is of high quality</li>
            <li> This new shaver head model is much better than the previous version.  </li>
            <li> I did end up with a little bit of razor burn, but I attribute this to not having been able to use the shaver for quite some time and needing to readjust after using a razor.</li>
            <li> It does a good job as long as the heads are replaced every few months.</li>
            <li> I was ready to throw out my old shaver, now it shaves like new again, at a fraction of the cost of a ne shaver.</li>
            <li> The ones I kept for right next to the owners manual for my lawn rake....</li>
            <li> The Rotary Razor replacements were priced right, arrived earlier than promised and work well.</li>
            <li> Blades do no rotate as rapidly as original shaver head and tends to run hot after shaving for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for exactly that product and was beginning to think of buying another electric razor.. and a friend of mine said &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> Works like new.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to throw it away and buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> My husband has new shaver...</li>
            <li> Now the shaver shaves like new.</li>
            <li> It got so it would not stay latched, so I ordered this new replacement unit.  </li>
            <li> Now I need to buy a new razor, I can&#x27;t stand this thing any longer.</li>
            <li> With the new blades, one or 2 passes is all it takes.</li>
            <li> My shaver is like new now.</li>
            <li> Kinda like having a new shaver all over again.  </li>
            <li> he says it is just like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> it works like a new razor now.</li>
            <li> I can notbe happer if I had bought a new razor.</li>
            <li> The new heads go in from the backside, when the razor is opened.  </li>
            <li> its like my husband has a new razor now.</li>
            <li> It now shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper to replace the blades than buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I can forget about buying a new shaver for now.</li>
            <li> Assuming you don&#x27;t need a new charging stand, it beats the of buying a new razor by ~$20.</li>
            <li> nothing beats a new blade.</li>
            <li> New head came within 3 days, switched head in 5 seconds,  </li>
            <li> made my shave like new</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t include and new one.</li>
            <li> The new one wasn&#x27;t as good as the old one as it pulled hairs even worse.</li>
            <li> Carefully remove each cutter and clean them.</li>
            <li> The shave is pretty much the same as the original it takes a little while to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> WOW, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> Mine was over a year old and tearing my face up!</li>
            <li> I probably will go for the higher priced replacement next time.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> They are also very sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> He was pleasantly surprised at the price and the fact that it worked like a new razor.</li>
            <li> Turned my old shaver into a new product again this is something we should all remember to do once a year</li>
            <li> Pop the old one off, clip the new one on.</li>
            <li> , I popped off the old one put on this replacement and had a new razor.......</li>
            <li> It works greats and was a direct replacement so there was no fooling around, just used the tab to push the new head and blades into the razor and a cleaner cut I now have.</li>
            <li> The old one snaps off, and in literally 30 seconds, you have the new head installed.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is to pop out the old shaver head, then snap on the new one.</li>
            <li> Works great, I usually get a few months out of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty quiet like the old one.</li>
            <li> What the makers do is intentionally use metal that corrodes quickly from being wet.</li>
            <li> Old blade was over a year old and instead of buying a new shaver, getting this head saved time and money.  </li>
            <li> Actually it&#x27;s easy: Open the head, no need to remove it, rotate the center three legged &#x27;spider&#x27; about 1/8 inch counter-clockwise and pull it off.</li>
            <li> We will see how long the blades last, Appears to be identical to the original shaver head.</li>
            <li> Definite improvement over the original which I used WAY too long</li>
            <li> I waited way to long to replace this like many other people mentioned.</li>
            <li> It actually only replaces the head on certain newer models.  </li>
            <li> instead it has a piece inside when you open it up that you just set in place and turn a little to lock them all in place which is better</li>
            <li> I love this shave and when the blades were getting dull</li>
            <li> I do wish they&#x27;d offer a discounted trade-in program for loyal yet disgruntled owners of this and other models plagued with the flying cutters, as a sign of goodwill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;During the shaving (with the old head) one of the blades might fall out.</li>
            <li> The Universal Replacement head is an improvement over the rotary heads that preceeded it, and Amazon has it at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again when I am ready for my next blade.</li>
            <li> My old razor head unit kept unlatching, dumping whiskers on me and the sink.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut as well as my old blades.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my old 5150 had a coating on the head, this one is just metal.</li>
            <li> but you might want to keep the old head and just swap out the blades.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than my old one that was over one year old.</li>
            <li> this replacement does not mimic the old one it replaces.&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a complete head unit replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the old type.  </li>
            <li> I have used the old ones for twice that time.</li>
            <li> It re-vitalized the old unit.  </li>
            <li> Just slipped off the old unit and slipped this one on.</li>
            <li> I purchased the panasonic shaver and on my wife&#x27;s recommendation, I got this replacement head for my old remington.</li>
            <li> no wasted time.</li>
            <li> my old one wore out and you get used to how it feels when I put this in you</li>
            <li> Makes major  difference like a new machine</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little noisier than the original part</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m thrilled with my \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; shaving experience, I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed (by comparison) with the shaving head that originally came with my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not smooth on the skin as the original.</li>
            <li> I think Remington makes a fine product, I usually go about 2 years between changing blades.</li>
            <li> but pretty  much rely on the razor for everyday shaves.</li>
            <li> I was able to disassemble both heads and use the blades and foils but the shave is not very good!</li>
            <li> I had to remove the blades and put them in my old holder because it did not function properly with the new head holder</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the instructions that come with it are sparse, but most people can figure out how to remove the old shaver head and install this one.</li>
            <li> This shaver head works just like the original one that it replaced, which is to say that it shaves very close and can give an occasional nick if I push too hard.  </li>
            <li> new head is designed in such a way that the blades will never fall out during the shaving procedure.</li>
            <li> Would probably get a new shaver next time.</li>
            <li> I need it because i lost one of the heads, But the price almost the same as a new shaver...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the plastic protective top no longer fits on the razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, and I almost forgot, replacing the old head took about 5 seconds, just lift the old one straight up at the hinge and slide the new one down, simple as that.  </li>
            <li> Yet the old one I had to take apart to have it cleaned prior to every shaving.</li>
            <li> Had to put it all back together by looking at the old one.</li>
            <li> I bought this rotary replacement, apparently made by Remington.</li>
            <li> Was much different then the old ones.  </li>
            <li> Got these newbies for my old razor and yelped as tiny hairs got ripped out of my face.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price to have a close shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I now love my old 3130, of course this new head cost almost as much as the original shaver, but at least Remington recognized and corrected the horrible design of the original cutter head.  </li>
            <li> After wasting money on this replacement head, I think it&#x27;s time to just buy a new razor from a different manufacturer entirely.</li>
            <li> So I switched to another brand, straight cutters, three rows, and now my facial skin is like a lustrous field of swaying dandelions on a spring morning, or some other analogy that might make you think of soft.</li>
            <li> I still use it periodially for a quick touch-up or a lazy Saturday</li>
            <li> Really, a five-star product -- except that in shipping the head assembly shook loose and I had to put the pieces back together.</li>
            <li> the head is as simple as opening the package, locking the loose parts together, pulling the old head off your razor, snapping the new head on.  </li>
            <li> As usual, by the time I needed to replace my razor&#x27;s blades, a new razor costs only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> The original blades were very difficult to take apart &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> I got a replacement head long before I should have needed one after using my Remington razor for three months because the old one started pulling a lot hairs which hurt.</li>
            <li> Wow, wish I had replaced the blades a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> So, I can get to work a few minutes earlier, or maybe better, sleep a few minutes</li>
            <li> Worked as expected and a decent price, but a plus that I could find it on Amazon as Iit was getting more difficult to find at local stores.</li>
            <li> First of all it fits really tight, which I don&#x27;t care about as long as it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> though this was new and sealed in box, it felt like it was extremely used from the beginning.</li>
            <li> Lots of pulling or snagging on whiskers instead of a crisp clean cutting.</li>
            <li> This replacement head was a gift to my friend and we were surprised that the shave head was loose with pieces not directly attached as the original.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reming Sprcdn Universal Rotary Replacement Shaver Heads are supposed to last a few weeks but the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the last twelve months get dull very quickly.</li>
            <li> and wow, I forgot what it was like to shave with sharp heads.  </li>
            <li> No defects just had a little to high of expectations.</li>
            <li> I think they are priced a little high.</li>
            <li> will last as long as the heads are constantly cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I thought my old shaver head was getting dull, and it was, but this didn&#x27;t seem to be as big of an improvement moving from a 4 year old shaver head to the replacement.</li>
            <li> That means that they have lasted about two years for me, although I have to admit that they were getting really run-down in the past month.</li>
            <li> Makes me a believer in getting replacement heads on a regular basis instead of waiting too long.</li>
            <li> the price was just a little less, I always wonder if I should buy a complete new razor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, you should just buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> since the blade wears slowly over time, i don&#x27;t notice too much until i put the new one in - and then wish i replaced it a few months earlier!</li>
            <li> Price isn&#x27;t too bad either considering most of the stores near me don&#x27;t carry this anymore for some reason.</li>
            <li> He said it took less than a minute to shave and it took him 10mins with the old ones.</li>
            <li> The head fit a little weird, so I just changed out the blades with the one already had, and the new blades worked well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decision whether to pay $22 for new blades or $34 for a new razor, but my razor wasn&#x27;t broken otherwise, so I stuck with just the blades.</li>
            <li> However, it is not exactly the same and the plastic cover that protects the head for travel does not fit the new one.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it for more than a couple months as it will cause hairs to be pulled out instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> I bought this not too long ago and based on the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not shave well enough to replace a wet razor.  </li>
            <li> Read carefully down further in the advertisement for the list of actual models it fits and compare it to your shaver.  </li>
            <li> Nice cutting; very sharp.</li>
            <li> The blades last me about 100 shaves, (every other day) which isn&#x27;t as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> Well today I found this replacement head made for this and other models, bought it locally, and</li>
            <li> At under $25, these replacements are equal to or lower than the prices of replacement heads for other razors.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the improvement over my old head, which had begun to pull, no longer cut close and was very slow.</li>
            <li> Just rise thoroughly, dry with towel &amp; set it so the moisture till drain off</li>
            <li> You sent wrong heads I sent them back never got the right head or saw a credit for the ones I was charged for</li>
            <li> It is hard to find replacement heads and end up buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> This replacement head was crazy easy to install</li>
            <li> Secondly it has dual-track cutters, so it shaves faster and closer than previously.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how dull the old blades were, but now shaving is easier and quicker!</li>
            <li> but it did not stay sharp for very long but that might be my beard.</li>
            <li> Got these to replace old dull heads.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Products works as expected.</li>
            <li> I had so much trouble snapping the heads back</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as expected</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and have been using the same Remington shaver for four years.</li>
            <li> EXPECTED</li>
            <li> This product performed as expected.</li>
            <li> There is hope that not all things have to be less expensive to replace in full and just replacing what is needed</li>
            <li> It also does this in about half the time of that of my previous razor, a rotary by Norelco of similar design.</li>
            <li> Not much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said in other reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, and everything I expected it to be since it&#x27;s a Remington.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp.  </li>
            <li> My husband has to use an electric shaver due to scars from an accident.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as store bought blades.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints and</li>
            <li> A lot easier than just getting the blades like other models.  </li>
            <li> Blades seem just as sharp as other refill packs I have bought though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sharp.</li>
            <li> The previous blades were basically grinding my hair down with a little stubble left.</li>
            <li> but I same tired of the big brand razor companies and their predatory schemes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would give 4 stars for performance but kick it down due to price and frequency of reordering.  </li>
            <li> Very strange... Blades pull hair very slightly.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up on my shaver because it was cutting slowly and made my face sore, but decided to try a new shaver head.</li>
            <li> After this last change I plan to change at least every 6 months.</li>
            <li> It is not very secure so keep an eye on it</li>
            <li> Done in 10 sec or less!</li>
            <li> boggs down my shaver power</li>
            <li> However, blades don&#x27;t seem to be very sharp.</li>
            <li> are a few differences mentioned by other posters.&lt;br /&gt;first</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the head on my Remington shaver after I had used the previous head for a year.</li>
            <li> My previous razor head broke off at the attachment.</li>
            <li> caused my shaver to run at half speed.</li>
            <li> Also, there is much less razor dust with this model.  </li>
            <li> Less money than the ones at Target.</li>
            <li> I would use that little included brush to wipe out debris on occasion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since that time, this is only the second time that I have had to replace the cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> If yours is not listed, then it will not fit.  </li>
            <li> I would have saved myself some trouble.</li>
            <li> I went to the Remington website and per their directions removed the cutters from the head and found a LOT of trapped debris.</li>
            <li> the cap did not fit the model it was supposed to</li>
            <li> The head fits on the shaver as it should; however, the latch mechanism will not work and will not secure the head to the shaver body.  </li>
            <li> Was not a fit for my razor</li>
            <li> The panasonic is going to be used in my travel bag and this will be my everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> Wrong heads for our old Remington Shaver.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but not great.</li>
            <li> does not fit this head</li>
            <li> they just didn&#x27;t seem to be very sharp almost seems like the old ones were cutting better.oh</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, it&#x27;s impossible to find one of these things at any local store.  </li>
            <li> Much less expensive than replacing entire razor!  </li>
            <li> Seams to slow my shaver down</li>
            <li> Was a little hard for my dad changing out the replacement</li>
            <li> Well, I was not okay with that when I happened to be in a hurry...</li>
            <li> This one usually stays latched (but sometimes has let go).  </li>
            <li> Shaving with it was really uncomfortable, my face was all red and buring by the end.</li>
            <li> Not sure if thats the difference</li>
            <li> It is no better or worse than any other replacement blades I have had, the selling point is the price.</li>
            <li> I will defintely replace the blades when they get dull.</li>
            <li> The blades were getting dull though, so I bought this replacement head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hardly noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I bought my replacement shield about 5 months ago and am shopping for another - its getting dull and not working as well as it was (meaning not-so-close shaves)...</li>
            <li> blades dull.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy it through Amazon because Remington (at least at the time of writing this) does not ship to Post Office (PO) boxes.</li>
            <li> total cost over the life of an electric razor must include that of replacement cutting heads.</li>
            <li> but when they say &amp;#34;Universal&amp;#34; they don&#x27;t mean it.</li>
            <li> could feel the diffrence - modified style so easier to disassemble for cleaning - only bad thing</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not fit (the specs on it were on the box</li>
            <li> Shaver will run with new head, but pulls whiskers (very painful).</li>
            <li> : Gentlemen, if you want your ladies to kiss you on the cheek and not complain about you being shaved poorly, you might want to use the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The battery technology is apparently poor.</li>
            <li> It is really poor quality product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the price (least expensive replacement I could find).</li>
            <li> and now I have a useless but expensive replacement head...</li>
            <li> My dad kept complaing about the lousy shave he was getting,so I purchased this replacement head.</li>
            <li> and I had thrown away the package in error and was unable to return</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I touch it the wrong way, it will twist out and the blades fall out into the sink.</li>
            <li> no paper work came with the item,so unable to return,I don&#x27;t understand</li>
            <li> Were very dull!!</li>
            <li> and I could tell the difference in cutting my hair immediately.</li>
            <li> Also this one pulls hair once in a while, not a lot, but still unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Too bad I had to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> Sick as it might seem</li>
            <li> : never shake the head unit while still connected to the base.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with Remington for allowing something this bad to get passed quality control.</li>
            <li> It pulls the hairs out of my face one by one in a very painful way.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful, to the point where I dread shaving.</li>
            <li> these were awful!!</li>
            <li> Terrible or non existent instructions with it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> bought this for my 89 year old dad who was able to change the head with no problems and says it shaves great. Very happy with item, the quickness of the delivery and how it was packaged.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased as replacement head on my Remington electric shaver and leaves face smooth without undo pulling and nicking.</li>
            <li> Love the Titanium Replacement Blades. This Remington is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and I have tried most of them.</li>
            <li> So nice to have a sharp new replacement head. Very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Easy to change.  Works like new.  Did not have to do the disassembly of the 3 heads and change them one by one.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to replace the heads on the shaver.  I love this shave and when the blades were getting dull I did not want to throw it away and buy a new shaver.  I was so glad I found these replacement heads on Amazon</li>
            <li> It is my very first time using it as well. Yet, if there was 6-star rating, I would rate it 6. Compared to the piece of junk I just replaced with this shaver head, this one is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, I absolutely did not have to take it apart to clean it; pulling the latch was all I had to do before brushing it clean. (That&#x27;s the way it should be done, right?) Yet the old one I had to take apart to have it cleaned prior to every shaving. Not enough? Here is some more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the shaving (with the old head) one of the blades might fall out. Not only it might cut me, it had got the shaved-off hair all over my chest. I might even have to take the shower once again... Well, I was not okay with that when I happened to be in a hurry...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new head is designed in such a way that the blades will never fall out during the shaving procedure. (It is funny that this convenience amazes me now; whereas, when I bought this electric shaver, it was supposed to be this comfortable already. Well... I am able to forgive and forget things quite easily.)&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can forget about the worries now. When I have to shave, I can just shave and not suffer through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Gentlemen, if you want your ladies to kiss you on the cheek and not complain about you being shaved poorly, you might want to use the [[ASIN:B0038LTIII Remington R-5130 Pivot &amp; Flex Titanium Dual Track Shaver]] equipped with this wonderful shaver head!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only makes me wonder why my razor (Remington R-5130) came equipped with a different head and not once like this???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, men, I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will love it too once you start using it!</li>
            <li> This is a good replacement head. We will see how long the blades last, Appears to be identical to the original shaver head.</li>
            <li> The shaver head popped onto my shaver with no issues.  It was nice to shave without pulling hair.  I won&#x27;t wait 18 months to replace the head again.</li>
            <li> Arrived in original unopened package.</li>
            <li> I expected the replacement shaver head to be the same as the old one and it is in what it does. However, it is not exactly the same and the plastic cover that protects the head for travel does not fit the new one.</li>
            <li> Not much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said in other reviews. The shaver head fits well and cuts well. It is easy to clean and a good value. I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> it was suppose to be the correct replacement but shaver won&#x27;t work with it</li>
            <li> I had to remove the blades and put them in my old holder because it did not function properly with the new head holder</li>
            <li> I received this item after purchasing for my husband&#x27;s razor. Snapped right on and worked like a charm! He was pleasantly surprised at the price and the fact that it worked like a new razor.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> The Universal Replacement head is an improvement over the rotary heads that preceeded it, and Amazon has it at a reasonable price.  Replacing it is very easy.  If the head seems to be stuck (like it was for me), try gently rocking the head from side to side while pulling it up.</li>
            <li> The replacement fit the shaver and worked properly but it doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as my old Philips shaver.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, it&#x27;s impossible to find one of these things at any local store.  I bought my razor there, but they don&#x27;t have the replacement heads . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one did the trick</li>
            <li> Good including the package</li>
            <li> Wallah!!!!! My husband has new shaver...üòÉ he loves it...</li>
            <li> Turned my old shaver into a new product again this is something we should all remember to do once a year</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described</li>
            <li> It fell apart when we opened it up.  Had to put it all back together by looking at the old one.</li>
            <li> Caution!  This replacement head is billed as a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; replacement for Remington rotary shavers.  It actually only replaces the head on certain newer models.  Read carefully down further in the advertisement for the list of actual models it fits and compare it to your shaver.  If yours is not listed, then it will not fit.  I did not look carefully enough (I have a Remington R845) and now I have a useless but expensive replacement head...</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp, but works ok.</li>
            <li> I like it better then my original head i had on it. My girlfriend didnt think it was going to fit it right and it snapped right on it just like the original piece. The heads do not lock into place on top anymore instead it has a piece inside when you open it up that you just set in place and turn a little to lock them all in place which is better I think. The shave is pretty much the same as the original it takes a little while to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> An indictment of the Remington R-5250 shaver, not this unit. Shaver began to pull so I ordered this replacement head. No difference. I should have noticed the rpms had dropped, even at full charge. The battery technology is apparently poor. Immediately purchased another shaver.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper then A new one !</li>
            <li> Everything went great, good product, price, and deleivery!  I found this product to attach to my old shaver with easy.  It actually fit my shaver.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the original; it was trivial to remove the old head and replace with the new one.  Now the shaver shaves like new.</li>
            <li> Works fine, what more do I need to say.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this replacement, it works better than the original shaving head that came with my razor!  While I&#x27;m thrilled with my \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; shaving experience, I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed (by comparison) with the shaving head that originally came with my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;changing out the head is as simple as opening the package, locking the loose parts together, pulling the old head off your razor, snapping the new head on.  takes about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, highly recommend this as a replacement!</li>
            <li> No complaints. I was surprised at the improvement over my old head, which had begun to pull, no longer cut close and was very slow.</li>
            <li> You sent wrong heads I sent them back never got the right head or saw a credit for the ones I was charged for</li>
            <li> As stated this is a universal head for Remington, it fit my Titanium just fine. The spring isn&#x27;t as strong as the Titanium replacement heads but that doesn&#x27;t affect the preformance in any way. I will be purchasing again when I am ready for my next blade.</li>
            <li> This head works snaps right into place and performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am the not-so-proud owner of a Remington R3130 shaver (see my review, not so kind), and while the shaver cut pretty good it had a fatal flaw.  The individual cutters were removable from above, and while shaving they could suddenly pop off.  This was especially true when in a humid environment (like a bathroom).  I thought once the cutters wore out I would throw it away and try another brand, or search ebay for one of the older better-designed models.  Well today I found this replacement head made for this and other models, bought it locally, and WOW, what a difference!  First of all, it&#x27;s ONE PIECE!  No more cutters to fly off.  Secondly it has dual-track cutters, so it shaves faster and closer than previously. Lastly the one piece design allows the whiskers to fall in the compartment underneath better instead of clogging directly under the cutting wheels.  Oh, and I almost forgot, replacing the old head took about 5 seconds, just lift the old one straight up at the hinge and slide the new one down, simple as that.  I now love my old 3130, of course this new head cost almost as much as the original shaver, but at least Remington recognized and corrected the horrible design of the original cutter head.  I do wish they&#x27;d offer a discounted trade-in program for loyal yet disgruntled owners of this and other models plagued with the flying cutters, as a sign of goodwill.  But still very glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This product came within the time promised and is an original manufacturers equipment. it works great and was much cheaper than those sold in the big box retailers.</li>
            <li> Works. Thanks. Good Seller.</li>
            <li> My dad kept complaing about the lousy shave he was getting,so I purchased this replacement head. He is thrilled.  Like having a new electric razor!</li>
            <li> Great replacement exact fit, works great and nice price. Works well with Remington R-5150</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than expected. Fit my razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great and didn&#x27;t take more than 30 seconds to install.</li>
            <li> A Good Price , I need a new one anyway and I like it.It works better than the old one.</li>
            <li> Good but it replacement irritate my face</li>
            <li> My old razor head unit kept unlatching, dumping whiskers on me and the sink.  It got so it would not stay latched, so I ordered this new replacement unit.  This one usually stays latched (but sometimes has let go).  The blades are sharp.  It allowed me to continue using my razor which had almost become unusable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my r6130. First of all it fits really tight, which I don&#x27;t care about as long as it gets the job done. Shaving with it was really uncomfortable, my face was all red and buring by the end. My old shaver head is like a year old, but it still works better than this new one. It is really poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Products works as expected.</li>
            <li> The replacement shave head was not as close shaving as I would like.  Would probably get a new shaver next time.</li>
            <li> This replacement head worked twice and then it just started pulling hairs.  The head that originally came with my Remington lasted for well over a year before is starting pulling hairs.  After wasting money on this replacement head, I think it&#x27;s time to just buy a new razor from a different manufacturer entirely.</li>
            <li> I love this replacement shaver head. I was ready to throw out my old shaver, now it shaves like new again, at a fraction of the cost of a ne shaver. Very easy to change out.</li>
            <li> I love the cutters..however the price is rich.  These do not last more than a month for me before they start making noise and must be replaced.  Get on the subscribe and save plan to save money and get free shipping.  Would give 4 stars for performance but kick it down due to price and frequency of reordering.  The price of the shaver is only 2x the price of the cutters!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement! Makes it like new again!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND OTHER CUSTOMER WILL ENJOY USING THIS PRODUCT AS A REPLACEMENT HEAD FOR THEY SHAVER.</li>
            <li> Makes me a believer in getting replacement heads on a regular basis instead of waiting too long.</li>
            <li> Good at a good price.</li>
            <li> This head has been purchased as a xmas gift for three consecutive years for my son-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;To date he continues to request a replacement each year without incident.&lt;br /&gt;This in itself speaks for the quality of the item.</li>
            <li> My husband has to use an electric shaver due to scars from an accident. It is hard to find replacement heads and end up buying a new razor. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received very quickly. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great! Mine was over a year old and tearing my face up! Found this one on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased . Works great and fits perfectly</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Instructions.... I don&#x27;t need no stink-in&#x27; instructions!&amp;#34; Had I read them I would have saved myself some trouble. I bought my Remington shaver in 2010 to replace an older Remington. Little-by-little it seems to cut less and pull more. I would use that little included brush to wipe out debris on occasion. Today I look into replacing the unit or just the shaver head. I went to the Remington website and per their directions removed the cutters from the head and found a LOT of trapped debris. I found a lost cat as well as a 5 dollar bill. I did not realize how much junk got trapped in there. Actually it&#x27;s easy: Open the head, no need to remove it, rotate the center three legged &#x27;spider&#x27; about 1/8 inch counter-clockwise and pull it off. Carefully remove each cutter and clean them. I used a toothpick and my wife&#x27;s toothbrush to dislodge debris and clean crevices, being carefully to not damage anything. A quick wash in mild detergent, rinse, dry and a squirt of shaver lube, reassemble and Voila.... cuts like new! I know I will need to replace it eventually. but for now it&#x27;s OK. Maybe next I&#x27;ll read those &amp;#34;stinking&amp;#34; instructions.... The ones I kept for right next to the owners manual for my lawn rake....&amp;#34;for future reference&amp;#34;. Yeah, right! Saved me some $ for now.</li>
            <li> I was able to disassemble both heads and use the blades and foils but the shave is not very good!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement head</li>
            <li> It worked well and now my husband can shave without pulling on his whiskers and face. good buy and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as store bought blades. Didn&#x27;t cut as well as my old blades. Very disappointed. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> These replacement blades were superior than the original blades in my R5130 shaver. The original blades were very difficult to take apart &amp; clean. I had so much trouble snapping the heads back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades come on and off like a breeze. Very easy to clean! They are also very sharp and smooth. I will order these every year, great product.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as ordered. It snapped right into place, replacing the old one. I forgot what a good shave was. I will defintely replace the blades when they get dull. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My Remington 5150 was a decent electric razor. It served me well for about year or so. The blades were getting dull though, so I bought this replacement head. Now the thing is a nightmare to use. Hairs are constantly getting grabbed and yanked out rather than cut. It&#x27;s awful, to the point where I dread shaving. I noticed that my old 5150 had a coating on the head, this one is just metal. Not sure if thats the difference but you might want to keep the old head and just swap out the blades. Wish I had done that. Now I need to buy a new razor, I can&#x27;t stand this thing any longer.</li>
            <li> this is just as they said it was sharp and wonderful nice shiney head and is universal way less than the store.</li>
            <li> Took all over 5 second to replace and now I have a subscription to this so I get new heads more often and don&#x27;t take 18 months to order the next one. Cuts like a champ by the way!</li>
            <li> the cap did not fit the model it was supposed to and I had thrown away the package in error and was unable to return so I tried to just use the blades and they didn&#x27;t fit either</li>
            <li> it fits perfect, and comes with the pin. I now realize I can rinse the whole thing with water so I know longer open it up and knock it against something to get the hair out. I just simple put it under the sink and let the water flush it out.</li>
            <li> This shaver head works just like the original one that it replaced, which is to say that it shaves very close and can give an occasional nick if I push too hard.  Other than that, no complaints and it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> Sharp blades, quick shipment, easy transaction. will buy replacement blade. My old shaver blades were taking 4 or 5 passes before my face felt smooth. With the new blades, one or 2 passes is all it takes.</li>
            <li> bon produit de qualiter a conseiller sans probl√©me la livraison ok rien a dire vous pouvez le commender sans probl√©me.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the head on my Remington shaver after I had used the previous head for a year. So far this one has done exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Top . Last for ever. Thanks.</li>
            <li> easy to replace on my Remington razor, fits exactly as described. Definitely recommend this product, but look at the model specifications that it fits on the remington website as it is not told on the Amazon description, which is often the case. Just do your research.</li>
            <li> This razor head fit correctly on the razor type I had, as stated. The head fit a little weird, so I just changed out the blades with the one already had, and the new blades worked well.</li>
            <li> The replacement head works fine.&lt;br /&gt;I really only needed one individual head rather than the three but now I have spares.&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that the original shaver came with a protective cover that snapped onto the three heads.&lt;br /&gt;This no longer can be used.</li>
            <li> works, and it fit but I would not buy again.  It would be just as cheap to buy a new razor.  In fact, I did.  3 stars &#x3D; it&#x27;s ok and it is.</li>
            <li> This works good for a replacement head. I thought my old shaver head was getting dull, and it was, but this didn&#x27;t seem to be as big of an improvement moving from a 4 year old shaver head to the replacement. I was expecting a closer shave but it was just ok. No defects just had a little to high of expectations.</li>
            <li> Began to rust and scrape in about 2 months, cleaned with recommended spray and used oil. Still rusted, can&#x27;t believe I paid money for this.</li>
            <li> IT S NOT  LIKE  THE ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> I need it because i lost one of the heads, But the price almost the same as a new shaver...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed new blades until I got them. My previous razor head broke off at the attachment. It&#x27;s a decision whether to pay $22 for new blades or $34 for a new razor, but my razor wasn&#x27;t broken otherwise, so I stuck with just the blades. I think Remington makes a fine product, I usually go about 2 years between changing blades. After this last change I plan to change at least every 6 months. It&#x27;s a much closer shave. The previous blades were basically grinding my hair down with a little stubble left. These are actually trimming them flush with my face. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair though so that may be the cause of the longevity.</li>
            <li> It Is very good and give you a really close shave I would recommend to others if I have problem I will defenity buy another one.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted. It arrived on time. Great that I could order and not try to hunt for it I the stores.</li>
            <li> My shaver is like new now. Should have done this much sooner. My face is Smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li> these were awful!! Were very dull!!</li>
            <li> This fit the razor my husband has had for years.  Great product at a reasonable price and lasts for about a year.</li>
            <li> As advertised. good product. will last as long as the heads are constantly cleaned.  Will recommend this item to others</li>
            <li> This replacement blade set works great and is easy to install.  A lot easier than just getting the blades like other models.  I will order another in 6 months.</li>
            <li> Blades do no rotate as rapidly as original shaver head and tends to run hot after shaving for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Got these to replace old dull heads.  Work just as good as ones that came on the previous razor head.</li>
            <li> Kinda like having a new shaver all over again.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the original.  The original is okay, just wanted to try the replacement, just in case it wasn&#x27;t okay.</li>
            <li> works great and is sure cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a closer shave than I was getting after three years using the original.  It&#x27;s a hardly noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> fit perfectly-- no problems</li>
            <li> Easy to install. Works great. It&#x27;s also way cheaper here than in stores. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> bought this for my grandsons shaver he is happy with it he says it is just like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as expected</li>
            <li> Have ordered these before. Work every time.</li>
            <li> Works great,  I purchased because the blade assembly broke. I didn&#x27;t know how dull the old blades were, but now shaving is easier and quicker!</li>
            <li> Works fine. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product works well for me. Price is very good. When you need a new shaver head can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> perfect replacement and gives me a great shave.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about spending a lot of money to replace the head but I believe now it was worth it. I thi k it works better,shaves better than it did brand new.</li>
            <li> Both were the same  Titanium so the same goes what more can I say except that I love them both</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do, good quality, clean shave. Price isn&#x27;t too bad either considering most of the stores near me don&#x27;t carry this anymore for some reason.</li>
            <li> Popped right in, but doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the original when new. Saved quite a bit over the product specific ones though.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;D RECIVED ON TIME AND PERFECT CONDICIONS THANKS A LOT AND GOOD PRICE AND BETTER CUALITY AND I START TO USE IT....</li>
            <li> Works better than ever. Will replace blades every 6 months for now on.</li>
            <li> This product was a perfect fit to the Remmington shaver and was super nice change to my dull shaver.</li>
            <li> caused my shaver to run at half speed. head got hot</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little noisier than the original part</li>
            <li> got the order promptly, fortunately it fit my husbands razor and works great!&lt;br /&gt;gave it a 5 star rating because it works well and I finally remembered to order for&lt;br /&gt;him!!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT  !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DEAR VENDOR&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT  GIFT  FOR  EVERYONE.  VERY INTERESTING AND COLORFUL&lt;br /&gt;GREAT DEALER FAST AND  TO THE POINT ON DEALS. WOULD  BUY AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;FROM THIS DEA;ERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT  GIFT  FOR  EVERYONE.  VERY INTERESTING AND COLORFUL&lt;br /&gt;GREAT DEALER FAST AND  TO THE POINT ON DEALS. WOULD  BUY AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;FROM THIS DEA;ERS.</li>
            <li> Shaver will run with new head, but pulls whiskers (very painful). Was touted to work with my R-3150. No way.</li>
            <li> Worked great to replace the shaver head.</li>
            <li> Product came as described. Fits my Remington R-5150. However, blades don&#x27;t seem to be very sharp. It doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than my old one that was over one year old.</li>
            <li> It fit right in to the model that I have. It&#x27;s sharp, and everything I expected it to be since it&#x27;s a Remington.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time. it was exactly as described and well packaged. it works like a new razor now. had tried one before just to see&lt;br /&gt;if they would work ok. did so I just got 3 more. also price is great compared to regular stores.&lt;br /&gt;thanks amazon and Remington.</li>
            <li> This shaver head has worked great, far better than I expected. My only complaint is the instructions that come with it are sparse, but most people can figure out how to remove the old shaver head and install this one. Excellent price and quality compared to buying it in a retail store.</li>
            <li> Great replacement head.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed to make the shaver work as good as new. Would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have owned two Remington R7130 shavers. Both of the original blade sets lasted a year or better. All replacement sets I have bought have needed replacing after 4-6 months MAXIMUM.</li>
            <li> Not so good. I probably will go for the higher priced replacement next time. The blades keep coming apart when you clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> Best way to go. Why buy blades, often at a higher price when you can buy the whole assembly. Takes literally three seconds to swap.</li>
            <li> No problems with the product or service makes the experience uneventful</li>
            <li> There was no problems with the replacement.</li>
            <li> This product does not work with the Remington AQ7 shaver.  The head fits on the shaver as it should; however, the latch mechanism will not work and will not secure the head to the shaver body.  The design is clearly different than the original I&#x27;m replacing.  The original latch is longer than this &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the new blades from the assembly and replaced the three old blades, but that seems a lot to pay when I&#x27;m throwing away most of the parts in the package.</li>
            <li> It is the part exactly as advertised. I had to buy it through Amazon because Remington (at least at the time of writing this) does not ship to Post Office (PO) boxes. But everything is exactly as it should be; even an updated design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to replace the heads, especially as compared to the old method of replacing each blade separately. Pop the old one off, clip the new one on. It&#x27;s that easy.The blades last me about 100 shaves, (every other day) which isn&#x27;t as long as I would like. My whiskers start getting pulled about halfway along. To be fair to the shaver, I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to except a blade</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Dad and he&#x27;s very happy and can now shave without effort.</li>
            <li> I looked all over the product information to make sure this replacement would fit my husband&#x27;s electric and I couldn&#x27;t find any restrictions or specific models it fit so I purchased it on good faith since it claims to be &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34;. Unfortunately it does not fit (the specs on it were on the box it came in and not online) and now we&#x27;re stuck with a $30 replacement head we can&#x27;t do anything with. I&#x27;m sure the product probably works just fine if the replacement actually fits on the shaver but when they say &amp;#34;Universal&amp;#34; they don&#x27;t mean it.</li>
            <li> Nice cutting; very sharp. Took a while to figure out how to clean the individual blades. Terrible or non existent instructions with it. It is very different from the original head on the razor I bought.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the piece it was replacing but it seems to be working fine. Still cheaper and easier than buying a whole new razor</li>
            <li> Was not a fit for my razor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and have been using the same Remington shaver for four years. I was very satisfied with the results. I bought this rotary replacement, apparently made by Remington. It pulls the hairs out of my face one by one in a very painful way. BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my original shaving head.Seams to slow my shaver down</li>
            <li> This replacement head was a gift to my friend and we were surprised that the shave head was loose with pieces not directly attached as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does provide the same good, close shave as the original head. I only wish that the pieces were held together more securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a bit of a challenge if you don&#x27;t keep your eyes on all the components.</li>
            <li> Husband happy to have shaver working again.</li>
            <li> Was just what we were hoping it would be.  We were unsure from the description whether it would work or not, but it did.  Easy to replace the old one with this.  There is hope that not all things have to be less expensive to replace in full and just replacing what is needed</li>
            <li> Very easy to exhange your old head for a new one. I shave my head and face with my Remington razor so I need replacement heads every six months. It is well worth the price to have a close shave everyday. I&#x27;m pleased with this product. The price is the same as Walmart but they don&#x27;t always stock it. Too bad I had to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> This new shaver head model is much better than the previous version.  I, too, shave my face and head and didn&#x27;t like the Remington I had since razor dust fell all over me and the heads would pop off.  This shaver head is more similar to the Norelco models where you remove the shavers from the inside and not the outside.  Also, there is much less razor dust with this model.  I&#x27;m thrilled Remington improved their design and now I don&#x27;t have to dislike my razor any more.</li>
            <li> I recieved this replacement shaver head for my razor . I can notbe happer if I had bought a new razor. The unit was good and the old head left a lot to be desired for a close shave, this replacement head did the trick and is great</li>
            <li> excelent product fit at once and works as the original used to it. no more to say  good bye folks</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for exactly that product and was beginning to think of buying another electric razor.. and a friend of mine said &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;... lo and behold, there it was and it  was like Christmas morning.... thanks.</li>
            <li> I made sure as suggested in previous reviews that the replacement head I needed was for my razor.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived promptly , I popped off the old one put on this replacement and had a new razor.......easy .....nuff said !</li>
            <li> extended the life of the razor</li>
            <li> Could not find these in stores. I think they are priced a little high. they work well</li>
            <li> I should have posted this much sooner than today but just never thought about it or did not have the time.&lt;br /&gt;Even though this was new and sealed in box, it felt like it was extremely used from the beginning. Yes. razor was fully charged for maximum performance. Lots of pulling or snagging on whiskers instead of a crisp clean cutting. Very disappointed with Remington for allowing something this bad to get passed quality control.</li>
            <li> It is no better or worse than any other replacement blades I have had, the selling point is the price.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.  Well satisfied.</li>
            <li> perfect replacement A+ will buy from anytime thanks.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Definite improvement over the original which I used WAY too long</li>
            <li> i think this is a great electric razor. i replace the blade once/year. since the blade wears slowly over time, i don&#x27;t notice too much until i put the new one in - and then wish i replaced it a few months earlier!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. I don&#x27;t have to search the stores for these any more</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement head for my Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this not too long ago and based on the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I looked up the part on Amazon and it was the right one. So I ordered it and it works fine. Except, the design twists out too easily to remove the blades. Sometimes if I touch it the wrong way, it will twist out and the blades fall out into the sink. Luckily I haven&#x27;t lost anything to date, though, so I Love It and gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Now when I shave, it&#x27;s smooth again.  Old blade was over a year old and instead of buying a new shaver, getting this head saved time and money.  Very easy to install, mich easier than changing individual blades.  Received them very fast.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> The Rotary Razor replacements were priced right, arrived earlier than promised and work well.</li>
            <li> Did not receive right product.</li>
            <li> I replace my shaver head once per year.  Nothing exciting about this.  It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Easy to install,  great value and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> WORKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY USED HEAD THAT I GET BLADE CLOSENESS SHAVES WITH NO SCRAPES OR BURNS!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to be just like the factory original. Works great.</li>
            <li> Worth getting the replacements since this is a good shaver. Better than buying a whole new shaver since they are pretty costly! This is the second time we&#x27;ve bought replacements and have had good luck.</li>
            <li> I order these regularly.  This set works better than the ones with the heads without a groove to me.</li>
            <li> Great fit, just like original. this has two blade rings in each head, watch out for others that only have one ring.</li>
            <li> this replacement does not mimic the old one it replaces.&lt;br /&gt;there are a few differences mentioned by other posters.&lt;br /&gt;first noticeable one is that the individual razor disks cannot be separately taken out from the top of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;it has to be flipped open to remove the disks from the underside.&lt;br /&gt;once reaching the underside, there is a carriage that needs to be turned counterclockwise to \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the carriage and free each individual razor disk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a complete head unit replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;warning: never shake the head unit while still connected to the base.  the hinge is fragile and i broke one of mine.  simply pull the head unit free before shaking the trimmings.</li>
            <li> Just like the original</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last more than 4 months.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Thanks! Would buy from again!</li>
            <li> Fair enough !&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
            <li> It was the exact replacement for the shaver and works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction.  The item was as described and arrived on time.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> It met all my needs, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> the replacement head was easy to replace and it works very well as expectedit is so much easier than just replacing the blades I would do this again.</li>
            <li> This shaver head is excellent. And fits perfect no problems. It&#x27;s worth buying for.......i highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have used electric razors manufactured by Remington, Braun, and Norelco. I have owned a [[ASIN:B001DEV2OU Remington R-7130]] electric razor since the end of 2008.  I have found that the R-7130 gives me a close uniform shave which is the equal of the best that I have had. It also does this in about half the time of that of my previous razor, a rotary by Norelco of similar design. So, I can get to work a few minutes earlier, or maybe better, sleep a few minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that time, this is only the second time that I have had to replace the cutting heads.  That means that they have lasted about two years for me, although I have to admit that they were getting really run-down in the past month. Now Remington has simplified the design for the replacement heads.  The new heads go in from the backside, when the razor is opened.  They work just as well as the old type.  My only complaint is that the plastic protective top no longer fits on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total cost over the life of an electric razor must include that of replacement cutting heads. At under $25, these replacements are equal to or lower than the prices of replacement heads for other razors. The instruction booklet suggested replacing the heads every twelve months. I have used the old ones for twice that time. It remains to be seen how long this new model lasts, but so far I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement for my Father in Law and he says it works great! Would order this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement product for my razor&#x27;s rotary heads!  Work great!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Falls apart when trying to clean.</li>
            <li> Better than the original, a closer, smoother, shave.</li>
            <li> Durable and provides a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Works like it should.  It re-vitalized the old unit.  Just slipped off the old unit and slipped this one on.</li>
            <li> Works great, but the life isn&#x27;t near what I expected it would be. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for more than a couple months as it will cause hairs to be pulled out instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> its like my husband has a new razor now. Very simple to put on and use. would recommend it . price wise it was cheaper than box store.</li>
            <li> fits good and does a great job! thanks! ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;  ;</li>
            <li> these are better than the original blades. Does a great job almost as good as a blade and a great price</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product is what I ordered &amp; it met my expectations.It arrived undamaged. Good buy!</li>
            <li> The fact that the shaving heads are washable makes it easy to clean them. They snap out easily and are replaceable.</li>
            <li> Purchased on Amazon since I couldn&#x27;t find any locally. Arrived quickly and performs well in my razor. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect replacement for my razor.  The shaver head fit perfectly and functions as well as the original</li>
            <li> New design then what I had on my razor originally but it swapped out perfectly. Been using it for a few months now and works great.</li>
            <li> These cutters were noisey</li>
            <li> good to change every six months</li>
            <li> I could not find any replacement Remington parts in my local bog box stores and did not want to spend the money on a new razor while my old one charged and worked perfectly fine. It is a Remington product so it is of high quality and I could tell the difference in cutting my hair immediately. It works greats and was a direct replacement so there was no fooling around, just used the tab to push the new head and blades into the razor and a cleaner cut I now have.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original blades Pulls on your beard if you let it get too long.</li>
            <li> Remington Replacement head works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replace the blades or the head on my electric razor once per year, as I use the electric to shave daily during the week. This replacement head fit perfect. The old one snaps off, and in literally 30 seconds, you have the new head installed. This head fit perfect on my razor. It now shaves like new again. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Nice not having hairs pulled out my face.</li>
            <li> I waited way to long to replace this like many other people mentioned. I wish I had ordered this earlier, it was simple to put in and works great. Less money than the ones at Target.</li>
            <li> fits the old razor and is being as it is all one unit, is easier to clean that the old head.</li>
            <li> No issues with product.</li>
            <li> Reming Sprcdn Universal Rotary Replacement Shaver Heads are supposed to last a few weeks but the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the last twelve months get dull very quickly.</li>
            <li> Fits my Remington I nicely.  If it looks like it fits, it probably does  (I rolled the dice on this, myself).  The last head lasted about a year of daily use.</li>
            <li> Greetings, This new style head is a big improvement from the original. It is designed so that the individual floating heads can&#x27;t detach. Perfect for my R5130. And I got a better than ever shave from the start. Installs in seconds not minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to take apart for cleaning, since it can be disassemble from the bottom, rather than the top like the original.</li>
            <li> much better operformance of razor with new blades</li>
            <li> Replacement shaver head arrived right away and is working like a new razor.  It is cheaper to replace the blades than buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Everything was correct and product cam on or before projected dat. I will use again. Thank you</li>
            <li> great price, quick shipment</li>
            <li> I never know this replacement kit exist! I have been using my R-4100 for over 2 years and kept bearing the nuisance of shaver cutters popping out. I agree with most reviewers that it is a good fix to a fundamentally bad design. I can forget about buying a new shaver for now. A word of caution: I was fooled by the pictures on the instructions, thinking that I have remove the triangular cutter carrier before installing the whole assembly on to my shaver. Then I realized that those steps are for cleaning the shavings. Perhaps I&#x27;m the only dummy around. %) All you have to do is to pop out the old shaver head, then snap on the new one. Done in 10 sec or less! It fits perfectly with my R-4100.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the price (least expensive replacement I could find). Note: This is an aftermarket replacement. It fit fine and works fine.</li>
            <li> they just didn&#x27;t seem to be very sharp almost seems like the old ones were cutting better.oh well what can we do</li>
            <li> It took about three seconds to change the unit on my razor. In the &amp;#34;old days,&amp;#34; you had to insert the rotors one-by-one.  This is the best price I&#x27;ve found on the unit.  Assuming you don&#x27;t need a new charging stand, it beats the of buying a new razor by ~$20.</li>
            <li> Even better then the original blades on the shaver</li>
            <li> I got a replacement head long before I should have needed one after using my Remington razor for three months because the old one started pulling a lot hairs which hurt. The new one wasn&#x27;t as good as the old one as it pulled hairs even worse. It also didn&#x27;t catch very well so it kept popping open. Switched to Norelco razor as a result of this purchase. I found that the Remington razor is better if you have a heavy beard and Norelco is better if you want to shave really close so now I use both.</li>
            <li> Good, just like the original.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, decent life.</li>
            <li> It fit. It works well. It&#x27;s pretty quiet like the old one. Piece of cake. Five more words are required.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement head for my Remington Electric razor.  This fit the bill.  It works just as good as the original one it came with (as I am sure its the same one).</li>
            <li> Very strange... Blades pull hair very slightly. Blades seem just as sharp as other refill packs I have bought though. I am somewhat satisfied. Amazon carries +1, Big box store no longer carries. It works well all-in-all so I still give it three stars for that. Sick as it might seem I think I am getting a closer shave because of the &amp;#34;slight&amp;#34; hair-pull effect. Amazon delivered via prime in two-days.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Remington SPR replacement heads as I have two shaver models:  R5150 and PR1260.&lt;br /&gt;The SPR works fine for both models, even though it is not listed as a replacement for the PR1260 head.  It is better quality than the original head on the PR1260.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up on my shaver because it was cutting slowly and made my face sore, but decided to try a new shaver head. Now the shaver works better than when it was new! Cuts pretty close, without pulling. Also much faster than with the worn heads.</li>
            <li> Works great, exactly what my guy wanted and needed.  He has had it a couple of months now and it still works great</li>
            <li> WORKS AS  EXPECTED --MATCHES PERFECTLY INSTALLS EASILY AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD EXPECT.(THIS COMPLETES THE WORDING REQUIRED FOR THIS REVIEW)</li>
            <li> The item works for my razor model, It&#x27;s  smooth and close shaving&lt;br /&gt;and easy to clean , can be rinsed with tap water. .</li>
            <li> They are working good.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly on my Remington.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric razor for four years.  It does a good job as long as the heads are replaced every few months.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as advertized.</li>
            <li> nothing beats a new blade. smooth shaving</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement shaver head, I actually like the replacement head better than the original head. It fit perfectly, fast delivery and no other issue to report. Thank You</li>
            <li> The heads seem to pinch a bit, next time I would try the Teflon coated heads...</li>
            <li> Very, very good. Really, a five-star product -- except that in shipping the head assembly shook loose and I had to put the pieces back together. Not a hard job, but a product should be able to be shipped without shaking apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement head cuts perfectly. I will buy it again when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my razor but it did not stay sharp for very long but that might be my beard.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I like my corded razor, but the blades wore out.  This replacement head was crazy easy to install and wow, I forgot what it was like to shave with sharp heads.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This product performed as expected. I have used these products before and have been very happy. Will continue to replace with these blades when needed.</li>
            <li> New head came within 3 days, switched head in 5 seconds,  I&#x27;ll buy another one every 2 yrs. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good replacement head, lasts about 1-3 months depending on use.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement after realizing these heads don&#x27;t last forever.  It works great and the only thing I can complain about is it doesn&#x27;t look the same as the original.  I understand that these are somewhat universal and in the end, it still does the job.  Maybe the shave isn&#x27;t quite what it was when I first bought it but it still is excellent.</li>
            <li> The heads on my razor croaked.  I didn&#x27;t want to replace it and pay big bucks.  The replacement heads are reasonable in price and work great.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shaver head,  was easy to replace, does the job very well. Was glad that I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> made my shave like new</li>
            <li> I thought the replacement blades would install as original but they didn&#x27;t, blades fall out when I open the shaver head to clean. The original did not fall out. The blades do work fine when shaving the problem is when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk. I received the blades quickly and they are the right size.&lt;br /&gt;The price was better than what I was able to get ordering direct from the manufacturer .</li>
            <li> As usual, by the time I needed to replace my razor&#x27;s blades, a new razor costs only a few dollars more. I do not know about the rest of you but I same tired of the big brand razor companies and their predatory schemes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, many people do not know this but the big brand manual razors are actually good for many shaves. What the makers do is intentionally use metal that corrodes quickly from being wet. Just rise thoroughly, dry with towel &amp; set it so the moisture till drain off and you can get several weeks of good use from each &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Wish I bought a whole new razor!</li>
            <li> I bought my replacement shield about 5 months ago and am shopping for another - its getting dull and not working as well as it was (meaning not-so-close shaves)... So I&#x27;m buying again but hoping that it&#x27;ll last longer!!!</li>
            <li> Fits and worked great</li>
            <li> I purchased the panasonic shaver and on my wife&#x27;s recommendation, I got this replacement head for my old remington. It works just like my old one and fit the old shaver perfectly. Wish I had just gotton this instead of the panasonic. The panasonic is going to be used in my travel bag and this will be my everyday shaver. It gets my 2 days growth of longer hairs like I am used to. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement head after my cat knocked the shaver onto the floor one too many times and broke the attaching pieces. Fit the shaver perfectly. I did end up with a little bit of razor burn, but I attribute this to not having been able to use the shaver for quite some time and needing to readjust after using a razor.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, good price. Was a little hard for my dad changing out the replacement but he finally go it!</li>
            <li> product as described shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Works and fits as described. No issues. Don&#x27;t feel as though they are as good as the original blades but they work well enough. Beats buying a whole new razor every 6 months or so..</li>
            <li> This order came in super fast, and this replacement head is super easy and quick to change. Works great, I usually get a few months out of it.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace, but no instructions included. Worked fine and greatly improve my shaving results. Closer shaves. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> What can you really say about electric shaver heads? It works. My man was happy. He said it took less than a minute to shave and it took him 10mins with the old ones.</li>
            <li> Needed two replacement heads. They are working well. Got a decent price for them and will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> no paper work came with the item,so unable to return,I don&#x27;t understand I gave you all the numbers on the unit</li>
            <li> not a bad replacement head, but it was almost the same price as buying a whole new razor. Also this one pulls hair once in a while, not a lot, but still unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Was easy to snap on and replace.  Much less expensive than replacing entire razor!  Most people don&#x27;t realize thee wear out anyway and then don&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li> Wrong heads for our old Remington Shaver.</li>
            <li> OK product;  nothing to get excited about!!  It does the job it was designed for!!</li>
            <li> It great. You forget how awesome brand new blades can be when it cuts down your shaving time by half. :)</li>
            <li> It fits well but running slower than the original</li>
            <li> went on with a snap! no wasted time.</li>
            <li> fit perfectly and has been working fantastic. good quaility</li>
            <li> Have to say that there was a vast difference in closeness compared to the old head and it was very easy to install.  Took much longer to get it out of the plastic vault in which it was encased.  On the down side, it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut my beard as easily as the original head did when it was new. (ie. It tugs and pulls at my beard). Also, it seems to labor the motor much more than the original.  And yes, I tried recharging the razor.</li>
            <li> fit perfectly and getting many close shaves with this, had to replace broken clips on old head. using for 4 months now</li>
            <li> Best price I could find, works fine on my Remington R3130</li>
            <li> Perfect price and fit</li>
            <li> Great product has described, works just fine.</li>
            <li> Returned shaver to original performance. Only problem is original  head guard does not fit this replacement head and does not come with its own cover.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t cut well. Was much different then the old ones.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, you should just buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaving head works adequately with the Remington R-7130.  However, it does not shave well enough to replace a wet razor.  Perhaps I was optimistic in thinking it might replace a razor.  I still use it periodially for a quick touch-up or a lazy Saturday but pretty  much rely on the razor for everyday shaves.</li>
            <li> i needed to replace the head on my cordless shaver and these were at a great price and work perfect</li>
            <li> These shaver heads work</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but not great.</li>
            <li> The heads snapped right into place and I was off and shaving in 10 minutes.  The are giving me the shave I used to get.</li>
            <li> Good quality replacement.</li>
            <li> The original head for my shaver had individual blades that could be removed. This replacement does not but works just as well. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is not smooth on the skin as the original. It doesn&#x27;t feel sharp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son&#x27;s razor. I just asked him if it works, he says it does. He doesn&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li> Thanks to seller and amazon saved me cost of buying a new shaver. This went on with a snap and works great.</li>
            <li> Wow, wish I had replaced the blades a long time ago.  The razor is happier too, the battery lasts longer.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a good replacement for muy old Remington shaver machine. Note that maybe is better to get a new one instead of only the shaver head. They are other Remington shavers really nice and cheap.</li>
            <li> no problem installing on razor, and it sure was better than my old one!!&lt;br /&gt;wish the price was just a little less, I always wonder if I should buy a complete new razor.</li>
            <li> worked  great  in razor</li>
            <li> Fit perfect on my model device, runs smooth and no hair pulling (use another machine to reduce length b4 using if ure hair is too long, will pull ure hair if it&#x27;s too long)</li>
            <li> Worked as expected and a decent price, but a plus that I could find it on Amazon as Iit was getting more difficult to find at local stores. Good price.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than anywhere else!  I don&#x27;t use them but my husband is pleased with them :)</li>
            <li> Everything good with this order - prompt delivery and product works great. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Makes major  difference like a new machine</li>
            <li> It works fine but when I was cleaning it it fell out of the razor, the blades did. It is not very secure so keep an eye on it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but was (and still am) quite pleased with this replacement shaver head - good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Got these newbies for my old razor and yelped as tiny hairs got ripped out of my face. So I switched to another brand, straight cutters, three rows, and now my facial skin is like a lustrous field of swaying dandelions on a spring morning, or some other analogy that might make you think of soft.</li>
            <li> very low grade material.  blades dull.  boggs down my shaver power</li>
            <li> Glad I found this.  I wish my razor was better labeled so I could be sure that it would work.  My Remington electric shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  Better than the more popular brand.</li>
            <li> Easy to attach. Easy to clean. Cuts great. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> my old one wore out and you get used to how it feels when I put this in you could feel the diffrence - modified style so easier to disassemble for cleaning - only bad thing is original cap does not fit this head and they didn&#x27;t include and new one.</li>
            <li> On time, fit well.  Satisfied.</li>
    </ol>
