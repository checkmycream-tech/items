            <li>Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>love this mascara!!</li>
            <li>Just love it!!</li>
            <li>It does add very nice length but zero volume.</li>
            <li>To remove, cup some very warm water in your hand over your eye.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing price!</li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you leave a minute or two in between the undercoat and mascara for best legnthening results.  </li>
            <li>Love, LOVE!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I read the instructions and tried to remove it in the shower - loads of soap and warm water in there!</li>
            <li>i successfully apply it to both eyes in just a couple minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the most awesome mascara I ever used!</li>
            <li>If you could find a good bottle it would be great</li>
            <li>This mascara, while a bit more time-consuming to apply, is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Of the many I&#x27;ve tried, it is the best.</li>
            <li>you should own this product!</li>
            <li>Really good product, apples very nicely, it won&#x27;t length you lashes dramatically</li>
            <li>For this product, the best idea of it is really easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>Been a faithful customer for 3 years and the Best mascara I have ever used; doesn&#x27;t smear and easy removal.</li>
            <li>it was on it looked good, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that there was any &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Seems to work good even though I don&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li>Loreal makes some really good mascaras.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I find one that looks good to start out, but it never lasts the day the way it started out.  </li>
            <li>I have heard good things about this mascara, but mine was already drying out when I opened it.  </li>
            <li>This is a mascara that I have been using for quite some time and with good results.  </li>
            <li>can apply this and it will stay on and look good for 2-3 days without reapplying.</li>
            <li>And this is just as good</li>
            <li>Nothing for us fair haired people...</li>
            <li>It is passable for daytime wear for a fair blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no idea why people are giving this mascara good reviews.</li>
            <li>The price is good.</li>
            <li>This is good mascara and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all.  </li>
            <li>It also looks great on and lasts nicely without flaking.</li>
            <li>the price is a good price.</li>
            <li>Now, L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued and I cannot find anything that was as good.</li>
            <li>Good waterproof-ness.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever change products: its that good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this has good reviews, but I bought it based on the rating</li>
            <li>It is not waterproof (which is good cause</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>The best mascara for me, as it just goes off while you&#x27;re having shower and no need to clean again after.</li>

            <li>Love Love Love it!!!  </li>
            <li>I love the shape of the tube, lol.</li>
            <li>I got so many complements from co-workers on how great my eyes looked.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find one product that delivers both length and volume but am very pleased with the results of this one.</li>
            <li>Lashes look great for many hours.</li>
            <li>Seeing the lashes float around the bathtub after isn&#x27;t always fun; but its by the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it looks great and you can take it all off with warm water and washcloth which helps a lot to avoid rubbing eyelids.</li>

            <li>My favorite mascara ever!  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S MAGIC!</li>
            <li>It was the first time I tried tubing mascara, and I was very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why others are experiencing issues with this mascara, however, I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara, EVER!</li>
            <li>Great cosmetic product and really easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it goes on easily and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Goes on great and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>I liked this better!</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t know better I&#x27;d think this L&#x27;Oreal product is pretty good, and the price is excellent.  </li>
            <li>The amazing thing was no marks or flakes came off on my fingers when I did</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and it makes my eyelashes look amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing results</li>
            <li>It does not come off until you take it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I have been asked what kind of mascara I use by ladies who have know me for some time.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of a pain to take off too.  </li>
            <li>I always liked this product.</li>
            <li>Just use a warm wash cloth</li>
            <li>The tubes slide off your lashes when warm water is applied and rinse off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes off nicely with warm water like plastic, leaving no residue on the face....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going by my own reflection in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bought this product in stores and liked it, so, I thought I would purchase it while Xmas shopping.  </li>
            <li>This is the absolute best mascara if you wear contact lenses!  </li>
            <li>mascara forms &#x27;tubes&#x27; around your eyelashes when you apply, which helps give it a nice voluminous look.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s kind of remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ive</li>
            <li>ive even made my own before.  </li>
            <li>no longer need a pin handy to separate</li>
            <li>no longer need a pin handy to separate</li>
            <li>Also, soak warm water on your eyes for 5 seconds or so before trying to remove it.</li>
            <li>When I took it off I washed my face with warm water, as I do every night.</li>
            <li>(just wash off with warm water).</li>
            <li>This has encouraged me to look into making my own.</li>
            <li>what kind of mascara I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It adds a bit too much length for my tastes, but would be perfect for someone with shorter lashes.  </li>
            <li>I just use warm water on my fingertips and rub my eyelashes--this will come off in what looks like fibrous clumps, leaving no residue on your lashes.</li>
            <li>Nice thickening and lengthening of the lashes.</li>
            <li>Nice concept, Loreal, but this one doesn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li>This mascara comes off with just some warm water.  </li>
            <li>I also liked how it made my lashed pop.  </li>
            <li>Although I can get some length with this mascara, the texture of my lashes becomes kind of rubbery</li>
            <li>Yet, it looks nice on the eyes.</li>
            <li>I always use this type of mascara, with the building block then the mascara, but had not used the tube like kind before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found splashing warm water</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really nice because it doesn&#x27;t clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wash them off with warm water before bed.</li>
            <li>It comes off with warm soap and water too.</li>
            <li>Honestly I dont like how it works</li>
            <li>so I have never been able to find the right mascara that worked perfectly for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE ITT!!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite for YEARS!!!  </li>

            <li>When I first used it, my lashes were incredibly clumpy and then at night I would scrub and scrub with eye makeup remover to try to get it off.</li>

            <li>I love that it comes off in tubes with just warm water.</li>
            <li>This may be the best solution I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>most amazing part was taking it off at night.</li>
            <li>What I mainly love about this is that it gives a kind of \\&quot;curl\\&quot; to my lashes, without using a lash-curler.</li>
            <li>It makes them flare up at the top and it looks really nice.</li>
            <li>I use my own favorite mascara instead of the mascara in this product.</li>
            <li>Did I mention this was amazing stuff?  :)</li>
            <li>The most amazing mascara I have ever used</li>
            <li>I would have liked more volume but this is by FAR the best mascara I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I discovered it and even more happy that it&#x27;s available through the subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>best feature is when you remove it there is no mess.</li>
            <li>So easy to remove too!</li>
            <li>It washes off easily too!</li>
            <li>Its so easy!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easily it comes off -- no eye makeup remover needed!</li>
            <li>It comes off easily when washing my face or with a baby wipe!</li>
            <li>Easy as pie !</li>
            <li>Another great thing is that it is super easy to remove--just warm water and soap.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this mascara!</li>
            <li>This is a very good mascara remover, just dampen with warm water in your shower time, so I like it very much, but the most important is that it does not have sweat when blooming.</li>
            <li>I used it for about 6  months &amp;  liked it,  but was so happy to find this one from L&#x27;Oreal much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect for a more natural, yet noticeably improved look for us post-menopausal ladies.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It was also too good to be true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a pretty good job of giving definition and length but not the best I&#x27;ve used like some of the new ones.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite mascara because it comes off so easily without smudging!</li>
            <li>This mascara looks amazing and goes on easily</li>
            <li>Warm water takes off the lashes easily - comes off as rubbery tubes.  </li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t clump together easily which is nice.</li>
            <li>Comes off easily with warm water</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smear or run, and comes off easily at the end of the day with warm water.</li>
            <li>Also, it washes out easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>It was a very popular product and was a hot seller.</li>
            <li>I love that the lashes wash away at the end of the day with just water</li>
            <li>this is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I need volume as my lashes are getting more sparse with age.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara and it helps my eyelashes look thicker.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to buy more L&#x27;Oreal products from now on.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t need to use makeup remover with this.</li>
            <li>Also, I love not having to use or buy eye make up remover.  </li>
            <li>If you try to do more than one coat it will clump so you have to get used to the tubes technology.  </li>
            <li>I love that</li>
            <li>I love that this mascara doesn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>was given a tube at an event in 2009 and I haven&#x27;t found anything better since.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite aspect of this mascara is the removal.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY mascaras, Meral Nomram, Aveda, Mary Kay, Beauty control, Lanicome, Estee Lauder</li>
            <li>I love the beauty tubes because I don&#x27;t have to use a remover.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if darker and brush wasn&#x27;t so huge.</li>
            <li>look 300% better.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not an employee or whatever, I just really love this product</li>
            <li>- Hope this helps :)&lt;</li>
            <li>On me, this lengthens my lashes probably 50% more.</li>
            <li>But it takes more time.  </li>
            <li>Needs to be replaced for sure after&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Now that I have used it a couple times, it am not so sure.  </li>
            <li>I have tried more mascaras than I can count and they have always smudged under my eyes not even 2 hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>Fattens my lashes which matters more than length, but it also improves the length.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I love the way this mascara comes off.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge and at the end of the day I just lay a warm washcloth lightly on the eye for 30 seconds</li>
            <li>I love it and will repurchase it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love the auto send option.  </li>
            <li>This one costs more doesn&#x27;t work as well as Telescopic which I love.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>My favorite aspect - no raccoon eyes as the day wears on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this has such good ratings?!?!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and hope Loreal never takes off the market, please......</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend Tubes Mascara is the best!</li>
            <li>My friend introduced it to me because most of mascaras smear on my lower eyelid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love, love love it.</li>
            <li>Then the mascara on top just emphasizes the clumping.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many mascara sand</li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t more people know about this miracle?</li>
            <li>Buy unless you want to be lashes free in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li>Interesting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It acted more like waterproof mascara for me and did not appear to be lengthening.</li>
            <li>But I do like a bit more length if I can get it.</li>
            <li>I simply love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for daily wear.  </li>
            <li>I also love how I don&#x27;t have to use makeup remover to remove the mascara because water will do the job.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal mascaras</li>
            <li>I love the way that it does not smudge.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite go-to mascaras because it has everything I need, all in one.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>While looking up contact safe mascara, I came across &amp;</li>
            <li>the reviews I read said contact safe (not all tube mascaras are.).</li>
            <li>I love the fact that when you was off you makeup, the pieces of fiber come off.</li>
            <li>I have no idea HOW they do it, but it creates more and longer lashes.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>ok so in terms of color, i give this mascara credit.</li>
            <li>I like Elf&#x27;s $3 mascara primer much better.</li>
            <li>The mascara side is just okay.</li>
            <li>There are much better options out there</li>
            <li>but all in all, it&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li>its all about which one is better for you-</li>
            <li>, so,  be sure to comb and curl your lashes to get them all untangled-</li>
            <li>sure this is not recommended by the manufacturer but this mascara DOES NOT BUDGE</li>
            <li>that is such an awesome thing to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure this is not recommended by the manufacturer but this mascara DOES NOT BUDGE</li>
            <li>that is such an awesome thing to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I must say, I like this even better.</li>
            <li>Stays on all day - love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it tubes because I don&#x27;t need to use eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using more of it</li>
            <li>Love this mascara</li>
            <li>It looked fabulous!</li>

            <li>I love it, and was you know</li>
            <li>i wood bought more.</li>
            <li>I guess we can&#x27;t always get what we want :) I still love using it in conjunction with another mascara for volume.</li>
            <li>Oh my gawd, this is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I still love the concept and may try another brand</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d better pay up!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>When you remove it, it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as most mascaras do.</li>
            <li>This is better than many mascaras I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Always looking for a better mascara and this one isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>

            <li>My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a difference using this product and it feels better on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I love the primer and mascara though.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s CHEAP!  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I can&#x27;t even use this stuff as back-up mascara when I am out of my favorite,</li>
            <li>A great product and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>tried it a couple of times to be sure it was the product, it was.</li>
            <li>When I put another type over the top, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>I could not tell a difference, except the price for this one is way better.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the beauty tubes...</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It wears most of the day.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand of mascara.</li>
            <li>Love the primer part of this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love the waterproof version of this</li>
            <li>I love how it removes in chunks and does not bleed at all.</li>
            <li>Made my eyelashes way longer than most mascaras do.</li>
            <li>love the mascara</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:) :)</li>
            <li>so when i started using more force, yes it started coming off</li>
            <li>WHICH I DON&#x27;T HAVE MANY TO BEGIN WITH</li>
            <li>Just okay.  </li>
            <li>Think that there are better mascaras out there for the price.</li>
            <li>I have used Loreal Double Extend for years and it was an excellent product before they decided to change it.</li>
            <li>I use this every day and don&#x27;t mind the extra time since my lashes are greatly improved!</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t irritate and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>ok, swipe, swipe, swipe again.  </li>
            <li>Let me swipe some more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was more waterproof</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a try, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different mascaras, but I like this one the best because it DOES NOT SMUDGE.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>I can feel the tubes loosen and come off, then splash more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;oreal cosmetics.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product for mascara.</li>
            <li>and I made sure to stock up on this as I will not be using another mascara ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Not waterproof, but I love the two step.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Depending on the position I sleep, I can sometimes go three days without redoing it or touching it up, no</li>
            <li>If you compare prices and is the best, there is no hold back to it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t fallen in love just yet, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li>I love the tube mascara formulation; it stays put until you soak your eyes in warm water, then it comes off cleanly, without the use of a makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>So easy to put on and removes nice and easy with water and washcloth.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, looks nice, and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the best mascara in the world, and will hopefully continue to be made until the end of all things.  </li>
            <li>I rarely used both ends, but I loved how easily this mascara just peeled off in the shower.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t run at all - very clean.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, it loved it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend a good eye makeup remover to take it off though, this stuff really lasts!</li>
            <li>My lashes are blonde-tipped and on the shorter side, so the extension and volume this gives my lashes is significant!</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this item is how easily removed it is.  </li>
            <li>This is super amazing so listen up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is super amazing so listen up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to put on both top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>The single best thing about this mascara is the way it comes off.</li>
            <li>very good mascara for daily use.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and is very easy to remove - all you need is warm water and it will just wash away if you gently wipe it off your eyes.</li>
            <li>the day I kept touching and lightly tugging on my lashes.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes our faces look there best when were soaking wet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;also- GREAT for sensitive eyes and contact wearers (like me).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal, Blinc, DHC, Cargo, and Trish McEvoy, all with great results.</li>
            <li>Warm water and a washcloth is all you need at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the buy and permanent change in mascara choice.  </li>
            <li>Washing it off it actually kind of fun.</li>
            <li>Come right off with warm water and face wash and leaves no staining.</li>
            <li>It just takes warm water in the shower and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>I wrote this review to help other people looking for THE BEST mascara that you can count on.</li>
            <li>I finally did and have to say that it is a really good product!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s actually true!</li>
            <li>Perfect for touch ups if you make a mess--dab any spot with a wet cotton swab and voila!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and remove, &amp; I like the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get it all off at once.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look longer and removes easily.</li>
            <li>Easy off.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, comes off even easier with water.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily too...love it.</li>
            <li>Removes easily with water....  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply,  the lash primer works</li>
            <li>comes off easily with water.</li>
            <li>and it washes off so easily with just water.</li>
            <li>Comes off easily.</li>
            <li>and I can easily remover this product with my fingers.</li>
            <li>Easy to take off but doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li>I also like that I can remove it with water fairly easily.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily in a clump... no smudges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use even though 2 steps are required for application.</li>
            <li>Because it forms tubelike around eyelashes, removal is easy with the use of a make-up remover.</li>
            <li>to apply&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clump easily when used against directions (see below)&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>clean, mine clumped up into a (for lack of a better description) boogery texture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes off easy in the shower with soap.  </li>
            <li>So easy</li>
            <li>Taking it off is easy, I do it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and it comes off easily with water</li>
            <li>It forms tubes around my lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>So easy to remove too</li>
            <li>I guess the upside of that is that it&#x27;s easily removable,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to take off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>Come off easily when you want it to.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s extremely easy to take off in the shower</li>
            <li>Comes off easily in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Taking it off is really easy.</li>
            <li>, this makes your lashes longer and comes off easy-</li>
            <li>BUT it is sooooo easy to remove because of the Loreal Tubes.</li>
            <li>It also smeared really easily.</li>
            <li>What I like about it, is that when it comes time to take it off; it is so easy.</li>
            <li>this stays put and comes off easily with water.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, lasts all day, and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and just as easy to take off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also- while it does come off easily when you wash it off-</li>
            <li>Pros-feel like it&#x27;s conditioning my lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge, clump and comes off easily with water (hold a water soaked cotton wool pad on for 10-15 seconds then wipe away).&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply and so easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Average results at best.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything under the sun (from the drugstores) and have asked around to see what people use and this is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is fine.</li>
            <li>I have blonde, non-existent lashes and it gives me huge, beautiful lashes and my eyes</li>
            <li>and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>which if fine for daytime wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know a great coat of mascara can make all the difference, so I envy those of you with lovely long lashes.</li>
            <li>Product looked fine.</li>
            <li>This mascara is fine.</li>
            <li>This mascara has quickly become a permanent fixture to my makeup box!</li>
            <li>BECAUSE ITS&#x27; A PAIN IN THE BUTT TO REMOVE, AND IF YOU TRY TO DO IT QUICKLY, YOU GET CASUALTIES IN THE FORM OF YOUR PRECIOUS EYELASHES!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>Comes off easily with warm water and gentle agitation.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lashes super long and full, and simply gorgeous!!</li>
            <li>SO, I have to say that I am THRILLED that this mascara removes just as easily as my favored Clinique does, yet ships to my door free and costs less.</li>
            <li>product comes off very easily in the shower or just by washing your face with hot water.</li>
            <li>I am notorious for not removing my makeup at night, and my eyes look perfectly made up every morning, except my eyelashes are bent a little from sleeping on them.  </li>
            <li>BEST mascara if you don&#x27;t like the dark undereye panda look!</li>
            <li>BEST MASCARA HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t advertise this amazing aspect more clearly</li>
            <li>I have a huge problem with that.</li>
            <li>I use good old Maybelline Great Lash on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and does not smear throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It almost seems too cheap..</li>
            <li>Takes a bit more time to apply but worth it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have time for that, but the mascara on its own works really well.</li>
            <li>Rather then rub the lashes from side to side, the instructions say smooth the tubes away from lashes with your fingertips.</li>
            <li>Washes off clean and easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>it stays put, it comes off miraculously clean and easy, doesn&#x27;t flake and run into your eyes and on your face-</li>
            <li>then just wipe the tubes away gently, or lightly pinch and pull with your fingertips and wallah.  </li>
            <li>but it was cheap.</li>
            <li>what the white &amp;#34;under coat&amp;#34; does on this mascara, but the over effect is great.  </li>
            <li>Then you just use your fingers to slide off the tubes, and you are make up free.</li>
            <li>It did clean easily.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s important), and I even fell in a pool while wearing it</li>
            <li>Although it takes more time to prime and then apply the mascara side, I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>That surprised me, as the product appeared to maintain its structural integrity - what I got off of my lashes with a good bit of effort came off as casts of my lashes.</li>
            <li>so I switched to just good old olive or coconut</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m purchasing 2 more of these right now</li>
            <li>The mascara comes off super easy at the end of the day with water</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and is super easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to remove with my fingers in the shower, doesn&#x27;t leave smudges or give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- remove super easily.</li>
            <li>so, removing it is super easy.</li>
            <li>Came off very easy when I wanted, but stayed on the whole time</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>the perfect mascara especially if other mascaras leave you with raccoon eyes by midday</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara without knowing how it would help with making my lashes look great, but after using it, I already know that it does a good job with volume and making it longer, especially with the white tube..</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have reviewed an item, and this is after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the hot water, but even with that it still requires more scrubbing than I want to do on my eye area.</li>
            <li>not much length or volume going on there and have yet to find a mascara that supplies both beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original tube mascara - \\&quot;Kiss Me\\&quot; brand for years.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and my eyes look great.</li>
            <li>so I decided to go with this since it was significantly cheaper and</li>
            <li>This mascara does not do that at all, and my lashes look significantly longer.  </li>
            <li>I, like many others, was blessed with pretty eyes but cursed with the shortest, almost non-existent eyelashes</li>
            <li>I have this on Subscribe and Save now because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the product.</li>
            <li>and I was excited about that.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it will be the first drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve ever repurchased.</li>
            <li>to use, long-lasting, great price, easy to find in make-up bag, effective brushes, natural looking and easy to remove simply with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It gives really great length and volume, and although it makes my lashes stick together a little more than I would prefer, I still like the way it looks.</li>
            <li>This mascara was really good, and it made my lashes bold and they really stood out without looking like I had too much makeup on!</li>
            <li>I have always used the original double extend from Loreal and liked it, but thought this would be even better.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and live in a warm, humid area.</li>
            <li>If it gets touched by warm or hot water, it clumps and comes off in tubes - i.e. hot yoga</li>
            <li>This is simply the most amazing mascara.  </li>
            <li>did clean that skin with some oil-free eye makeup remover and cotton pads.</li>
            <li>Fun and easy to use</li>
            <li>Beware though, you will need to clean up your sink afterward.</li>
            <li>So I scrape the brush nearly dry, put it on sparingly and the results are great.</li>
            <li>and I have to clean my sink after I&#x27;ve washed my make-up off.</li>
            <li>This washes off so cleanly.</li>
            <li>No need for special removers, no need for repeated scrubbing, no need for raccoon eyes - just went the lashes and wipe or pull the coating off the lashes.  </li>
            <li>If I have a special event or something</li>
            <li>It peels right off!</li>
            <li>she is right!</li>
            <li>But it is very similar in that it does clump very easily, does tug at some of your lashes and the product will flake into your eye ball!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite ever mascara, used MAC tubes and didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s true of all mascara.  </li>
            <li>easiest way to remove it is to put warm water on your lashes, either directly under the shower stream or with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>It feels so nice in your hand, and it looks all professional.    </li>
            <li>True to its name, this is quite lengthening and adds volume in a just-more-than-natural way.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it ideal for everyday use because it is a 2-step application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true in part</li>
            <li>a full 10 hour day and no flaking or smudging.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I&#x27;ve found will keep me looking good all day.  </li>
            <li>and its true-</li>
            <li>and I really do feel better in a lot of ways-</li>
            <li>and I really do feel better in a lot of ways-</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>Good mascara, and it will last all day.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say about this mascara is that it didn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>It does look good, but learning how to cover the white coat without sticking your lashes together is a process.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, because it really does make your lashes look longer.</li>
            <li>I love gently pulling off the tubing from the lashes.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this mascara to anyone trying to obtain full lashes without clumping or having the</li>
            <li>I do wish that it was a full bottle</li>
            <li>This mascara is so cool.  </li>
            <li>I love how much people compliment me eyelashes and woman</li>
            <li>just love this mascara so much.</li>
            <li>Even after an hour and a half of intense PE, my mascara looks perfect!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did last all day, and it also came off easily with warm water and a bit of soap.</li>
            <li>When I finally wash it off in the shower it comes off easily, though kind of dramatically since it comes off like plastic and still leaves no residue on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So it is easy to wipe away in the shower, but if your face gets wet you&#x27;re not going to have a good day.</li>
            <li>Washes off pretty easily in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality, easy to apply, dries quick, and washes away easily.</li>
            <li>it seems to be a nice product, however; you have to make sure you cover all the white or you look funny</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it; I used to have to clean mascara off with 3 separate methods just to remove it all: washing with soap, wiping with an eye makeup remover, then wiping with a QTip with moisturizer on it,</li>
            <li>It alright for quick length when you don&#x27;t feel like layering mascara on.</li>
            <li>Everyone has different chemistry, and things work differently for people, but this is the perfect mascara for me.</li>
            <li>I super recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I do not like that it dries out so quickly.</li>
            <li>As a busy Mom and one who doesn&#x27;t enjoy primping, unless it&#x27;s for a night out on the town, I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>And yes, you have to be sure you cover the white which takes some more TLC.</li>
            <li>a quick face wipe time in bed anyway.  </li>
            <li>a quick face wipe time in bed anyway.  </li>
            <li>just put ur face under the warm shower and gently grab ur eye lashes without really pulling hand</li>
            <li>The reason I love this mascara so much is that it plumps up my lashes, but mainly because it comes off easily and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I think there is no other kind I would buy.  </li>
            <li>I have used Clinique&#x27;s High Impact mascara for years and years, primarily for the easy &amp;#34;warm water removal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>On a positive note it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The only difference is this one seems to come off the lashes easier, warm water and it pretty much slides right off, which is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>If I could remember what the other type or types I used many years ago that I liked, I would buy those.</li>
            <li>I have had it for about a month and love it more and more everyday.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara because it&#x27;s the only one that comes off cleanly and easily.  </li>
            <li>love this mascara, and I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s way cheaper than some other tube mascaras on the market.</li>
            <li>However, it is strange in a good way, for me anyway.</li>
            <li>This REALLY works as advertised, I love it, It&#x27;s by far my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Benefit&#x27;s brand, but this is my new love for going out.</li>
            <li>I live in Europe and i can&#x27;t buy her in here because she isn&#x27;t able to by not even by l&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li>Plus it really does extend my lashes and is so easy to take off.  </li>
            <li>its super useful for vacations.  </li>
            <li>its super useful for vacations.  </li>
            <li>the first unit that i open its good.</li>
            <li>I hope the next be so good as this first.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge, run or flake, and is easy to take off with just water and gentle wiping with a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>and I must say this is the best mascara I have ever used,its long lasting n gives volume to your lashes.</li>
            <li>No runs,washes of easily and does really make lashes look noticeably longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty neat!</li>
            <li>But it is a product you need to learn to apply and take off properly, and with practice you will love it!</li>
            <li>No smudging for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s pretty explainable!</li>
            <li>Lash primer makes lashes more lush!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara of all times because it comes of with warm water and does not leave black marks under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Finally, a cheaper product that I can more easily find in the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, this can clump, but I just apply to clean lashes, first wiping the wand on the rim of the tube to remove the excess.  </li>
            <li>To take it off at night, I just splash my eyes with warm water a few times and very lightly rub my eyelashes with my finger.</li>
            <li>FYI, the one I received from Amazon was very dry like it wasnt store in good condition.</li>
            <li>know how normal mascara is quick and easy to put on-</li>
            <li>and you are competent enough to know how to accurately apply mascara-</li>
            <li>This is my favorite type so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li>The wait is so powerful</li>
            <li>effect to the look of this mascara that makes it worth the application and removal effort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason this type of mascara is worth it:  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is considerably cheaper than most tube mascaras I found&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara so far</li>
            <li>this is your golden ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but its SO worth it to give it trudge through the declumping process.  </li>
            <li>but again- worth</li>
            <li>in my opinion- its worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m using it up more frequently, but I think its drying in the tube.</li>
            <li>When the mascara is fresh, it comes off in tubes when you wash it off.</li>
            <li>I was getting it via Amazon Subscribe and Save - a fresh tube every month.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Simply just with warm water.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Fresh product.</li>
            <li>Not that I would advise to leave it on for that long, can&#x27;t be good for your eyes... ;)</li>
            <li>It only comes off when I take a warm shower and rub my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it four stars is because you really have to wash it off good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep this to use the fiber coating, but stick with Maybelline Colossal Volume.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Favourite, only kind I purchase now.</li>
            <li>I rarely use that end of the precut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesnt even come close to Maybelline Colossal volume.</li>
            <li>I swear by this mascara - discovered it over 6 years ago and have only used this kind since.</li>
            <li>It is the only kind I can use without getting raccoon eyes (even waterproof mascaras &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; for me).  </li>
            <li>It coats my lash nicely with the extra volume but it also pull out my lashes when removing it.</li>
            <li>There is some clumping, or a lot of clumping if you&#x27;re not doing it right, but overall it&#x27;s a nice mascara.</li>
            <li>REALLY Lengthening, volume, and super EASY removal - just wipe off with warm wet wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara, the extra time is worth having longer lashes!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty great little product.</li>
            <li>you are right handed.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>and it comes right off</li>
            <li>It comes right off.</li>
            <li>Once it loosens it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>they come right off.</li>
            <li>Then I just touch them and the mascara lifts right off my lash.</li>
            <li>they come right off.</li>
            <li>Then I just touch them and the mascara lifts right off my lash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get the right angle to apply the stuff to my lashes because the handle keeps hitting me in the face, so I end up with lashes that get clumped together.</li>
            <li>Zero irritation (not even those fumes that can make your eyes water right after you put it on) and the extensils STAY PUT.  </li>
            <li>So, when it is time to remove it, it just comes right off with water and like two swipes.</li>
            <li>As for taking it off, it pulls right off in the shower after letting the steam soak them for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>and it slides right off.</li>
            <li>Love how easy it is to take off at night, and I can wear it light or heavy depending on the look</li>
            <li>A nice first tubing mascara especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Washes off cleanly with gentle cleansers (Neutrogena).  </li>
            <li>It also comes off very easily with just water, no makeup remover necessary.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully they will make a new formula that is more gentle on eyes.</li>
            <li>So easy to clean off too, when I wet my face in the shower then lightly run my thumb and forefinger across my lashes the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; come right off and look like well formed eyelashes coming off.</li>
            <li>My lashes stuck together the whole day, and even though I used eye makeup remover and oil cleanse my face, my lashes were STILL sticking together and clumping for a full three days after using this.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use another L&#x27;oreal mascara on top of it if I really want it to be thick, but this one is good in itself.</li>
            <li>If you want the long lash look and can&#x27;t afford extensions or the pricy extension mascara, this is a nice compromise.  </li>
            <li>Once soaked you pull it off with your fingertips and it comes off easy in rubbery little strings, which is totally cool :)</li>
            <li>Take it off with a warm moist towelette and just a little light rubbing.</li>
            <li>My phone pictures are not that good, but there is rarely ever any smearing around the eye area, no matter how sloppy I am when applying it, that is my favorite part.</li>
            <li>so it is super fast application product.  </li>
            <li>But despite the extra care and the cons above, this is a great mascara to keep in your arsenal.</li>
            <li>I would love a Brown for daytime use, and maybe even a blue for fun.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara so much because I have nearly non existent eye lashes.</li>
            <li>Possibly, if I had younger skin, I would not have experienced that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the Blinc mascara is far superior in application, lengthening and building, and especially in removal.</li>
            <li>then apply it well, and have a safety pin handy to separate clumped lashes before they dry.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, especially after spending $25 every couple months on Blinc which is basically the same product.</li>
            <li>I truly love this mascara - five stars for the product, but only when it is a fresh tube.</li>
            <li>and this by far is my absolute favorite</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t add much volume which I don&#x27;t care for anyways because I prefer more of a natural look.</li>
            <li>The first couple times you wash this off in the shower, it is kind of freaky, it looks like black spider legs coming off, but it rinses off clean.  </li>
            <li>Why did they mess with a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Why did Loreal have to mess with a good thing?</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants long lasting mascara that makes their eyes look great!</li>
            <li>I just splash my eyelashes with water, very gently pull the mascara off</li>
            <li>so just watch out, be VERY gentle and patient when taking this off...</li>
            <li>Like rubber.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara dries off very fast , so</li>
            <li>Very gently rests on the eyelashes and visibly udlinyaetyu eyelashes stick together.</li>
            <li>I loved the old tube of Double extend in the white and gold container--haven&#x27;t been able to find it, so</li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as some of my other favorite mascaras</li>
            <li>My new go-to daily lash blast - LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I think I prefer the one in the blue package that Loreal makes a little better, but this one works good too.</li>
            <li>I always love this mascara as it&#x27;s non traditional.</li>
            <li>I washed my face twice afterwards, and still had residue in my eyes for the next day or more.</li>
            <li>Double Extend has been my go-to mascara for many years, since it first came to market.</li>
            <li>My lashes look long and thick, and the best part is, this is essentially waterproof until you wash your face with warm to hot water.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first tubing mascara</li>
            <li>It takes forever to make sure there isn&#x27;t any white from it showing</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>If you can afford more, definitely choose another brand.</li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;d pass on this unless your budget won&#x27;t allow for better.</li>
            <li>It does not run if you get it wet, when you want it to come off use warm water to pre-soak</li>
            <li>stuff that you&#x27;re supposed to put on your lashes before is pretty goopy.</li>
            <li>First of all I got to say, this is NOT designed for volume.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would change about this mascara would be to add more color choices.  </li>
            <li>-I can tell the difference in my lashes when I&#x27;m wearing this versus when I&#x27;m wearing regular mascara; it does make my lashes look longer and fuller (adds more volume).  </li>
            <li>I generally love L&#x27;Oreal products, especially their Voluminous mascara which I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>fact, after my first use of the product and my difficulties removing it, I thought I must have misread the package whilst in the store and had accidentally purchased waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>First, it does lengthen my lashes, maybe not 60%, but still noticable.  </li>
            <li>stuff was $40 a tube when it first came out as a Lancome product in the 80s.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not waterproof.</li>
            <li>do your taxes better, but, if you actually want it to *stay* in your lashes, this is the one you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it dries pretty</li>
            <li>thanks for everything!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally found something as the way</li>
            <li>mascara is my favourite one, since the first time that i use her.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first time that i buy to you, and i buy and soon bought three units.</li>
            <li>&quot; I was to apply first.  </li>
            <li>I would gladly give the white stuff up for a longer tube of mascara.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Works way better than those so called big brands.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold up pretty well - no raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>The only con I can see if that it gives more length than volume.</li>
            <li>Really enhances eyelashes length!</li>
            <li>but when I use the growth side(white side) it really made my lashes grow!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order again when I finish with my mascara. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Just stick to the old style, it worked fantastic.</li>
            <li>Love the price, especially on my subscription, but if the price keeps creeping up</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>, actually I love it for me, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;OH my god, the first time i tried to remove it, it was NOT coming off even though YES i read and followed the directions.  </li>
            <li>First time in my life I haven&#x27;t looked like a raccoon by 10am.</li>
            <li>First time on this product, I thought it ruined my lashes.</li>
            <li>I actually like it better w/o primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I love it because I only wear this and cover up as make up and touch my face a lot.</li>
            <li>I have always used this product since it first came out.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the white primer end of this mascara.</li>
            <li>I usually will use a brand that provides more volume and then layer this on top</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever for anything on Amazon</li>
            <li>I love the tubes because they last all day and don&#x27;t make me look like a raccoon.</li>
            <li>This is a great product even though it does not last long before it gets clumpy both in the bottle and on your lashes.  </li>
            <li>or if I put too much on and it&#x27;s hot out it will smudge underneath my eye, but that&#x27;s rare.  </li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used some pretty expensive ones from Sephora.</li>
            <li>Love it even though I never use the white end.</li>
            <li>Blinc has a similar product but for more than twice the price.</li>
            <li>My favorite make up item in my extensive arsenal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mascara since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>I wore it for 10+ hours for the first time today, and realized it was making my eyes itch.</li>
            <li>Use a good eyelash curler with this and it can look gorgeous, similar to false lashes.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and once dry</li>
            <li>It coats your eyelashes with a very flexible, almost soft plastic coating that comes off easily with water and does not EVER smear or get crunchy.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily and apparently the primer is conditioning for your lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ive gotten to the point where I can put this on as quickly and easily as normal mascara.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ive gotten to the point where I can put this on as quickly and easily as normal mascara.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is non clumpy and stays on incredibly well even through long, active work days or exercise.</li>
            <li>I really cannot tell you how much this one small addition to my routine makes me happy.  </li>
            <li>The two step doesn&#x27;t really take up much more time, no more time than it takes to add a couple more coats.  </li>
            <li>I have other mascara for \\&quot;evenings,\\&quot; but to be honest -- I still use this because it is so worry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to look so severe during the day with a black mascara against my fair skin and light hair, but the black is fine.</li>
            <li>Finally, it is nice to be active, swim, sweat, tear up at a wedding, and not have to worry about my mascara running.</li>
            <li>The main problem I have with ordering this mascara from Amazon is that I think it is not as fresh as what I can buy from Target, for instance.</li>
            <li>The length is good, but better with the primer unfortunately.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you really coat your lashes with the white stuff before using the mascara.  </li>
            <li>I saw an earlier review that said she wore this through labor and delivery of her child and it stayed on and still looked good when she got back</li>
            <li>It was very strange at first, but now I love it.</li>
            <li>To remove mascara from your lashes, just wash gently with a warm, wet washcloth or let the shower head splash yours and then wipe gently with your fingers.</li>
            <li>it just makes my whole bedtime routine much quicker !</li>
            <li>However, it dries out pretty fast and starts getting spidery and clumpy after about a month.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love how long it stays on.  </li>
            <li>My eyes popped out more because of the long lashes framing them.</li>
            <li>i was VERY DEPRESSED after losing about TWELVE lashes on the first removal.  </li>
            <li>When I applied it straight over the primer the first time, my lashes became gooey and stuck together</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t believe those lush full eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t have problems with it flaking off into my eyes during the day, and the color is nice and dark</li>
            <li>Amazon quickly replaced it - I literally received a new one the next day - and it was fine.</li>
            <li>after my hair is washed, I wash my face with my normal cleanser and the tubes come right off.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes look fake, super easy to take off with warm water and face wash.</li>
            <li>It did much better when I let the tubes dry</li>
            <li>But now before I put it on in the morning I comb out my eyelashes before putting a light coat of the white stuff on first.</li>
            <li>I can even forget to take it off at bed and just as easily remove in in the shower the next morning or while washing my face.  </li>
            <li>Instead of leaving smudgy black goop everywhere, it slides off in tubes when you apply warm water and let it soak in for a minute or so.</li>
            <li>This is my favourite mascara of all times because it comes of with warm water and does not leave black marks under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Most mascaras when dry are chalky.</li>
            <li>It not only lengthens the lashes it does not smear easily.  </li>
            <li>certainly isn&#x27;t a volumizer.</li>
            <li>You look like you&#x27;re not even wearing mascara, just like you&#x27;re blessed with long, thick, amazing lashes of your own.</li>
            <li>If you want nice defined lashes without the mess, go for Lash Blast.</li>
            <li>The best way is to apply the white coat then immediately after do the same lash with the black coat.</li>
            <li>The white end really makes it show up where to put the black and my lashes look great.</li>
            <li>This mascara is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>While it certainly does create a \\&quot;tube\\&quot; around your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t extend them much, if at all.</li>
            <li>i went from a super high to a super low.  </li>
            <li>By comparison to blinc, its a lot thicker which is nice, however it does feel a little drying on your eyes after several hours where bounce is much more sensitive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m staying with this Double Extend and hope it&#x27;s forever available and well stocked.</li>
            <li>This mascara really does stay on until washed off.</li>
            <li>It bothered him so much at breakfast that he wanted me to go take it off.</li>
            <li>It added some real length to my lashes without being gaudy or gooey looking.  </li>
            <li>; say to throw away mascara after a couple months, but with this one you really have to.</li>
            <li>It sets my curled lashes very well and does not smudge at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It really is.</li>
            <li>That being said, it really clumps.</li>
            <li>Somehow they don&#x27;t attach to the hair itself or bond and really does just encase it.</li>
            <li>I might as well say I don&#x27;t like the primer much and don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>While this is a very affordable option for a tubing mascara, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>After much research, I decided to try &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li>It becomes very sticky soon.</li>
            <li>For some reason, it doesn&#x27;t remove this stuff no matter how much I rub.</li>
            <li>It really does make lashes look quite a bit longer</li>
            <li>But, I was all ready used to using a primer mascara.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t provide as much extension as it claims.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so reasonable.</li>
            <li>that reads a bit like a legal disclaimer, doesn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can use this product instead of getting my eyelashes dyed (I&#x27;m blonde, with light lashes).  </li>
            <li>It makes your lashes look longer, curlier, and VERY defined.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s just too much</li>
            <li>really helps with building length and volume.</li>
            <li>so I need a primer to add much length.  </li>
            <li>and it really does extend my eyelashes to where strangers often complement my eyes.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really brush them to fix this either because the mascara dries into what they call &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; and they just pull off when you try.</li>
            <li>but really really despise the work and raccoon eyes and redness of the removal</li>
            <li>really really wipe that wand off on the sides of the tube opening.  </li>
            <li>itself- really scrape off excess from the applicator.</li>
            <li>which wasn&#x27;t much time to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which wasn&#x27;t much time to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll have very clumpy looking lashes.</li>
            <li>, it works well, builds lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump (much) when it&#x27;s being applied.  </li>
            <li>It can be a bit clumpy if you put too much of either the primer or mascara on</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes seem much thicker and longer</li>
            <li>Yes, it does remove like a dream when you are ready.</li>
            <li>It comes off in tubes and flakes and no matter how much you wipe, it all remains under your eyes.</li>
            <li>I found that my lashes get very brittle with this product.</li>
            <li>It absolutely makes your lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that Blink&#x27;s formulation stays wet longer, but it also costs substantially more than L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>There are several brands available.</li>
            <li>I used the product as directed and it was absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascera.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>Well peels off really</li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference?</li>
            <li>Really adds volume to your lashes</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge and really makes my lashes look longer.</li>
            <li>really makes your eyelashes look longer</li>
            <li>This mascara really works.</li>
            <li>They looked very doll-like.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t give you much volume.</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to chemical smells and perfumes, to me this doesn&#x27;t have any smells.</li>
            <li>it gives SO MUCH VOLUME&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, when I put it  on, I scrape the brush really well.  </li>
            <li>you have to be VERY PATIENT with taking it off, THEN it won&#x27;t damage your lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>w/ gentle face cleaner makes the &#x27;tubes&#x27; wash off intact.  </li>
            <li>Really holds the curl.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you don&#x27;t like to use make up remover around your eyes!</li>
            <li>I really like the mascara...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really use the nourishing serum because I&#x27;m always in a hurry in the morning.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference; the serum doesn&#x27;t help or hurt</li>
            <li>If you dab water on it, let the water sit for a while, you can just gently rub or pull the tubes off your eyelashes with your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I really like how this looks once</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m just waking my face in the sink, I splash water, and just rub the lashes gently with the tips of my fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li>This really helps with my post menopausal lash loss</li>
            <li>And it really extends your lashes.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>It really gives you a polished look.</li>
            <li>so this was just way too much for me.  </li>
            <li>Lately I been buying tons of mascaras because I wanted a really good one.</li>
            <li>so if I wear regular mascara I get raccoon eyes when I smile or laugh.</li>
            <li>I wish they didn&#x27;t dry so quickly and look clumpy if I dont work quickly.</li>
            <li>apparently without it you don&#x27;t get that full lash look that buyers wanted</li>
            <li>I have tried many different waterproof mascaras, and while some are better than others, even the most expensive ones resulted in the raccoon look before I was ready to wash it off.  </li>
            <li>I own this mascara for a few months now</li>
            <li>I previously used the Trish McEvoy High Volume mascara which I liked but was too pricey.  </li>
            <li>Comes right off in the shower with no mess!</li>
            <li>It does a great job tubing my lashes and making them look super thick and long.  </li>
            <li>if you get caught out camping and have no hot water to wash your face, the mascara will still look good the next morning.</li>
            <li>I usued to have oily skin; now that I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and live in a dry climate, it&#x27;s more combination, but the eye area still seems to be oily.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that the Clinique mascara is healthier and likely has less chemicals etc, but at this moment in life…ease and convenience far outweigh my concern for what&#x27;s in my mascara :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is much better than I expected; it hasn&#x27;t smudged once!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the original (and hoping they dont discontinue it now).  </li>
            <li>Even when I apply other mascaras on top of this l&#x27;oreal, I do not have raccoon eyes when I was off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and prefer not to fuss with the area around my eyes too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t really create &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If I want a more dramatic look, I just add a light coat of another mascara on top, and I still have the extreme definition, but a little more ooomph!</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first about how the white side would work on my lashes but the black coats it perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended if you have any of the special needs I listed above!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove (by taking a wet washcloth and letting it rest on your lashes for a minute or two, then gently wiping).</li>
            <li>and it stays smudge free all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too old to care that much!</li>
            <li>Let it dry on its own, and it&#x27;s usually just fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if its space age cosmetic snake oil or I&#x27;m just simply not leveled up enough in womanly things to understand how to make this look good.</li>
            <li>I usually slide the tubes off with my fingers and warm water in the evening before I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>It occasionally flakes, but never badly.</li>
            <li>The down side is that I have seen better thickening and lengthening mascaras.</li>
            <li>It takes a little more time to apply with the two different layers but so worth it!</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s kind of a pain to put it on as you would have to first apply the white layer and then the black.</li>
            <li>The only thing this may be good for is freaking someone out when you wash it off, since it looks like your eyelashes are falling out, little tubes.</li>
            <li>The mascara really does live up to the hype</li>
            <li>for the black, if you brush it more than twice, it clumps your lashes together</li>
            <li>more time putting on, less time taking off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it came of just as easily as always- just a wet paper towel.</li>
            <li>it stays put but comes off easily when wet but not until I take it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the dual mascaras and this one is basically entirely the same.</li>
            <li>I most definitely applied it properly, and am not a newbie to cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, I only used it consistently for about a month when I first got it, but still, no difference.</li>
            <li>I recently noticed a picture of myself where my eyes were closed from squinting in the sun and noticed how nice and elongated my lashes looked.  </li>
            <li>me, a MUCH better choice is the \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Mascara\\&quot; in the gold and white tube.</li>
            <li>the older we become, the shorter our lashes are.</li>
            <li>It clumps my lashes together in a way that makes them look sparse when I have decent lashes to begin with.</li>
            <li>I started using the more expensive Trish McEvoy version of this and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and eyes; this product is an absolute dream to get off.</li>
            <li>bought it with high hopes</li>
            <li>I used to spend hours in high school layering on mascara and ended up l</li>
            <li>I tell everyone I know about it - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive eyes and find that most other mascara cause irritation or burning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too fat and short to really get to your smaller lashes easily.</li>
            <li>This adds more visible length than any other mascara I have found so far, which is why I continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>The previously packaged product in the white and gold tube is far superior.</li>
            <li>I like my mascara to be a little more volumizing than this one, but like the &amp;#34;extend&amp;#34; in the name implies it does the trick on making them appear longer.</li>
            <li>I do like mascara that provides a little more volume for when I go out at night, so</li>
            <li>I soak a cotton ball in very warm water and hold it in place - repeat a few times and gently pull down</li>
            <li>:)  Makes my lashes super dark, long, and wears all day!  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smudge as easy as other mascaras.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it smears quite easily &amp; clumps a bit, though not as badly as other products.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to remove...</li>
            <li>they might be pulling at their own lashes way too hard.  </li>
            <li>be pulling at their own lashes way too hard.  </li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover which usually does an excellent job removing everything, and it hardly got any of it off.</li>
            <li>&quot; I have the best of both worlds and none of the bad.</li>
            <li>Once it dries out, it doesn&#x27;t look great and it&#x27;s really difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>looks great but extremely difficult to remove at the end of the day</li>
            <li>After finally running out of my old favorite (Lashblast Fusion by CoverGirl), I decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li>I love how long my lashes are with this mascara they actually hit my sunglasses and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes look long and full.</li>
            <li>I have eye makeup remover which I normally use with a cotton pad before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>: how enormous it makes my lashes appear or how much fun it is to wash it off.  </li>
            <li>I normally have to use baby oil to get my waterproof mascaras off.</li>
            <li>the part everyone complains about is that its kind of sucks to put on.</li>
            <li>it will happen with normal mascara when you rub it off to.</li>
            <li>it will happen with normal mascara when you rub it off to.</li>
            <li>This mascara makes your eyelashes look so long and full.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is mascara is worth the extra 30 seconds because it doesn&#x27;t budge.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give much volume, pretty much only &#x27;adds&#x27; length.</li>
            <li>A two step process but worth the extra time.</li>
            <li>Remains waterproof in the pool as long as the water is cool and you don&#x27;t touch your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I normally use 2-3 swipes on each eye.</li>
            <li>It gives full long lashes.</li>
            <li>A great pairing of primer &amp; mascara equals long &amp; thick looking lashes.  </li>
            <li>But I didnt mind having it on for a swimming trip because it always comes off without black smears under the eyes! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have a problem with length, mine or short and don&#x27;t curl easily, but this mascara totally makes them stand out!</li>
            <li>The best (and also worst) thing about it is that it easily comes off with water.</li>
            <li>So far I have experienced very little clumping and that&#x27;s hard to find with these big brushes most cosmetic companies are pushing these days.</li>
            <li>This stiff is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I have about 8 different kinds of mascara in my purse right now, but since getting this mascara I haven&#x27;t used any of them.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I discovered that there&#x27;s no easy and inexpensive way to order my favorite mascara online, and now with two littles, a trip to the mall isn&#x27;t as quick, easy, or fun as it used to be.</li>
            <li>makes my lashes look super long</li>
            <li>Your lashes are super long and no clumping.</li>
            <li>I will be loyal to this mascara as long as its on the market.</li>
            <li>: Tubing-type mascaras encase your individual lashes and are super easy to wash off with just water once dried.</li>
            <li>it makes my eye lashes appear super long</li>
            <li>it will easily come on ur hands and it doesn&#x27;t leave the dark circles under ur eyes if u accidentally sleep with it</li>
            <li>My lashes are well defined, pretty long and pretty natural looking.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that gives me massive volume and length, no smudges, stays fresh looking all day long, and still removes easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was in the market for a new mascara, and I chose this one, as the commercials I&#x27;ve seen for it made it irresistible.</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s time to throw it out and go out and buy a new one (in my case).</li>
            <li>I thought that this one thinking it was just a new packaging.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t end up buying it until 6 months ago because it costs $10 here where I live.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can live without this mascara and</li>
            <li>Tube mascara is my new fave.  </li>
            <li>My new &#x27;go to&#x27; mascara</li>
            <li>So glad I know i can find this on amazon for a reasonable price because it is hard to find in stores in my area now.</li>
            <li>As a result, the mascara in the tube can dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I often leave my make up on after working my late evening, and the next day, it still looks good.  </li>
            <li>No black under the eyes at the end of the day!!</li>
            <li>I am Asian, and therefore have very straight lashes.</li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite mascara since the one I usually use has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>Makes eyelashes REALLY long and is easy to remove but at the same time stays put/doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, pretty clumpy overall.</li>
            <li>Once I finally got my lashes to a somewhat acceptable state, I covered the white with the top coat - which sort of melted throughout the entire evening, and then wouldn&#x27;t come off with even my strongest makeup removers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another tip: If you like to do multiple layers, wait until the first one dries so it builds.</li>
            <li>(whichever your personal curling method is), it will stay curled the whole day too!</li>
            <li>Additionally, the package appears to have been opened, so I&#x27;m not sure I feel safe using this.</li>
            <li>Does not come off until you want it off - better than the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li>There is a white base-coat that is applied first on the lashes and the topcoat forms tubes around the lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s my favorite part about this mascara</li>
            <li>I love it for vacations with my boyfriend when face washing is usually nothing but</li>
            <li>I love it for vacations with my boyfriend when face washing is usually nothing but</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the formulas all seem pretty similar, the biggest differences are the  brushes and the effect they give your lashes.</li>
            <li>I remember watching the commercial for it for the first time</li>
            <li>(Which obviously they weren&#x27;t) other than that I love this mascara</li>
            <li>Please listen to your customers Loreal and go back to the original Double Extend.</li>
            <li>on the eyelashes, not under the eyes, unlike every other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Miraculously doesn&#x27;t get INTO my eyes - safe for my contacts!&lt;br /&gt;Comes off instantly with makeup remover!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But wow!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with the double mascara.  </li>
            <li>If this comes off it&#x27;s like little flakes that I can just easily wipe off.</li>
            <li>One of the primary reasons is how it washes away and doesn&#x27;t leave black clumps in the corner of your eyes.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t budge all day, but easily comes off in a few seconds being soaked in water</li>
            <li>Thinking this was an old bottle sent to me as I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it worked much better</li>
            <li>I made sure to get all the clumps from the white side out of my lashes before applying the dark mascara.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t if I wet my lashes then use a make up or mild remover.</li>
            <li>stays on for the whole day, but it definitely flakes, even if you use the white end first.</li>
            <li>You should put the black mascara on top of the white primer</li>
            <li>Who wants to see a black mess under our eyes when we get that first glance in the mirror when we emerge refreshed from a nice long shower.  </li>
            <li>Some say it comes off easily with plain water, but I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So while it is wonderful at not smudging or smearing on dry skin, it will come completely off with any little bit of moisture, which to me, is worse than smudginglike a dream when you are ready.</li>
            <li>it is very important to get your eyes wet and keep the mascara wet until it loosens.  </li>
            <li>I save this for date nights, going out, special outings, or if I&#x27;m feeling like being a bit more dramatic on the eyes and have extra time.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it washes off in \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; rather than running down your face like a hot mess.</li>
            <li>However,  I&#x27;m willing to trade off on a little bit of length and definition in order to not have dark circles every day :)</li>
            <li>I may have been pulling my eyelashes out like crazy, but it was great.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Plus, since I have sensitive eyes I have to throw away my mascara every 3 months to prevent irritation and eye infections.  </li>
            <li>Again with sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have extremely, short, sparse eyelashes, so I bought this not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>(so far for me, about every 4-6 months, which is how often we&#x27;re supposed to replace it anyway)</li>
            <li>It stays for the whole entire day without smudging, and once you have curled it before/</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve read this review this far, I would recommend you give this mascara</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve read this review this far, I would recommend you give this mascara a try.</li>
            <li>This is probably my fifth tube so far.</li>
            <li>then it slides off your lashes with a gentle wipe as a solid without smearing all over you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and when I pull it away the mascara is completely gone.</li>
            <li>The only issue I found with this is that you cannot put too much on or else you get spider legs instead of lashes.</li>
            <li>I had lash extensions and was told they wouldn&#x27;t ruin my natural lashes.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes, this product will work for you.</li>
            <li>The wand creates stuck-together eyelashes and the white formula dries and hardens so fast that there&#x27;s no time to comb through and sort out all the clumps.</li>
            <li>When I remove it, it comes completely off.</li>
            <li>and then with such ease when I am ready.</li>
            <li>The problem is my lashes don&#x27;t look natural when I clump on mascara</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>But it takes prolonged and frequent rubbing (also speaking from experience).</li>
            <li>The three star rating is because I think the product was old.</li>
            <li>but overall it works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not stark at all.</li>
            <li>It leaves my lashes natural looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always been SO jealous of people with long, pretty lashes.</li>
            <li>If you are also a makeup noob and/or avoid looking like an old woman, leave this product aside for the pros.</li>
            <li>It iliminates having to scrub and pull at your sensitive eyelids.</li>
            <li>I believe I received an old product.</li>
            <li>I have short lashes that are straight.</li>
            <li>When I opened the container, nearly nothing came off on the wand.</li>
            <li>Like I was sold an old product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an old saying.......</li>
            <li>it looks natural</li>
            <li>I think I will take and old rubber bristle brush and see how that does.</li>
            <li>and it was completely unsmudged and intact.</li>
            <li>The mascara will \\&quot;tube\\&quot; and it almost feels like rubber or soft plastic.</li>
            <li>Only guidance is be gentle on your eye lashes when removing so you do not pull out your lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Occasionally comes off in flakes when washing it off, but I much prefer that over continuously wiping off the mascara smears.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive skinned</li>
            <li>Big mistake, I returned whatever I had purchased immediately for a fresh tube of Double Extend Beauty Tubes.</li>
            <li>I find that the product is worth buying even though I only use the white end of the tube.</li>
            <li>It has a 2-step process that requires extra time (2 minutes, big deal) but it&#x27;s so worth it given</li>
            <li>ok, i don&#x27;t have thick and numerous lashes to begin with, so i go for mascaras that REALLY pump of the volume and length.  </li>
            <li>it looks like im wearing fake lashes (in a good way!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They can stick to the tub or shower pan and dry on, so make sure to wash them down the drain.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to any other cheap mascara.</li>
            <li>They come off your eye lashes easily, but the small bits got into my eyes and were all over my face and clothes.  </li>
            <li>Usually washable mascaras run, but are easy to get off and waterproof mascaras stay put, but I can sometimes irritate my eye area trying to get it off.</li>
            <li>So while it is wonderful at not smudging or smearing on dry skin, it will come completely off with any little bit of moisture, which to me, is worse than smudging</li>
            <li>The only downside is that you really can&#x27;t reapply - but taking it off and putting it back on is so easy because you just need a little water on your hands.</li>
            <li>And it don&#x27;t just grow a little it can grow as long as you want it to by putting on more coat.</li>
            <li>amazing mascara makes a little lengthening tube around your eyelash that only comes off with water and a little gentle friction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to completely clean off the applicator, before putting it away; this way you don&#x27;t have any small clumps of mascara mixing with the new mascara in the tube.</li>
            <li>As somewhat of a makeup hoarder, I think I&#x27;m pretty knowledgeable of good mascaras vs bad.</li>
            <li>No black smudges under my eyes,  </li>
            <li>Most tube mascaras are pretty expensive</li>
            <li>It only flakes as with and older and used tube of mascara.</li>
            <li>no black brown or brown.  </li>
            <li>First I use the white primer, wait about 30 seconds then apply to coats of the mascara before the white primer dries.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t wear it on the day I go swimming, because it would come off in tiny black strings in the pool, but other than that it is ideal to use everyday.  </li>
            <li>I tried maybe 10 different brands of waterproof and regular mascara from cheap drugstore brands to more expensive labels.</li>
            <li>It really does noticeably increase the length of my lashes, and is waterproof as long as you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; your lashes.</li>
            <li>I love that the mascara never rubs off, even after a long day and eye rubbing, and comes off completely while washing my face with my usual facewash.</li>
            <li>The only real difference is that it is a two step process, but it really doesn&#x27;t take me more that a few seconds longer than usual.  </li>
            <li>Plus no dark circles anymore- EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Far too often mascara is advertised as flake free, and long lasting, with easy removal, and then promptly fails to live up to any of those.</li>
            <li>one thing that I&#x27;ve found, that I would change, is that L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s formulation drys quickly, a little too quickly.  </li>
            <li>for the white conditioner, I&#x27;m not 100% certain of it&#x27;s functionality outside of</li>
            <li>I just stand under running water and gently rub my eyes down from top to bottom with eyes closed, using a wet facecloth.  </li>
            <li>I took one star off because there are other traditional mascaras that can really thicken and add plush volume, which this doesn&#x27;t do so much.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going out for the evening I&#x27;ll wear a different mascara, but this one is my new go-to for all-day wear.</li>
            <li>After about two to three months, you have to pitch it and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;- Looks gross</li>
            <li>Second tube was fine, but it makes your lashes really stiff and stuck together.  </li>
            <li>Bought this mascara based off all the great reviews, used it on one eye and immediately started desperately trying to remove it in the short amount of time I had before I had to leave.</li>
            <li>It does not, at least for me, wash off easily with water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not impossible to get it off, and in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it for the dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;ve switched back to my old mascara completely.</li>
            <li>My only complaint - it doesn&#x27;t come in brown - as a redhead, I love brown mascaras.  </li>
            <li>This nourishes my lashes and extends them such that over time my real lashes have grown so the lengthening effect is only improved over time!</li>
            <li>I have very short, straight lashes and this mascara definitely gives them a boost.</li>
            <li>The white base is awesome for lifting and lengthening my lashes.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily and makes my lashes so thick.</li>
            <li>I had it on auto ship every month because it dried out quickly</li>
            <li>For extra definition, use both the base coat and the mascara on top of your top lashes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it can be a little high-maintenance, I mostly use it for long days or nights out.</li>
            <li>This product does not live up to the descrption, and it makes my lashes very brittle.</li>
            <li>No other drugstore mascaras like this</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge or run on my extremely oily skin in hot summer weather.</li>
            <li>and I  get major raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>So the first day I tried the conditioner on one eye, but not the other.</li>
            <li>There is no other product out there that can match it for my needs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truly an amazing mascara if you want a long dramatic look that is very natural</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out, stays smooth and dark...</li>
            <li>I usually get better results when I don&#x27;t use the white site of the product and just go straight to the black side.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always use it with the white base coat, but when I do, it has a great plumping quality - you just have to make sure to cover up all the white with the black</li>
            <li>Personally, I have decently thick, very dark eyelashes, and a good length, but for the looks I go for</li>
            <li>After using this thing I looked like I had a few long lashes with huge gaps in between.</li>
            <li>There were huge flakes and clumps coming off slowly, sticking to my skin.</li>
            <li>This mascara creates long, lush, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive eyes and can not tolerate several types of mascara.  </li>
            <li>Even with careful application, it continually stuck my lashes together and really really stuck.</li>
            <li>for a while I tried using this stuff on my upper lashes and then using my old mascara on my lower lashes.</li>
            <li>I tried to use my eyelash comb thing to seperate and no deal - completely hardened and gross lashes.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way.</li>
            <li>and I totally recommend it for anyone in search of a smudge proof, natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to remove it, just get it wet</li>
            <li>I just wet my fingertips, place them on my lashes and gently wipe off the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; using my thumb and index fingers.  </li>
            <li>It took me the same amount of time using this as it would for me to use 2 coats of my old mascara.</li>
            <li>The old Double Extend formula was my go-to for years.</li>
            <li>It was apparently designed to be used by giants.</li>
            <li>In order to remove them, wet your lashes, squeeze gently, then they rinse off.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, it stayed on all day, and felt the same as my normal mascara (no itchy eyes or irritation with it).</li>
            <li>-Kind of difficult to remove, since it creates a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; of mascara on each lash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying the wrong kind of mascara for 25 years.</li>
            <li>like fake eyelashes that you encase your own lashs in.  </li>
            <li>So what I do is apply this for incredible length, and do the base of my eyelashes, after it dries, with a little bit of my previous favorite which I have lots of on hand.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true it droops down the first few applications, but when I curl it again with the product, it actually stays curled.</li>
            <li>Make sure to remove it if you&#x27;re going swimming or there will be little black tubes floating in the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a lot of trouble applying the mascara because the tube is so huge that I can hardly get it around the right side of my head to get the brush to my lashes.</li>
            <li>It really does last all day long!</li>
            <li>I actually had the Novalashes for a while, but they became expensive to maintain, though they looked beautiful and were less maintenance for me.  </li>
            <li>: if you wait too long, the mascara coat will not go on smoothly because the lashes will be a bit too stiff.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how one would look right after crying, or laughing, or how it would wear in the summer with perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how one would look right after crying, or laughing, or how it would wear in the summer with perspiration.    </li>
            <li>I take it off, I just splash water on my eyes a few times and then whoosh, the &#x27;tubes&#x27; slide right off, leaving no residue-</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as other mascaras, I mean supply wise.</li>
            <li>It comes off in clumpy &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; versus smears.&lt;br /&gt;Probably not good for my lashes, but I wear it for 2 days easily sometimes.</li>
            <li>No better than any other mascara I have used so not too sure what the hype is about the &amp;#34;extended tubes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is not for lazy people who want to put on mascara quick..</li>
            <li>It goes on much thicker and darker than any I have tried, making my lashes look star quality almost fake length and thickness from my natural light and short ones.</li>
            <li>I wet a cotton pad with some eye makeup remover and press lightly on my eyes for 1-2 minutes, then do the little zigzag motion while whiping it downwards.</li>
            <li>I wet a cotton pad with some eye makeup remover (Neutrogena) and press lightly on my eyes for 1-2 minutes, then do the little zigzag motion while whiping it downwards.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean off</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than some other options.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t wear it in the ocean and pool since it&#x27;s not waterproof, but those other waterproof kinds irritate me so much</li>
            <li>I use eye make-up remover pad to remove this mascara, and I really like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or blacken my eye like other mascaras do.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin around my eyes, and other mascaras almost always smudge under my eyes and makes me look like a football player.</li>
            <li>It was also hard to clean off at end of the day.  </li>
            <li>One thing to have in mind with this mascara is that you need a little extra time to put it on correctly, but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>one layer for office, then add another for a more dramatic look on the way to cocktail hour.</li>
            <li>think maybe Amazon should not sell cosmetics as this is the 2nd item I have ordered recently that appeared to be old and unusable.</li>
            <li>If you try this, you will never go back to your old generic mascara!</li>
            <li>You have to be fast about getting it on; you can only layer it while it&#x27;s still wet.  </li>
            <li>You only have to rub a little water on it then pull them right off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And if that wasn&#x27;t enough- the length and girth this gives my lashes is like no other mascara ive ever used.  </li>
            <li>Upper white coat then right away the black coat.</li>
            <li>Originally I was a bit skeptical ordering this product because I hadn&#x27;t heard much about it.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look twice as long, but is natural looking and not clumpy.</li>
            <li>I naturally have a lot of lashes and they are fairly long too.</li>
            <li>First tube I bought was completely dried out</li>
            <li>The black color is not a dark black but more like a dark gray.</li>
            <li>I generally use Blinc (kiss me) tubes and love it, but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li>I previously used a two step maybelline XXL intense, which is designed for volume and length.  </li>
            <li>mascara seems to only be available in black, and blackest black.</li>
            <li>It really stretches your lashes and you fill in with the black.  </li>
            <li>It seemed dry and that gives me reason to believe it was old.</li>
            <li>I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t add enough volume, but using multiple coats is apparently the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I received this mascara, the white primer side was completely dried up.</li>
            <li>Cover Girl Super Thick Lash.</li>
            <li>I recommend using the white, not letting it dry, and immediately applying the black right afterwards.</li>
            <li>Two coats of the primer really makes a difference before adding the final black coat.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is how quickly I go through the tube.</li>
            <li>The coating is rich and doesn&#x27;t feel dry or chalky in the least and glides through really smoothly - something I never much paid attention to in the past.  </li>
            <li>If you do all four of your lashes first with the white then do the black after it gets dry and doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>The basecoat is ok but seems a little thick as compared to my clinique version.  </li>
            <li>This product did not give me full or long lashes and was incredibly hard to remove.</li>
            <li>Good concept and idea, bad performance.</li>

            <li> If you could find a good bottle it would be great</li>
            <li> This mascara, while a bit more time-consuming to apply, is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Of the many I&#x27;ve tried, it is the best.</li>
            <li> you should own this product!</li>
            <li> Really good product, apples very nicely, it won&#x27;t length you lashes dramatically</li>
            <li> For this product, the best idea of it is really easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> Been a faithful customer for 3 years and the Best mascara I have ever used; doesn&#x27;t smear and easy removal.</li>
            <li> it was on it looked good, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that there was any &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Seems to work good even though I don&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li> Loreal makes some really good mascaras.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I find one that looks good to start out, but it never lasts the day the way it started out.  </li>
            <li> I have heard good things about this mascara, but mine was already drying out when I opened it.  </li>
            <li> This is a mascara that I have been using for quite some time and with good results.  </li>
            <li> can apply this and it will stay on and look good for 2-3 days without reapplying.</li>
            <li> And this is just as good</li>
            <li> Nothing for us fair haired people...</li>
            <li> It is passable for daytime wear for a fair blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people are giving this mascara good reviews.</li>
            <li> The price is good.</li>
            <li> This is good mascara and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all.  </li>
            <li> It also looks great on and lasts nicely without flaking.</li>
            <li> the price is a good price.</li>
            <li> Now, L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued and I cannot find anything that was as good.</li>
            <li> Good waterproof-ness.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever change products: its that good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this has good reviews, but I bought it based on the rating</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof (which is good cause</li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> The best mascara for me, as it just goes off while you&#x27;re having shower and no need to clean again after.</li>
            <li> Seriously, super impressed with this mascara!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it!!!  </li>
            <li> I love the shape of the tube, lol.</li>
            <li> I got so many complements from co-workers on how great my eyes looked.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find one product that delivers both length and volume but am very pleased with the results of this one.</li>
            <li> Lashes look great for many hours.</li>
            <li> Seeing the lashes float around the bathtub after isn&#x27;t always fun; but its by the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it looks great and you can take it all off with warm water and washcloth which helps a lot to avoid rubbing eyelids.</li>

            <li> Well my tube is running out, I must go buy some more!</li>
            <li> And it looks amazing too! :)</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it Ladies!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever!  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S MAGIC!</li>
            <li> It was the first time I tried tubing mascara, and I was very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why others are experiencing issues with this mascara, however, I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara, EVER!</li>
            <li> Great cosmetic product and really easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it goes on easily and looks great.  </li>
            <li> Goes on great and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I liked this better!</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t know better I&#x27;d think this L&#x27;Oreal product is pretty good, and the price is excellent.  </li>
            <li> The amazing thing was no marks or flakes came off on my fingers when I did</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> and it makes my eyelashes look amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing results</li>
            <li> It does not come off until you take it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I have been asked what kind of mascara I use by ladies who have know me for some time.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of a pain to take off too.  </li>
            <li> I always liked this product.</li>
            <li> Just use a warm wash cloth</li>
            <li> The tubes slide off your lashes when warm water is applied and rinse off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes off nicely with warm water like plastic, leaving no residue on the face....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going by my own reflection in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in stores and liked it, so, I thought I would purchase it while Xmas shopping.  </li>
            <li> This is the absolute best mascara if you wear contact lenses!  </li>
            <li> mascara forms &#x27;tubes&#x27; around your eyelashes when you apply, which helps give it a nice voluminous look.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s kind of remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ive</li>
            <li> ive even made my own before.  </li>
            <li> no longer need a pin handy to separate</li>
            <li> no longer need a pin handy to separate</li>
            <li> Also, soak warm water on your eyes for 5 seconds or so before trying to remove it.</li>
            <li> When I took it off I washed my face with warm water, as I do every night.</li>
            <li> (just wash off with warm water).</li>
            <li> This has encouraged me to look into making my own.</li>
            <li> what kind of mascara I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It adds a bit too much length for my tastes, but would be perfect for someone with shorter lashes.  </li>
            <li> I just use warm water on my fingertips and rub my eyelashes--this will come off in what looks like fibrous clumps, leaving no residue on your lashes.</li>
            <li> Nice thickening and lengthening of the lashes.</li>
            <li> Nice concept, Loreal, but this one doesn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li> This mascara comes off with just some warm water.  </li>
            <li> I also liked how it made my lashed pop.  </li>
            <li> Although I can get some length with this mascara, the texture of my lashes becomes kind of rubbery</li>
            <li> Yet, it looks nice on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I always use this type of mascara, with the building block then the mascara, but had not used the tube like kind before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found splashing warm water</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really nice because it doesn&#x27;t clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wash them off with warm water before bed.</li>
            <li> It comes off with warm soap and water too.</li>
            <li> Honestly I dont like how it works</li>
            <li> so I have never been able to find the right mascara that worked perfectly for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Love love love!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE ITT!!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite for YEARS!!!  </li>
            <li> It is also very easy to remove, just use warm water</li>
            <li> the fact that it comes off very easily without smudging is nice.</li>
            <li> VERY easy to remove with a face wash or just warm water in the shower.</li>
            <li> , it is very easy to take off, just warm wash cloth</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look huge &amp; amazing lengths!</li>
            <li> When I first used it, my lashes were incredibly clumpy and then at night I would scrub and scrub with eye makeup remover to try to get it off.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see this mascara was still manufactured, and it works great as far as length goes.</li>
            <li> Super duper happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Washes off VERY easily with soap and water and does appear to lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li> that washes off VERY easily and does appear to lengthen.</li>
            <li> My most favorite mascara ever!</li>
            <li> I love love this mascara!</li>
            <li> My most favorite mascara ever!</li>
            <li> I love that it comes off in tubes with just warm water.</li>
            <li> This may be the best solution I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> most amazing part was taking it off at night.</li>
            <li> What I mainly love about this is that it gives a kind of \\&quot;curl\\&quot; to my lashes, without using a lash-curler.</li>
            <li> It makes them flare up at the top and it looks really nice.</li>
            <li> I use my own favorite mascara instead of the mascara in this product.</li>
            <li> Did I mention this was amazing stuff?  :)</li>
            <li> The most amazing mascara I have ever used</li>
            <li> I would have liked more volume but this is by FAR the best mascara I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I discovered it and even more happy that it&#x27;s available through the subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> best feature is when you remove it there is no mess.</li>
            <li> So easy to remove too!</li>
            <li> It washes off easily too!</li>
            <li> Its so easy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easily it comes off -- no eye makeup remover needed!</li>
            <li> It comes off easily when washing my face or with a baby wipe!</li>
            <li> Easy as pie !</li>
            <li> Another great thing is that it is super easy to remove--just warm water and soap.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara!</li>
            <li> This is a very good mascara remover, just dampen with warm water in your shower time, so I like it very much, but the most important is that it does not have sweat when blooming.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 6  months &amp;  liked it,  but was so happy to find this one from L&#x27;Oreal much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This product is perfect for a more natural, yet noticeably improved look for us post-menopausal ladies.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It was also too good to be true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a pretty good job of giving definition and length but not the best I&#x27;ve used like some of the new ones.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite mascara because it comes off so easily without smudging!</li>
            <li> This mascara looks amazing and goes on easily</li>
            <li> Warm water takes off the lashes easily - comes off as rubbery tubes.  </li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t clump together easily which is nice.</li>
            <li> Comes off easily with warm water</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smear or run, and comes off easily at the end of the day with warm water.</li>
            <li> Also, it washes out easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> It was a very popular product and was a hot seller.</li>
            <li> I love that the lashes wash away at the end of the day with just water</li>
            <li> this is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> I need volume as my lashes are getting more sparse with age.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and it helps my eyelashes look thicker.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to buy more L&#x27;Oreal products from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t need to use makeup remover with this.</li>
            <li> Also, I love not having to use or buy eye make up remover.  </li>
            <li> If you try to do more than one coat it will clump so you have to get used to the tubes technology.  </li>
            <li> I love that</li>
            <li> I love that this mascara doesn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> was given a tube at an event in 2009 and I haven&#x27;t found anything better since.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> My favorite aspect of this mascara is the removal.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY mascaras, Meral Nomram, Aveda, Mary Kay, Beauty control, Lanicome, Estee Lauder</li>
            <li> I love the beauty tubes because I don&#x27;t have to use a remover.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice if darker and brush wasn&#x27;t so huge.</li>
            <li> look 300% better.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not an employee or whatever, I just really love this product</li>
            <li> - Hope this helps :)&lt;</li>
            <li> On me, this lengthens my lashes probably 50% more.</li>
            <li> But it takes more time.  </li>
            <li> Needs to be replaced for sure after&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Now that I have used it a couple times, it am not so sure.  </li>
            <li> I have tried more mascaras than I can count and they have always smudged under my eyes not even 2 hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> Fattens my lashes which matters more than length, but it also improves the length.</li>
            <li> Mostly, I love the way this mascara comes off.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge and at the end of the day I just lay a warm washcloth lightly on the eye for 30 seconds</li>
            <li> I love it and will repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love the auto send option.  </li>
            <li> This one costs more doesn&#x27;t work as well as Telescopic which I love.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> My favorite aspect - no raccoon eyes as the day wears on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this has such good ratings?!?!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and hope Loreal never takes off the market, please......</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend Tubes Mascara is the best!</li>
            <li> My friend introduced it to me because most of mascaras smear on my lower eyelid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love, love love it.</li>
            <li> Then the mascara on top just emphasizes the clumping.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascara sand</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t more people know about this miracle?</li>
            <li> Buy unless you want to be lashes free in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> Interesting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It acted more like waterproof mascara for me and did not appear to be lengthening.</li>
            <li> But I do like a bit more length if I can get it.</li>
            <li> I simply love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for daily wear.  </li>
            <li> I also love how I don&#x27;t have to use makeup remover to remove the mascara because water will do the job.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal mascaras</li>
            <li> I love the way that it does not smudge.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite go-to mascaras because it has everything I need, all in one.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> While looking up contact safe mascara, I came across &amp;</li>
            <li> the reviews I read said contact safe (not all tube mascaras are.).</li>
            <li> I love the fact that when you was off you makeup, the pieces of fiber come off.</li>
            <li> I have no idea HOW they do it, but it creates more and longer lashes.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li> ok so in terms of color, i give this mascara credit.</li>
            <li> I like Elf&#x27;s $3 mascara primer much better.</li>
            <li> The mascara side is just okay.</li>
            <li> There are much better options out there</li>
            <li> but all in all, it&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> its all about which one is better for you-</li>
            <li> , so,  be sure to comb and curl your lashes to get them all untangled-</li>
            <li> sure this is not recommended by the manufacturer but this mascara DOES NOT BUDGE</li>
            <li> that is such an awesome thing to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure this is not recommended by the manufacturer but this mascara DOES NOT BUDGE</li>
            <li> that is such an awesome thing to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I must say, I like this even better.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day - love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it tubes because I don&#x27;t need to use eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using more of it</li>
            <li> Love this mascara</li>
            <li> It looked fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is so much better.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love it, and was you know</li>
            <li> i wood bought more.</li>
            <li> I guess we can&#x27;t always get what we want :) I still love using it in conjunction with another mascara for volume.</li>
            <li> Oh my gawd, this is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I still love the concept and may try another brand</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d better pay up!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.</li>

            <li> My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> When you remove it, it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as most mascaras do.</li>
            <li> This is better than many mascaras I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Always looking for a better mascara and this one isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras will just smudge everywhere.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a difference using this product and it feels better on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love the primer and mascara though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s CHEAP!  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I can&#x27;t even use this stuff as back-up mascara when I am out of my favorite,</li>
            <li> A great product and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> tried it a couple of times to be sure it was the product, it was.</li>
            <li> When I put another type over the top, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> I could not tell a difference, except the price for this one is way better.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the beauty tubes...</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It wears most of the day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand of mascara.</li>
            <li> Love the primer part of this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love the waterproof version of this</li>
            <li> I love how it removes in chunks and does not bleed at all.</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes way longer than most mascaras do.</li>
            <li> love the mascara</li>
            <li> I dipped it in again and tried to get some more.</li>
            <li> I love love love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :) :)</li>
            <li> so when i started using more force, yes it started coming off</li>
            <li> WHICH I DON&#x27;T HAVE MANY TO BEGIN WITH</li>
            <li> Just okay.  </li>
            <li> Think that there are better mascaras out there for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used Loreal Double Extend for years and it was an excellent product before they decided to change it.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and don&#x27;t mind the extra time since my lashes are greatly improved!</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t irritate and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> ok, swipe, swipe, swipe again.  </li>
            <li> Let me swipe some more.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was more waterproof</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a try, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different mascaras, but I like this one the best because it DOES NOT SMUDGE.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I can feel the tubes loosen and come off, then splash more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;oreal cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for mascara.</li>
            <li> and I made sure to stock up on this as I will not be using another mascara ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Not waterproof, but I love the two step.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Depending on the position I sleep, I can sometimes go three days without redoing it or touching it up, no</li>
            <li> If you compare prices and is the best, there is no hold back to it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t fallen in love just yet, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> I love the tube mascara formulation; it stays put until you soak your eyes in warm water, then it comes off cleanly, without the use of a makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> So easy to put on and removes nice and easy with water and washcloth.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, looks nice, and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the best mascara in the world, and will hopefully continue to be made until the end of all things.  </li>
            <li> I rarely used both ends, but I loved how easily this mascara just peeled off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run at all - very clean.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, it loved it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend a good eye makeup remover to take it off though, this stuff really lasts!</li>
            <li> My lashes are blonde-tipped and on the shorter side, so the extension and volume this gives my lashes is significant!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this item is how easily removed it is.  </li>
            <li> This is super amazing so listen up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is super amazing so listen up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to put on both top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> The single best thing about this mascara is the way it comes off.</li>
            <li> very good mascara for daily use.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and is very easy to remove - all you need is warm water and it will just wash away if you gently wipe it off your eyes.</li>
            <li> the day I kept touching and lightly tugging on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes our faces look there best when were soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;also- GREAT for sensitive eyes and contact wearers (like me).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal, Blinc, DHC, Cargo, and Trish McEvoy, all with great results.</li>
            <li> Warm water and a washcloth is all you need at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the buy and permanent change in mascara choice.  </li>
            <li> Washing it off it actually kind of fun.</li>
            <li> Come right off with warm water and face wash and leaves no staining.</li>
            <li> It just takes warm water in the shower and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> I wrote this review to help other people looking for THE BEST mascara that you can count on.</li>
            <li> I finally did and have to say that it is a really good product!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s actually true!</li>
            <li> Perfect for touch ups if you make a mess--dab any spot with a wet cotton swab and voila!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and remove, &amp; I like the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get it all off at once.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look longer and removes easily.</li>
            <li> Easy off.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, comes off even easier with water.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily too...love it.</li>
            <li> Removes easily with water....  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply,  the lash primer works</li>
            <li> comes off easily with water.</li>
            <li> and it washes off so easily with just water.</li>
            <li> Comes off easily.</li>
            <li> and I can easily remover this product with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Easy to take off but doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li> I also like that I can remove it with water fairly easily.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily in a clump... no smudges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use even though 2 steps are required for application.</li>
            <li> Because it forms tubelike around eyelashes, removal is easy with the use of a make-up remover.</li>
            <li> to apply&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clump easily when used against directions (see below)&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> clean, mine clumped up into a (for lack of a better description) boogery texture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes off easy in the shower with soap.  </li>
            <li> So easy</li>
            <li> Taking it off is easy, I do it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and it comes off easily with water</li>
            <li> It forms tubes around my lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> So easy to remove too</li>
            <li> I guess the upside of that is that it&#x27;s easily removable,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to take off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Come off easily when you want it to.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely easy to take off in the shower</li>
            <li> Comes off easily in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Taking it off is really easy.</li>
            <li> , this makes your lashes longer and comes off easy-</li>
            <li> BUT it is sooooo easy to remove because of the Loreal Tubes.</li>
            <li> It also smeared really easily.</li>
            <li> What I like about it, is that when it comes time to take it off; it is so easy.</li>
            <li> this stays put and comes off easily with water.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, lasts all day, and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and just as easy to take off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also- while it does come off easily when you wash it off-</li>
            <li> Pros-feel like it&#x27;s conditioning my lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge, clump and comes off easily with water (hold a water soaked cotton wool pad on for 10-15 seconds then wipe away).&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and so easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Average results at best.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything under the sun (from the drugstores) and have asked around to see what people use and this is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is fine.</li>
            <li> I have blonde, non-existent lashes and it gives me huge, beautiful lashes and my eyes</li>
            <li> and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> which if fine for daytime wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know a great coat of mascara can make all the difference, so I envy those of you with lovely long lashes.</li>
            <li> Product looked fine.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fine.</li>
            <li> This mascara has quickly become a permanent fixture to my makeup box!</li>
            <li> BECAUSE ITS&#x27; A PAIN IN THE BUTT TO REMOVE, AND IF YOU TRY TO DO IT QUICKLY, YOU GET CASUALTIES IN THE FORM OF YOUR PRECIOUS EYELASHES!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> Comes off easily with warm water and gentle agitation.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes super long and full, and simply gorgeous!!</li>
            <li> SO, I have to say that I am THRILLED that this mascara removes just as easily as my favored Clinique does, yet ships to my door free and costs less.</li>
            <li> product comes off very easily in the shower or just by washing your face with hot water.</li>
            <li> I am notorious for not removing my makeup at night, and my eyes look perfectly made up every morning, except my eyelashes are bent a little from sleeping on them.  </li>
            <li> BEST mascara if you don&#x27;t like the dark undereye panda look!</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t advertise this amazing aspect more clearly</li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with that.</li>
            <li> I use good old Maybelline Great Lash on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and does not smear throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It almost seems too cheap..</li>
            <li> Takes a bit more time to apply but worth it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have time for that, but the mascara on its own works really well.</li>
            <li> Rather then rub the lashes from side to side, the instructions say smooth the tubes away from lashes with your fingertips.</li>
            <li> Washes off clean and easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> it stays put, it comes off miraculously clean and easy, doesn&#x27;t flake and run into your eyes and on your face-</li>
            <li> then just wipe the tubes away gently, or lightly pinch and pull with your fingertips and wallah.  </li>
            <li> but it was cheap.</li>
            <li> what the white &amp;#34;under coat&amp;#34; does on this mascara, but the over effect is great.  </li>
            <li> Then you just use your fingers to slide off the tubes, and you are make up free.</li>
            <li> It did clean easily.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s important), and I even fell in a pool while wearing it</li>
            <li> Although it takes more time to prime and then apply the mascara side, I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> That surprised me, as the product appeared to maintain its structural integrity - what I got off of my lashes with a good bit of effort came off as casts of my lashes.</li>
            <li> so I switched to just good old olive or coconut</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m purchasing 2 more of these right now</li>
            <li> The mascara comes off super easy at the end of the day with water</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and is super easy to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to remove with my fingers in the shower, doesn&#x27;t leave smudges or give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- remove super easily.</li>
            <li> so, removing it is super easy.</li>
            <li> Came off very easy when I wanted, but stayed on the whole time</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> the perfect mascara especially if other mascaras leave you with raccoon eyes by midday</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara without knowing how it would help with making my lashes look great, but after using it, I already know that it does a good job with volume and making it longer, especially with the white tube..</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have reviewed an item, and this is after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the hot water, but even with that it still requires more scrubbing than I want to do on my eye area.</li>
            <li> not much length or volume going on there and have yet to find a mascara that supplies both beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original tube mascara - \\&quot;Kiss Me\\&quot; brand for years.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day long and my eyes look great.</li>
            <li> so I decided to go with this since it was significantly cheaper and</li>
            <li> This mascara does not do that at all, and my lashes look significantly longer.  </li>
            <li> I, like many others, was blessed with pretty eyes but cursed with the shortest, almost non-existent eyelashes</li>
            <li> I have this on Subscribe and Save now because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the product.</li>
            <li> and I was excited about that.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it will be the first drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve ever repurchased.</li>
            <li> to use, long-lasting, great price, easy to find in make-up bag, effective brushes, natural looking and easy to remove simply with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It gives really great length and volume, and although it makes my lashes stick together a little more than I would prefer, I still like the way it looks.</li>
            <li> This mascara was really good, and it made my lashes bold and they really stood out without looking like I had too much makeup on!</li>
            <li> I have always used the original double extend from Loreal and liked it, but thought this would be even better.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and live in a warm, humid area.</li>
            <li> If it gets touched by warm or hot water, it clumps and comes off in tubes - i.e. hot yoga</li>
            <li> This is simply the most amazing mascara.  </li>
            <li> did clean that skin with some oil-free eye makeup remover and cotton pads.</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use</li>
            <li> Beware though, you will need to clean up your sink afterward.</li>
            <li> So I scrape the brush nearly dry, put it on sparingly and the results are great.</li>
            <li> and I have to clean my sink after I&#x27;ve washed my make-up off.</li>
            <li> This washes off so cleanly.</li>
            <li> No need for special removers, no need for repeated scrubbing, no need for raccoon eyes - just went the lashes and wipe or pull the coating off the lashes.  </li>
            <li> If I have a special event or something</li>
            <li> It peels right off!</li>
            <li> she is right!</li>
            <li> But it is very similar in that it does clump very easily, does tug at some of your lashes and the product will flake into your eye ball!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite ever mascara, used MAC tubes and didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s true of all mascara.  </li>
            <li> easiest way to remove it is to put warm water on your lashes, either directly under the shower stream or with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> It feels so nice in your hand, and it looks all professional.    </li>
            <li> True to its name, this is quite lengthening and adds volume in a just-more-than-natural way.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it ideal for everyday use because it is a 2-step application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true in part</li>
            <li> a full 10 hour day and no flaking or smudging.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I&#x27;ve found will keep me looking good all day.  </li>
            <li> and its true-</li>
            <li> and I really do feel better in a lot of ways-</li>
            <li> and I really do feel better in a lot of ways-</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> Good mascara, and it will last all day.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say about this mascara is that it didn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> It does look good, but learning how to cover the white coat without sticking your lashes together is a process.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, because it really does make your lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> I love gently pulling off the tubing from the lashes.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this mascara to anyone trying to obtain full lashes without clumping or having the</li>
            <li> I do wish that it was a full bottle</li>
            <li> This mascara is so cool.  </li>
            <li> I love how much people compliment me eyelashes and woman</li>
            <li> just love this mascara so much.</li>
            <li> Even after an hour and a half of intense PE, my mascara looks perfect!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did last all day, and it also came off easily with warm water and a bit of soap.</li>
            <li> When I finally wash it off in the shower it comes off easily, though kind of dramatically since it comes off like plastic and still leaves no residue on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So it is easy to wipe away in the shower, but if your face gets wet you&#x27;re not going to have a good day.</li>
            <li> Washes off pretty easily in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality, easy to apply, dries quick, and washes away easily.</li>
            <li> it seems to be a nice product, however; you have to make sure you cover all the white or you look funny</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it; I used to have to clean mascara off with 3 separate methods just to remove it all: washing with soap, wiping with an eye makeup remover, then wiping with a QTip with moisturizer on it,</li>
            <li> It alright for quick length when you don&#x27;t feel like layering mascara on.</li>
            <li> Everyone has different chemistry, and things work differently for people, but this is the perfect mascara for me.</li>
            <li> I super recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do not like that it dries out so quickly.</li>
            <li> As a busy Mom and one who doesn&#x27;t enjoy primping, unless it&#x27;s for a night out on the town, I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> And yes, you have to be sure you cover the white which takes some more TLC.</li>
            <li> a quick face wipe time in bed anyway.  </li>
            <li> a quick face wipe time in bed anyway.  </li>
            <li> just put ur face under the warm shower and gently grab ur eye lashes without really pulling hand</li>
            <li> The reason I love this mascara so much is that it plumps up my lashes, but mainly because it comes off easily and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I think there is no other kind I would buy.  </li>
            <li> I have used Clinique&#x27;s High Impact mascara for years and years, primarily for the easy &amp;#34;warm water removal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> On a positive note it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The only difference is this one seems to come off the lashes easier, warm water and it pretty much slides right off, which is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> If I could remember what the other type or types I used many years ago that I liked, I would buy those.</li>
            <li> I have had it for about a month and love it more and more everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it&#x27;s the only one that comes off cleanly and easily.  </li>
            <li> love this mascara, and I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s way cheaper than some other tube mascaras on the market.</li>
            <li> However, it is strange in a good way, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> This REALLY works as advertised, I love it, It&#x27;s by far my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Benefit&#x27;s brand, but this is my new love for going out.</li>
            <li> I live in Europe and i can&#x27;t buy her in here because she isn&#x27;t able to by not even by l&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li> Plus it really does extend my lashes and is so easy to take off.  </li>
            <li> its super useful for vacations.  </li>
            <li> its super useful for vacations.  </li>
            <li> the first unit that i open its good.</li>
            <li> I hope the next be so good as this first.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge, run or flake, and is easy to take off with just water and gentle wiping with a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> and I must say this is the best mascara I have ever used,its long lasting n gives volume to your lashes.</li>
            <li> No runs,washes of easily and does really make lashes look noticeably longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty neat!</li>
            <li> But it is a product you need to learn to apply and take off properly, and with practice you will love it!</li>
            <li> No smudging for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s pretty explainable!</li>
            <li> Lash primer makes lashes more lush!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of all times because it comes of with warm water and does not leave black marks under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Finally, a cheaper product that I can more easily find in the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, this can clump, but I just apply to clean lashes, first wiping the wand on the rim of the tube to remove the excess.  </li>
            <li> To take it off at night, I just splash my eyes with warm water a few times and very lightly rub my eyelashes with my finger.</li>
            <li> FYI, the one I received from Amazon was very dry like it wasnt store in good condition.</li>
            <li> know how normal mascara is quick and easy to put on-</li>
            <li> and you are competent enough to know how to accurately apply mascara-</li>
            <li> This is my favorite type so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> The wait is so powerful</li>
            <li> effect to the look of this mascara that makes it worth the application and removal effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason this type of mascara is worth it:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is considerably cheaper than most tube mascaras I found&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara so far</li>
            <li> this is your golden ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but its SO worth it to give it trudge through the declumping process.  </li>
            <li> but again- worth</li>
            <li> in my opinion- its worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m using it up more frequently, but I think its drying in the tube.</li>
            <li> When the mascara is fresh, it comes off in tubes when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I was getting it via Amazon Subscribe and Save - a fresh tube every month.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Simply just with warm water.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> Fresh product.</li>
            <li> Not that I would advise to leave it on for that long, can&#x27;t be good for your eyes... ;)</li>
            <li> It only comes off when I take a warm shower and rub my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because you really have to wash it off good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this to use the fiber coating, but stick with Maybelline Colossal Volume.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Favourite, only kind I purchase now.</li>
            <li> I rarely use that end of the precut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> doesnt even come close to Maybelline Colossal volume.</li>
            <li> I swear by this mascara - discovered it over 6 years ago and have only used this kind since.</li>
            <li> It is the only kind I can use without getting raccoon eyes (even waterproof mascaras &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; for me).  </li>
            <li> It coats my lash nicely with the extra volume but it also pull out my lashes when removing it.</li>
            <li> There is some clumping, or a lot of clumping if you&#x27;re not doing it right, but overall it&#x27;s a nice mascara.</li>
            <li> REALLY Lengthening, volume, and super EASY removal - just wipe off with warm wet wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara, the extra time is worth having longer lashes!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great little product.</li>
            <li> you are right handed.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> and it comes right off</li>
            <li> It comes right off.</li>
            <li> Once it loosens it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> they come right off.</li>
            <li> Then I just touch them and the mascara lifts right off my lash.</li>
            <li> they come right off.</li>
            <li> Then I just touch them and the mascara lifts right off my lash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the right angle to apply the stuff to my lashes because the handle keeps hitting me in the face, so I end up with lashes that get clumped together.</li>
            <li> Zero irritation (not even those fumes that can make your eyes water right after you put it on) and the extensils STAY PUT.  </li>
            <li> So, when it is time to remove it, it just comes right off with water and like two swipes.</li>
            <li> As for taking it off, it pulls right off in the shower after letting the steam soak them for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> and it slides right off.</li>
            <li> Love how easy it is to take off at night, and I can wear it light or heavy depending on the look</li>
            <li> A nice first tubing mascara especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Washes off cleanly with gentle cleansers (Neutrogena).  </li>
            <li> It also comes off very easily with just water, no makeup remover necessary.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully they will make a new formula that is more gentle on eyes.</li>
            <li> So easy to clean off too, when I wet my face in the shower then lightly run my thumb and forefinger across my lashes the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; come right off and look like well formed eyelashes coming off.</li>
            <li> My lashes stuck together the whole day, and even though I used eye makeup remover and oil cleanse my face, my lashes were STILL sticking together and clumping for a full three days after using this.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use another L&#x27;oreal mascara on top of it if I really want it to be thick, but this one is good in itself.</li>
            <li> If you want the long lash look and can&#x27;t afford extensions or the pricy extension mascara, this is a nice compromise.  </li>
            <li> Once soaked you pull it off with your fingertips and it comes off easy in rubbery little strings, which is totally cool :)</li>
            <li> Take it off with a warm moist towelette and just a little light rubbing.</li>
            <li> My phone pictures are not that good, but there is rarely ever any smearing around the eye area, no matter how sloppy I am when applying it, that is my favorite part.</li>
            <li> so it is super fast application product.  </li>
            <li> But despite the extra care and the cons above, this is a great mascara to keep in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> I would love a Brown for daytime use, and maybe even a blue for fun.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much because I have nearly non existent eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Possibly, if I had younger skin, I would not have experienced that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the Blinc mascara is far superior in application, lengthening and building, and especially in removal.</li>
            <li> then apply it well, and have a safety pin handy to separate clumped lashes before they dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, especially after spending $25 every couple months on Blinc which is basically the same product.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara - five stars for the product, but only when it is a fresh tube.</li>
            <li> and this by far is my absolute favorite</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add much volume which I don&#x27;t care for anyways because I prefer more of a natural look.</li>
            <li> The first couple times you wash this off in the shower, it is kind of freaky, it looks like black spider legs coming off, but it rinses off clean.  </li>
            <li> Why did they mess with a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Why did Loreal have to mess with a good thing?</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants long lasting mascara that makes their eyes look great!</li>
            <li> I just splash my eyelashes with water, very gently pull the mascara off</li>
            <li> so just watch out, be VERY gentle and patient when taking this off...</li>
            <li> Like rubber.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara dries off very fast , so</li>
            <li> Very gently rests on the eyelashes and visibly udlinyaetyu eyelashes stick together.</li>
            <li> I loved the old tube of Double extend in the white and gold container--haven&#x27;t been able to find it, so</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as some of my other favorite mascaras</li>
            <li> My new go-to daily lash blast - LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I think I prefer the one in the blue package that Loreal makes a little better, but this one works good too.</li>
            <li> I always love this mascara as it&#x27;s non traditional.</li>
            <li> I washed my face twice afterwards, and still had residue in my eyes for the next day or more.</li>
            <li> Double Extend has been my go-to mascara for many years, since it first came to market.</li>
            <li> My lashes look long and thick, and the best part is, this is essentially waterproof until you wash your face with warm to hot water.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first tubing mascara</li>
            <li> It takes forever to make sure there isn&#x27;t any white from it showing</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> If you can afford more, definitely choose another brand.</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;d pass on this unless your budget won&#x27;t allow for better.</li>
            <li> It does not run if you get it wet, when you want it to come off use warm water to pre-soak</li>
            <li> stuff that you&#x27;re supposed to put on your lashes before is pretty goopy.</li>
            <li> First of all I got to say, this is NOT designed for volume.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change about this mascara would be to add more color choices.  </li>
            <li> -I can tell the difference in my lashes when I&#x27;m wearing this versus when I&#x27;m wearing regular mascara; it does make my lashes look longer and fuller (adds more volume).  </li>
            <li> I generally love L&#x27;Oreal products, especially their Voluminous mascara which I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> fact, after my first use of the product and my difficulties removing it, I thought I must have misread the package whilst in the store and had accidentally purchased waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> First, it does lengthen my lashes, maybe not 60%, but still noticable.  </li>
            <li> stuff was $40 a tube when it first came out as a Lancome product in the 80s.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not waterproof.</li>
            <li> do your taxes better, but, if you actually want it to *stay* in your lashes, this is the one you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it dries pretty</li>
            <li> thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally found something as the way</li>
            <li> mascara is my favourite one, since the first time that i use her.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first time that i buy to you, and i buy and soon bought three units.</li>
            <li> &quot; I was to apply first.  </li>
            <li> I would gladly give the white stuff up for a longer tube of mascara.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Works way better than those so called big brands.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold up pretty well - no raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> The only con I can see if that it gives more length than volume.</li>
            <li> Really enhances eyelashes length!</li>
            <li> but when I use the growth side(white side) it really made my lashes grow!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order again when I finish with my mascara. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Just stick to the old style, it worked fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love the price, especially on my subscription, but if the price keeps creeping up</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> , actually I love it for me, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OH my god, the first time i tried to remove it, it was NOT coming off even though YES i read and followed the directions.  </li>
            <li> First time in my life I haven&#x27;t looked like a raccoon by 10am.</li>
            <li> First time on this product, I thought it ruined my lashes.</li>
            <li> I actually like it better w/o primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I love it because I only wear this and cover up as make up and touch my face a lot.</li>
            <li> I have always used this product since it first came out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the white primer end of this mascara.</li>
            <li> I usually will use a brand that provides more volume and then layer this on top</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever for anything on Amazon</li>
            <li> I love the tubes because they last all day and don&#x27;t make me look like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product even though it does not last long before it gets clumpy both in the bottle and on your lashes.  </li>
            <li> or if I put too much on and it&#x27;s hot out it will smudge underneath my eye, but that&#x27;s rare.  </li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used some pretty expensive ones from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Love it even though I never use the white end.</li>
            <li> Blinc has a similar product but for more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> My favorite make up item in my extensive arsenal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara since it first came out.  </li>
            <li> I wore it for 10+ hours for the first time today, and realized it was making my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> Use a good eyelash curler with this and it can look gorgeous, similar to false lashes.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and once dry</li>
            <li> It coats your eyelashes with a very flexible, almost soft plastic coating that comes off easily with water and does not EVER smear or get crunchy.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily and apparently the primer is conditioning for your lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ive gotten to the point where I can put this on as quickly and easily as normal mascara.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ive gotten to the point where I can put this on as quickly and easily as normal mascara.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is non clumpy and stays on incredibly well even through long, active work days or exercise.</li>
            <li> I really cannot tell you how much this one small addition to my routine makes me happy.  </li>
            <li> The two step doesn&#x27;t really take up much more time, no more time than it takes to add a couple more coats.  </li>
            <li> I have other mascara for \\&quot;evenings,\\&quot; but to be honest -- I still use this because it is so worry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to look so severe during the day with a black mascara against my fair skin and light hair, but the black is fine.</li>
            <li> Finally, it is nice to be active, swim, sweat, tear up at a wedding, and not have to worry about my mascara running.</li>
            <li> The main problem I have with ordering this mascara from Amazon is that I think it is not as fresh as what I can buy from Target, for instance.</li>
            <li> The length is good, but better with the primer unfortunately.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you really coat your lashes with the white stuff before using the mascara.  </li>
            <li> I saw an earlier review that said she wore this through labor and delivery of her child and it stayed on and still looked good when she got back</li>
            <li> It was very strange at first, but now I love it.</li>
            <li> To remove mascara from your lashes, just wash gently with a warm, wet washcloth or let the shower head splash yours and then wipe gently with your fingers.</li>
            <li> it just makes my whole bedtime routine much quicker !</li>
            <li> However, it dries out pretty fast and starts getting spidery and clumpy after about a month.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love how long it stays on.  </li>
            <li> My eyes popped out more because of the long lashes framing them.</li>
            <li> i was VERY DEPRESSED after losing about TWELVE lashes on the first removal.  </li>
            <li> When I applied it straight over the primer the first time, my lashes became gooey and stuck together</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t believe those lush full eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t have problems with it flaking off into my eyes during the day, and the color is nice and dark</li>
            <li> Amazon quickly replaced it - I literally received a new one the next day - and it was fine.</li>
            <li> after my hair is washed, I wash my face with my normal cleanser and the tubes come right off.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes look fake, super easy to take off with warm water and face wash.</li>
            <li> It did much better when I let the tubes dry</li>
            <li> But now before I put it on in the morning I comb out my eyelashes before putting a light coat of the white stuff on first.</li>
            <li> I can even forget to take it off at bed and just as easily remove in in the shower the next morning or while washing my face.  </li>
            <li> Instead of leaving smudgy black goop everywhere, it slides off in tubes when you apply warm water and let it soak in for a minute or so.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite mascara of all times because it comes of with warm water and does not leave black marks under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras when dry are chalky.</li>
            <li> It not only lengthens the lashes it does not smear easily.  </li>
            <li> certainly isn&#x27;t a volumizer.</li>
            <li> You look like you&#x27;re not even wearing mascara, just like you&#x27;re blessed with long, thick, amazing lashes of your own.</li>
            <li> If you want nice defined lashes without the mess, go for Lash Blast.</li>
            <li> The best way is to apply the white coat then immediately after do the same lash with the black coat.</li>
            <li> The white end really makes it show up where to put the black and my lashes look great.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> While it certainly does create a \\&quot;tube\\&quot; around your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t extend them much, if at all.</li>
            <li> i went from a super high to a super low.  </li>
            <li> By comparison to blinc, its a lot thicker which is nice, however it does feel a little drying on your eyes after several hours where bounce is much more sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m staying with this Double Extend and hope it&#x27;s forever available and well stocked.</li>
            <li> This mascara really does stay on until washed off.</li>
            <li> It bothered him so much at breakfast that he wanted me to go take it off.</li>
            <li> It added some real length to my lashes without being gaudy or gooey looking.  </li>
            <li> ; say to throw away mascara after a couple months, but with this one you really have to.</li>
            <li> It sets my curled lashes very well and does not smudge at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It really is.</li>
            <li> That being said, it really clumps.</li>
            <li> Somehow they don&#x27;t attach to the hair itself or bond and really does just encase it.</li>
            <li> I might as well say I don&#x27;t like the primer much and don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> While this is a very affordable option for a tubing mascara, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided to try &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li> It becomes very sticky soon.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it doesn&#x27;t remove this stuff no matter how much I rub.</li>
            <li> It really does make lashes look quite a bit longer</li>
            <li> But, I was all ready used to using a primer mascara.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t provide as much extension as it claims.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so reasonable.</li>
            <li> that reads a bit like a legal disclaimer, doesn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use this product instead of getting my eyelashes dyed (I&#x27;m blonde, with light lashes).  </li>
            <li> It makes your lashes look longer, curlier, and VERY defined.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s just too much</li>
            <li> really helps with building length and volume.</li>
            <li> so I need a primer to add much length.  </li>
            <li> and it really does extend my eyelashes to where strangers often complement my eyes.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really brush them to fix this either because the mascara dries into what they call &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; and they just pull off when you try.</li>
            <li> but really really despise the work and raccoon eyes and redness of the removal</li>
            <li> really really wipe that wand off on the sides of the tube opening.  </li>
            <li> itself- really scrape off excess from the applicator.</li>
            <li> which wasn&#x27;t much time to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which wasn&#x27;t much time to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll have very clumpy looking lashes.</li>
            <li> , it works well, builds lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump (much) when it&#x27;s being applied.  </li>
            <li> It can be a bit clumpy if you put too much of either the primer or mascara on</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes seem much thicker and longer</li>
            <li> Yes, it does remove like a dream when you are ready.</li>
            <li> It comes off in tubes and flakes and no matter how much you wipe, it all remains under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I found that my lashes get very brittle with this product.</li>
            <li> It absolutely makes your lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that Blink&#x27;s formulation stays wet longer, but it also costs substantially more than L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> There are several brands available.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed and it was absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascera.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> Well peels off really</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference?</li>
            <li> Really adds volume to your lashes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge and really makes my lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> really makes your eyelashes look longer</li>
            <li> This mascara really works.</li>
            <li> They looked very doll-like.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t give you much volume.</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to chemical smells and perfumes, to me this doesn&#x27;t have any smells.</li>
            <li> it gives SO MUCH VOLUME&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when I put it  on, I scrape the brush really well.  </li>
            <li> you have to be VERY PATIENT with taking it off, THEN it won&#x27;t damage your lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> w/ gentle face cleaner makes the &#x27;tubes&#x27; wash off intact.  </li>
            <li> Really holds the curl.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you don&#x27;t like to use make up remover around your eyes!</li>
            <li> I really like the mascara...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really use the nourishing serum because I&#x27;m always in a hurry in the morning.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference; the serum doesn&#x27;t help or hurt</li>
            <li> If you dab water on it, let the water sit for a while, you can just gently rub or pull the tubes off your eyelashes with your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I really like how this looks once</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m just waking my face in the sink, I splash water, and just rub the lashes gently with the tips of my fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> This really helps with my post menopausal lash loss</li>
            <li> And it really extends your lashes.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> It really gives you a polished look.</li>
            <li> so this was just way too much for me.  </li>
            <li> Lately I been buying tons of mascaras because I wanted a really good one.</li>
            <li> so if I wear regular mascara I get raccoon eyes when I smile or laugh.</li>
            <li> I wish they didn&#x27;t dry so quickly and look clumpy if I dont work quickly.</li>
            <li> apparently without it you don&#x27;t get that full lash look that buyers wanted</li>
            <li> I have tried many different waterproof mascaras, and while some are better than others, even the most expensive ones resulted in the raccoon look before I was ready to wash it off.  </li>
            <li> I own this mascara for a few months now</li>
            <li> I previously used the Trish McEvoy High Volume mascara which I liked but was too pricey.  </li>
            <li> Comes right off in the shower with no mess!</li>
            <li> It does a great job tubing my lashes and making them look super thick and long.  </li>
            <li> if you get caught out camping and have no hot water to wash your face, the mascara will still look good the next morning.</li>
            <li> I usued to have oily skin; now that I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and live in a dry climate, it&#x27;s more combination, but the eye area still seems to be oily.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that the Clinique mascara is healthier and likely has less chemicals etc, but at this moment in life…ease and convenience far outweigh my concern for what&#x27;s in my mascara :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is much better than I expected; it hasn&#x27;t smudged once!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the original (and hoping they dont discontinue it now).  </li>
            <li> Even when I apply other mascaras on top of this l&#x27;oreal, I do not have raccoon eyes when I was off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and prefer not to fuss with the area around my eyes too much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t really create &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If I want a more dramatic look, I just add a light coat of another mascara on top, and I still have the extreme definition, but a little more ooomph!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first about how the white side would work on my lashes but the black coats it perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended if you have any of the special needs I listed above!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove (by taking a wet washcloth and letting it rest on your lashes for a minute or two, then gently wiping).</li>
            <li> and it stays smudge free all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old to care that much!</li>
            <li> Let it dry on its own, and it&#x27;s usually just fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if its space age cosmetic snake oil or I&#x27;m just simply not leveled up enough in womanly things to understand how to make this look good.</li>
            <li> I usually slide the tubes off with my fingers and warm water in the evening before I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> It occasionally flakes, but never badly.</li>
            <li> The down side is that I have seen better thickening and lengthening mascaras.</li>
            <li> It takes a little more time to apply with the two different layers but so worth it!</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s kind of a pain to put it on as you would have to first apply the white layer and then the black.</li>
            <li> The only thing this may be good for is freaking someone out when you wash it off, since it looks like your eyelashes are falling out, little tubes.</li>
            <li> The mascara really does live up to the hype</li>
            <li> for the black, if you brush it more than twice, it clumps your lashes together</li>
            <li> more time putting on, less time taking off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it came of just as easily as always- just a wet paper towel.</li>
            <li> it stays put but comes off easily when wet but not until I take it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the dual mascaras and this one is basically entirely the same.</li>
            <li> I most definitely applied it properly, and am not a newbie to cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I only used it consistently for about a month when I first got it, but still, no difference.</li>
            <li> I recently noticed a picture of myself where my eyes were closed from squinting in the sun and noticed how nice and elongated my lashes looked.  </li>
            <li> me, a MUCH better choice is the \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Mascara\\&quot; in the gold and white tube.</li>
            <li> the older we become, the shorter our lashes are.</li>
            <li> It clumps my lashes together in a way that makes them look sparse when I have decent lashes to begin with.</li>
            <li> I started using the more expensive Trish McEvoy version of this and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and eyes; this product is an absolute dream to get off.</li>
            <li> bought it with high hopes</li>
            <li> I used to spend hours in high school layering on mascara and ended up l</li>
            <li> I tell everyone I know about it - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive eyes and find that most other mascara cause irritation or burning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too fat and short to really get to your smaller lashes easily.</li>
            <li> This adds more visible length than any other mascara I have found so far, which is why I continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> The previously packaged product in the white and gold tube is far superior.</li>
            <li> I like my mascara to be a little more volumizing than this one, but like the &amp;#34;extend&amp;#34; in the name implies it does the trick on making them appear longer.</li>
            <li> I do like mascara that provides a little more volume for when I go out at night, so</li>
            <li> I soak a cotton ball in very warm water and hold it in place - repeat a few times and gently pull down</li>
            <li> :)  Makes my lashes super dark, long, and wears all day!  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smudge as easy as other mascaras.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it smears quite easily &amp; clumps a bit, though not as badly as other products.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to remove...</li>
            <li> they might be pulling at their own lashes way too hard.  </li>
            <li> be pulling at their own lashes way too hard.  </li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover which usually does an excellent job removing everything, and it hardly got any of it off.</li>
            <li> &quot; I have the best of both worlds and none of the bad.</li>
            <li> Once it dries out, it doesn&#x27;t look great and it&#x27;s really difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> looks great but extremely difficult to remove at the end of the day</li>
            <li> After finally running out of my old favorite (Lashblast Fusion by CoverGirl), I decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li> I love how long my lashes are with this mascara they actually hit my sunglasses and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes look long and full.</li>
            <li> I have eye makeup remover which I normally use with a cotton pad before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> : how enormous it makes my lashes appear or how much fun it is to wash it off.  </li>
            <li> I normally have to use baby oil to get my waterproof mascaras off.</li>
            <li> the part everyone complains about is that its kind of sucks to put on.</li>
            <li> it will happen with normal mascara when you rub it off to.</li>
            <li> it will happen with normal mascara when you rub it off to.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes your eyelashes look so long and full.</li>
            <li> That being said, this is mascara is worth the extra 30 seconds because it doesn&#x27;t budge.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give much volume, pretty much only &#x27;adds&#x27; length.</li>
            <li> A two step process but worth the extra time.</li>
            <li> Remains waterproof in the pool as long as the water is cool and you don&#x27;t touch your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I normally use 2-3 swipes on each eye.</li>
            <li> It gives full long lashes.</li>
            <li> A great pairing of primer &amp; mascara equals long &amp; thick looking lashes.  </li>
            <li> But I didnt mind having it on for a swimming trip because it always comes off without black smears under the eyes! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have a problem with length, mine or short and don&#x27;t curl easily, but this mascara totally makes them stand out!</li>
            <li> The best (and also worst) thing about it is that it easily comes off with water.</li>
            <li> So far I have experienced very little clumping and that&#x27;s hard to find with these big brushes most cosmetic companies are pushing these days.</li>
            <li> This stiff is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I have about 8 different kinds of mascara in my purse right now, but since getting this mascara I haven&#x27;t used any of them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I discovered that there&#x27;s no easy and inexpensive way to order my favorite mascara online, and now with two littles, a trip to the mall isn&#x27;t as quick, easy, or fun as it used to be.</li>
            <li> makes my lashes look super long</li>
            <li> Your lashes are super long and no clumping.</li>
            <li> I will be loyal to this mascara as long as its on the market.</li>
            <li> : Tubing-type mascaras encase your individual lashes and are super easy to wash off with just water once dried.</li>
            <li> it makes my eye lashes appear super long</li>
            <li> it will easily come on ur hands and it doesn&#x27;t leave the dark circles under ur eyes if u accidentally sleep with it</li>
            <li> My lashes are well defined, pretty long and pretty natural looking.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that gives me massive volume and length, no smudges, stays fresh looking all day long, and still removes easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was in the market for a new mascara, and I chose this one, as the commercials I&#x27;ve seen for it made it irresistible.</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s time to throw it out and go out and buy a new one (in my case).</li>
            <li> I thought that this one thinking it was just a new packaging.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t end up buying it until 6 months ago because it costs $10 here where I live.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can live without this mascara and</li>
            <li> Tube mascara is my new fave.  </li>
            <li> My new &#x27;go to&#x27; mascara</li>
            <li> So glad I know i can find this on amazon for a reasonable price because it is hard to find in stores in my area now.</li>
            <li> As a result, the mascara in the tube can dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I often leave my make up on after working my late evening, and the next day, it still looks good.  </li>
            <li> No black under the eyes at the end of the day!!</li>
            <li> I am Asian, and therefore have very straight lashes.</li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite mascara since the one I usually use has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Makes eyelashes REALLY long and is easy to remove but at the same time stays put/doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, pretty clumpy overall.</li>
            <li> Once I finally got my lashes to a somewhat acceptable state, I covered the white with the top coat - which sort of melted throughout the entire evening, and then wouldn&#x27;t come off with even my strongest makeup removers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another tip: If you like to do multiple layers, wait until the first one dries so it builds.</li>
            <li> (whichever your personal curling method is), it will stay curled the whole day too!</li>
            <li> Additionally, the package appears to have been opened, so I&#x27;m not sure I feel safe using this.</li>
            <li> Does not come off until you want it off - better than the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> There is a white base-coat that is applied first on the lashes and the topcoat forms tubes around the lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s my favorite part about this mascara</li>
            <li> I love it for vacations with my boyfriend when face washing is usually nothing but</li>
            <li> I love it for vacations with my boyfriend when face washing is usually nothing but</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the formulas all seem pretty similar, the biggest differences are the  brushes and the effect they give your lashes.</li>
            <li> I remember watching the commercial for it for the first time</li>
            <li> (Which obviously they weren&#x27;t) other than that I love this mascara</li>
            <li> Please listen to your customers Loreal and go back to the original Double Extend.</li>
            <li> on the eyelashes, not under the eyes, unlike every other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Miraculously doesn&#x27;t get INTO my eyes - safe for my contacts!&lt;br /&gt;Comes off instantly with makeup remover!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But wow!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with the double mascara.  </li>
            <li> If this comes off it&#x27;s like little flakes that I can just easily wipe off.</li>
            <li> One of the primary reasons is how it washes away and doesn&#x27;t leave black clumps in the corner of your eyes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t budge all day, but easily comes off in a few seconds being soaked in water</li>
            <li> Thinking this was an old bottle sent to me as I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it worked much better</li>
            <li> I made sure to get all the clumps from the white side out of my lashes before applying the dark mascara.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t if I wet my lashes then use a make up or mild remover.</li>
            <li> stays on for the whole day, but it definitely flakes, even if you use the white end first.</li>
            <li> You should put the black mascara on top of the white primer</li>
            <li> Who wants to see a black mess under our eyes when we get that first glance in the mirror when we emerge refreshed from a nice long shower.  </li>
            <li> Some say it comes off easily with plain water, but I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So while it is wonderful at not smudging or smearing on dry skin, it will come completely off with any little bit of moisture, which to me, is worse than smudginglike a dream when you are ready.</li>
            <li> it is very important to get your eyes wet and keep the mascara wet until it loosens.  </li>
            <li> I save this for date nights, going out, special outings, or if I&#x27;m feeling like being a bit more dramatic on the eyes and have extra time.</li>
            <li> and i love the way it washes off in \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; rather than running down your face like a hot mess.</li>
            <li> However,  I&#x27;m willing to trade off on a little bit of length and definition in order to not have dark circles every day :)</li>
            <li> I may have been pulling my eyelashes out like crazy, but it was great.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Plus, since I have sensitive eyes I have to throw away my mascara every 3 months to prevent irritation and eye infections.  </li>
            <li> Again with sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I have extremely, short, sparse eyelashes, so I bought this not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> (so far for me, about every 4-6 months, which is how often we&#x27;re supposed to replace it anyway)</li>
            <li> It stays for the whole entire day without smudging, and once you have curled it before/</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve read this review this far, I would recommend you give this mascara</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read this review this far, I would recommend you give this mascara a try.</li>
            <li> This is probably my fifth tube so far.</li>
            <li> then it slides off your lashes with a gentle wipe as a solid without smearing all over you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when I pull it away the mascara is completely gone.</li>
            <li> The only issue I found with this is that you cannot put too much on or else you get spider legs instead of lashes.</li>
            <li> I had lash extensions and was told they wouldn&#x27;t ruin my natural lashes.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive eyes, this product will work for you.</li>
            <li> The wand creates stuck-together eyelashes and the white formula dries and hardens so fast that there&#x27;s no time to comb through and sort out all the clumps.</li>
            <li> When I remove it, it comes completely off.</li>
            <li> and then with such ease when I am ready.</li>
            <li> The problem is my lashes don&#x27;t look natural when I clump on mascara</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> But it takes prolonged and frequent rubbing (also speaking from experience).</li>
            <li> The three star rating is because I think the product was old.</li>
            <li> but overall it works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not stark at all.</li>
            <li> It leaves my lashes natural looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been SO jealous of people with long, pretty lashes.</li>
            <li> If you are also a makeup noob and/or avoid looking like an old woman, leave this product aside for the pros.</li>
            <li> It iliminates having to scrub and pull at your sensitive eyelids.</li>
            <li> I believe I received an old product.</li>
            <li> I have short lashes that are straight.</li>
            <li> When I opened the container, nearly nothing came off on the wand.</li>
            <li> Like I was sold an old product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an old saying.......</li>
            <li> it looks natural</li>
            <li> I think I will take and old rubber bristle brush and see how that does.</li>
            <li> and it was completely unsmudged and intact.</li>
            <li> The mascara will \\&quot;tube\\&quot; and it almost feels like rubber or soft plastic.</li>
            <li> Only guidance is be gentle on your eye lashes when removing so you do not pull out your lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Occasionally comes off in flakes when washing it off, but I much prefer that over continuously wiping off the mascara smears.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive skinned</li>
            <li> Big mistake, I returned whatever I had purchased immediately for a fresh tube of Double Extend Beauty Tubes.</li>
            <li> I find that the product is worth buying even though I only use the white end of the tube.</li>
            <li> It has a 2-step process that requires extra time (2 minutes, big deal) but it&#x27;s so worth it given</li>
            <li> ok, i don&#x27;t have thick and numerous lashes to begin with, so i go for mascaras that REALLY pump of the volume and length.  </li>
            <li> it looks like im wearing fake lashes (in a good way!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They can stick to the tub or shower pan and dry on, so make sure to wash them down the drain.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other cheap mascara.</li>
            <li> They come off your eye lashes easily, but the small bits got into my eyes and were all over my face and clothes.  </li>
            <li> Usually washable mascaras run, but are easy to get off and waterproof mascaras stay put, but I can sometimes irritate my eye area trying to get it off.</li>
            <li> So while it is wonderful at not smudging or smearing on dry skin, it will come completely off with any little bit of moisture, which to me, is worse than smudging</li>
            <li> The only downside is that you really can&#x27;t reapply - but taking it off and putting it back on is so easy because you just need a little water on your hands.</li>
            <li> And it don&#x27;t just grow a little it can grow as long as you want it to by putting on more coat.</li>
            <li> amazing mascara makes a little lengthening tube around your eyelash that only comes off with water and a little gentle friction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to completely clean off the applicator, before putting it away; this way you don&#x27;t have any small clumps of mascara mixing with the new mascara in the tube.</li>
            <li> As somewhat of a makeup hoarder, I think I&#x27;m pretty knowledgeable of good mascaras vs bad.</li>
            <li> No black smudges under my eyes,  </li>
            <li> Most tube mascaras are pretty expensive</li>
            <li> It only flakes as with and older and used tube of mascara.</li>
            <li> no black brown or brown.  </li>
            <li> First I use the white primer, wait about 30 seconds then apply to coats of the mascara before the white primer dries.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear it on the day I go swimming, because it would come off in tiny black strings in the pool, but other than that it is ideal to use everyday.  </li>
            <li> I tried maybe 10 different brands of waterproof and regular mascara from cheap drugstore brands to more expensive labels.</li>
            <li> It really does noticeably increase the length of my lashes, and is waterproof as long as you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; your lashes.</li>
            <li> I love that the mascara never rubs off, even after a long day and eye rubbing, and comes off completely while washing my face with my usual facewash.</li>
            <li> The only real difference is that it is a two step process, but it really doesn&#x27;t take me more that a few seconds longer than usual.  </li>
            <li> Plus no dark circles anymore- EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Far too often mascara is advertised as flake free, and long lasting, with easy removal, and then promptly fails to live up to any of those.</li>
            <li> one thing that I&#x27;ve found, that I would change, is that L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s formulation drys quickly, a little too quickly.  </li>
            <li> for the white conditioner, I&#x27;m not 100% certain of it&#x27;s functionality outside of</li>
            <li> I just stand under running water and gently rub my eyes down from top to bottom with eyes closed, using a wet facecloth.  </li>
            <li> I took one star off because there are other traditional mascaras that can really thicken and add plush volume, which this doesn&#x27;t do so much.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going out for the evening I&#x27;ll wear a different mascara, but this one is my new go-to for all-day wear.</li>
            <li> After about two to three months, you have to pitch it and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;- Looks gross</li>
            <li> Second tube was fine, but it makes your lashes really stiff and stuck together.  </li>
            <li> Bought this mascara based off all the great reviews, used it on one eye and immediately started desperately trying to remove it in the short amount of time I had before I had to leave.</li>
            <li> It does not, at least for me, wash off easily with water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not impossible to get it off, and in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it for the dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;ve switched back to my old mascara completely.</li>
            <li> My only complaint - it doesn&#x27;t come in brown - as a redhead, I love brown mascaras.  </li>
            <li> This nourishes my lashes and extends them such that over time my real lashes have grown so the lengthening effect is only improved over time!</li>
            <li> I have very short, straight lashes and this mascara definitely gives them a boost.</li>
            <li> The white base is awesome for lifting and lengthening my lashes.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily and makes my lashes so thick.</li>
            <li> I had it on auto ship every month because it dried out quickly</li>
            <li> For extra definition, use both the base coat and the mascara on top of your top lashes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it can be a little high-maintenance, I mostly use it for long days or nights out.</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to the descrption, and it makes my lashes very brittle.</li>
            <li> No other drugstore mascaras like this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge or run on my extremely oily skin in hot summer weather.</li>
            <li> and I  get major raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> So the first day I tried the conditioner on one eye, but not the other.</li>
            <li> There is no other product out there that can match it for my needs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Truly an amazing mascara if you want a long dramatic look that is very natural</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out, stays smooth and dark...</li>
            <li> I usually get better results when I don&#x27;t use the white site of the product and just go straight to the black side.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always use it with the white base coat, but when I do, it has a great plumping quality - you just have to make sure to cover up all the white with the black</li>
            <li> Personally, I have decently thick, very dark eyelashes, and a good length, but for the looks I go for</li>
            <li> After using this thing I looked like I had a few long lashes with huge gaps in between.</li>
            <li> There were huge flakes and clumps coming off slowly, sticking to my skin.</li>
            <li> This mascara creates long, lush, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive eyes and can not tolerate several types of mascara.  </li>
            <li> Even with careful application, it continually stuck my lashes together and really really stuck.</li>
            <li> for a while I tried using this stuff on my upper lashes and then using my old mascara on my lower lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried to use my eyelash comb thing to seperate and no deal - completely hardened and gross lashes.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way.</li>
            <li> and I totally recommend it for anyone in search of a smudge proof, natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li> When you are ready to remove it, just get it wet</li>
            <li> I just wet my fingertips, place them on my lashes and gently wipe off the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; using my thumb and index fingers.  </li>
            <li> It took me the same amount of time using this as it would for me to use 2 coats of my old mascara.</li>
            <li> The old Double Extend formula was my go-to for years.</li>
            <li> It was apparently designed to be used by giants.</li>
            <li> In order to remove them, wet your lashes, squeeze gently, then they rinse off.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, it stayed on all day, and felt the same as my normal mascara (no itchy eyes or irritation with it).</li>
            <li> -Kind of difficult to remove, since it creates a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; of mascara on each lash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the wrong kind of mascara for 25 years.</li>
            <li> like fake eyelashes that you encase your own lashs in.  </li>
            <li> So what I do is apply this for incredible length, and do the base of my eyelashes, after it dries, with a little bit of my previous favorite which I have lots of on hand.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true it droops down the first few applications, but when I curl it again with the product, it actually stays curled.</li>
            <li> Make sure to remove it if you&#x27;re going swimming or there will be little black tubes floating in the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble applying the mascara because the tube is so huge that I can hardly get it around the right side of my head to get the brush to my lashes.</li>
            <li> It really does last all day long!</li>
            <li> I actually had the Novalashes for a while, but they became expensive to maintain, though they looked beautiful and were less maintenance for me.  </li>
            <li> : if you wait too long, the mascara coat will not go on smoothly because the lashes will be a bit too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how one would look right after crying, or laughing, or how it would wear in the summer with perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how one would look right after crying, or laughing, or how it would wear in the summer with perspiration.    </li>
            <li> I take it off, I just splash water on my eyes a few times and then whoosh, the &#x27;tubes&#x27; slide right off, leaving no residue-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as other mascaras, I mean supply wise.</li>
            <li> It comes off in clumpy &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; versus smears.&lt;br /&gt;Probably not good for my lashes, but I wear it for 2 days easily sometimes.</li>
            <li> No better than any other mascara I have used so not too sure what the hype is about the &amp;#34;extended tubes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is not for lazy people who want to put on mascara quick..</li>
            <li> It goes on much thicker and darker than any I have tried, making my lashes look star quality almost fake length and thickness from my natural light and short ones.</li>
            <li> I wet a cotton pad with some eye makeup remover and press lightly on my eyes for 1-2 minutes, then do the little zigzag motion while whiping it downwards.</li>
            <li> I wet a cotton pad with some eye makeup remover (Neutrogena) and press lightly on my eyes for 1-2 minutes, then do the little zigzag motion while whiping it downwards.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean off</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than some other options.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wear it in the ocean and pool since it&#x27;s not waterproof, but those other waterproof kinds irritate me so much</li>
            <li> I use eye make-up remover pad to remove this mascara, and I really like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or blacken my eye like other mascaras do.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin around my eyes, and other mascaras almost always smudge under my eyes and makes me look like a football player.</li>
            <li> It was also hard to clean off at end of the day.  </li>
            <li> One thing to have in mind with this mascara is that you need a little extra time to put it on correctly, but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> one layer for office, then add another for a more dramatic look on the way to cocktail hour.</li>
            <li> think maybe Amazon should not sell cosmetics as this is the 2nd item I have ordered recently that appeared to be old and unusable.</li>
            <li> If you try this, you will never go back to your old generic mascara!</li>
            <li> You have to be fast about getting it on; you can only layer it while it&#x27;s still wet.  </li>
            <li> You only have to rub a little water on it then pull them right off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And if that wasn&#x27;t enough- the length and girth this gives my lashes is like no other mascara ive ever used.  </li>
            <li> Upper white coat then right away the black coat.</li>
            <li> Originally I was a bit skeptical ordering this product because I hadn&#x27;t heard much about it.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look twice as long, but is natural looking and not clumpy.</li>
            <li> I naturally have a lot of lashes and they are fairly long too.</li>
            <li> First tube I bought was completely dried out</li>
            <li> The black color is not a dark black but more like a dark gray.</li>
            <li> I generally use Blinc (kiss me) tubes and love it, but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I previously used a two step maybelline XXL intense, which is designed for volume and length.  </li>
            <li> mascara seems to only be available in black, and blackest black.</li>
            <li> It really stretches your lashes and you fill in with the black.  </li>
            <li> It seemed dry and that gives me reason to believe it was old.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t add enough volume, but using multiple coats is apparently the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I received this mascara, the white primer side was completely dried up.</li>
            <li> Cover Girl Super Thick Lash.</li>
            <li> I recommend using the white, not letting it dry, and immediately applying the black right afterwards.</li>
            <li> Two coats of the primer really makes a difference before adding the final black coat.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how quickly I go through the tube.</li>
            <li> The coating is rich and doesn&#x27;t feel dry or chalky in the least and glides through really smoothly - something I never much paid attention to in the past.  </li>
            <li> If you do all four of your lashes first with the white then do the black after it gets dry and doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> The basecoat is ok but seems a little thick as compared to my clinique version.  </li>
            <li> This product did not give me full or long lashes and was incredibly hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Good concept and idea, bad performance.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal creates a very pretty, natural look of long, soft lashes without looking like fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Both ends of this product are dry as if they are old or were exposed to extremely dry temperatures.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I use it as an everyday natural looking eyelashes , because it&#x27;s not very black .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a mascara that does not end up in black smudges under my eyes and here it is!  </li>
            <li> I left off one star for the drying out issue, but it really should be 4.75 stars because that&#x27;s a small issue considering the benefits of this product.</li>
            <li> I use facial cloths at night and these usually remove the mascara without too much work.  </li>
            <li> The main turnoff for me is that this mascara is SO MESSY.</li>
            <li> I tried a few in high school and gave up.  </li>
            <li> unless I cake my lashes with the mascara, some white remains uncovered and looks strange.  </li>
            <li> I have one concern on how long the tube will last as I&#x27;m noticing crusting on the side of the tube...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to take the extra time to apply this carefully, then by all means, use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes and it make them look short and stuck together!!!</li>
            <li> The white stuff is what stretches to make the long end tubes.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t stand to give this a two star rating--so just use it on those extra long days/nights where you know you won&#x27;t have time for raccoon eye check ups.</li>
            <li> and I got the strange sensation of my upper and lower lashes sticking together.</li>
            <li> I use to have long lashes but after the wear and tear of cleaning off makeup and all they have gotten very short.</li>
            <li> Since I already have naturally long eyelashes, it extends them even further.</li>
            <li> But that is only a minor problem.</li>
            <li> If you have pretty thick lashes, then maybe it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are like little tubes, and become very pliable, almost \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; when they get wet.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are like little tubes, and become very pliable, almost \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; when they get wet.  </li>
            <li> I will forever use this product and only this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market!</li>
            <li> The first time you use it and wash it off, it freaks you out a little, because it comes off in little tiny tubes.  </li>
            <li> Very long lasting!!</li>
            <li> Washes off quite easily, although does feel weird coming off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait for the white part to dry.  </li>
            <li> This reminds me of CoverGirl professional *waterproof* mascara the way it used to be before they changed the formula (and made it less smudge-proof).</li>
            <li> The only time it smudges is when it&#x27;s still wet and gets on my upper lid</li>
            <li> This mascara does make your lashes full and long, but I got tired of the two step process.</li>
            <li> Either that, or the tube I got was very old and partially dried up.</li>
            <li> I will never ever go back to using plain old mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other ones, including some of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s newer mascaras, but I continue to go back to Double Extend.</li>
            <li> Compared to other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in my lifetime, this is the most difficult to get off (besides waterproof types).</li>
            <li> A little messy to remove the stings of mascara, but does so easily with hand lotion or plain water rinses.</li>
            <li> Tip: A little olive oil completely removes the mascara.</li>
            <li> a little all natural foundation, eye brow pencil, lip gloss and now....</li>
            <li> this stuff- not a fleck, not a drop, not a trace of mascara anywhere after just a little water and soft wiping or pinching.  </li>
            <li> Black and Blackest Black doesn&#x27;t give much variety.  </li>
            <li> It came off easily and didn&#x27;t leave any black residue behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no black mess on your face cloth or your towels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For the reasons above, I found this pretty tough to apply to lower lashes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other tube mascaras several years ago, then went back to regular mascara, which always left me slightly raccoon-eyed.</li>
            <li> It really lengthens and plumps up my lashes, without making them clumpy and icky.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lasts a long time without any smudging.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t seem separated, there was absolutely no added volume apparent, and finally, the lengthening effect only worked sparsely on a few lashes here and there.</li>
            <li> I have one of those lashes that might be too long or too curved that, although it doesn&#x27;t look like it touches the bottom part of my eyes, it must.  </li>
            <li> I want really long looking lashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely clumping for me, even with careful application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not thinking for long considering it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;full tube&amp;#34; per say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubts in my mind that the reviewer who gave birth wearing this and the lady who went camping for a week with it on are lying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a long time.</li>
            <li> The use of this wand is strange for me.  </li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> The primer goes a long way, don&#x27;t need to put a lot on the eye lashes and then end with one coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> I cannot have long, luxurious lashes -</li>
            <li> This mascara stays on all day long with no smudges and no flaking.</li>
            <li> It is harder to apply than regular mascara.</li>
            <li> The only way it comes off is in the shower or if you soak your lashes with a wet washcloth or cotton ball for 30-60 seconds.</li>
            <li> so it looks like I have 3 or 4 long, spiky lashes -</li>
            <li> you just aren&#x27;t getting them wet enough.  </li>
            <li> lets see how long this stuff stays</li>
            <li> you just aren&#x27;t getting them wet enough.  </li>
            <li> lets see how long this stuff stays</li>
            <li> makes my eyelashes look like they&#x27;re naturally long.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes</li>
            <li> I thought it took to long to put on.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t mind, as long as I like the stuff.</li>
            <li> searched a long time for mascara that didnt end up under my eyes.</li>
            <li> In fact, they are so long..</li>
            <li> I had given up on wearing mascara for a long time bc</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes really long, and I can curl them again after applying the 2 steps.</li>
            <li> Lashes are very stiff (but look pretty); product dries out a little faster than regular mascara</li>
            <li> It would either cause dark circles under my eyes or be impossible to remove - especially the waterproof kind.  </li>
            <li> start with the white and brush on like a regular mascara and follow on with the black mascara.  </li>
            <li> After the white coat you put on the black one to cover the white.</li>
            <li> One end has a conditioner that is white colored and then use put the black color over the white.</li>
            <li> If you apply enough black to cover all the white you run the risk of smudgy lashes.</li>
            <li> Using the white side and then the black, it lasts all day and then sometimes into the next day.</li>
            <li> My lashes are very long, but they&#x27;re invisible, so long doesn&#x27;t matter if you can&#x27;t see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes the black layer doesn&#x27;t completely cover the black layer, so some white still shows.</li>
            <li> I have tried other mascaras, but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> My lashes look so long when I wear this mascara!  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes twice as long!  </li>
            <li> I only wish it came without the other end.</li>
            <li> how well this mascara has stays on all day long!</li>
            <li> Other one-step mascaras produce similar results.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because the primer can get a little clumpy and requires occasional wiping of the applicator.</li>
            <li> So overall it beat the other department store brand.</li>
            <li> This makes them look LONG!</li>
            <li> I second all those other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;stays</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found several on my neck and other body parts.</li>
            <li> It hardens differently than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> But cleanup is not the same as with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> The mascara makes my lashes very long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wait for the primer to dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions say no need to wait for tube application to dry before putting on mascara.  </li>
            <li> and my lashes don&#x27;t stick when I dry in between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t let it dry at all before putting on the mascara.</li>
            <li> immediately - don&#x27;t wait for the primer to dry</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the product takes a quite a while to dry</li>
            <li> Clumpy, flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame you have to waste money to get the primer with the mascara, and that the actual mascara is in a tiny container.    </li>
            <li> The base was sticky, and at the end of everything my lashes were no longer or volumized than they are using Maybelline Great Lash, which for me is an everyday work mascara.</li>
            <li> The base and mascara dry pretty quick</li>
            <li> I know these things are subjective and my ability to measure any lengthening is clearly limited.</li>
            <li> but it is expensive and there is a short window when the consistency is just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands, from high-end to drugstore, mega waterproof products that smudged all over yet were impossible to remove, even brands from Japan that purport to stay on all day long yet end up giving me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;you have to understand that its not normal mascara.  </li>
            <li> Nothing crazy special, however!</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t come off until you hit water, then it comes off as a solid instead of running down your face.  </li>
            <li> Then look DOWN and WIGGLE the 2nd step on)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Occasionally I will find a small speck on my cheek which I will simply brush away like a loose lash.  </li>
            <li> It goes on OK, but seems to be impossible to remove fully</li>
            <li> There is an appearance of longer lashes, but only slightly.     </li>
            <li> (Warning: It does so in big strands which might look odd in the pool or at the beach.)&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the shape of my Asian eyes is what causes such issues with mascara in the past....</li>
            <li> once with the white end and once with the black.  </li>
            <li> I like the double sided tube so that you can prime your lashes before applying the black mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that there are two steps to the mascara process with this product - the white brush, then the black brush.  </li>
            <li> But what ultimately drew me away was that it slightly bothered my eyes.</li>
            <li> been riding through freezing fog, lashing rain, and this is the only mascara that has withstand the weather in Ireland for me - all year round biker.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for a really long time, so</li>
            <li> You never get raccoon eyes because it&#x27;s not capable of smearing once dry.</li>
            <li> : I always can&#x27;t use the black one to wholly cover the white one.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it comes off like black spider webs if you go in a pool or if it rains.</li>
            <li> The ones that I&#x27;ve found are either super expensive or a struggle to remove.</li>
            <li> Weak mascara--didn&#x27;t give my lashes much oomph.</li>
            <li> Since this mascara builds a tube around your lash, adding another while it&#x27;s wet will only pull the previous layer off.</li>
            <li> I have deep set eyes and long lashes, so I have a lot of trouble with my mascara rubbing off onto my brow bone - not a pretty look.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know about tubes, all it means that when the mascara is applied, it forms little tubes around the lash when it instantly sets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rich enough to throw even 9 bucks into the trash, but in this case I have to.</li>
            <li> so I was excited that L&#x27;oreal came out with this less expensive mascara that includes the primer.  </li>
            <li> I apply two coats of the base coat, then two coats of the mascara, and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the tube will last me</li>
            <li> and removing it always left the delicate skin around my eyes red and puffy</li>
            <li> I either put my face in the water (shower or tub), hold a wet cloth or paper towel to my closed eyelids, or use my hands as a min bath for my eyes in the sink to get it off.</li>
            <li> My only issue, which is to be expected for this effect really, is it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> As I have aged (60 years plus), my lashes, like my hair have thinned out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very graceful to remove.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> No real complaints.</li>
            <li> Be careful</li>
            <li> I have strayed away from it a few times but keep coming back.</li>
            <li> if I know my lashes will be getting wet.</li>
            <li> (although, I usually am not really too thorough about removing eye makeup at night, so there&#x27;s some remaining).</li>
            <li> It lasts all day with absolutely no smudging or flaking.  </li>
            <li> If you should happen to get it wet unintentionally, just don&#x27;t touch it.</li>
            <li> Or rub your eyelashes with wet fingertips.</li>
            <li> There are two steps to it, but only takes a few seconds and you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li> just take a wet paper towel, hold it over my eye to let the lashe tubes soak up the water-</li>
            <li> put a wet paper towel or wash cloth over them and let them soak the water.  </li>
            <li> put a wet paper towel or wash cloth over them and let them soak the water.  </li>
            <li> All you do is get your lashes wet in the shower and wait a couple seconds and the mascara comes off in tubes.</li>
            <li> Do one eye at a time so the white conditioning side isn&#x27;t dried before putting the mascara over it.</li>
            <li> the mascara comes off without any hassle when it gets wet</li>
            <li> This mascara, though, stays put (indefinitely) until you purposely wet it and rub your lashes.</li>
            <li> Um, still not really visible.  </li>
            <li> so I just use it for everyday use and a different one for going out.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear any because it ether looks fake or ends up all over my face..</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I only leave reviews if love or hate something, and I surelyhate this.</li>
            <li> I have to take my time to make sure I fully cover all the white base</li>
            <li> I get my face wet in the shower when I get in, and a few moments later</li>
            <li> As long as they sell this, I am not buying any other mascara!</li>
            <li> This is different from any other mascara in that it comes off neatly like little threads with just water.</li>
            <li> As a pale blonde, my eyelashes (and brows) are invisible.</li>
            <li> But, the regular black isn&#x27;t to dark.    </li>
            <li> I had tried this mascara before, then explored a few other brands before coming back to it.</li>
            <li> As a pet groomer my face gets wet at work and other mascaras run and cause darkness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Plus my lashes don&#x27;t dry out with this mascara, which means less chance they will fall out.  </li>
            <li> I was particularly intrigued by the false lashes effects it creates with the tubing mechanism.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof, but other washable mascaras leave goop over your lids when you go in water.</li>
            <li> I think it must be some type of material that makes the mascara wash off in the way it does, unlike any other product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and it have always been my go-to mascara despite buying and trying out other brand in between, none works as well as this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to cover by the black I have to use three different black mascaras just to cover the white</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &#x27;apples to oranges&#x27; when comparing all other mascaras and this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about that, but my lashes definitely have not been damaged by using this for years.</li>
            <li> change to my other hand so it faces in the correct direction.  </li>
            <li> other thing</li>
            <li> Recieved product, shipping was ridiculous by the way, i shouldve paid attention to it, but the white side was COMPLETELY DRY AND EMPTY.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because all my other mascaras kept smudging under my eyes, resulting in a panda-like experience.</li>
            <li> Every other mascara I have ever worn ends up under my eyes in a matter of hours.  </li>
            <li> Buying it at Amazon, along with other makeup products saves me money and time.</li>
            <li> I tried several applications on different days to see if I was doing it wrong, but got the same result every time.</li>
            <li> Other than that - this is it.</li>
            <li> One-third the price of other &amp;#34;lash coating tubes&amp;#34; mascaras.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other mascara after this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it builds up my lashes as well as other mascaras though.</li>
            <li> With other mascaras I usually use 2 or 3 pads, but with this mascara I only use 1 pad, which saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> I switched to this about six months ago because the other tubes mascara</li>
            <li> , I have even used it with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> It also never creates that under-eye shadow unlike other mascaras that flake off over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wear any other mascara.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t as wowed as some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> One end had a fortifier and the other</li>
            <li> I can just see the wrinkles adding up each time I am removing the other product.</li>
            <li> With other mascaras, I had to use lotion and q-tips to get the access off all the time.</li>
            <li> I never was asked this with any other mascara.</li>
            <li> Every other mascara I have ever tried has flaked and smudged, this mascara does neither.</li>
            <li> Even waterproof mascara does this due to the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have used for the past 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even other beauty Tube mascara products from other companies.  </li>
            <li> NYX Doll Eye and L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous are far better for length and volume, with the &amp;#34;false lash&amp;#34; look, than this awful product is.</li>
            <li> The tube is also thick and more awkward to hold and the application brush does not separate your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It gives that extra WOW factor without the time and money of keeping up fake lashes.</li>
            <li> If you want something that actually makes you have fuller, thicker, longer looking lashes without going the false eyelash route at a low price, this may be your answer.</li>
            <li> I have oily eyelids that cause all other mascaras to smudge or flake, resulting in unsightly dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> just wish it stayed wet a little longer.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when putting it on, it has a tendency to give little hairs on the tips of your lashes, so I would recommend using a mirror when applying.</li>
            <li> not sure why the other gal is having such trouble getting it off</li>
            <li> Normal mascarea gives me terrible racoon eyes--by the end of the work day I have dark pools under my eyes, with mascara gathered in every wrinkle and fine line.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to apply the second coat without it clumping on the lashes and also getting smudges where it shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> The applicator doesn&#x27;t do a well enough job of seperating the lashes for me, so it&#x27;s hard to get rid of the clumps that may develop.    </li>
            <li> Hard to rate an actual product if it arrives unuseable.</li>
            <li> Oh and just LOVE this stupid design</li>
            <li> but if your lashes get wet and you rub your eye whether it&#x27;s hot or cold water</li>
            <li> I exited the shower, the skin under my eyes was dark.</li>
            <li> Before using this, I used to have dark circles under my eyes...</li>
            <li> At least it actually adds up to the volume.</li>
            <li> I always ended up with dark circles under my eyes by the end of the day from my mascara falling off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a paid reviewer or product tester reviewer, just an average Joe.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a dark brown.</li>
            <li> It flakes/sheds so not worth the money or effort.</li>
            <li> It does give me thick lashes quite instantly, without having to apply over and over again.</li>
            <li> I have a mirror in my shower and after washing my face, there are these thick solid black masses going down my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Plus when I use my eye drops the mascara does not come off or run down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s down side is that sometimes the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; slide off when my eyes tear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that tend to get raccoon eyes by midday because my lashes point down, even after I curl them.</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
            <li> Mascara does come off a little bit sometimes, but it is nothing compared to the other mascaras that I have tried.</li>
            <li> the kind that no matter what mascara I use: volumizing, lengthening, thickening--nothing does much other than darken them, leaving me disappointed because the models in the ads (with their fake eyelashes) had such long, thick lashes just by using that brand&#x27;s mascara</li>
            <li> The primer went on find but as soon as I used the mascara it turned my lashes into about 5 large, ugly, short clumps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t waste endless amounts of potions, tissue, swabs and pads removing excess.</li>
            <li> And after I wash it off at night, I can wake up in the morning without any worry of having black clumps in my eyes.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use waterproof mascara, I have black smudges underneath my eyes</li>
            <li> This is a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> The two steps take no longer to apply that other mascara, as I usually put two coats of other brands on.</li>
            <li> It just &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34; off and doesn&#x27;t leave any embarrassing black streaks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less  sticky/ gooey</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but wanted to take the time for this product.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t scrub away - you wake up with black lines around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> and it takes me half the time</li>
            <li> and it takes me half the time</li>
            <li> The downside is that it gums up less than a month after opening up the tube.  </li>
            <li> under eye black eyes removing this item.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this smaller size does not provide the same level of lash extension that I was used to.</li>
            <li> I always end up with mascara smeared under my eyes after a half day or so.  </li>
            <li> and there is no yucky black smudgy marks ever.</li>
            <li> If you cry, you won&#x27;t have any black running.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First you apply a primer coat to help with length, then you cover it with the black mascara.</li>
            <li> Lashes are instantly half inch longer.</li>
            <li> and I get black streaks on my face or</li>
            <li> I use the black side for day, and both sides for evening.  </li>
            <li> This mascara really does give dramatic lashes!</li>
            <li> , I put this on for work with just a little bit of the other for volume, and my eyelashes kept hitting my glasses and even eyebrows!  </li>
            <li> This newer product is a mess.</li>
            <li> not good for swimming &amp; emotional situations&lt;</li>
            <li> I work outdoors in the summer, and my face is often a mess of sunblock, sweat, and water</li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s because my skill is not good enough~</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess to remove.</li>
            <li> Long thick lashes...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my lashes long and thick.  </li>
            <li> lashes are long and thick with this mascara</li>
            <li> it feels a little like paying for half a bottle some months.</li>
            <li> it seems to be a never ending process and leaves little black strings all over the place.</li>
            <li> In the shower I just wipe my eyelashes and it comes off in little tendrils, no smeary mess.</li>
            <li> It makes a nice hard base with the white side, and then the black latches on and forms long, thick lashes!!!</li>
            <li> It even made what little (almost nonexistent)</li>
            <li> I can put on as much or as little as I like.</li>
            <li> I washed my face and the little strings came off with it.</li>
            <li> It gives a little bit of volume as well.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like little mascara caterpillars that slide off.</li>
            <li> The thickener seems to be a little too rigid.  </li>
            <li> Like little jelly-like things coming off your eyes.</li>
            <li> Do not use if swimming because your mascara will come of in pieces like little spider legs</li>
            <li> but it still smears a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> like it claims - it just washes of a little stringy</li>
            <li> There are these little tubes/extra lashes that come off when I take off the mascara.  </li>
            <li> and I usually apply it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I always ended up getting a little of the oil in my eyes</li>
            <li> Then it starts to flake a little at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Just a little moisture, and</li>
            <li> My problem with this is, although the package says water resistant, any little moisture makes my eyelashes clump together.</li>
            <li> Just a little moisture, and</li>
            <li> My problem with this is, although the package says water resistant, any little moisture makes my eyelashes clump together.</li>
            <li> As a little tip - you can add a teensy drop of tea tree oil to both sides to prevent germs and the tea tree oil</li>
            <li> WORST MASCARA EVERRR!!!!(AND I&#x27;VE TRIED MANY!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like little gloves for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and it all comes off in little tubes.  </li>
            <li> These beauty tube technology makes it so the mascara comes of in little threads, but its painless and comes off with just water.</li>
            <li> It wierdly washes off in little tubes but looks goodc all day.</li>
            <li> I recommend letting the primer dry for a minute before putting on the actual mascara, or else it is really difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> but it takes a while to dry and in the mean time remains sticky so things stick to</li>
            <li> It sets and becomes this little tube that just pulls away with nothing left behind.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price, which I don&#x27;t think is that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just one old lady who had a bad experience whilst using a product and following the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run when it gets wet like regular mascara, and it isn&#x27;t difficult to remove like waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> (I take my contacts out and use a few baby wipes to remove the mascara every day and that does the trick for me.)</li>
            <li> There were a few that did extend here and there.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Although it definitely lives up to the descriptions of staying power, it also makes my lashes feel thin and crispy.  </li>
            <li> Be warned that it \\&quot;goes bad\\&quot; after a few months and won&#x27;t apply like it used to anymore.</li>
            <li> I have short, thin eyelashes -</li>
            <li> I wear this mascara everyday in school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a few years.</li>
            <li> I have been using Maybeline XXL mascara  for a few years and adored it.</li>
            <li> It clings to your lashes for dear life, but is not supposed to be waterproof, and a few eyelashes always come out in the process.</li>
            <li> I am throwing mine out, and it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear or flake while sweating heavily (working out), swimming, or even sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a plus for someone like me with thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> heavy on lashes&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lost a few eyelashes in the process.</li>
            <li> I like that my eye lashes don&#x27;t get dried and brittle if I don&#x27;t take it off at night...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any trouble with this</li>
            <li> This mascara dried my lashes when wanted to apply additional coats, and it also pulled out my lashes when removing it.</li>
            <li> stuff doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake at all, and doesn&#x27;t even come off when you&#x27;re crying (speaking from experience here).</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> however it causes eye irritation and caused my eyes to produce eye gunk a few days after application.</li>
            <li> I would finally have a mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge or worse, flake.  </li>
            <li> You can use a tissue to wipe the excess off, but that wastes product.  </li>
            <li> I just wasted a lot of remover on it.</li>
            <li> I use I almost everyday and have bought another one.</li>
            <li> Also withstands heavy sweating at the gym.</li>
            <li> Every few years I&#x27;d try a supermarket brand, but still have the racoon problem.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> few months ago, I stumbled on this mascara after a web search for a cheaper place to buy Blinc and was ecstatic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Final line, I was flummoxed and did not enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I have thin short eyelashes &amp;</li>
            <li> I just picked up this mascara a few days ago.</li>
            <li> If you want long and thick lashes, this product may not be for you or may require a small amount of supplemental mascara.      </li>
            <li> So, even when you cry or sweat, it usually doesn&#x27;t come off and if it does, it just looks like there is a little piece of thread on your face instead of having black smudged eyes.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes 2 face washes to get it off and you&#x27;ll want to pay attention after you get out of the shower or you might find little black sticky booger like things stuck all over you.</li>
            <li> Usually when I curl my eyelashes and put on mascara, it droops down because my eyelashes cannot handle heavy stuff.</li>
            <li> It leaves long, black, stringy strands on your face, and a bunch of small black dots that are very hard to take off.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based off the positive reviews here - but this is the worst mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I usually end up looking like a raccoon with black mascara under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Again, this could just be because of how I do things, since I usually applied this soon after applying black liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less than $9 - I&#x27;d urge you to just try it!</li>
            <li> Hard to apply, clumpy and stiff, hard to remove--used a makeup remover, then soap and water, finally mascara started coming off, or I should say flaking off , it actually turns to weird stretchy little things.  </li>
            <li> Also, half the tube is a WHITE primer that is absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> (I apparently have oily skin around my eyes, weird.)</li>
            <li> Just insert the brush at the base of the lashes and wiggle wiggle as you brush up to coat and separate lashes at the same time to avoid clumping, same as any other mascara.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY mascara that I have tried that does not smudge and create a late day shadow under my sparse, thin eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> if you know you&#x27;re going to be out late and coming back tired and wanting to just hurry up and get all the makeup off and go to bed asap.  </li>
            <li> The actual mascara end of this is complete crap.</li>
            <li> I guess I am a little too rushed in the morning!</li>
            <li> It was difficult for me to get all of the white parts covered, resulting in a few of my lashes with this weird powdered white look, while all of the rest were sleek and dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Blinc brush, on the other hand, has small, sparse bristles that really allow you to get at the base of your lashes which I like.</li>
            <li> Once dried on it&#x27;s hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad, as they really do work in terms of lengthening the lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would re-purchase on Amazon, as it seemed to get clumpy after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my formula was whacked, but I think that I&#x27;ll be sticking to the usual stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used the Kiss Me Mascara and blinc tube mascara in the past</li>
            <li> No more vigorous scrubbing at your eyes till your eyelashes come</li>
            <li> a weird rubbery/plastic feeling on your eyelashes at first that may be difficult to get used</li>
            <li> No more racoon eyes or makeup remover needed.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s weird to me that the names are so similar.</li>
            <li> say goodbye to raccoon eyes, they are a thing of the past with this product.</li>
            <li> I end up pulling my eyelashes out usually.</li>
            <li> Using this does not lengthen or darken my lashes as it has in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am lazy when it comes to my makeup.  </li>
            <li> The last tube I got from Amazon was gummy and difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve, but you can get past it with my tip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical about the white \\&quot;conditioner\\</li>
            <li> NO MORE RACCOON</li>
            <li> (I usually take it off in the shower).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no more difficult to put on than any regular mascara, imo, at least if you want even coating without clumping, except you do it twice:</li>
            <li> I hated that I had to choose between regular mascara which smudged and looked dirty at the end of the day but easily washed off or waterproof mascara that stayed put</li>
            <li> You can adjust the amount to be subtle or heavy depending on what you&#x27;re going for...</li>
            <li> no more pulling at your delicate skin and no need for makeup removers.  </li>
            <li> I want to say the first time i used it, it scared the crap out of me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s virtually impossible to put the white stuff on, and fully cover it with the black, and NOT have gunky hooker-lashes.</li>
            <li> In fact, my only real complaint is in trying to get it all off!</li>
            <li> always ask what mascara I wear, and if my lashes are fake because they are so long!</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and often have bad reactions to eye makeup, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> For decades, every single mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, including waterproof and expensive store brands, ended up underneath my eyes within an hour even if I&#x27;d used powder, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t wish to mess with false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It hard to take off though.</li>
            <li> It clumped on my lashes, no matter how hard I tried to get it on evenly.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with</li>
            <li> It is a tad hard to take off without make up remover.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get off - acted a bit like rubber</li>
            <li> if you have to pull so hard that youre pulling out your lashes-</li>
            <li> if you have to pull so hard that youre pulling out your lashes-</li>
            <li> and I think any tube mascara will because they make your lashes too hard.</li>
            <li> It has been hard finding an equivalent replacement.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does not apply evenly and is hard to hold when applying.</li>
            <li> Some reviews say it&#x27;s hard to wash off, for me</li>
            <li> Some mascaras become thick and hard to use and become unnaturally looking as the substance gets gooky but this mascara does not.</li>
            <li> but then I had to use oily removers and had to scrub the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> Step 1 white part became dirty (gray).</li>
            <li> Started wearing it in my late 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This made my lashes longer but not as thick or noticable.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; but it stays in place</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a few people get upset in these reviews - a bit confused and saddened by that.</li>
            <li> and then gently pinch your eyelashes at the base, and slide your fingers.</li>
            <li> So..I was upset that Revlon discontinued their dual lash booster/mascara combo, so I was forced to try this by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> When I followed directions it made my lashes thick and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> but i have say that i hate the fact that it makes your lashes just absolutely clump together.</li>
            <li> its a thick coating.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it goes on too thickly and is not flattering at all.  </li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> I mean, I feel like this stuff is impenetrable.</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes!  </li>
            <li> Step one, apply oddly crumbly yet goopy white crap.</li>
            <li> When I first got this mascara I absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the Kiss Me brand and is a lot less expensive.  </li>
            <li> No clumping, no smudging and seriously waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Like I figured out the subtle ways to move the wand and keep it from clumping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like I figured out the subtle ways to move the wand and keep it from clumping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If it was less expensive</li>
            <li> As soon as I put the base coat on, I could tell this was far beyond ordinary mascara!  </li>
            <li> they have weird little clumps all over them.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little creepy.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about yet another \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; beauty product that probably wouldn&#x27;t work for me as well as people said it did for them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> (not good for keeping wrinkles away either to have to rub and wipe your eyes</li>
            <li> - some people have asked me lately if I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> it stayed on, didnt look fake and it came off like a breeze with plain water</li>
            <li> This crap is way to hard to apply and you end up with a lot of white eyelashes because of it.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed given all the positive reviews but had to stop using it</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Double Extend, and was incredibly disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointed and have gone back to their Voluminous brand.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 3 years exclusively!  </li>
            <li> It absolutely SUCKS!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put mascara on very thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just talking a little tear from the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just talking a little tear from the cold weather.</li>
            <li> The mascara washes away without leaving behind residue or raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not happy about it.  </li>
            <li> It might work for some people, but it was an unnecessary hassle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal is also a challenge.</li>
            <li> It has poor separation and does not add volume.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> if you REALLY hate the white stuff-</li>
            <li> that is completely unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> that is completely unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference when I used the white base layer.</li>
            <li> Just enough to be really annoying every couple days.</li>
            <li> have yet to be disappointed with this product after so long.</li>
            <li> I just started a job where I work 12+ hours a day, and the raccoon eye problem got way worse.</li>
            <li> Gives the look of false eyelashes without being over-done for every day wear.  </li>
            <li> I have really thin and short eyelashes but the base coat for this mascara</li>
            <li> Even though my lashes are thin and short, I find that 1 application of base coat and 1 application of mascara is all I need to get longer fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ll still be utilizing the false eyelashes</li>
            <li> But, I hate how long it takes to apply.  </li>
            <li> -Doesn&#x27;t give a dramatic look</li>
            <li> No more trying expensive mascaras for me!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed to see the unopened package yellowed which means the mascara is old also.  </li>
            <li> When I took it of it burned my eyes so bad and took quite a few of my eyelashes with it</li>
            <li> Then I tried regular ol&#x27; water-based mascara but hated how it sometimes ran.</li>
            <li> Am so disappointed with L&#x27;Oreal discontinuing the previous product.</li>
            <li> I hate other mascaras, because it takes a lot of rubbing with soap or makeup remover to remove it from my eyes.</li>
            <li> I hate that the mascara comes off in little tubes, too.</li>
            <li> I even tried the 2x as expensive Blinc \\&quot;Tube\\&quot; mascara and guess what?</li>
            <li> This makes my eye lashes look kinda fake</li>
            <li> When you remove it from the tube it is on the wrong side, so I need</li>
            <li> Unable to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Taking it off is difficult almost like glue</li>
            <li> Wrong -</li>
            <li> -Too expensive for my liking.</li>
            <li> Thought that this could replace it and was WRONG.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so unimportant in comparison to everything else in life!</li>
            <li> People always compliment my eyelashes and ask if its fake.</li>
            <li> removing feels weird and takes some work.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am removing wrong because others have said the tubes just slide off</li>
            <li> Unable to use.  </li>
            <li> I was using all kinds of fake eye lashes and switched to this product.  </li>
            <li> so I could only ever take my maekup off with my contacts removed and even then my eyes would always be nasty in the morning and</li>
            <li> Again, sorry loreal.</li>
            <li> The weird thing is, that when you wash it off, it literally comes off in sheets.  </li>
            <li> This is too difficult to remove and damages your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> so the brush is in the wrong hand</li>
            <li> Tried this - my eyelids, at the base of my lashes ached after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> I used blinc for a while, but it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that the product was nearly dried up before I could even use the product!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s basically useless now.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so sad for my lost lashes....</li>
            <li> everyone thinks they are fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to take a star from this mascara because it irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> That was very frustrating for me.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating</li>
            <li> They got so thin that in some spots I had no or just stubs of lashes. :(</li>
            <li> no matter what, I&#x27;d always have horrible dark circles after taking it</li>
            <li> I have used expensive fiber mascara from a department store and the weight/sentivity to fibers made it impossible for me to wear, but tube lashes-</li>
            <li> Removes with cold cream and there is no ordor.</li>
            <li> If I use waterproof, then it&#x27;s difficult to remove, and it often appears that my lashes are removed along with the mascara!</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> But it was weird to have that happen!</li>
            <li> The primer went on well, but the mascara was very difficult to apply over the primer.</li>
            <li> Thing is, it&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE for it to run, smudge, melt, etc.....washing it off</li>
            <li> CREATES HORRIBLE CLUMPY, STIFF SPIDER-LEG HOOKER LASHES!!</li>
            <li> I dont know why Loreal changed it, too bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> So while it isn&#x27;t a bad product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again -</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t be as bad as this.</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes, and this mascara made them look horrible.</li>
            <li> I used to wear waterproof mascara but hated how difficult it was to remove.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say but this is the worst mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for the manufacturer, but this is one of the worst mascaras I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Stupid, design, stupid product, never buying this again.  </li>
            <li> I liberally apply the base then run a lash comb through to remove any clumps then apply the mascara.</li>
            <li> and I hate the way it feels on me-</li>
            <li> out of the way, I hate this product.</li>
            <li> To me, this just adds time to the already annoying makeup application process.</li>
            <li> I used to hate mascara and therefore did not wear it.  </li>
            <li> sister hate it &amp; thinks it breaks her lashes, that doesn&#x27;t happen to mines .</li>
            <li> I hate waterproof)</li>
            <li> but hate the applicator.</li>
            <li> But the worst part is that it&#x27;s impossible to remove it with a mascara remover.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my 16 yo after I tried it, she hated it, too.</li>
            <li> Even using a eyelash brush/separator when I realized how terribly the bottom coat was clumping up my lashes couldn&#x27;t help the situation.  </li>
            <li> The tube/wand on this mascara is horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> Awful!!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> felt and looked disgusting.</li>
            <li> So I started trying out sleeping in this mascara- since the reason it was horrible before was because I slept on my side</li>
            <li> So I started trying out sleeping in this mascara- since the reason it was horrible before was because I slept on my side</li>
            <li> It was awful - without a doubt one of the worst mascaras I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I NEVERRR WRITE REVIEWS, BUT THIS ONE IS JUST SO BAD!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> 比国内卖得短很多呢-。-  帮朋友买的  不知道效果是不是一样的  长的是国内买的  短的是这买的</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and can&#x27;t go back to traditional mascara.  I love that the lashes wash away at the end of the day with just water and I never have flakey gunk to deal with.</li>
            <li> This is the best tubing mascara I have found.  I&#x27;m not sure I would re-purchase on Amazon, as it seemed to get clumpy after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> makes my lashes look super long</li>
            <li> I always love this mascara as it&#x27;s non traditional. It makes a tubing over your lashes. It&#x27;s not waterproof, but other washable mascaras leave goop over your lids when you go in water. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use eye makeup remover. I have to use a Q-tip and water to wipe away fussy eye makeup. This mascara, though, is NEVER a problem. I either put my face in the water (shower or tub), hold a wet cloth or paper towel to my closed eyelids, or use my hands as a min bath for my eyes in the sink to get it off. It&#x27;s so simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can freak people out with these, too! If I visit a friend I take it off and when it comes off, it literally looks like you are holding eyelashes in you hands. No reside is left over on your eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based off the positive reviews here - but this is the worst mascara I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, pretty clumpy overall. I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover which usually does an excellent job removing everything, and it hardly got any of it off. There were huge flakes and clumps coming off slowly, sticking to my skin. I washed my face twice afterwards, and still had residue in my eyes for the next day or more.</li>
            <li> Double Extend has been my go-to mascara for many years, since it first came to market. I&#x27;ve tried other ones, including some of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s newer mascaras, but I continue to go back to Double Extend. One of the primary reasons is how it washes away and doesn&#x27;t leave black clumps in the corner of your eyes. It also doesn&#x27;t smudge as easy as other mascaras. When you wash it off, you will think you&#x27;re washing away your eyelashes, but don&#x27;t fret. I think it must be some type of material that makes the mascara wash off in the way it does, unlike any other product. It was very strange at first, but now I love it. This stuff lasts a long time without any smudging. And after I wash it off at night, I can wake up in the morning without any worry of having black clumps in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the dual mascaras and this one is basically entirely the same. The only difference is this one seems to come off the lashes easier, warm water and it pretty much slides right off, which is phenomenal! But it is very similar in that it does clump very easily, does tug at some of your lashes and the product will flake into your eye ball!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite mascara.  i&#x27;ve tried everything at sephora and every brand at the drug store, and this is the one i keep coming back to.  it plumps and lengthens my lashes...as i want it to do.</li>
            <li> I got this because it had great reviews but when I wash it off it get all these strings of mascara all over. Hard to clean off but they do look longer when applied.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite ever mascara, used MAC tubes and didn&#x27;t like it as much. This stays on all day without irritation.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever. I will never go back to anything else! Never clumps or smears. Makes my lashes super long and full, and simply gorgeous!! Comes right off in the shower with no mess! Love love love!!</li>
            <li> I need volume as my lashes are getting more sparse with age. If I don&#x27;t use waterproof mascara, I have black smudges underneath my eyes and I&#x27;m constantly checking a mirror to remove them. If I use waterproof, then it&#x27;s difficult to remove, and it often appears that my lashes are removed along with the mascara! This is the only product that gives me massive volume and length, no smudges, stays fresh looking all day long, and still removes easily. After cruising the mascara circuit, I always come back to this one. Nothing else compares. I&#x27;m not wasting anymore money on the &#x27;newest&#x27; advertised mascara, no matter how well it&#x27;s marketed. I&#x27;m staying with this Double Extend and hope it&#x27;s forever available and well stocked.</li>
            <li> I adore this mascara. I have incredibly sensitive eyes and find that most other mascara cause irritation or burning. Not this one though. My lashes look long and thick, and the best part is, this is essentially waterproof until you wash your face with warm to hot water. The mascara washes away without leaving behind residue or raccoon eyes. I will use this for life.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and it helps my eyelashes look thicker. Very great product.</li>
            <li> If you want something that actually makes you have fuller, thicker, longer looking lashes without going the false eyelash route at a low price, this may be your answer. Does not come off nor need to be reapplied during the day. My only issue, which is to be expected for this effect really, is it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to get off. Compared to other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in my lifetime, this is the most difficult to get off (besides waterproof types). It&#x27;s not impossible to get it off, and in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it for the dramatic effect. (I take my contacts out and use a few baby wipes to remove the mascara every day and that does the trick for me.) Hope this review helps you out!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve owned. I think I&#x27;m going to buy more L&#x27;Oreal products from now on. One thing to have in mind with this mascara is that you need a little extra time to put it on correctly, but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> This mascara really does stay on until washed off. No flaking or smudging at all. The down side is that I have seen better thickening and lengthening mascaras.</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as some of my other favorite mascaras (the two-layer application process makes it a bit clumpy), but the upside is that it never, ever smudges. If I&#x27;m going out for the evening I&#x27;ll wear a different mascara, but this one is my new go-to for all-day wear.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Benefit&#x27;s brand, but this is my new love for going out. It does not come off until you take it off with warm water. It comes off in clumpy &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; versus smears.&lt;br /&gt;Probably not good for my lashes, but I wear it for 2 days easily sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of different mascaras - by the end of one day of use some mascaras make my eyes itch. This one doesn&#x27;t and i love the way it washes off in \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; rather than running down your face like a hot mess. No spider lashes either! I even prefer this over my MAC Zoom Lash.</li>
            <li> This product drys and breaks off and drops noticeable flakes of mascara under your eyes.Both my husband and my granddaughter noticed it. It bothered him so much at breakfast that he wanted me to go take it off.</li>
            <li> Practically every women that I know has one type of beauty product that she cannot leave the house without.  For me, it&#x27;s mascara.  After finally running out of my old favorite (Lashblast Fusion by CoverGirl), I decided to try something different.  This, the highest rated mascara on Amazon was one of the biggest cosmetic disappointments I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Even using a eyelash brush/separator when I realized how terribly the bottom coat was clumping up my lashes couldn&#x27;t help the situation.  Once I finally got my lashes to a somewhat acceptable state, I covered the white with the top coat - which sort of melted throughout the entire evening, and then wouldn&#x27;t come off with even my strongest makeup removers.  Perhaps my formula was whacked, but I think that I&#x27;ll be sticking to the usual stuff.</li>
            <li> Second time I buy this. My most favorite mascara ever! I love that I don&#x27;t need to use makeup remover with this. I just splash my eyelashes with water, very gently pull the mascara off and it&#x27;s done. If it&#x27;s the only thing I had put on that day...it just makes my whole bedtime routine much quicker !</li>
            <li> the product arrive at excellents condicion</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive eyes and can not tolerate several types of mascara.  I have used the Kiss Me Mascara and blinc tube mascara in the past so I was excited that L&#x27;oreal came out with this less expensive mascara that includes the primer.  I used the Kiss Me Mascara primer which had to be purchased separate.  Plus, since I have sensitive eyes I have to throw away my mascara every 3 months to prevent irritation and eye infections.  This product is affordable enough I don&#x27;t complain.      Also, I love not having to use or buy eye make up remover.  I love how long my lashes are with this mascara they actually hit my sunglasses and eyebrows.  It only takes one coat of the primer and then one coat of the mascara.  I don&#x27;t even wait for the primer to dry so it is super fast application product.  If you try to do more than one coat it will clump so you have to get used to the tubes technology.  Only one coat is needed.      I love that I NEVER EVER get racoon eyes or mascara flaking.  Again with sensitive eyes sometimes  I will rub my eyes and with this mascara&#x27;s  tube technology I end up with no mascara under my eyes.     Finally, it is nice to be active, swim, sweat, tear up at a wedding, and not have to worry about my mascara running.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001IAINFU L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend Lash Extension Effect Mascara ~ 570 Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the market for a new mascara, and I chose this one, as the commercials I&#x27;ve seen for it made it irresistible. It was also too good to be true. While it certainly does create a \\&quot;tube\\&quot; around your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t extend them much, if at all. I noticed no extension effect for the majority of my lashes. There were a few that did extend here and there. I most definitely applied it properly, and am not a newbie to cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did last all day, and it also came off easily with warm water and a bit of soap. It gets the two stars for that. Far too often mascara is advertised as flake free, and long lasting, with easy removal, and then promptly fails to live up to any of those. This one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big detractor is that it doesn&#x27;t add volume. My lashes didn&#x27;t look much different from regular mascara. They didn&#x27;t seem separated, there was absolutely no added volume apparent, and finally, the lengthening effect only worked sparsely on a few lashes here and there. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Good concept and idea, bad performance.</li>
            <li> This stiff is fabulous!  I have extremely, short, sparse eyelashes, so I bought this not expecting much.  As soon as I put the base coat on, I could tell this was far beyond ordinary mascara!  It even made what little (almost nonexistent) bottom lashes I have look longer and thicker! It added some real length to my lashes without being gaudy or gooey looking.  It stayed on and didn&#x27;t smudge.  This product is a winner!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and remove, &amp; I like the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; that form on my lashes, it makes them look amazing!&lt;br /&gt;However, it smears quite easily &amp; clumps a bit, though not as badly as other products.</li>
            <li> Happy to find, because couldn&#x27;t find in stores.  Thanks! A+</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and never want to switch!</li>
            <li> Best mascara, EVER.  So easy to remove too! Does NOT require any product to aid in removal and it doesn&#x27;t leave raccoon eyes at all. Warm water and a washcloth is all you need at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the buy and permanent change in mascara choice.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive stuff. This is a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> It works. Voluminizes and lengthens. It hard to take off though.</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes fuller and longer but if your lashes get wet and you rub your eye whether it&#x27;s hot or cold water the mascara will come off with clumps.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite mascara! I even tried the 2x as expensive Blinc \\&quot;Tube\\&quot; mascara and guess what? I liked this better! I am getting to the end of a tube and thought I&#x27;d \\&quot;just try\\&quot; something else to switch things up. Big mistake, I returned whatever I had purchased immediately for a fresh tube of Double Extend Beauty Tubes.</li>
            <li> As I have aged (60 years plus), my lashes, like my hair have thinned out.  Since I have used this product, others have noticed and commented on my lashes.  I have been asked what kind of mascara I use by ladies who have know me for some time.  They do appear longer &amp; fuller.  The two steps take no longer to apply that other mascara, as I usually put two coats of other brands on. Two coats of the primer really makes a difference before adding the final black coat. A little messy to remove the stings of mascara, but does so easily with hand lotion or plain water rinses. Hope this product is not taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I have deep set eyes and long lashes, so I have a lot of trouble with my mascara rubbing off onto my brow bone - not a pretty look. This mascara is non clumpy and stays on incredibly well even through long, active work days or exercise.</li>
            <li> I love that this mascara doesn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes.  It is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t.  So, I think it&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;m not a fan of the &#x27;extender&#x27; part (the white end) - unless I cake my lashes with the mascara, some white remains uncovered and looks strange.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with it anyway.  I do wish that someday a mascara company would figure out how to get the globs of masacara off the tip of the brush - I always end up wiping it off before applying to avoid clumps.  But that&#x27;s true of all mascara.  This is my favorite type so far.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a mascara that does not end up in black smudges under my eyes and here it is!  It washes off easily too!</li>
            <li> I think there is no other kind I would buy.  I love that it comes off in tubes with just warm water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this after I realized none of my friends knew about this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a tube at an event in 2009 and I haven&#x27;t found anything better since. It has its drawbacks, but they are few:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Stays on until you take it off. Literally. Like, you could wear it for days.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t smudge ANYWHERE. It basically forms into a solid when you put it on. It won&#x27;t rub off or go anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s water RESISTANT. (not proof, see Cons)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s easy to get it all off at once.&lt;br /&gt;- It makes your lashes look like &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; falsies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t come off with regular eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;- If it gets touched by warm or hot water, it clumps and comes off in tubes - i.e. hot yoga&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not very graceful to remove.&lt;br /&gt;- After about two to three months, you have to pitch it and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;- Looks gross stuck to the shower when it comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; say to throw away mascara after a couple months, but with this one you really have to. Once it dries out, it doesn&#x27;t look great and it&#x27;s really difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest way to remove it is to put warm water on your lashes, either directly under the shower stream or with a washcloth. It will almost fall off and it doesn&#x27;t adhere to or leave residue on your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip: If you like to do multiple layers, wait until the first one dries so it builds. Since this mascara builds a tube around your lash, adding another while it&#x27;s wet will only pull the previous layer off. For extra definition, use both the base coat and the mascara on top of your top lashes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it can be a little high-maintenance, I mostly use it for long days or nights out. It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; mascara. I use good old Maybelline Great Lash on a daily basis. But despite the extra care and the cons above, this is a great mascara to keep in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was the highest rated on Amazon. It&#x27;s terrible!&lt;br /&gt;Flakey and clumpy and doesn&#x27;t even add length.</li>
            <li> This is my first tubing mascara and I am very impressed by it. It sets my curled lashes very well and does not smudge at the end of the day. Definitely lengthens with a tad of volume.   I have one concern on how long the tube will last as I&#x27;m noticing crusting on the side of the tube...but for this price, I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying another one after 2 months.   A nice first tubing mascara especially for the price!</li>
            <li> the perfect mascara especially if other mascaras leave you with raccoon eyes by midday</li>
            <li> I have one of those lashes that might be too long or too curved that, although it doesn&#x27;t look like it touches the bottom part of my eyes, it must.  At the end of the day, I usually end up looking like a raccoon with black mascara under my eyes.  Definitely don&#x27;t want wrinkles around the eyes later on from all the constant rubbing and wiping off of the mascara.  This may be the best solution I have found so far.  This has 2 ends... start with the white and brush on like a regular mascara and follow on with the black mascara.  It stays on the lashes (with no transfer) and it looks like the lashes are covered individually.  Warm water takes off the lashes easily - comes off as rubbery tubes.  You&#x27;ll know you have to replace it (so far for me, about every 4-6 months, which is how often we&#x27;re supposed to replace it anyway) once it starts to look like spider legs and not individual lashes.  Great product.  Much cheaper than some other options.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara without knowing how it would help with making my lashes look great, but after using it, I already know that it does a good job with volume and making it longer, especially with the white tube.. It stays for the whole entire day without smudging, and once you have curled it before/after application (whichever your personal curling method is), it will stay curled the whole day too! Sometimes I use another L&#x27;oreal mascara on top of it if I really want it to be thick, but this one is good in itself. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Have used it for years. Goes on smoothly and does not smear throughout the day. Washes off with water and simple face cleanser.</li>
            <li> It alright for quick length when you don&#x27;t feel like layering mascara on. Also it doesn&#x27;t clump together easily which is nice.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look longer and removes easily.</li>
            <li> My favorite aspect of this mascara is the removal. I&#x27;m getting older and prefer not to fuss with the area around my eyes too much (I think this will lessen damage and wrinkles). This mascara does not leave residue. I don&#x27;t end up looking like a raccoon. I don&#x27;t waste endless amounts of potions, tissue, swabs and pads removing excess. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and it have always been my go-to mascara despite buying and trying out other brand in between, none works as well as this.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I can put on as much or as little as I like. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t come off until I take it off... no smudges!</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY mascaras, Meral Nomram, Aveda, Mary Kay, Beauty control, Lanicome, Estee Lauder Etc... This is by far my favorite. The white base is awesome for lifting and lengthening my lashes.</li>
            <li> The item listed is Loreal beauty tubes mascara &amp; the listing shows a picture of the same-- mascara in a red and white package. I love the beauty tubes because I don&#x27;t have to use a remover.  What was shipped though, is a DIFFERENT Loreal mascara product -- lash boosting serum mascara, in a blue and gold package. I have no idea how this product is removed.  Additionally, the package appears to have been opened, so I&#x27;m not sure I feel safe using this. It was only $6 and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the hassle of returning it. But I&#x27;m not happy about it.  I do not recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> The white color for the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; always leaves some of my lashes white. Its unsightly.&lt;br /&gt;As for the black, if you brush it more than twice, it clumps your lashes together HORRIBLY.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on for the whole day, but it definitely flakes, even if you use the white end first.</li>
            <li> Weak mascara--didn&#x27;t give my lashes much oomph. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The wait is so powerful it&#x27;s hard to cover by the black I have to use three different black mascaras just to cover the white</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have reviewed an item, and this is after reading many reviews.  I would not buy this mascara again.  Although it definitely lives up to the descriptions of staying power, it also makes my lashes feel thin and crispy.  It does not, at least for me, wash off easily with water.  If someone else feels the way I do, I didn&#x27;t see their review, so I wanted to post this one.  Will try without the primer, but definitely will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> After reading a bunch of reviews I knew I needed to try this mascara. As somewhat of a makeup hoarder, I think I&#x27;m pretty knowledgeable of good mascaras vs bad. Personally, I have decently thick, very dark eyelashes, and a good length, but for the looks I go for I want really long looking lashes. I want it to look either as though I have eyelash extensions or falsies on.&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the deal: this mascara is awesome. It really is. It&#x27;s probaby the weirdest mascara because of the way it feels. It sort of feels like you&#x27;re putting plastic on your eyelashes. That being said, it really clumps. Even with careful application, it continually stuck my lashes together and really really stuck. I had to pull them apart with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the day I kept touching and lightly tugging on my lashes. They didn&#x27;t feel like my lashes.. They felt like rubber. The amazing thing was no marks or flakes came off on my fingers when I did that.&lt;br /&gt;I went to workout later in the evening and after a vigorous, sweaty workout, the mascara hadn&#x27;t budged. There were no flakes or smudging from it.&lt;br /&gt;That has never happened, even with the waxiest of waterproof mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;The most amazing part was taking it off at night. I washed my face and the little strings came off with it. I would tug on my lashes and they&#x27;d just slip off. Somehow they don&#x27;t attach to the hair itself or bond and really does just encase it. It&#x27;s incredible. No more vigorous scrubbing at your eyes till your eyelashes come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons for me:&lt;br /&gt;- Clumping. Definitely clumping for me, even with careful application.&lt;br /&gt;- a weird rubbery/plastic feeling on your eyelashes at first that may be difficult to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not sure how long the tube will last me but I&#x27;m not thinking for long considering it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;full tube&amp;#34; per say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubts in my mind that the reviewer who gave birth wearing this and the lady who went camping for a week with it on are lying. This is very incredible mascara. It almost seems too cheap.. I&#x27;ve tried fiber mascaras before and they smear and such and cost a fortune. I wonder when some brand will catch into this formula and try selling it for $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve read this review this far, I would recommend you give this mascara a try.eap..

            <li> I love this stuff! I wouldn&#x27;t have eyelashes without it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a long time. Makes my eyelashes look long and full. Doesn&#x27;t flake, run or smudge. Takes a bit more time to apply but worth it. Easy off.</li>
            <li> I love the shape of the tube, lol. It feels so nice in your hand, and it looks all professional.    I might as well say I don&#x27;t like the primer much and don&#x27;t use it anymore. It takes forever to make sure there isn&#x27;t any white from it showing and I don&#x27;t have time for that, but the mascara on its own works really well. It&#x27;s a shame you have to waste money to get the primer with the mascara, and that the actual mascara is in a tiny container.    What I mainly love about this is that it gives a kind of \\&quot;curl\\&quot; to my lashes, without using a lash-curler. It makes them flare up at the top and it looks really nice. The length is good, but better with the primer unfortunately. It gives a little bit of volume as well. There is some clumping, or a lot of clumping if you&#x27;re not doing it right, but overall it&#x27;s a nice mascara. Be warned that it \\&quot;goes bad\\&quot; after a few months and won&#x27;t apply like it used to anymore. Then it&#x27;s time to throw it out and go out and buy a new one (in my case). ;)</li>
            <li> While this is a very affordable option for a tubing mascara, I don&#x27;t recommend it. If it&#x27;s all you can afford, it will give you the smudge proof benefits of a tubing mascara. If you can afford more, definitely choose another brand. The tube/wand on this mascara is horrible. It&#x27;s too fat and short to really get to your smaller lashes easily. The ridiculously short wand is just a pain to use. Also, half the tube is a WHITE primer that is absolutely useless. White? I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking with that. Use the mascara without the primer and save yourself some frustration. The mascara itself is fine. No real complaints. But overall, I&#x27;d pass on this unless your budget won&#x27;t allow for better.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!  I have tried other mascaras, but always come back to this one. :)  Makes my lashes super dark, long, and wears all day!  It will not smudge under the eyes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Would be nice if darker and brush wasn&#x27;t so huge. White primer does length.</li>
            <li> Ladies, this is the best mascara that exists! I have blonde, non-existent lashes and it gives me huge, beautiful lashes and my eyes look 300% better. Thing is, it&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE for it to run, smudge, melt, etc.....washing it off, it&#x27;s like little mascara caterpillars that slide off. It&#x27;s &#x27;apples to oranges&#x27; when comparing all other mascaras and this one. I wrote this review to help other people looking for THE BEST mascara that you can count on. (I&#x27;m not an employee or whatever, I just really love this product and I just have no need to even try any others, it&#x27;s THAT good!) - Hope this helps :)&lt;br /&gt;If they ever stop making it, I will be soooo upset!</li>
            <li> Great, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Gave this only 4 stars because I just use the white primer not the mascara. This makes my eye lashes look kinda fake and I like it! Very easy to apply. I use my own favorite mascara instead of the mascara in this product. I find that the product is worth buying even though I only use the white end of the tube. Wish they would make just the white primer in a tube. I would buy that. Advice - apply white primer to front and back of lashes and apply mascara to both front and back of lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty decent. Gives the look of longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I only wear tube mascara because regular mascara always smudges under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried Blinc and Too Faced tube mascaras but always go back to L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend. This is probably my fifth tube so far. True to its name, this is quite lengthening and adds volume in a just-more-than-natural way. I took one star off because there are other traditional mascaras that can really thicken and add plush volume, which this doesn&#x27;t do so much. On me, this lengthens my lashes probably 50% more. It washes off easily and apparently the primer is conditioning for your lashes. I&#x27;m not sure about that, but my lashes definitely have not been damaged by using this for years. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find the perfect mascara that does not smudge and leave me looking like a raccoon by the end of the day. After much research, I decided to try &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; mascara. No more raccoon eyes! I love it!</li>
            <li> The use of this wand is strange for me.  When you remove it from the tube it is on the wrong side, so I need&lt;br /&gt;to change to my other hand so it faces in the correct direction.  It is like getting into a car to drive only to&lt;br /&gt;find out you are sitting in the passengers seat instead of the drivers seat.  Or trying to eat with your left hand&lt;br /&gt;when you are right handed.  I ordered this to save time.  But it takes more time.  Needs to be replaced for sure after&lt;br /&gt;3 months. It becomes very sticky soon.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Hard to apply, clumpy and stiff, hard to remove--used a makeup remover, then soap and water, finally mascara started coming off, or I should say flaking off , it actually turns to weird stretchy little things.  I think some of my lashes came off with it.  I loved the old tube of Double extend in the white and gold container--haven&#x27;t been able to find it, so I thought that this one thinking it was just a new packaging.  I dont know why Loreal changed it, too bad.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am torn with this mascara.  When I first used it, it loved it.  Now that I have used it a couple times, it am not so sure.  It is kind of a pain to take off too.  I will definitely finish what I have but will probably not buy another one.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have found that truly does not smudge! I have tried more mascaras than I can count and they have always smudged under my eyes not even 2 hours after I applied it. This stuff is great if you have smudge problems like I do!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good an resistent and durability for 24 hrs</li>
            <li> All the women in our family use this product, ranging in age from 24-74!  Love, love, love it.  Best mascara ever.</li>
            <li> I feel like a girl! Where has this stuff been all my life?? No matter what brand I used it all came off under my eyes. This is the best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> this mascara is the best ever made. It does not run if you get it wet, when you want it to come off use warm water to pre-soak then it slides off your lashes with a gentle wipe as a solid without smearing all over you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;BEST EVER.</li>
            <li> I always liked this product. Unable to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Great cosmetic product and really easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I bought some for me and for my friends, as a gift.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara! No raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE mascara!! Works great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Come right off with warm water and face wash and leaves no staining.</li>
            <li> I have used regular waterproof mascara - nothing fancy - for years. A couple of my friends have been raving about this stuff so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The white &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; stuff that you&#x27;re supposed to put on your lashes before is pretty goopy. It clumped on my lashes, no matter how hard I tried to get it on evenly. Which meant that when I tried to put on the silicone &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; coating, it clumped too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I had a hard time with was covering all of the white parts of my lashes with the silicone. It was difficult for me to get all of the white parts covered, resulting in a few of my lashes with this weird powdered white look, while all of the rest were sleek and dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reasons above, I found this pretty tough to apply to lower lashes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for a while I tried using this stuff on my upper lashes and then using my old mascara on my lower lashes. But now I&#x27;ve switched back to my old mascara completely. It might work for some people, but it was an unnecessary hassle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal is also a challenge. I have eye makeup remover which I normally use with a cotton pad before I go to bed. For some reason, it doesn&#x27;t remove this stuff no matter how much I rub. I&#x27;ve tried the hot water, but even with that it still requires more scrubbing than I want to do on my eye area. I&#x27;ve pulled out several eyelashes by accident just trying to get the mascara to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was on it looked good, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that there was any &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; effect to the look of this mascara that makes it worth the application and removal effort.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. My Walmart never has it in stock. Target sometimes does, sometimes doesn&#x27;t have stock. Goes on easy, comes off even easier with water. Can&#x27;t stand traditional mascaras that require constant rubbing and tugging of skin using makeup remover. Never smudges. Fattens my lashes which matters more than length, but it also improves the length. They look like spiders when you wash them off. :D No other drugstore mascaras like this, it&#x27;s so affordable, and I hope L&#x27;Oreal never discontinues this product in the US.</li>
            <li> This is simply the most amazing mascara.  It really does make lashes look quite a bit longer AND it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  Ever.  Comes off easily with warm water and you never EVER end up with raccoon eyes because of the way this mascara works.  Make sure you leave a minute or two in between the undercoat and mascara for best legnthening results.  Be careful: if you wait too long, the mascara coat will not go on smoothly because the lashes will be a bit too stiff.  PS: Did I mention this was amazing stuff?  :)</li>
            <li> Recieved product, shipping was ridiculous by the way, i shouldve paid attention to it, but the white side was COMPLETELY DRY AND EMPTY. Rip off.</li>
            <li> First of all I got to say, this is NOT designed for volume.  If you want long and thick lashes, this product may not be for you or may require a small amount of supplemental mascara.      But length, whoa did it deliver!  I have short, thin eyelashes - not much length or volume going on there and have yet to find a mascara that supplies both beautifully.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of mascaras!    I previously used a two step maybelline XXL intense, which is designed for volume and length.  It always delivered for volume but not length. So what I do is apply this for incredible length, and do the base of my eyelashes, after it dries, with a little bit of my previous favorite which I have lots of on hand.    I got to say, I put this on for work with just a little bit of the other for volume, and my eyelashes kept hitting my glasses and even eyebrows!  I got so many complements from co-workers on how great my eyes looked.  It works just as well as the Kiss Me brand and is a lot less expensive.  The two step doesn&#x27;t really take up much more time, no more time than it takes to add a couple more coats.  But, I was all ready used to using a primer mascara.  My only complaint - it doesn&#x27;t come in brown - as a redhead, I love brown mascaras.  But, the regular black isn&#x27;t to dark.    I have yet to find one product that delivers both length and volume but am very pleased with the results of this one.</li>
            <li> I only use this now. No more racoon eyes or makeup remover needed. It washes off like tubes. (I call them spider legs. )</li>
            <li> I bought this product because all my other mascaras kept smudging under my eyes, resulting in a panda-like experience. Seeing that this mascara had a primer, I decided to give it a shot. Originally I was a bit skeptical ordering this product because I hadn&#x27;t heard much about it. However, in the end I decided to buy the mascara and I&#x27;m so happy I did! The mascara comes with a primer that extends and primes your lashes. The mascara itself is much better than I expected; it hasn&#x27;t smudged once! I wear this mascara everyday in school. Even after an hour and a half of intense PE, my mascara looks perfect! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants long lasting mascara that makes their eyes look great!</li>
            <li> This just makes my lashes look they have weird little clumps all over them.</li>
            <li> Seems to work good even though I don&#x27;t care for it.  The thickener seems to be a little too rigid.  If I could remember what the other type or types I used many years ago that I liked, I would buy those.</li>
            <li> I have really short lashes, and this changes everything! It makes my lashes look twice as long, but is natural looking and not clumpy. I rub my eyes a lot and it doesn&#x27;t smear or run, and comes off easily at the end of the day with warm water. I also have very sensitive skin and often have bad reactions to eye makeup, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a few years. I have strayed away from it a few times but keep coming back. Mostly, I love the way this mascara comes off. Its so easy! It just &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34; off and doesn&#x27;t leave any embarrassing black streaks. It is not waterproof, but is the only mascara I want to use if I know my lashes will be getting wet. I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with very blonde, almost transparent, lashes so I wear mascara a lot. I hated that I had to choose between regular mascara which smudged and looked dirty at the end of the day but easily washed off or waterproof mascara that stayed put but then I had to use oily removers and had to scrub the delicate eye area. With the \\&quot;tube technology\\&quot; I have the best of both worlds and none of the bad. It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge and at the end of the day I just lay a warm washcloth lightly on the eye for 30 seconds and when I pull it away the mascara is completely gone. My eyes no longer have to choose between getting irritated throughout the day from flaky mascara or at night when I am scrubbing off the waterproof stuff.</li>
            <li> This mascara really does give dramatic lashes! My lashes were practically hitting my brows! I love it and will repurchase it. I wouldn&#x27;t call it ideal for everyday use because it is a 2-step application. I save this for date nights, going out, special outings, or if I&#x27;m feeling like being a bit more dramatic on the eyes and have extra time. If you&#x27;re willing to take the extra time to apply this carefully, then by all means, use it everyday! It&#x27;s amazing! I don&#x27;t have any issues with allergies, running or smearing, or flaking. Washes off quite easily, although does feel weird coming off. Like little jelly-like things coming off your eyes. Overall, I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Every other mascara I have ever worn ends up under my eyes in a matter of hours.  This mascara NEVER does.  I love it. Plus it really does extend my lashes and is so easy to take off.  Just use a warm wash cloth and it&#x27;s gone in seconds.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!  If you want the long lash look and can&#x27;t afford extensions or the pricy extension mascara, this is a nice compromise.  :)</li>
            <li> My go-to mascara.  My lashes look so long when I wear this mascara!  Plus my lashes don&#x27;t dry out with this mascara, which means less chance they will fall out.  The only thing I would change about this mascara would be to add more color choices.  Black and Blackest Black doesn&#x27;t give much variety.  I would love a Brown for daytime use, and maybe even a blue for fun.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite for YEARS!!!  The white side is the priming booster for your lashes.  Makes my lashes twice as long!  Love, LOVE!!!!!  Used over ten years.</li>
            <li> Love the auto send option.  I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for 4+ years and now receive it every 4 months on auto order!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this product for a long time. I finally did and have to say that it is a really good product! I think I prefer the one in the blue package that Loreal makes a little better, but this one works good too. Great seller...fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This made my lashes longer but not as thick or noticable. Loreal makes some really good mascaras. This one costs more doesn&#x27;t work as well as Telescopic which I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 7+ years! It creates length and thickness, and the best part is that it stays put all day. You can adjust the amount to be subtle or heavy depending on what you&#x27;re going for...one layer for office, then add another for a more dramatic look on the way to cocktail hour. Washes off easily too...love it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  Lengthens and adds volume by utilizing a two part application - #1. nourish &amp; protect  #2. Fiber &#x27;tubes&#x27; . My favorite aspect - no raccoon eyes as the day wears on. Removes easily with water....  I wear contacts and have no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!!! I don&#x27;t know why this has such good ratings?!?! I have long eyelashes and it make them look short and stuck together!!! Awful!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, addicted!!!&lt;br /&gt;lengh and volume!!! I can ask for nothing else in a mascara!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside it is a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much because I have nearly non existent eye lashes. This nourishes my lashes and extends them such that over time my real lashes have grown so the lengthening effect is only improved over time! So easy to clean off too, when I wet my face in the shower then lightly run my thumb and forefinger across my lashes the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; come right off and look like well formed eyelashes coming off. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product so thank you Loreal!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this mascara. I have a problem with length, mine or short and don&#x27;t curl easily, but this mascara totally makes them stand out! The only issue I found with this is that you cannot put too much on or else you get spider legs instead of lashes. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I would definitely by this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Taking it off is difficult almost like glue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I really like it. Mascara doesn&#x27;t run, and it washes off in the evening when I wash it off. It lasts all day. Buying it at Amazon, along with other makeup products saves me money and time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and hope Loreal never takes off the market, please......</li>
            <li> I had lash extensions and was told they wouldn&#x27;t ruin my natural lashes.  Wrong - but I tried this and it really works.  You have to make sure you really coat your lashes with the white stuff before using the mascara.  I really love it.</li>
            <li> I have always used the original double extend from Loreal and liked it, but thought this would be even better.  WRONG!  First tube I bought was completely dried out so I had to go back and return it.  Second tube was fine, but it makes your lashes really stiff and stuck together.  I tried to use my eyelash comb thing to seperate and no deal - completely hardened and gross lashes.  I&#x27;m going back to the original (and hoping they dont discontinue it now).  This newer product is a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara since it arrived on the market  Whomever invented tube  mascara is a genius!  If you don&#x27;t know about tubes, all it means that when the mascara is applied, it forms little tubes around the lash when it instantly sets. It doesn&#x27;t migrate, or flake. If you have sensitive eyes, this product will work for you. This mascara creates long, lush, natural looking lashes. It&#x27;s easy to apply,  the lash primer works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;The best feature is when you remove it there is no mess. The tubes slide off your lashes when warm water is applied and rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;There is no black mess on your face cloth or your towels. L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend Tubes Mascara is the best!</li>
            <li> This is a very good mascara remover, just dampen with warm water in your shower time, so I like it very much, but the most important is that it does not have sweat when blooming.</li>
            <li> Really good product, apples very nicely, it won&#x27;t length you lashes dramatically however it is the cleaner mascara one will ever find.... Comes off nicely with warm water like plastic, leaving no residue on the face.... Good for the day time!!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of aspects I don&#x27;t like.  Pros: -I can tell the difference in my lashes when I&#x27;m wearing this versus when I&#x27;m wearing regular mascara; it does make my lashes look longer and fuller (adds more volume).  Cons: -Didn&#x27;t make my lashes grow longer. Now, I only used it consistently for about a month when I first got it, but still, no difference. -Kind of difficult to remove, since it creates a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; of mascara on each lash. I have to pick it off after removing my makeup and washing my face (although, I usually am not really too thorough about removing eye makeup at night, so there&#x27;s some remaining). -The Step 1 white part became dirty (gray). Again, this could just be because of how I do things, since I usually applied this soon after applying black liquid eyeliner. -Too expensive for my liking. I bought this at Rite Aid for somewhere between $8-$14, if I remember correctly.  The cons outweigh the pros in my review.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes look fake, super easy to take off with warm water and face wash. I will keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li> My favorite! Washes off easily and makes my lashes so thick. Do not use if swimming because your mascara will come of in pieces like little spider legs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dissapointed in this product. I wish adverts would stop lying to us already. The main turnoff for me is that this mascara is SO MESSY. It&#x27;s hard for me to apply the second coat without it clumping on the lashes and also getting smudges where it shouldn&#x27;t be. The applicator doesn&#x27;t do a well enough job of seperating the lashes for me, so it&#x27;s hard to get rid of the clumps that may develop.    It also doesn&#x27;t provide as much extension as it claims. There is an appearance of longer lashes, but only slightly.     If you want nice defined lashes without the mess, go for Lash Blast.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced it to me because most of mascaras smear on my lower eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;She mentioned that this one does not smear in contact with oil but water.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true in part but it still smears a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;but I like it that I don&#x27;t need an eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;It comes off easily with water.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; but it stays in place</li>
            <li> This mascara made my eyelashes fall out. I was very disappointed given all the positive reviews but had to stop using it</li>
            <li> Does not come off until you want it off - better than the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> The mascara lengthens and darken my lashes. It only has to be applied once daily. Tip: A little olive oil completely removes the mascara.</li>
            <li> This has officially ended my search for mascara. There is a white base-coat that is applied first on the lashes and the topcoat forms tubes around the lashes. When taking the mascara off, think of taking off easy-slide tubes. Rather then rub the lashes from side to side, the instructions say smooth the tubes away from lashes with your fingertips. The mascara comes off super easy at the end of the day with water but it does not end up at the bottom of my eyes in the middle of the day. Everyone has different chemistry, and things work differently for people, but this is the perfect mascara for me. I love, love love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t really create &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; like it claims - it just washes of a little stringy so it looks like there are tubes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s my favorite part about this mascara: how enormous it makes my lashes appear or how much fun it is to wash it off.  I wear contacts and this does not irritate my eyes at all. It occasionally flakes, but never badly. My only complaint is how quickly I go through the tube.</li>
            <li> The best mascara I have ever purchased. Doesnt smear or run. Washes off clean and easily with soap and water. Fabulous.</li>
            <li> I generally love L&#x27;Oreal products, especially their Voluminous mascara which I&#x27;ve used for years. I decided to try the Double Extend, and was incredibly disappointed with the results. The wand creates stuck-together eyelashes and the white formula dries and hardens so fast that there&#x27;s no time to comb through and sort out all the clumps. Then the mascara on top just emphasizes the clumping. I tried several applications on different days to see if I was doing it wrong, but got the same result every time. Also, when my baby daughter accidentally bumped my eye, it caused ALL the eyelashes in that section to instantly stick together and I couldn&#x27;t get them separated again (this was several hours after I had put the basecoat/mascara on. Terribly disappointed and have gone back to their Voluminous brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascara sand I&#x27;m always looking for the 1 mascara that will not smudge. The ones that I&#x27;ve found are either super expensive or a struggle to remove. I saw a pin on this mascara and the person swore by it so I decided to try it out. My search is over! This mascara is everything that I&#x27;m looking for! I wore it all day &amp; even with a workout this mascara did not smudge or run! No retouching under my eyes! And then when it was time to remove...it was a piece of cake! I only wish it came without the other end. The wand is short and I only use the red end. But for the benefit ...I&#x27;ll take it as is! I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t more people know about this miracle? Mascara always runs and gives raccoon eyes, right? Apparently it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way. I&#x27;ve been buying the wrong kind of mascara for 25 years. This stuff FLAKES off at the end of the day. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t advertise this amazing aspect more clearly: it makes your lashes look really great, but it also does NOT smudge and smear. And it&#x27;s so reasonable. Just bought my second tube. Really, really a good product!</li>
            <li> This is the best waterproof mascara I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. The primer goes a long way, don&#x27;t need to put a lot on the eye lashes and then end with one coat of mascara. It will stay on in the heat and humidity of the South without running. It is a tad hard to take off without make up remover.</li>
            <li> In looking for a mascara that wouldn&#x27;t give me \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;  by the end of the day, I learned about  tubing  mascara.  The only one I found was $28  from Sephora. I used it for about 6  months &amp;  liked it,  but was so happy to find this one from L&#x27;Oreal much cheaper.  No black smudges under my eyes,  and it washes off so easily with just water. Actually I think I like it better than the expensive one;  it&#x27;s less  sticky/ gooey (tubing mascara has a  slightly different consistancy  than regular).  Do not buy if you need waterproof though.</li>
            <li> Pros:  This adds more visible length than any other mascara I have found so far, which is why I continue to use it.  It also comes off very easily with just water, no makeup remover necessary.  (Warning: It does so in big strands which might look odd in the pool or at the beach.)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  However, it dries out pretty fast and starts getting spidery and clumpy after about a month.  (I use about three or four layers each time though.)  It has poor separation and does not add volume.</li>
            <li> I only leave reviews if love or hate something, and I surelyhate this. I have been using Maybeline XXL mascara  for a few years and adored it. It must have been discontinued because I no longer can find it anywhere. Thought that this could replace it and was WRONG. It goes on OK, but seems to be impossible to remove fully and I&#x27;ve tried 3 different eye makeup removers. It clings to your lashes for dear life, but is not supposed to be waterproof, and a few eyelashes always come out in the process. I am throwing mine out, and it was a waste of money. Buy unless you want to be lashes free in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave me looking like a raccoon halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY mascara that I have tried that does not smudge and create a late day shadow under my sparse, thin eyelashes.  I don&#x27;t know if the shape of my Asian eyes is what causes such issues with mascara in the past....who knows?...but I do know I do not think twice about the state of my eye makeup after applying this mascara even if I&#x27;m rushing out the door and swiping this stuff on in my haste!  The coating is rich and doesn&#x27;t feel dry or chalky in the least and glides through really smoothly - something I never much paid attention to in the past.  I&#x27;m a simple person when it comes to makeup...a little all natural foundation, eye brow pencil, lip gloss and now....mascara!  I really cannot tell you how much this one small addition to my routine makes me happy.  I recently noticed a picture of myself where my eyes were closed from squinting in the sun and noticed how nice and elongated my lashes looked.  I&#x27;m not saying this stuff is a miracle worker but for me, it&#x27;s my goto! The mascara really does live up to the hype and I totally recommend it for anyone in search of a smudge proof, natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t keep enough of these in our local stores so I now order on-line. Best mascara ever. You brush on the white coating, then add the mascara over that. Your lashes are super long and no clumping. Comes off easily. Not waterproof so you may need to switch it up when that is needed. Other than that - this is it.</li>
            <li> I see lots of rave reviews, which just points out how individual these things are. I read the instructions and tried to remove it in the shower - loads of soap and warm water in there! It was hard to get off - acted a bit like rubber cement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I exited the shower, the skin under my eyes was dark. That surprised me, as the product appeared to maintain its structural integrity - what I got off of my lashes with a good bit of effort came off as casts of my lashes. Interesting. I would have thought there was nothing to stain my skin with; I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did clean that skin with some oil-free eye makeup remover and cotton pads. But it was weird to have that happen! Also, it did not appear to lengthen my lashes at all. I know these things are subjective and my ability to measure any lengthening is clearly limited. I&#x27;m just going by my own reflection in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It acted more like waterproof mascara for me and did not appear to be lengthening. The issue of staining my skin could be an effect of my age - at 60, my skin isn&#x27;t the same as it was at 20! Possibly, if I had younger skin, I would not have experienced that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, after my first use of the product and my difficulties removing it, I thought I must have misread the package whilst in the store and had accidentally purchased waterproof mascara. I went BACK to the store to get some non-waterproof mascara. I looked at this product in it&#x27;s packaging and read the instructions again. I was flabbergasted to see that it is supposed to wash off with soap and water and that I DID purchase the item I had intended to purchase, after all. I was astonished by that - for me, it behaves like a waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, a MUCH better choice is the \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Mascara\\&quot; in the gold and white tube. Washes off VERY easily with soap and water and does appear to lengthen my lashes. On the product page of the product I&#x27;m reviewing - the red and white tube - itis called \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Beauty Tubes.\\&quot; It&#x27;s weird to me that the names are so similar. Can&#x27;t quite figure that one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a few people get upset in these reviews - a bit confused and saddened by that. This is just mascara. It&#x27;s so unimportant in comparison to everything else in life! If you are upset by my comments about this makeup, please understand that I never intend to offend ANY person. I&#x27;m just one old lady who had a bad experience whilst using a product and following the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. Hehehe... that reads a bit like a legal disclaimer, doesn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the mascara I like - that washes off VERY easily and does appear to lengthen. I cannot have long, luxurious lashes - the older we become, the shorter our lashes are. That&#x27;s actually true! And I don&#x27;t wish to mess with false eyelashes. I&#x27;m too old to care that much! But I do like a bit more length if I can get it. I like this mascara here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Paris-Double-Mascara-Blackest/dp/B0000AJ3Q3/ref&#x3D;sr_1_17?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390607298&amp;sr&#x3D;8-17&amp;keywords&#x3D;l%27oreal+mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly trying different kinds of mascara.  Sometimes I find one that looks good to start out, but it never lasts the day the way it started out.  This mascara is different.  First, it does lengthen my lashes, maybe not 60%, but still noticable.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t come off during regular wear.  It lasts all day with absolutely no smudging or flaking.  When I finally wash it off in the shower it comes off easily, though kind of dramatically since it comes off like plastic and still leaves no residue on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear it on the day I go swimming, because it would come off in tiny black strings in the pool, but other than that it is ideal to use everyday.  I bought it for friends and family, just because I think it is the perfect mascara.  I simply love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara! It has worked miracles for me. I have oily eyelids that cause all other mascaras to smudge or flake, resulting in unsightly dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands, from high-end to drugstore, mega waterproof products that smudged all over yet were impossible to remove, even brands from Japan that purport to stay on all day long yet end up giving me raccoon eyes. This mascara stays on all day long with no smudges and no flaking. I&#x27;ve even worn it while working out at the gym and it did not budge. Another great thing is that it is super easy to remove--just warm water and soap. That said, if I was going to be swimming or sitting in a steam room, I would not use this mascara. It has a 2-step process that requires extra time (2 minutes, big deal) but it&#x27;s so worth it given how well this mascara has stays on all day long! This is the only mascara I will ever use!!! If you have perpetual raccoon eyes, try this!</li>
            <li> Makes my non existent eyelashes look like I have some!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original tube mascara - \\&quot;Kiss Me\\&quot; brand for years.  Finally, a cheaper product that I can more easily find in the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this type of mascara is worth it:  It doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear or flake while sweating heavily (working out), swimming, or even sleeping.  I can use this product instead of getting my eyelashes dyed (I&#x27;m blonde, with light lashes).  It is perfect for daily wear.  I have other mascara for \\&quot;evenings,\\&quot; but to be honest -- I still use this because it is so worry free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love love this mascara! I will never go back to any other cheap mascara. Not only does it extend my eyelash tremendously, it actually stays on my eyelashes throughout the day. Usually when I curl my eyelashes and put on mascara, it droops down because my eyelashes cannot handle heavy stuff. 70% of the time when I try to curl my eyelashes again when it droops, it doesn&#x27;t curl back because of the weight but this one is different. It&#x27;s true it droops down the first few applications, but when I curl it again with the product, it actually stays curled. People always compliment my eyelashes and ask if its fake. I also love how I don&#x27;t have to use makeup remover to remove the mascara because water will do the job.</li>
            <li> One of my friends recommend this to me. Lately I been buying tons of mascaras because I wanted a really good one. After spending a lot of money on disappointments, this is the one! It lasts all day long and my eyes look great. I especially love when I just wash my face and I can easily remover this product with my fingers. I super recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was always a die-hard waterproof mascara gal, but this &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; mascara is the best I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried DOZENS! It makes your lashes look longer, curlier, and VERY defined. You look like you&#x27;re not even wearing mascara, just like you&#x27;re blessed with long, thick, amazing lashes of your own. If I want a more dramatic look, I just add a light coat of another mascara on top, and I still have the extreme definition, but a little more ooomph! This product is perfect for a more natural, yet noticeably improved look for us post-menopausal ladies. And it stays put without smudging or flaking -- all day! Take it off with a warm moist towelette and just a little light rubbing. This compares well with even dept store brands. My new go-to daily lash blast - LOVE it! One-third the price of other &amp;#34;lash coating tubes&amp;#34; mascaras.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal mascaras it is the only brand I buy, they had this one on subscribe and save so I thought I would give it a try. I did not like it it clumped up my eyelashes and made my eyes itchy. When I took it of it burned my eyes so bad and took quite a few of my eyelashes with it I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch but I definitely will not use or purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Long thick lashes...a full 10 hour day and no flaking or smudging. Kind of hard to remove...but hey I&#x27;ll take that. You can&#x27;t have it both ways.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other mascara after this one. No smudging. No flaking. It stays on until I want to remove it--often I&#x27;ll apply it once and wear the same coat two days in a row. All that and removal is a snap.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the best mascara in the world, and will hopefully continue to be made until the end of all things.  It&#x27;s no more difficult to put on than any regular mascara, imo, at least if you want even coating without clumping, except you do it twice: once with the white end and once with the black.  Just insert the brush at the base of the lashes and wiggle wiggle as you brush up to coat and separate lashes at the same time to avoid clumping, same as any other mascara.  What makes this mascara awesome is the ease with which it comes off.  No need for special removers, no need for repeated scrubbing, no need for raccoon eyes - just went the lashes and wipe or pull the coating off the lashes.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite mascara because it comes off so easily without smudging!</li>
            <li> Easy to take off but doesn&#x27;t smear. I don&#x27;t think it builds up my lashes as well as other mascaras though.</li>
            <li> I love the way that it does not smudge. I have a huge problem with that. I also like that I can remove it with water fairly easily. It is harder to apply than regular mascara. I do not like that it dries out so quickly. A tube was barely lasting two weeks. I had to switch to a different product.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, the extra time is worth having longer lashes!</li>
            <li> This has been my only brand of mascara for over 2 years. I absolutely love it!  It looks great... thickens and lengthens your eyelashes. It doesn&#x27;t run when it gets wet like regular mascara, and it isn&#x27;t difficult to remove like waterproof mascara. If you should happen to get it wet unintentionally, just don&#x27;t touch it. Let it dry on its own, and it&#x27;s usually just fine. When you are ready to remove it, just get it wet and then gently pinch your eyelashes at the base, and slide your fingers. It comes off easily in a clump... no smudges.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple years, can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  I used to wear contacts, and this mascara has never flaked, smudged, or irritated my eyes - ever!  Now that I had corrective vision surgery, same thing.  The first couple times you wash this off in the shower, it is kind of freaky, it looks like black spider legs coming off, but it rinses off clean.  Never any smudge on clothing or pillowcases.  I am notorious for not removing my makeup at night, and my eyes look perfectly made up every morning, except my eyelashes are bent a little from sleeping on them.  Gives the look of false eyelashes without being over-done for every day wear.  I hope they never discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but wanted to take the time for this product. I have somewhat deep set eyes so if I wear regular mascara I get raccoon eyes when I smile or laugh. Waterproof mascara cures the raccoon problem but removing it is a task. No matter how thorough I think I&#x27;ve been, I wake up the next morning with mascara residue around my eyes. So tube mascara has been an excellent option. It stays on until I remove it. When I remove it, it comes completely off. I was using Blinc tube mascara but it is expensive and there is a short window when the consistency is just right. The L&#x27;Oreal brand has been great. I liberally apply the base then run a lash comb through to remove any clumps then apply the mascara. My lashes are well defined, pretty long and pretty natural looking. The base and mascara dry pretty quick so I&#x27;ve learned to do one eye at a time. I hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA HANDS DOWN! Have been using nothing but this for the passed two years or so. Would recommend it to anyone. Love how easy it is to take off at night, and I can wear it light or heavy depending on the look I&#x27;m going for. Will probably use this for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in stores and liked it, so, I thought I would purchase it while Xmas shopping.  VERY disappointed to see the unopened package yellowed which means the mascara is old also.  Will not buy this from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about this mascara, but mine was already drying out when I opened it.  Chunks of mascara fell off when I pulled the brush out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think maybe Amazon should not sell cosmetics as this is the 2nd item I have ordered recently that appeared to be old and unusable.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! It gives me length and does not rub off through out the night. say goodbye to raccoon eyes, they are a thing of the past with this product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite go-to mascaras because it has everything I need, all in one.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best mascara if you wear contact lenses!  I have worn this for years and will not wear anything else!</li>
            <li> Before using this, I used to have dark circles under my eyes...turned out to be trace amounts of mascara from the standard type formulas. This is different from any other mascara in that it comes off neatly like little threads with just water. Just splash water several times and wash them off . Or rub your eyelashes with wet fingertips. They can stick to the tub or shower pan and dry on, so make sure to wash them down the drain. I wish they didn&#x27;t dry so quickly and look clumpy if I dont work quickly. But it&#x27;s worth it; I used to have to clean mascara off with 3 separate methods just to remove it all: washing with soap, wiping with an eye makeup remover, then wiping with a QTip with moisturizer on it, and that&#x27;s just too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was $40 a tube when it first came out as a Lancome product in the 80s. Love L&#x27;Oreal!!</li>
            <li> This mascara was really good, and it made my lashes bold and they really stood out without looking like I had too much makeup on! I like the double sided tube so that you can prime your lashes before applying the black mascara. I was a little worried at first about how the white side would work on my lashes but the black coats it perfectly. I would recommend a good eye makeup remover to take it off though, this stuff really lasts!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or run on my extremely oily skin in hot summer weather. It is also very easy to remove, just use warm water and it comes right off</li>
            <li> So..I was upset that Revlon discontinued their dual lash booster/mascara combo, so I was forced to try this by L&#x27;Oreal. It goes on much thicker and darker than any I have tried, making my lashes look star quality almost fake length and thickness from my natural light and short ones. Unfortunately it is not waterproof. However, that ended up being it&#x27;s best quality! I normally have to use baby oil to get my waterproof mascaras off. This one requires NO mascara remover AT ALL! It stays on ALL day and even while I sleep. Until I get in the SHOWER, then somehow the water activates it enough to just crumble off in my fingers! AMAZING. Please do not stop making this! I won&#x27;t wear it in the ocean and pool since it&#x27;s not waterproof, but those other waterproof kinds irritate me so much I end up pulling my eyelashes out usually. This is the best on the days I&#x27;m not going swimming. I have never met a mascara that didn&#x27;t come off until I wanted it to and then with such ease when I am ready. No irritation.</li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite mascara since the one I usually use has been discontinued. It&#x27;s really easy to use even though 2 steps are required for application. I have really thin and short eyelashes but the base coat for this mascara really helps with building length and volume. Even though my lashes are thin and short, I find that 1 application of base coat and 1 application of mascara is all I need to get longer fuller lashes. I have worn this throughout the day without ever having to reapply and have never had any problems with it smudging, flaking or running. It really does last all day long! This is a 2 step mascara so it&#x27;s going to take a minute or 2 longer to apply but really no big difference from using any regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara forms &#x27;tubes&#x27; around your eyelashes when you apply, which helps give it a nice voluminous look. Definitely a plus for someone like me with thin eyelashes. Because it forms tubelike around eyelashes, removal is easy with the use of a make-up remover. I use eye make-up remover pad to remove this mascara, and I really like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or blacken my eye like other mascaras do. It also doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort to remove and when you&#x27;re removing it, the mascara comes off in tubelike fibers. It&#x27;s pretty neat! With other mascaras I usually use 2 or 3 pads, but with this mascara I only use 1 pad, which saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of mascaras.  I have thin eyelashes but a lot of them so it takes some work to thicken my lashes.  But it can be done.  The problem is my lashes don&#x27;t look natural when I clump on mascara and I  get major raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  I also have sensitive eyes so I have never been able to find the right mascara that worked perfectly for my needs.  While looking up contact safe mascara, I came across &amp;#34;tube mascara&amp;#34; which I have never heard of before.  I have used expensive fiber mascara from a department store and the weight/sentivity to fibers made it impossible for me to wear, but tube lashes- I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Most tube mascaras are pretty expensive so I decided to go with this since it was significantly cheaper and the reviews I read said contact safe (not all tube mascaras are.). I have to say I am pretty happy with it.  It is the best mascara I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clump easily when used against directions (see below)&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t heavy on lashes&lt;br /&gt;Price is considerably cheaper than most tube mascaras I found&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Directions say remove with water and rub- removing feels weird and takes some work.  I did use an eye cleaner after giving the water only a try and it removed the residue.  Maybe I am removing wrong because others have said the tubes just slide off clean, mine clumped up into a (for lack of a better description) boogery texture.&lt;br /&gt;Directions say no need to wait for tube application to dry before putting on mascara.  When I followed directions it made my lashes thick and clumpy.  It did much better when I let the tubes dry (1-2min) and my lashes don&#x27;t stick when I dry in between.&lt;br /&gt;The one wand holds two products so you are getting 1/2 the mascara.  For this reason I may look into a more expensive tube mascara if this one runs out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The tubes are VERY white so I can&#x27;t use this mascara when I am in a hurry.  I have to take my time to make sure I fully cover all the white base</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t know better I&#x27;d think this L&#x27;Oreal product is pretty good, and the price is excellent.  However, the Blinc mascara is far superior in application, lengthening and building, and especially in removal.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! It makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing lash extensions. The only downside is that it takes forever to wash off, and comes off in clumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this specific mascara for years. I love the fact that when you was off you makeup, the pieces of fiber come off. It looks like you are loosing your lashes, but you are not. Since the lash fibers fall off as you wash your face, you have no racoon eyes. Even when I apply other mascaras on top of this l&#x27;oreal, I do not have raccoon eyes when I was off. I will be loyal to this mascara as long as its on the market.</li>
            <li> Thinking this was an old bottle sent to me as I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it worked much better</li>
            <li> Product is not acceptable.  Unable to use.  Does make eyelashes look longer, but flakes off and gets in eyes.  tried it without the white, thought maybe that was the problem, but still flakes off.  Had to throw away.  Would never order again or recommend.</li>
            <li> I was using all kinds of fake eye lashes and switched to this product.  I have no idea HOW they do it, but it creates more and longer lashes.  There are these little tubes/extra lashes that come off when I take off the mascara.  Comes off easy in the shower with soap.  Don&#x27;t wait for the white part to dry.  You&#x27;ll love it.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out, stays smooth and dark...no flakiness!  I want and bought more and stopped the fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> When I first got this mascara I absolutely hated it. But it is a product you need to learn to apply and take off properly, and with practice you will love it! When I first used it, my lashes were incredibly clumpy and then at night I would scrub and scrub with eye makeup remover to try to get it off. I lost a few eyelashes in the process. But now before I put it on in the morning I comb out my eyelashes before putting a light coat of the white stuff on first. I don&#x27;t let it dry at all before putting on the mascara. I only put on one coat of each. To take it off at night, I just splash my eyes with warm water a few times and very lightly rub my eyelashes with my finger. It peels right off! So easy and it makes my eyelashes look amazing - some people have asked me lately if I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have used Clinique&#x27;s High Impact mascara for years and years, primarily for the easy &amp;#34;warm water removal&amp;#34;. Unfortunately, I discovered that there&#x27;s no easy and inexpensive way to order my favorite mascara online, and now with two littles, a trip to the mall isn&#x27;t as quick, easy, or fun as it used to be. SO, I have to say that I am THRILLED that this mascara removes just as easily as my favored Clinique does, yet ships to my door free and costs less. It even seems like it applies easier. I am sure that the Clinique mascara is healthier and likely has less chemicals etc, but at this moment in life…ease and convenience far outweigh my concern for what&#x27;s in my mascara :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this item is how easily removed it is.  I just wet my fingertips, place them on my lashes and gently wipe off the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; using my thumb and index fingers.  It wears all day without flaking or smudging.  I have a habit of rubbing my eyes and this product does&#x27;t budge all day until I remove it.  I can even forget to take it off at bed and just as easily remove in in the shower the next morning or while washing my face.  Just remember it is NOT waterproof, so if you are looking for that, this item isn&#x27;t for you.  So glad I know i can find this on amazon for a reasonable price because it is hard to find in stores in my area now.</li>
            <li> There are mascara a that lengthen/thicken/do your taxes better, but, if you actually want it to *stay* in your lashes, this is the one you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, and every mascara, even waterproof ones, will leave me looking like a raccoon. This is the only one I&#x27;ve found will keep me looking good all day.  And I don&#x27;t have to use a make up remover to get it off!  It&#x27;s definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever, Ever.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara so far</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!  I have fairly short eyelashes so I need a primer to add much length.  This mascara works great for length and volume, and it literally &amp;#34;rolls&amp;#34; off in the shower.  I like that my eye lashes don&#x27;t get dried and brittle if I don&#x27;t take it off at night...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for 4+ years. It&#x27;s made my eye lashes thicker and longer with no mascara applied. While it is on I have never had this mascara run and it really does extend my eyelashes to where strangers often complement my eyes. I will forever use this product and only this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market!</li>
            <li> As a busy Mom and one who doesn&#x27;t enjoy primping, unless it&#x27;s for a night out on the town, I love this mascara.  No clumping, no smudging and seriously waterproof.  If it does come off, it&#x27;s when I want it to.  It just takes warm water in the shower and it comes right off.  No raccoon eyes when you get out of the shower.  Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes our faces look there best when were soaking wet.  Who wants to see a black mess under our eyes when we get that first glance in the mirror when we emerge refreshed from a nice long shower.  It&#x27;s worth the price, which I don&#x27;t think is that bad. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I switched to this about six months ago because the other tubes mascara I was using was flaking into my eyes.  I&#x27;ve not had any trouble with this and it goes on easily and looks great.  There are two steps to it, but only takes a few seconds and you&#x27;re done.  Taking it off is easy, I do it in the shower.  I just stand under running water and gently rub my eyes down from top to bottom with eyes closed, using a wet facecloth.  It comes right off. And the best part is, because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t smudge of come off until you wash it off. Don&#x27;t wear in the pool, though because water will loosen the tubes and it will start coming off.</li>
            <li> ok so in terms of color, i give this mascara credit. but i have say that i hate the fact that it makes your lashes just absolutely clump together. i dont know if this is just me because i have longer eyelashes. the fact that it comes off very easily without smudging is nice.</li>
            <li> Dries clumpy. Used it for a week then threw it away.</li>
            <li> This mascara dried my lashes when wanted to apply additional coats, and it also pulled out my lashes when removing it. I wet a cotton pad with some eye makeup remover and press lightly on my eyes for 1-2 minutes, then do the little zigzag motion while whiping it downwards. The mascara came off as well as some lashes. I will not use it again. Terrible product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful. Flaky, gives you the &amp;#34;spider leg&amp;#34; look. Gave it to my 16 yo after I tried it, she hated it, too.</li>
            <li> I have opened two of these.  Both ends of this product are dry as if they are old or were exposed to extremely dry temperatures.  This is a mascara that I have been using for quite some time and with good results.  Using this does not lengthen or darken my lashes as it has in the past.  It only flakes as with and older and used tube of mascara.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Mascara does not smudge or run.  Lashes look great for many hours. Removes with cold cream and there is no ordor.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend about a year ago and I didn&#x27;t end up buying it until 6 months ago because it costs $10 here where I live. Once I gave in I regretted not buying it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake at all, and doesn&#x27;t even come off when you&#x27;re crying (speaking from experience here). The only way it comes off is in the shower or if you soak your lashes with a wet washcloth or cotton ball for 30-60 seconds. Once soaked you pull it off with your fingertips and it comes off easy in rubbery little strings, which is totally cool :) Make sure to remove it if you&#x27;re going swimming or there will be little black tubes floating in the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can apply this and it will stay on and look good for 2-3 days without reapplying. However if you have allergies like me and your eyes get itchy and you rub them A LOT then it can rub off. But it takes prolonged and frequent rubbing (also speaking from experience). I saw an earlier review that said she wore this through labor and delivery of her child and it stayed on and still looked good when she got back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case this didn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes 80% like they say, I&#x27;ll give them 30%, 40% max. This might be different for others though. I don&#x27;t care about that so it doesn&#x27;t bother me but I wanted to mention it for those who do care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tube of this lasts me about 3 months and I usually apply it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> The first time I received this mascara, the white primer side was completely dried up. Amazon quickly replaced it - I literally received a new one the next day - and it was fine. I like the primer side, I have even used it with other mascaras. I like Elf&#x27;s $3 mascara primer much better. The mascara side is just okay. The mascara makes my lashes very long but they stick together so it looks like I have 3 or 4 long, spiky lashes - and that&#x27;s it. You can&#x27;t really brush them to fix this either because the mascara dries into what they call &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; and they just pull off when you try. There are much better options out there but all in all, it&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li> So this is the last mascara I will ever buy, please god don&#x27;t stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have to understand that its not normal mascara.  it works differently.&lt;br /&gt;its like fake eyelashes that you encase your own lashs in.  its genius really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heres the thing about this stuff- Its a time switcharoo.&lt;br /&gt;You know how normal mascara is quick and easy to put on- but is a pain to get off or comes off when you don&#x27;t want?  well this stuff is the opposite.  it stays put, it comes off miraculously clean and easy, doesn&#x27;t flake and run into your eyes and on your face- but its takes a lil extra time to get it on right.&lt;br /&gt;so it switched the time used from taking it off to putting it on.  see what im sayin?&lt;br /&gt;So its all about which one is better for you- do you require the fastest morning prep imaginable and only have time to slap mascara on in one second while looking in the car mirror on your commute but have all night to oil and scrub and ice your irritated eyes at night?  then this isn&#x27;t for you.  If you aren&#x27;t in a rush and you are competent enough to know how to accurately apply mascara- but really really despise the work and raccoon eyes and redness of the removal process- this is your golden ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also- GREAT for sensitive eyes and contact wearers (like me).&lt;br /&gt;I actually had to stop wearing mascara because my eyes just turned into itchy irritated messes every time I wore it.  and removing it always left the delicate skin around my eyes red and puffy no matter what I used.  but if you don&#x27;t scrub away - you wake up with black lines around your eyes.  always.  (not good for keeping wrinkles away either to have to rub and wipe your eyes so much!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just take a wet paper towel, hold it over my eye to let the lashe tubes soak up the water- then just wipe the tubes away gently, or lightly pinch and pull with your fingertips and wallah.  gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;because like i said- its not a wax you paint on, its something that actually encases yoru lash.  It sets and becomes this little tube that just pulls away with nothing left behind.  no more pulling at your delicate skin and no need for makeup removers.  make up removers always burn my skin and eyes- so I switched to just good old olive or coconut oil- but I always ended up getting a little of the oil in my eyes so I could only ever take my maekup off with my contacts removed and even then my eyes would always be nasty in the morning and just..ugh.  btu this stuff- not a fleck, not a drop, not a trace of mascara anywhere after just a little water and soft wiping or pinching.  brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if that wasn&#x27;t enough- the length and girth this gives my lashes is like no other mascara ive ever used.  it looks like im wearing fake lashes (in a good way!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the part everyone complains about is that its kind of sucks to put on. and its true- but like i said- its just a time switch.  more time putting on, less time taking off.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so,  be sure to comb and curl your lashes to get them all untangled- this will help with clumping.  start with the white stuff.  really really wipe that wand off on the sides of the tube opening.  I scrape the entire tube off until youd think theres nothing left on it.  then apply it well, and have a safety pin handy to separate clumped lashes before they dry. this stuff clumps.  but its SO worth it to give it trudge through the declumping process.  work one eye at a time because you don&#x27;t want it drying before its all declumped. it dries pretty stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and if you REALLY hate the white stuff- you don&#x27;t need it.  I went to the site and learned that its only there to give girth.  apparently without it you don&#x27;t get that full lash look that buyers wanted so they added the white step.  its not necessary for the \\&quot;tubing\\&quot; process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then do the same with the mascara itself- really scrape off excess from the applicator. and work one eye at a time to declump before drying. And yes, you have to be sure you cover the white which takes some more TLC. but again- worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review that someone said they could feel it on their lashes- if you don&#x27;t declump and separate your lashes- I can see where this would happen. its a thick coating.  but I ALWAYS feel my mascara and I hate the way it feels on me- I have no complaints with this stuff at all.  like I said though- I take the extra care and time when applying though so that the stuff doesn&#x27;t set in clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it lasts. I mean, I feel like this stuff is impenetrable. it lasts mor ethan all day. dont sleep in it.  no no no.  you shouldn&#x27;t ever sleep in mascara to begin with.  but ya know, sometimes, ugh, you just fall asleep.  and I did.  and I woke up and my lashes were clumped together all Tammy Faye Baker style. felt and looked disgusting. BUT- it hadn&#x27;t ran or flaked or came off on my face of pillow- the lashes just clumped together. and it came of just as easily as always- just a wet paper towel. so, in a way- that&#x27;s kind of remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ive ben in sweaty humidity, steamy baths and showers, and it stays put. I have never swam in it though.  I don&#x27;t swim in makeup anyway.  its not labeled for waterproof- and it comes off easily with water but I did read a reviewer say they swam with it and it was fine.  so I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not just a swipe swipe ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;But in my opinion- its worth it.  With the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it lasts, and the ease and nonirritating way it comes off.  Its the best mascara ive ever used.  and ive tried countless types and brands.  ive even made my own before.  this one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;and its not like it takes an hour to do- i successfully apply it to both eyes in just a couple minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh and also- people that say they are losing eyelashes because of this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the tubes that come off look like your lashes- so its possible people mistake these tubes for lashes.&lt;br /&gt;2. they might be pulling at their own lashes way too hard.  that is completely unnecessary.  just get the lashes wet- and softly slide the tubes off.  if you have to pull so hard that youre pulling out your lashes- you just aren&#x27;t getting them wet enough.  put a wet paper towel or wash cloth over them and let them soak the water.  you need no force at all.&lt;br /&gt;3. you lose lashes all the time.  like brushing your hair and getting hairs in yoru brush- it happens.  it will happen with normal mascara when you rub it off to. it will happen if you rub your eyes without any makeup at all on. just sayin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok, that&#x27;s my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;So Ive been using this for about 5 months now and I have to say it only gets better.&lt;br /&gt;Ive gotten to the point where I can put this on as quickly and easily as normal mascara.  Don&#x27;t ask me how- its just ...somehow...easier.  Like I figured out the subtle ways to move the wand and keep it from clumping.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer need a pin handy to separate and it takes me half the time it used- which wasn&#x27;t much time to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO- This is super amazing so listen up.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do an experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started teaching myself to sleep on my back.  for lots of reasons- wrinkles, back and neck issues, so on.  its supposed to be the healthiest way to sleep.  So im trying it out and I really do feel better in a lot of ways- But anyway- So I started trying out sleeping in this mascara- since the reason it was horrible before was because I slept on my side and it clumped it all up.&lt;br /&gt;And I have gotten to the point where i can wear this mascara for a week at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im sure this is not recommended by the manufacturer but this mascara DOES NOT BUDGE so I thought- why the heck not?  im sleeping on my back so it doesn&#x27;t clump it- lets see how long this stuff stays on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course- keep in mind- in order to do this trick- I use face wipes only to wash my face or my oil and wash clothtrick.  No water.  The face wipes don&#x27;t take it off- even when im removing eye makeup. I haven&#x27;t tried the oil around my eyes yet though to see if it stays put.&lt;br /&gt;So its super useful for vacations.  or weekend trips, camping even.  I love it for vacations with my boyfriend when face washing is usually nothing but a quick face wipe time in bed anyway.  I can wake up and have mascara on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And still no irritation. Ive never had a mascara that didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Its still a miracle and keeps getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this the affordable DIY answer to eyelash extensions.&lt;br /&gt;And that is such an awesome thing to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K.  Im done ranting like a lunatic about mascara. But someone had to do it.t be pulling at their own lashes way too hard.  that is completely unnecessary.  just get the lashes wet- and softly slide the tubes off.  if you have to pull so hard that youre pulling out your lashes- you just aren&#x27;t getting them wet enough.  put a wet paper towel or wash cloth over them and let them soak the water.  you need no force at all.&lt;br /&gt;3. you lose lashes all the time.  like brushing your hair and getting hairs in yoru brush- it happens.  it will happen with normal mascara when you rub it off to. it will happen if you rub your eyes without any makeup at all on. just sayin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok, that&#x27;s my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;So Ive been using this for about 5 months now and I have to say it only gets better.&lt;br /&gt;Ive gotten to the point where I can put this on as quickly and easily as normal mascara.

            <li> This mascara makes your eyelashes look so long and full. I use it everyday and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Wish it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use and you won&#x27;t believe those lush full eyelashes.  Stays on well without smudging.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> thanks for everything! I loved!</li>
            <li> This mascara looks amazing and goes on easily however it causes eye irritation and caused my eyes to produce eye gunk a few days after application.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of CoverGirl professional *waterproof* mascara the way it used to be before they changed the formula (and made it less smudge-proof). It really does noticeably increase the length of my lashes, and is waterproof as long as you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; your lashes. It&#x27;s easy to remove (by taking a wet washcloth and letting it rest on your lashes for a minute or two, then gently wiping). I&#x27;m glad I finally found something as the way Covergirl *used* to be!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this produce when looking to buy more of my (expensive) tubing mascara of another brand. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I must say, I like this even better. I don&#x27;t always use it with the white base coat, but when I do, it has a great plumping quality - you just have to make sure to cover up all the white with the black so there&#x27;s nothing showing through. I recommend using the white, not letting it dry, and immediately applying the black right afterwards. This helps your lashes from looking like spiders! Stays on all day - love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 3 years exclusively!  I like that it stays on all day and volumizes my thinning lashes.  I LOVE that it tubes because I don&#x27;t need to use eye makeup remover. All you do is get your lashes wet in the shower and wait a couple seconds and the mascara comes off in tubes. No smearing!  I gave it 4 stars because it dries out in the tube sooner than I&#x27;d like. It seems to have changes over the years as it used to last longer. Maybe I&#x27;m using more of it and I&#x27;m using it up more frequently, but I think its drying in the tube. Love this mascara just wish it stayed wet a little longer.</li>
            <li> Someone at Sephora told me I have oily eyelids.  Eye liner doesn&#x27;t stay on my eyelids, neither does mascara.  I tried maybe 10 different brands of waterproof and regular mascara from cheap drugstore brands to more expensive labels. All gives me raccoon eyes within 2 - 4 hrs, except this one.  It forms tubes around my lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge and is easy to remove. Though not the best at thickening, It gives good volume and length. And it NEVER smudges on me.  Unless I can find another mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge, I will stick with this.&lt;br /&gt; The downside is that it gums up less than a month after opening up the tube.  Then it starts to flake a little at the end of the day.  In the first 2 weeks of use, it&#x27;s the best mascara ever.  If L&#x27;Oreal can figure out how to maintain the consistency longer, it will be a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> I had to leave a review because for me, mascara is the one cosmetic I&#x27;d want with me if I were stranded on a desert island. This stuff is great, especially after spending $25 every couple months on Blinc which is basically the same product. The Beauty Tubes stay on, but does need to be replaced probably every 2 months because it dries out. You should put the black mascara on top of the white primer immediately - don&#x27;t wait for the primer to dry or you&#x27;ll have very clumpy looking lashes. Also, soak warm water on your eyes for 5 seconds or so before trying to remove it. It needs to soften for removal. If you&#x27;re looking to actually grow longer eyelashes, as I read from one reviewer, this is not that product - this is simply mascara with some sort of conditioner. To grow longer lashes you need  Latisse and it does work! I left off one star for the drying out issue, but it really should be 4.75 stars because that&#x27;s a small issue considering the benefits of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I will never ever go back to using plain old mascara. It took me the same amount of time using this as it would for me to use 2 coats of my old mascara. I made sure to get all the clumps from the white side out of my lashes before applying the dark mascara. It looked fabulous! Not only that, it stayed on all day, and felt the same as my normal mascara (no itchy eyes or irritation with it). When I took it off I washed my face with warm water, as I do every night. It came off easily and didn&#x27;t leave any black residue behind. I&#x27;m purchasing 2 more of these right now so I can stay stocked up! If you try this, you will never go back to your old generic mascara!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  I have used &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; mascara (&amp;#62;$30) for years.  This is so much better.  It does not flake or smear at all. Period. There is a bit of a learning curve.  I apply the primer to upper and lower lashes, then apply mascara.  Two coats. Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara does make your lashes full and long, but I got tired of the two step process. Other one-step mascaras produce similar results. So while it isn&#x27;t a bad product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again - I guess I am a little too rushed in the morning!</li>
            <li> Two things about me:  1.  I am lazy when it comes to my makeup.  2.  I am the queen of raccoon eyes with every brand of mascara.  That being said, this is mascara is worth the extra 30 seconds because it doesn&#x27;t budge.  No flaking, no raccoon eyes.  I use facial cloths at night and these usually remove the mascara without too much work.  (When I&#x27;m in a hurry I may wake up with flakes in the morning.)  The primer gives a lot of length and some thickness.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because the primer can get a little clumpy and requires occasional wiping of the applicator.</li>
            <li> I have about 8 different kinds of mascara in my purse right now, but since getting this mascara I haven&#x27;t used any of them. this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve found yet!</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara. My lashes are blonde-tipped and on the shorter side, so the extension and volume this gives my lashes is significant! So easy to remove too (just wash off with warm water). It also never creates that under-eye shadow unlike other mascaras that flake off over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara - five stars for the product, but only when it is a fresh tube. I have oily skin so my mascara always rubbed off on my upper and lower lids. This mascara does not do that at all, and my lashes look significantly longer.  The three star rating is because I think the product was old. The main problem I have with ordering this mascara from Amazon is that I think it is not as fresh as what I can buy from Target, for instance. When the mascara is fresh, it comes off in tubes when you wash it off. The last tube I got from Amazon was gummy and difficult to take off. It definitely did not come off in the &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; tubes. I was getting it via Amazon Subscribe and Save - a fresh tube every month. But I canceled my subscription and started buying it from Target again.</li>
            <li> The best mascara for me, as it just goes off while you&#x27;re having shower and no need to clean again after.</li>
            <li> Hello!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is my favourite one, since the first time that i use her. I live in Europe and i can&#x27;t buy her in here because she isn&#x27;t able to by not even by l&#x27;oreal. I don&#x27;t now why. I love it, and was you know it&#x27;s the first time that i buy to you, and i buy and soon bought three units. the first unit that i open its good.I hope the next be so good as this first. I just tink that the price is to hide. If it was less expensive i wood bought more.</li>
            <li> Amazing results, my wife&#x27;s friends ask her how she got those great eye lashes</li>
            <li> I was happy to see this mascara was still manufactured, and it works great as far as length goes. What it does lack is volume. I guess we can&#x27;t always get what we want :) I still love using it in conjunction with another mascara for volume. There is a learning curve, but you can get past it with my tip. Do one eye at a time so the white conditioning side isn&#x27;t dried before putting the mascara over it. The white stuff is what stretches to make the long end tubes. Great for length, but lacks in volume.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say but this is the worst mascara I have ever used. It clumps my lashes together in a way that makes them look sparse when I have decent lashes to begin with. Also, even though it isn&#x27;t Waterproof, it takes me scraping my lashes between finger nails to get it off. No amount of eye makeup remover or soap worked.  The old Double Extend formula was my go-to for years. This has encouraged me to look into making my own. It couldn&#x27;t be as bad as this. Again, sorry loreal.</li>
            <li> Não tive nenhum problema na minha compra, recebi o produto em perfeito estado e dentro do prazo previsto. Site confiável, recomendo.</li>
            <li> as described I pay $27 at Macy&#x27;s for mascara And this is just as good&lt;br /&gt;And you have to buy the primer separately</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, it works well, builds lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump (much) when it&#x27;s being applied.  The weird thing is, that when you wash it off, it literally comes off in sheets.  It looks as if you&#x27;re losing all you eyelases.  I have a mirror in my shower and after washing my face, there are these thick solid black masses going down my cheeks.  I guess the upside of that is that it&#x27;s easily removable, but it&#x27;s a little creepy.</li>
            <li> Oh my gawd, this is fabulous! It doesn&#x27;t smear, or flake off. It lasts all day and is super easy to remove. This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> My favorite Mascara!  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I rarely used both ends, but I loved how easily this mascara just peeled off in the shower. Stayed on no problem during the day though</li>
            <li> You will either like this mascara or not like it.  I don&#x27;t think there is an in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my lashes long and thick.  I have switched form Origins mascara to this.  I wear contacts and suffer from allergies.  This mascara does not flake or cause me eye irritation at all.  Plus when I use my eye drops the mascara does not come off or run down my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove this mascara it is very important to get your eyes wet and keep the mascara wet until it loosens.  Once it loosens it comes right off.  YOU ARE NOT LOSING YOUR LASHES.  What comes off is the mascara tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No under eye black eyes removing this item.  This is not for lazy people who want to put on mascara quick.. You must do the two step process for it to work like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are long and thick with this mascara and I receive lots of compliments and have had two people ask me what kind of mascara I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you have time to correctly apply it.</li>
            <li> Makes eyelashes REALLY long and is easy to remove but at the same time stays put/doesn&#x27;t smudge. It can be a bit clumpy if you put too much of either the primer or mascara on but overall it works really well. It doesn&#x27;t give much volume, pretty much only &#x27;adds&#x27; length. Use a good eyelash curler with this and it can look gorgeous, similar to false lashes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  It makes my eyelashes seem much thicker and longer and it stays smudge free all day long. I&#x27;ve even slept in it and it doesn&#x27;t budge until I wash it off.</li>
            <li> I am always on the search for the perfect mascara. As a pale blonde, my eyelashes (and brows) are invisible. My lashes are very long, but they&#x27;re invisible, so long doesn&#x27;t matter if you can&#x27;t see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recently told me about a tube mascara called \\&quot;Blinc.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t want to spend $25 on a mascara that I had to either buy online or drive 15 miles to Sephora to purchase, so I researched a tube mascara I could buy at a grocery store. This product was the only one I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it with high hopes I would finally have a mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge or worse, flake.  It preforms beautifully on both accounts.  Plus it adds length.. which I don&#x27;t need. It adds a bit too much length for my tastes, but would be perfect for someone with shorter lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t add body though, which if fine for daytime wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about the white \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; I was to apply first.  So the first day I tried the conditioner on one eye, but not the other. I could tell no difference in the application of the mascara, the wear, or the removal. Not sure what exactly the conditioner is meant for.. Never thought to condition my lashes before. I would gladly give the white stuff up for a longer tube of mascara.  See, this mascara is divided into two parts. The wands are therefore short. Too short, in my opinion.  We are all used to longer wands on our mascara. The short wand makes it a bit more difficult to reach the corners of my eyes without putting my hands on my face. And, I fear that because the actual tubes of mascara are so short, this mascara will run out soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara seems to only be available in black, and blackest black. Nothing for us fair haired people... no black brown or brown.  I don&#x27;t like to look so severe during the day with a black mascara against my fair skin and light hair, but the black is fine. It&#x27;s not stark at all. It is passable for daytime wear for a fair blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback for me is the removal. Yes, it does remove like a dream when you are ready. Just a little moisture, and they come right off. Yes, they are like little tubes, and become very pliable, almost \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; when they get wet.  My problem with this is, although the package says water resistant, any little moisture makes my eyelashes clump together. Then I just touch them and the mascara lifts right off my lash. I&#x27;m just talking a little tear from the cold weather. I can&#x27;t imagine how one would look right after crying, or laughing, or how it would wear in the summer with perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it is wonderful at not smudging or smearing on dry skin, it will come completely off with any little bit of moisture, which to me, is worse than smudginglike a dream when you are ready. Just a little moisture, and they come right off. Yes, they are like little tubes, and become very pliable, almost \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; when they get wet.

            <li> I have short blonde eyelashes that refuse to curl.  You know, the kind that no matter what mascara I use: volumizing, lengthening, thickening--nothing does much other than darken them, leaving me disappointed because the models in the ads (with their fake eyelashes) had such long, thick lashes just by using that brand&#x27;s mascara.... I actually had the Novalashes for a while, but they became expensive to maintain, though they looked beautiful and were less maintenance for me.  This mascara is a great runner up.  It actually does lengthen my short, sad eyelashes, and makes me look much more awake.  Yes, this can clump, but I just apply to clean lashes, first wiping the wand on the rim of the tube to remove the excess.  You can use a tissue to wipe the excess off, but that wastes product.  After a coat of the primer, I use two coats of the mascara, and it makes all the difference.  You know a great coat of mascara can make all the difference, so I envy those of you with lovely long lashes. It&#x27;s also easy to take off. I just use warm water on my fingertips and rub my eyelashes--this will come off in what looks like fibrous clumps, leaving no residue on your lashes. It&#x27;s easy. For the price, this is a wonderful mascara--I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This used to be my savior, my HG of mascaras! No smudging for the first time in my life! I had it on auto ship every month because it dried out quickly but it was cheap. I had racoon eyes no matter what before I discovered tube mascara. I still love the concept and may try another brand but this stuff started making my eyelashes fall out after using it for over a year and I think any tube mascara will because they make your lashes too hard. My lashes still haven&#x27;t recovered. They got so thin that in some spots I had no or just stubs of lashes. :( so so sad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to YSL baby doll mascara--no tubes, no broken/missing lashes, no smudging--huge price tag. Oh well. I don&#x27;t want bald eyes so I&#x27;d better pay up!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand to give this a two star rating--so just use it on those extra long days/nights where you know you won&#x27;t have time for raccoon eye check ups.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rich enough to throw even 9 bucks into the trash, but in this case I have to. If you have pretty thick lashes, then maybe it&#x27;ll work for you. I have thin lashes, and this mascara made them look horrible. Let me say that it didn&#x27;t even add to the length. Besides, it clumped them together, and when I tried to separate them it just wouldn&#x27;t work. After using this thing I looked like I had a few long lashes with huge gaps in between. But the worst part is that it&#x27;s impossible to remove it with a mascara remover. It comes off in tubes and flakes and no matter how much you wipe, it all remains under your eyes. Some say it comes off easily with plain water, but I haven&#x27;t tried. I just wasted a lot of remover on it. Going back to Maybelline Mega Plush. At least it actually adds up to the volume.</li>
            <li> I found that my lashes get very brittle with this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara. It absolutely makes your lashes thicker and longer. A two step process but worth the extra time. The best way is to apply the white coat then immediately after do the same lash with the black coat. If you do all four of your lashes first with the white then do the black after it gets dry and doesn&#x27;t work well. The trick it one lash at a time. Upper white coat then right away the black coat.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the L&#x27;Oreal Tube mascara for a couple of years now; it&#x27;s my goto mascara.  I love the tube mascara formulation; it stays put until you soak your eyes in warm water, then it comes off cleanly, without the use of a makeup remover.  There is never EVER under eye residue.  It&#x27;s a win/win situation.  I&#x27;ve found that tube mascara will add volume, as well as lengthen, without &amp;#34;spider eye&amp;#34;, or the &amp;#34;Lady of the Evening&amp;#34; look (to be polite).  It leaves my lashes natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I&#x27;ve found, that I would change, is that L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s formulation drys quickly, a little too quickly.  You have to be fast about getting it on; you can only layer it while it&#x27;s still wet.  As a result, the mascara in the tube can dry quickly.  I&#x27;ve learned to completely clean off the applicator, before putting it away; this way you don&#x27;t have any small clumps of mascara mixing with the new mascara in the tube. It lasts longer this way.  .  I&#x27;ve read that Blink&#x27;s formulation stays wet longer, but it also costs substantially more than L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I wear contact lenses.  I won&#x27;t wear any other mascara.  This has an undercoat with lengthening fibers and an outer coat that prevents the fibers from escaping into my eyes.  I can wear it all day and if I forget to wash it off at night it doesn&#x27;t create problems.</li>
            <li> So easy to put on and removes nice and easy with water and washcloth.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fantastic!  I previously used the Trish McEvoy High Volume mascara which I liked but was too pricey.  This over-the-counter version works just as well for a quarter of the price.  The only real difference is that it is a two step process, but it really doesn&#x27;t take me more that a few seconds longer than usual.  I love that the mascara never rubs off, even after a long day and eye rubbing, and comes off completely while washing my face with my usual facewash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fibers in this product.  It irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> love this mascara!! Nothing like it. makes my eyelashes look like they&#x27;re naturally long. YAYYYSS!! I use I almost everyday and have bought another one.</li>
            <li> Works way better than those so called big brands. Love it.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;d like to be able to say that I like this but since it arrived dried up like many others have mentioned, worthless. Hard to rate an actual product if it arrives unuseable.</li>
            <li> For those with oily lids, tube mascara is the only way to go! For decades, every single mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, including waterproof and expensive store brands, ended up underneath my eyes within an hour even if I&#x27;d used powder, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered the wonders of tubing mascara! Hurrah! There are several brands available. So far, I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal, Blinc, DHC, Cargo, and Trish McEvoy, all with great results. NO MORE RACCOON EYES!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the formulas all seem pretty similar, the biggest differences are the  brushes and the effect they give your lashes. The L&#x27;Oreal creates a very pretty, natural look of long, soft lashes without looking like fake lashes. The Blinc brush, on the other hand, has small, sparse bristles that really allow you to get at the base of your lashes which I like. Try them all to see which you prefer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Tubing-type mascaras encase your individual lashes and are super easy to wash off with just water once dried. Perfect for touch ups if you make a mess--dab any spot with a wet cotton swab and voila! To remove mascara from your lashes, just wash gently with a warm, wet washcloth or let the shower head splash yours and then wipe gently with your fingers. I think you could still swim with tube mascara--just don&#x27;t rub your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people are giving this mascara good reviews. I used the product as directed and it was absolutely horrendous. The base was sticky, and at the end of everything my lashes were no longer or volumized than they are using Maybelline Great Lash, which for me is an everyday work mascara. My lashes stuck together the whole day, and even though I used eye makeup remover and oil cleanse my face, my lashes were STILL sticking together and clumping for a full three days after using this. It was awful - without a doubt one of the worst mascaras I have ever used. NYX Doll Eye and L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous are far better for length and volume, with the &amp;#34;false lash&amp;#34; look, than this awful product is.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  The first time you use it and wash it off, it freaks you out a little, because it comes off in little tiny tubes.  But, that means it is staying on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge.  You can&#x27;t reapply though, but you don&#x27;t have to.  Tubing mascara is my favorite.  I love Blinc, but this is way cheaper!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a better mascara. I have shorter lashes that never seem to keep mascara on throughout the day. This is the BEST mascara I have ever used. I have had it for about a month and love it more and more everyday. It takes a little more time to apply with the two different layers but so worth it!</li>
            <li> Definitely adds volume and length.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara. Makes my tiny, short eye lashes look like a models lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Stays on without smudging even when swimming. Come off easily when you want it to.</li>
            <li> Nice thickening and lengthening of the lashes. No flaking. Also withstands heavy sweating at the gym. When you remove it, it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as most mascaras do. Instead, the mascara &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; basically fall or pull off the lashes and has a rubbery like texture. Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascera.  It does a great job tubing my lashes and making them look super thick and long.  I usually get better results when I don&#x27;t use the white site of the product and just go straight to the black side.  The only thing is I find that I have to replace it about once a month because it gets too clumpy to use in a months time.  Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. The best (and also worst) thing about it is that it easily comes off with water. Well peels off really, it&#x27;s cool. So it is easy to wipe away in the shower, but if your face gets wet you&#x27;re not going to have a good day.</li>
            <li> For this product, the best idea of it is really easy to wash off. Simply just with warm water. Very long lasting!! Just love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for about 3 years now. I remember watching the commercial for it for the first time and I was out the door and on my way to walmart before it was over, lol. I, like many others, was blessed with pretty eyes but cursed with the shortest, almost non-existent eyelashes and I&#x27;ve always been SO jealous of people with long, pretty lashes. I used to spend hours in high school layering on mascara and ended up l</li>
            <li> This is better than many mascaras I&#x27;ve tried but I wasn&#x27;t as wowed as some of the other reviewers. I have naturally long lashes so maybe that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference? If I have a special event or something then I&#x27;ll still be utilizing the false eyelashes but this is a great option for when I used it for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; occasions (I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara twice. It seems to hold up pretty well - no raccoon eyes. I have noticed that the product takes a quite a while to dry and I got the strange sensation of my upper and lower lashes sticking together. I have a lot of trouble applying the mascara because the tube is so huge that I can hardly get it around the right side of my head to get the brush to my lashes. I&#x27;m right handed so the left side is a bit easier. And the brush is immense too. It was apparently designed to be used by giants.</li>
            <li> This is too difficult to remove and damages your eyelashes. The previously packaged product in the white and gold tube is far superior.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the larger size of this product for some years but it has all of a sudden become unavailable here in Australia. Unfortunately this smaller size does not provide the same level of lash extension that I was used to.</li>
            <li> I usued to have oily skin; now that I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and live in a dry climate, it&#x27;s more combination, but the eye area still seems to be oily.  Normal mascarea gives me terrible racoon eyes--by the end of the work day I have dark pools under my eyes, with mascara gathered in every wrinkle and fine line.  In my mid 20s I discovered Blinc mascara, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t paint your lashes, tube them!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d been using that for 10+ years, but have always been put off by the price and inconvenience of finding it.  Every few years I&#x27;d try a supermarket brand, but still have the racoon problem.&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I stumbled on this mascara after a web search for a cheaper place to buy Blinc and was ecstatic.  I had no idea that mainstream brands now made &amp;#34;tubing&amp;#34; mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I must confess, I have no idea what the white &amp;#34;under coat&amp;#34; does on this mascara, but the over effect is great.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge, run or flake, and is easy to take off with just water and gentle wiping with a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;At $7 on Amazon vs $29 I used to pay for Blinc, this is a steal! I will never use another mascara again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara ever!  and, at 58, I have tried them all.  I now have eyelasshes!  Non clumping.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great. I get no flaking, smudging, or clumping. In the shower I just wipe my eyelashes and it comes off in little tendrils, no smeary mess.</li>
            <li> Always looking for a better mascara and this one isn&#x27;t it.  Granted, those \\&quot;beauty tubes\\&quot; don&#x27;t flake or come off during the day, but they were clumpy and gave me Tammy Faye Baker tarantula lashes.  They come off your eye lashes easily, but the small bits got into my eyes and were all over my face and clothes.  I was still picking them off even after washing my face several times.  Nice concept, Loreal, but this one doesn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. It really works!</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to the descrption, and it makes my lashes very brittle.</li>
            <li> The most amazing mascara I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried multiple kinds of mascara a and this by far is my absolute favorite it makes my eye lashes appear super long and it&#x27;s extremely easy to take off in the shower just put ur face under the warm shower and gently grab ur eye lashes without really pulling hand it will easily come on ur hands and it doesn&#x27;t leave the dark circles under ur eyes if u accidentally sleep with it</li>
            <li> Great mascara.  Really adds volume to your lashes</li>
            <li> Good mascara, and it will last all day. In fact, my only real complaint is in trying to get it all off! But I don&#x27;t have problems with it flaking off into my eyes during the day, and the color is nice and dark how I like it.</li>
            <li> I would like to stress that this review has nothing to do with the seller, the seller was perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That out of the way, I hate this product. I can&#x27;t tell if its space age cosmetic snake oil or I&#x27;m just simply not leveled up enough in womanly things to understand how to make this look good. Step one, apply oddly crumbly yet goopy white crap. Step two, then put on the mascara. Seems simple, like priming with paint- but so, so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This certainly isn&#x27;t a volumizer. I end up with four to six giant clump eyelashes while attempting to use it. They do however appear quite a bit longer! They also look as though they were done by Betty Boop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final line, I was flummoxed and did not enjoy this product. If you are also a makeup noob and/or avoid looking like an old woman, leave this product aside for the pros. Maybe they can figure it out.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara.  I have tried several others, but this beats them all.  The reason I love this mascara so much is that it plumps up my lashes, but mainly because it comes off easily and cleanly.  Most mascaras will just smudge everywhere. This mascara comes off with just some warm water.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  Comes off easily in the shower.  Doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference using this product and it feels better on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Very good!!!!! Doesn&#x27;t smear, lengthens great.I&#x27;ll be back for more.I do have a problem though even after weeks I keep opening it so the brush is in the wrong hand and I&#x27;m about to apply it with the end that doesnt have the brush.Used to having the short end contain the brush!!  I&#x27;ll learn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t use eye makeup remover to get this off of your eyes - you&#x27;d think water would be easier, but I just don&#x27;t like it. I love the primer and mascara though.</li>
            <li> I always end up with mascara smeared under my eyes after a half day or so.  I have tried many different waterproof mascaras, and while some are better than others, even the most expensive ones resulted in the raccoon look before I was ready to wash it off.  I love this stuff...it stays in place for hours and hours, and best of all it&#x27;s CHEAP!  No more trying expensive mascaras for me!</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say about this mascara is that it didn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes. I don&#x27;t like that there are two steps to the mascara process with this product - the white brush, then the black brush.  To me, this just adds time to the already annoying makeup application process. Also, the brushes are way too short. I can&#x27;t get the right angle to apply the stuff to my lashes because the handle keeps hitting me in the face, so I end up with lashes that get clumped together. I hate that the mascara comes off in little tubes, too. I have to use my fingers to pull the sticky tubes off my face after using makeup remover. I have to say, I can&#x27;t even use this stuff as back-up mascara when I am out of my favorite, Cover Girl Super Thick Lash. I&#x27;m sticking with CG, and you should, too!</li>
            <li> Does not make your lashes any bigger.</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome. Its perfect if you have problems with flaking or smudging because it doesn&#x27;t budge till you want it to. Taking it off is really easy. You only have to rub a little water on it then pull them right off. It comes off looking like spider legs. It iliminates having to scrub and pull at your sensitive eyelids. By comparison to blinc, its a lot thicker which is nice, however it does feel a little drying on your eyes after several hours where bounce is much more sensitive</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for YEARS! I have tried others and they don&#x27;t work as well, this makes your lashes longer and comes off easy- and there is no yucky black smudgy marks ever. LOVE LOVE LOVE ITT!!</li>
            <li> I have used a TON of mascaras by all different manufacturers and this mascara is the easiest to not only remove, but to apply. The trick is to layer it with a waterproof mascara and do ONE eye at a time. First I use the white primer, wait about 30 seconds then apply to coats of the mascara before the white primer dries. Once my eyes look as I desired, I simply swipe some waterproof mascara to hold it all. (think of waterproof mascara as hairspray for your eyelashes).&lt;br /&gt;The best part, is that now you have waterproof eyelashes BUT it is sooooo easy to remove because of the Loreal Tubes. It lengthens AND adds incredible volume! I have this on Subscribe and Save now because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I love this dual mascara!  A great product and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> The single best thing about this mascara is the way it comes off. Instead of leaving smudgy black goop everywhere, it slides off in tubes when you apply warm water and let it soak in for a minute or so. Then you just use your fingers to slide off the tubes, and you are make up free. Has saved me HOURS!</li>
            <li> I came to buy this mascara from some ladies&#x27; recommendation. It lives up to my expectation. The price is good. So overall it beat the other department store brand. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Product looked fine. I generally use Blinc (kiss me) tubes and love it, but it&#x27;s expensive. Tried this - my eyelids, at the base of my lashes ached after a few hours. Weird. tried it a couple of times to be sure it was the product, it was. got rid of it. It did clean easily.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fine. Nothing crazy special, however!</li>
            <li> This is good mascara and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all.  VERY easy to remove with a face wash or just warm water in the shower.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!  The white end really makes it show up where to put the black and my lashes look great.</li>
            <li> But, I hate how long it takes to apply.  It does look good, but learning how to cover the white coat without sticking your lashes together is a process. I recommend it when you&#x27;re not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I will use. It&#x27;s super easy to remove with my fingers in the shower, doesn&#x27;t leave smudges or give me raccoon eyes. It also looks great on and lasts nicely without flaking. I hope L&#x27;Oreal never discontinues this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY mascara you can think of. I ALWAYS come back to this one. I don&#x27;t have the longest lashes in the world and this always makes them pop. Seeing the lashes float around the bathtub after isn&#x27;t always fun; but its by the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, because it really does make your lashes look longer. I use another type of mascara over it, because the L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend tends to flake off. When I put another type over the top, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it.  I have used this for years and love how long it stays on.  It makes my lashes look longer than they are and it doesn&#x27;t flake.  LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> The only con I can see if that it gives more length than volume. I would have liked more volume but this is by FAR the best mascara I have ever tried. SMUDGE FREE !!!! It is incredible</li>
            <li> I used to hate mascara and therefore did not wear it.  It would either cause dark circles under my eyes or be impossible to remove - especially the waterproof kind.  I tried a few in high school and gave up.  Now, with this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Beauty Tubes Mascara, I don&#x27;t go a day without it.  Started wearing it in my late 30&#x27;s.  It is very easy to apply and once dry it will not smear at all.  Occasionally I will find a small speck on my cheek which I will simply brush away like a loose lash.  Comes off easily with warm water and gentle agitation.  I usually slide the tubes off with my fingers and warm water in the evening before I wash my face.  Remains waterproof in the pool as long as the water is cool and you don&#x27;t touch your eyes.  Also, don&#x27;t wipe your face with the towel, as the wiping may remove the lash tubes.  It is very similar to a salon brand which also forms tubes on the lashes.  I could not tell a difference, except the price for this one is way better.  Love Love Love it!!!  I will never buy anything else.  I tell everyone I know about it - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the beauty tubes... the mascara comes off without any hassle when it gets wet (definitely not a waterproof mascara)... But I didnt mind having it on for a swimming trip because it always comes off without black smears under the eyes! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I own this mascara for a few months now and I must say this is the best mascara I have ever used,its long lasting n gives volume to your lashes. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love tube mascara! This doesn&#x27;t run at all. If you cry, you won&#x27;t have any black running. When it gets moist and rubbed it comes off in tubes. It wears most of the day. The conditioner has been helping my eyelashes grow as well. I used blinc for a while, but it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand of mascara. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and really makes my lashes look longer. As a little tip - you can add a teensy drop of tea tree oil to both sides to prevent germs and the tea tree oil promotes lash growth.</li>
            <li> Love the primer part of this mascara.  It really stretches your lashes and you fill in with the black.  Doesn&#x27;t clump.  Use with curler for maximum impact.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this and won&#x27;t buy it again.  I love the waterproof version of this but they stopped selling it so I figured I&#x27;d buy this and it would be the same.  It came off in clumps by mid-day.  It also smeared really easily.</li>
            <li> Pros: I love how it removes in chunks and does not bleed at all. I may have been pulling my eyelashes out like crazy, but it was great. I also liked how it made my lashed pop.  Cons: I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference when I used the white base layer. But what ultimately drew me away was that it slightly bothered my eyes. Just enough to be really annoying every couple days.</li>
            <li> The black color is not a dark black but more like a dark gray. Although I can get some length with this mascara, the texture of my lashes becomes kind of rubbery and they are floppy, they will not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> I believe I received an old product. The primer went on well, but the mascara was very difficult to apply over the primer. It seemed dry and that gives me reason to believe it was old. The package was shop-worn. Tossed it out after two uses.</li>
            <li> really makes your eyelashes look longer</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!! WORST MASCARA EVERRR!!!!(AND I&#x27;VE TRIED MANY!) CREATES HORRIBLE CLUMPY, STIFF SPIDER-LEG HOOKER LASHES!! I NEVERRR WRITE REVIEWS, BUT THIS ONE IS JUST SO BAD!!! I WILL STICK TO MY COVERGIRLEXACT EYELIGTHS MASCARA,WITH IT PEOPLE ASK IF IM WEARING FALSIES, ITS GREAT...  SKIP THIS ONE!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara really works. Made my eyelashes way longer than most mascaras do. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was when I washed it off. It came off looking like my eyelashes were falling off. (Which obviously they weren&#x27;t) other than that I love this mascara</li>
            <li> Really enhances eyelashes length!</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome mascara I ever used! I have short lashes but when I use the growth side(white side) it really made my lashes grow! And it don&#x27;t just grow a little it can grow as long as you want it to by putting on more coat. After the white coat you put on the black one to cover the white. It makes my lashes grow longer and fuller. So happy with this product!! I don&#x27;t think I can live without this mascara and the price is a good price. I will definitely order again when I finish with my mascara. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is my favourite mascara of all times because it comes of with warm water and does not leave black marks under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Been trying to find product that replaces this company&#x27;s product that use to be sold in the blue and white tube. One end had a fortifier and the other end the mascara. It was a very popular product and was a hot seller. Now, L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued and I cannot find anything that was as good. Am so disappointed with L&#x27;Oreal discontinuing the previous product. BRING IT BACK L&#x27;OREAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> love the mascara but it does sort of clump off.  On a positive note it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price you pay. I have short lashes that are straight. They do help accentuate what lashes I do have.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was cheaper than my Arbonne Mascara to last me in between ordering. I found this product. I read reviews to I decided to order it. It came on time which was great. I was excited to try the product. When I opened the container, nearly nothing came off on the wand. I dipped it in again and tried to get some more. I was disappointed to find that the product was nearly dried up before I could even use the product! Like I was sold an old product. That was very frustrating for me. From what I could use of the product it was great on my lashes but it&#x27;s basically useless now. If you could find a good bottle it would be great and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara! I bought it from the drugstore when I heard great reviews about this mascara. I was particularly intrigued by the false lashes effects it creates with the tubing mechanism. When I tried it on, I could immediately see the difference. My eyes popped out more because of the long lashes framing them. They looked very doll-like. I added primer and curled my lashes and it popped out more! It was such a transformation!! Washing it off it actually kind of fun. I love gently pulling off the tubing from the lashes. Beware though, you will need to clean up your sink afterward. It does tend to stick to the sides of the sink. This mascara has quickly become a permanent fixture to my makeup box!</li>
            <li> Tube mascara is my new fave.  Great product as it has the primer too.</li>
            <li> Been a faithful customer for 3 years and the Best mascara I have ever used; doesn&#x27;t smear and easy removal.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great little product. I can&#x27;t believe how easily it comes off -- no eye makeup remover needed! I had been using a waterproof mascara prior to this one and was practically pulling out eyelashes to get it off. I like my mascara to be a little more volumizing than this one, but like the &amp;#34;extend&amp;#34; in the name implies it does the trick on making them appear longer.</li>
            <li> Super duper happy with purchase. Amazing price!</li>
            <li> Why did they mess with a good thing.  Why did they reformulate this????  It absolutely SUCKS!  Goes on horrible, you go to take it off and it&#x27;s like glue on your eyes!  L&#x27;Oreal what were you thinking.  Oh and just LOVE this stupid design, let&#x27;s make it so you can&#x27;t even stand the thing up on your counter while your putting it on.  Now it practically rolls off your sink counter.  Stupid, design, stupid product, never buying this again.  There&#x27;s an old saying.......if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.  Just stick to the old style, it worked fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.  Zero irritation (not even those fumes that can make your eyes water right after you put it on) and the extensils STAY PUT.  They don&#x27;t BUDGE.  In order to remove them, wet your lashes, squeeze gently, then they rinse off.  Love the price, especially on my subscription, but if the price keeps creeping up I&#x27;ll cancel the subscription and buy them locally.</li>
            <li> I used to use Marathon mascara which is no longer made.  It has been hard finding an equivalent replacement.  This stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge, but does start flaking by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> looks great but extremely difficult to remove at the end of the day</li>
            <li> Good waterproof-ness.  Doesn&#x27;t run at all - very clean.  Washes off pretty easily in the shower.  Doesn&#x27;t smear in the swimming pool.</li>
            <li> It lengthens and it doesn&#x27;t smudge. But it doesn&#x27;t give you much volume.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this mascara. I thought it took to long to put on. I ended up only using it about a month and then got rid of it.</li>
            <li> There is a blog I follow and the girl did a makeup tutorial on there. She said this was the best mascara out there and ladies she is right! I have tried almost everything under the sun (from the drugstores) and have asked around to see what people use and this is hands down the best! My lashes look TONS longer! I use to have long lashes but after the wear and tear of cleaning off makeup and all they have gotten very short. This makes them look LONG! Seriously, super impressed with this mascara!</li>
            <li> Fresh product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Beast &amp;#34;high eyelash &amp;#34; extension mascara I have found!</li>
            <li> I started using the more expensive Trish McEvoy version of this and fell in love.  I always ended up with dark circles under my eyes by the end of the day from my mascara falling off.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t come off until you hit water, then it comes off as a solid instead of running down your face.  I will never use anything else!  It is so great.  The only downside is that you really can&#x27;t reapply - but taking it off and putting it back on is so easy because you just need a little water on your hands.</li>
            <li> I love love love this mascara. I would suggest this mascara to anyone trying to obtain full lashes without clumping or having the I have a spider sitting on my eye lid look. I do wish that it was a full bottle it feels a little like paying for half a bottle some months.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the strangest mascara that I have ever used. However, it is strange in a good way, for me anyway. I don&#x27;t think it is waterproof. What I like about it, is that when it comes time to take it off; it is so easy. I hate other mascaras, because it takes a lot of rubbing with soap or makeup remover to remove it from my eyes. I can just see the wrinkles adding up each time I am removing the other product. Not with this, the best way I can describe it is a plastic like material. So, when it is time to remove it, it just comes right off with water and like two swipes. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. Yet, it looks nice on the eyes. I am going to post a before and after pictures. I am very allergic to chemical smells and perfumes, to me this doesn&#x27;t have any smells. I love it. I don&#x27;t have to count each wrinkle I see coming when using this product. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as other mascaras, I mean supply wise. However, I don&#x27;t mind, as long as I like the stuff. It does give me thick lashes quite instantly, without having to apply over and over again. One end has a conditioner that is white colored and then use put the black color over the white. I normally use 2-3 swipes on each eye. I like it, actually I love it for me, but everyone is different. I have repurchased this mascara about four times over the last year, so I can estimate it lasts me about two months. I&#x27;m not a paid reviewer or product tester reviewer, just an average Joe. My phone pictures are not that good, but there is rarely ever any smearing around the eye area, no matter how sloppy I am when applying it, that is my favorite part. With other mascaras, I had to use lotion and q-tips to get the access off all the time. Well my tube is running out, I must go buy some more!</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA EVER. It&#x27;s like little gloves for my eyelashes. It comes off easily when washing my face or with a baby wipe! Doesn&#x27;t leave any dark circles under my eyes. It&#x27;s the best mascara, and I&#x27;ve gone through A LOT! :) :) :)</li>
            <li> This mascara does NOT smudge. I can cry at the drop of a hat and it does NOT effect it at all.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- it gives SO MUCH VOLUME&lt;br /&gt;- it give a lot of length&lt;br /&gt;- it looks natural&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all (no raccoon eyes)&lt;br /&gt;- remove super easily. (Splash water &amp; the mascara separates and falls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- it clumps if you don&#x27;t know how to use the wand (trick: apply 1st step. Then look DOWN and WIGGLE the 2nd step on)&lt;br /&gt;- not good for swimming &amp; emotional situations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than THE ROCKET MASCARA.&lt;br /&gt;Best mascara I&#x27;ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> searched a long time for mascara that didnt end up under my eyes. this stays put and comes off easily with water. no racoon smudges under eyes</li>
            <li> The best (mascara) I&#x27;ve ever had!&lt;br /&gt;Have been riding through freezing fog, lashing rain, and this is the only mascara that has withstand the weather in Ireland for me - all year round biker.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for a really long time, so if you get caught out camping and have no hot water to wash your face, the mascara will still look good the next morning. Not that I would advise to leave it on for that long, can&#x27;t be good for your eyes... ;)&lt;br /&gt;Hope they never stop producing this! Buy with confidence!&lt;br /&gt;PS. And it looks amazing too! :)</li>
            <li> Easy to put on both top and bottom lashes.No runs,washes of easily and does really make lashes look noticeably longer.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it&#x27;s the only one that comes off cleanly and easily.  I soak a cotton ball in very warm water and hold it in place - repeat a few times and gently pull down and it all comes off in little tubes.  No more raccoon eyes!  However, when I put it  on, I scrape the brush really well.  Otherwise it goes on too thickly and is not flattering at all.  So I scrape the brush nearly dry, put it on sparingly and the results are great.</li>
            <li> ok, i don&#x27;t have thick and numerous lashes to begin with, so i go for mascaras that REALLY pump of the volume and length.  so on htis front, this product DOES deliver.  i DO have thikcer and longer lashes and i feel oh-so-pretty!!!!  it doesn&#x27;t smuge, it doesn&#x27;t wear off, but don&#x27;t overdo it because it CAN clump, but if you use it as instructed, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER!!!!  why is this NOT five stars????  BECAUSE ITS&#x27; A PAIN IN THE BUTT TO REMOVE, AND IF YOU TRY TO DO IT QUICKLY, YOU GET CASUALTIES IN THE FORM OF YOUR PRECIOUS EYELASHES!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH my god, the first time i tried to remove it, it was NOT coming off even though YES i read and followed the directions.  so when i started using more force, yes it started coming off all stringy-like, BUT SO DID SOME OF MY LASHES...WHICH I DON&#x27;T HAVE MANY TO BEGIN WITH....CAN&#x27;T PUT MASCARA ON LASHES THAT AREN&#x27;T THERE....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so you have to be VERY PATIENT with taking it off, THEN it won&#x27;t damage your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i was VERY DEPRESSED after losing about TWELVE lashes on the first removal.  i went from a super high to a super low.  so just watch out, be VERY gentle and patient when taking this off...because it will take a while!!!!  do NOT use if you know you&#x27;re going to be out late and coming back tired and wanting to just hurry up and get all the makeup off and go to bed asap.  and NEVER make the mistake of falling asleep with this mascara on...the lashes will break off in the morning.  i&#x27;m so sad for my lost lashes....cryyy</li>
            <li> Just okay.  Think that there are better mascaras out there for the price.</li>
            <li> Terrible!!! Clumpy, flaky and dry. I have used Loreal Double Extend for years and it was an excellent product before they decided to change it. Now it&#x27;s probably the worst mascara and primer I&#x27;ve ever used. Why did Loreal have to mess with a good thing? The tube is also thick and more awkward to hold and the application brush does not separate your eyelashes. Just leaves big clumps. Please listen to your customers Loreal and go back to the original Double Extend.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I used to wear waterproof mascara but hated how difficult it was to remove. Then I tried regular ol&#x27; water-based mascara but hated how it sometimes ran. This mascara, though, stays put (indefinitely) until you purposely wet it and rub your lashes. These beauty tube technology makes it so the mascara comes of in little threads, but its painless and comes off with just water. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever change products: its that good.</li>
            <li> I second all those other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;stays on the eyelashes, not under the eyes, unlike every other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Miraculously doesn&#x27;t get INTO my eyes - safe for my contacts!&lt;br /&gt;Comes off instantly with makeup remover!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how they invented this and no one else ever has. It&#x27;s truly a miracle. First time in my life I haven&#x27;t looked like a raccoon by 10am. or even midnight!&lt;br /&gt;If there is ever a rumor that they are going to discontinue this I am buying a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> I had tried this mascara before, then explored a few other brands before coming back to it. There is no other product out there that can match it for my needs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I wear contact lenses and have allergies, so any product that could flake and irritate the eyes is to be avoided&lt;br /&gt;2. I am Asian, and therefore have very straight lashes. Even when I curl my lashes, I always have under-eye smudges by the end of the day if I use regular or even waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;3. I work outdoors in the summer, and my face is often a mess of sunblock, sweat, and water&lt;br /&gt;4. After working outdoors, I often like to jump in the pool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Beauty Tubes stays on through sweat and swimming, and leaves NO under-eye smudges. It only comes off when I take a warm shower and rub my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you have any of the special needs I listed above!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara EVER. I use this and always get compliments on my lashes. In fact, they are so long.. everyone thinks they are fake. It makes a nice hard base with the white side, and then the black latches on and forms long, thick lashes!!!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because you really have to wash it off good. I want to say the first time i used it, it scared the crap out of me. I always use this type of mascara, with the building block then the mascara, but had not used the tube like kind before. I washed my face off in the shower and when i saw the strings of tubing coming off, I thought my lashes were gone. First time on this product, I thought it ruined my lashes. Millions of images flashing through my mind, i jumped out to look at the mirror and was relieved that they were still there.  All in all, it works well. It gives full long lashes. Just be careful when putting it on, it has a tendency to give little hairs on the tips of your lashes, so I would recommend using a mirror when applying.</li>
            <li> Bought this mascara based off all the great reviews, used it on one eye and immediately started desperately trying to remove it in the short amount of time I had before I had to leave. I threw it away without a second thought. Terrible mascara!! I naturally have a lot of lashes and they are fairly long too. The primer went on find but as soon as I used the mascara it turned my lashes into about 5 large, ugly, short clumps. Very frustrating</li>
            <li> This mascara, while a bit more time-consuming to apply, is awesome!  It really lengthens and plumps up my lashes, without making them clumpy and icky.  I use this every day and don&#x27;t mind the extra time since my lashes are greatly improved!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara. End of the story.</li>
            <li> I have thin short eyelashes &amp; this mascara doesn&#x27;t lengthens or make my eyelashes thicker ! So this is why I give it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;But I like that it doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes &amp; that I can swim in it &amp; it won&#x27;t come off unless I touch my eyes or rub them &amp; it comes off as eyelashes glue? Like rubber.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara dries off very fast , so NO WAY you can put another layer !&lt;br /&gt;I used this mascara for years &amp; I use it as an everyday natural looking eyelashes , because it&#x27;s not very black .&lt;br /&gt;But if you are looking for a lengthening mascara this is not yours , if you want thicker eyelashes? Forget about it .&lt;br /&gt;My sister hate it &amp; thinks it breaks her lashes, that doesn&#x27;t happen to mines .</li>
            <li> No, no, no.  I don&#x27;t know how this has good reviews, but I bought it based on the rating and I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed.  Sure, it doesn&#x27;t irritate and it stays on all day.  BUT it does nothing to enhance the length or volume and took 10-15 swipes on each eye to even be visible.  The white fiber coating works well and I was excited about that.  Then for the black...swipe, swipe, swipe,...ok, swipe, swipe, swipe again.  Um, still not really visible.  Let me swipe some more.  There&#x27;s a whole world of mascara now that lengthens and voluminizes with a few coats that also doesn&#x27;t irritate, smear or wear off.  I&#x27;ll keep this to use the fiber coating, but stick with Maybelline Colossal Volume.</li>
            <li> A great pairing of primer &amp; mascara equals long &amp; thick looking lashes.  Of the many I&#x27;ve tried, it is the best. The two parts bind making a tube-like coating on each lash.  The biggest plus: It&#x27;s truly the easiest to remove.  Since scrubbing or excess rubbing can damage &amp; break your lashes, the fact no scrubbing is required is key.  I&#x27;ve found splashing warm water w/ gentle face cleaner makes the &#x27;tubes&#x27; wash off intact.  Easy as pie ! Ease of removal would prevent use at the pool, beach, etc... So I would use a different waterproof product for those settings.</li>
            <li> Pros:  REALLY Lengthening, volume, and super EASY removal - just wipe off with warm wet wash cloth.  It CANNOT smudge or flake.  Really holds the curl.  You can use with or without the primer.  I actually like it better w/o primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Lashes are very stiff (but look pretty); product dries out a little faster than regular mascara I think</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t run, even in the pool! Goes on great and washes off easily. Perfect mascara for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even see the point of the primer. This stuff does not apply evenly and is hard to hold when applying.</li>
            <li> This is my one and only mascara.  I love it because I only wear this and cover up as make up and touch my face a lot. This is great because I know that it won&#x27;t smear! To take it off, (to get an idea) I just splash my face with water and then brush my teeth, which gives the mascara enough time to loosen up so that I can just pinch it off my eyes. Easy to apply, lasts all day, and comes off easily. Highly recommend if you don&#x27;t like to use make up remover around your eyes!</li>
            <li> I have always used this product since it first came out. I will never use another product unless L&#x27;Oreal quits making this product. It is easy to apply and just as easy to take off. No smudges throughout the day either. Plus you will get great compliments on your great lashes! Love it Ladies! you should own this product!</li>
            <li> Best mascara...wish I could find it in waterproof</li>
            <li> I LOVE the white primer end of this mascara. In fact that is the only reason I buy it and the only reason that this is getting four stars. The actual mascara end of this is complete crap. It adds no volume or length.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever!  I use this daily because it does not smudge; rather it comes off in fibers.  So, even when you cry or sweat, it usually doesn&#x27;t come off and if it does, it just looks like there is a little piece of thread on your face instead of having black smudged eyes.  I do like mascara that provides a little more volume for when I go out at night, so I usually will use a brand that provides more volume and then layer this on top and it still seals my lashes so they do not smudge and only comes off in fibers.</li>
            <li> This mascara will definitely make your lashes longer! However, it&#x27;s a pain to take off. It leaves long, black, stringy strands on your face, and a bunch of small black dots that are very hard to take off. Too bad, as they really do work in terms of lengthening the lashes. Also, it&#x27;s kind of a pain to put it on as you would have to first apply the white layer and then the black. Sometimes the black layer doesn&#x27;t completely cover the black layer, so some white still shows. If you apply enough black to cover all the white you run the risk of smudgy lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so cool.  It coats your eyelashes with a very flexible, almost soft plastic coating that comes off easily with water and does not EVER smear or get crunchy. I have tried dozens of different kinds of mascara and once I found this I knew I would never need another mascara  again. It is not waterproof (which is good cause I hate waterproof) but you can go in the water with it and it stays on if you don&#x27;t touch it.  You never get raccoon eyes because it&#x27;s not capable of smearing once dry. But you can pull it off with water and it&#x27;s like stretchy plastic.  I always get compliments on my eyelashes and have been asked if I use Latisse or if they are extensions. I never was asked this with any other mascara. Definitely worth a try. Use both sides (the white part and the mascara part) every time. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Wish it was more waterproof</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!  I had given up on wearing mascara for a long time bc no matter what, I&#x27;d always have horrible dark circles after taking it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I use Beauty Tubes and it does not smear or flake during the day. Even if I shed a tear or two it doesn&#x27;t come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I take it off, I just splash water on my eyes a few times and then whoosh, the &#x27;tubes&#x27; slide right off, leaving no residue- IT&#x27;S MAGIC! Plus no dark circles anymore- EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m  not sure why the other gal is having such trouble getting it off and there&#x27;s still some left in the morning. For me, it couldn&#x27;t be simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a pretty good job of giving definition and length but not the best I&#x27;ve used like some of the new ones. However,  I&#x27;m willing to trade off on a little bit of length and definition in order to not have dark circles every day :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HALLELUJAH!</li>
            <li> I really like the mascara...but hate the applicator. I wish the would use a brush with the rubber bristles. I think I will take and old rubber bristle brush and see how that does. As for taking it off, it pulls right off in the shower after letting the steam soak them for a couple minutes. Came off very easy when I wanted, but stayed on the whole time I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> My new &#x27;go to&#x27; mascara</li>
            <li> No better than any other mascara I have used so not too sure what the hype is about the &amp;#34;extended tubes&amp;#34;. Average results at best.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever! Will never wear anything else again</li>
            <li> very good mascara for daily use. only one problem: I always can&#x27;t use the black one to wholly cover the white one. maybe that&#x27;s because my skill is not good enough~</li>
            <li> My most favorite mascara ever! I love how much people compliment me eyelashes and woman always ask what mascara I wear, and if my lashes are fake because they are so long!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about yet another \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; beauty product that probably wouldn&#x27;t work for me as well as people said it did for them. I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a try, though. It was the first time I tried tubing mascara, and I was very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use the nourishing serum because I&#x27;m always in a hurry in the morning. In my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference; the serum doesn&#x27;t help or hurt anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different mascaras, but I like this one the best because it DOES NOT SMUDGE. It won&#x27;t end up under your eye, it doesn&#x27;t come off even when you cry (I&#x27;m a crybaby, so that&#x27;s important), and I even fell in a pool while wearing it and it was completely unsmudged and intact. The mascara will \\&quot;tube\\&quot; and it almost feels like rubber or soft plastic. It&#x27;s also really nice because it doesn&#x27;t clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, removing it is super easy. If you dab water on it, let the water sit for a while, you can just gently rub or pull the tubes off your eyelashes with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this mascara so much. I don&#x27;t plan on even trying any others.</li>
            <li> This is the longest and thickest mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It wierdly washes off in little tubes but looks goodc all day.</li>
            <li> Favourite, only kind I purchase now. Must have!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, won&#x27;t use anything else. Every other mascara I have ever tried has flaked and smudged, this mascara does neither.</li>
            <li> This crap is way to hard to apply and you end up with a lot of white eyelashes because of it.  The only thing this may be good for is freaking someone out when you wash it off, since it looks like your eyelashes are falling out, little tubes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why others are experiencing issues with this mascara, however, I love it! Since I already have naturally long eyelashes, it extends them even further. They create a doll like eyelash which I prefer. But wow! So beautiful! It doesn&#x27;t add much volume which I don&#x27;t care for anyways because I prefer more of a natural look. But! They will definitely extend your lashes! This is my first review ever for anything on Amazon so that&#x27;s pretty explainable!</li>
            <li> Well, I once thought that all mascaras were created equal. This one, however, is in a league by itself. It&#x27;s high quality, easy to apply, dries quick, and washes away easily. It doesn&#x27;t clump and it doesn&#x27;t irritate. I&#x27;m glad I discovered it and even more happy that it&#x27;s available through the subscribe and save. I&#x27;ll continue to buy it. Hopefully it won&#x27;t jump in price or get discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is my go to mascara. I love the tubes because they last all day and don&#x27;t make me look like a raccoon. I just wash them off with warm water before bed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product even though it does not last long before it gets clumpy both in the bottle and on your lashes.  The only time it smudges is when it&#x27;s still wet and gets on my upper lid or if I put too much on and it&#x27;s hot out it will smudge underneath my eye, but that&#x27;s rare.  This is a great product.  Only guidance is be gentle on your eye lashes when removing so you do not pull out your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the white conditioner, I&#x27;m not 100% certain of it&#x27;s functionality outside of it&#x27;s wonderful at making you see where you still need to apply mascara.  I rarely use that end of the precut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s the only mascara I use.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it looks great and you can take it all off with warm water and washcloth which helps a lot to avoid rubbing eyelids.</li>
            <li> just tried it. doesnt even come close to Maybelline Colossal volume.</li>
            <li> So I really like how this looks once applied- but it takes a while to dry and in the mean time remains sticky so things stick to your eyelashes- like your bangs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also- while it does come off easily when you wash it off- it seems to be a never ending process and leaves little black strings all over the place. It&#x27;s a mess to remove. It usually takes 2 face washes to get it off and you&#x27;ll want to pay attention after you get out of the shower or you might find little black sticky booger like things stuck all over you. I&#x27;ve found several on my neck and other body parts. Once dried on it&#x27;s hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> This mascara stays in place alllllll day and night! I have very oily skin around my eyes, and other mascaras almost always smudge under my eyes and makes me look like a football player. Even waterproof mascara does this due to the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This amazing mascara makes a little lengthening tube around your eyelash that only comes off with water and a little gentle friction. I get my face wet in the shower when I get in, and a few moments later after my hair is washed, I wash my face with my normal cleanser and the tubes come right off. I think all the moisture in the shower helps. If I&#x27;m just waking my face in the sink, I splash water, and just rub the lashes gently with the tips of my fingers. I can feel the tubes loosen and come off, then splash more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you apply a primer coat to help with length, then you cover it with the black mascara. I sometimes apply a couple coats, but usually only need one. This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used some pretty expensive ones from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this mascara. It&#x27;s fast. Very gently rests on the eyelashes and visibly udlinyaetyu eyelashes stick together. a quality product. Recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and live in a warm, humid area. This mascara stays on and doesn&#x27;t run. It comes off with warm soap and water too. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This stuff was gross. It&#x27;s virtually impossible to put the white stuff on, and fully cover it with the black, and NOT have gunky hooker-lashes. It felt like I had pudding on my eyelashes. Either that, or the tube I got was very old and partially dried up. Either way, this was returned.</li>
            <li> This really helps with my post menopausal lash loss</li>
            <li> Read instructions! It is great, adds bulk and length! Love it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived as scheduled. That&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Pros-feel like it&#x27;s conditioning my lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge, clump and comes off easily with water (hold a water soaked cotton wool pad on for 10-15 seconds then wipe away).&lt;br /&gt;Cons-Doesn&#x27;t give a dramatic look so I just use it for everyday use and a different one for going out.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;oreal cosmetics.It makes my eyes greaten.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge this is it. Even when I go from work to a work out it stays put but comes off easily when wet but not until I take it off. I even go to my swim work out with it on. Love it even though I never use the white end. Blinc has a similar product but for more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of all times because it comes of with warm water and does not leave black marks under your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for mascara. Easy to apply and easy to remove. It makes your lashes look incredible. This is the only mascara I have used for the past 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to be disappointed with this product after so long. I am traveling to a country that does not have this mascara and I made sure to stock up on this as I will not be using another mascara ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes off very easily in the shower or just by washing your face with hot water. It does not flake throughout the day and I have not had a problem with it get gooky by the end of the use. Some mascaras become thick and hard to use and become unnaturally looking as the substance gets gooky but this mascara does not. One tube lasts me about 3-4 months. Truly an amazing mascara if you want a long dramatic look that is very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, long-lasting, great price, easy to find in make-up bag, effective brushes, natural looking and easy to remove simply with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope that L&#x27;Oreal NEVER stops making this product !!!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with the double mascara.  I love it.  It stays put, no raccoon eyes.  In fact, I often leave my make up on after working my late evening, and the next day, it still looks good.  When you do wash it off, it comes off in tiny flakes.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This product did not give me full or long lashes and was incredibly hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Honestly I dont like how it works but this is the only mascara I can use coz my eye lids are oily, even others waterproof mascaras just made me ended up with racoon eyes. This mascara never smudges altho I did sleep with it on. It does add very nice length but zero volume. FYI, the one I received from Amazon was very dry like it wasnt store in good condition.</li>
            <li> works great. Lashes are instantly half inch longer. Lasts all day</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply. And it really extends your lashes. No clumping. For all of those reasons, I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when you want to wash it off, the instructions say to pull it off of your eyelashes with your fingernails. It hardens differently than other mascaras. Most mascaras when dry are chalky. This is rubbery. So it doesn&#x27;t disintegrate well when you use make-up remover. I&#x27;ve tried regular soap, regular make-up remover, waterproof make-up remover. This mascara comes off in rubbery flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, they fall and smear in the sink and I have to clean my sink after I&#x27;ve washed my make-up off. Sometimes, the flakes stay on my skin and I get black streaks on my face or my washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for looks, this is a great mascara. But cleanup is not the same as with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara. So easy to apply and so easy to remove. As long as they sell this, I am not buying any other mascara!</li>
            <li> I really only use this mascara now because everything else runs or smudges on my face. Even other beauty Tube mascara products from other companies.  The only downside is that it comes off like black spider webs if you go in a pool or if it rains.</li>
            <li> Mascara always seems to not want to stick on my eyelashes. Using the white side and then the black, it lasts all day and then sometimes into the next day. My mother also tried this product and loves it as well (she even started putting mascara on her bottom lashes without getting smeary.) Mascara does come off a little bit sometimes, but it is nothing compared to the other mascaras that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it&#x27;s the only mascara I use.  As a pet groomer my face gets wet at work and other mascaras run and cause darkness around my eyes.  If this comes off it&#x27;s like little flakes that I can just easily wipe off.</li>
            <li> I love this. mascara! I rarely wear any because it ether looks fake or ends up all over my face.. I have skimpy lashes and this stuff was great! it stayed on, didnt look fake and it came off like a breeze with plain water</li>
            <li> I was not blessed with eye lashes but the problem has been solved with this product.  I have been using it for a couple of years and I love it.</li>
            <li> BEST mascara if you don&#x27;t like the dark undereye panda look!</li>
            <li> This REALLY works as advertised, I love it, It&#x27;s by far my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> Not waterproof, but I love the two step. No black under the eyes at the end of the day!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I use the black side for day, and both sides for evening.  It gives that extra WOW factor without the time and money of keeping up fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Darn! It flakes. A lot. Giving the benefit of the doubt, perhaps I simply don&#x27;t have the hang of putting it on properly. I will post an update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> it seems to be a nice product, however; you have to make sure you cover all the white or you look funny, it is very easy to take off, just warm wash cloth and it slides right off.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever enjoyed! I use it daily. Some reviews say it&#x27;s hard to wash off, for me it isn&#x27;t if I wet my lashes then use a make up or mild remover. It makes my lashes look huge &amp; amazing lengths! My favorite make up item in my extensive arsenal!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara, EVER!</li>
            <li> I swear by this mascara - discovered it over 6 years ago and have only used this kind since.</li>
            <li> This washes off so cleanly. I will never need eye makeup remover again.</li>
            <li> I looked for years to find a mascara that did not smudge under my eyes. This does not at all. It&#x27;s down side is that sometimes the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; slide off when my eyes tear. But that is only a minor problem. I love this mascara</li>
            <li> This mascara rocks! I&#x27;m one of those people that tend to get raccoon eyes by midday because my lashes point down, even after I curl them. Not with this stuff! It makes my lashes really long, and I can curl them again after applying the 2 steps. Also, it washes out easily with warm water. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best mascara you can buy</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It is the only kind I can use without getting raccoon eyes (even waterproof mascaras &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; for me).  I highly, highly recommend this product!  I wish it came in a dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have very short, straight lashes and this mascara definitely gives them a boost. Although it takes more time to prime and then apply the mascara side, I think it&#x27;s well worth it. So far I have experienced very little clumping and that&#x27;s hard to find with these big brushes most cosmetic companies are pushing these days. I also have very sensitive skin and eyes; this product is an absolute dream to get off. Usually washable mascaras run, but are easy to get off and waterproof mascaras stay put, but I can sometimes irritate my eye area trying to get it off. This is the best of both world. Doesn&#x27;t budge all day, but easily comes off in a few seconds being soaked in water (I usually take it off in the shower). I love this product and it will be the first drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve ever repurchased.</li>
            <li> This is great mascara. To remove, cup some very warm water in your hand over your eye. Hold it there for 5-10 seconds. Use your fingertips to slide the mascara tubes off your lashes without a trace of product left over. Could not be easier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara since it first came out.  Pro&#x27;s:  Does NOT RUN or smear AT ALL    Washes off cleanly with gentle cleansers (Neutrogena).  Occasionally comes off in flakes when washing it off, but I much prefer that over continuously wiping off the mascara smears.  Con&#x27;s:  Requires 2 steps for application    It would be perfect in my book if you could apply it in one step.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of mascara for over two years.  It not only lengthens the lashes it does not smear easily.  It really gives you a polished look.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace my clinique lash basecoat and mascara.  The basecoat is ok but seems a little thick as compared to my clinique version.  The mascara was way too think for me as well.  It clumped up a lot.  I don&#x27;t put mascara on very thick so this was just way too much for me.  It was also hard to clean off at end of the day.  I didn&#x27;t use an eye make up remover but there would still be residue the next day after cleaning well the night before.  I have sinced went back to my clinique mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other tube mascaras several years ago, then went back to regular mascara, which always left me slightly raccoon-eyed. I just started a job where I work 12+ hours a day, and the raccoon eye problem got way worse. (I apparently have oily skin around my eyes, weird.) I didn&#x27;t even know Loreal made a tube mascara until I stumbled across it while looking for a mascara that maybe, possibly, wouldn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;d been punched repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not hyperbole when I say that I will probably never use a different mascara again. I LOVE this stuff. I apply two coats of the base coat, then two coats of the mascara, and it looks amazing. I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t add enough volume, but using multiple coats is apparently the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - no raccoon eyes, no running if you cry (though it&#x27;s definitely not waterproof...don&#x27;t go swimming unless you want to look like you have murdered spiders on your face), and...well, confession time, I always sleep in my mascara. For years now. Regular mascara gets all gross and smudgy, but this mascara continues to amaze. Unless I thrash around while I sleep, I wake up and this mascara still looks great. Depending on the position I sleep, I can sometimes go three days without redoing it or touching it up, no joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this mascara, and I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s way cheaper than some other tube mascaras on the market. It&#x27;s less than $9 - I&#x27;d urge you to just try it!</li>
            <li> Good Product. As expected. No compains. If you compare prices and is the best, there is no hold back to it.</li>
            <li> It coats my lash nicely with the extra volume but it also pull out my lashes when removing it. I wet a cotton pad with some eye makeup remover (Neutrogena) and press lightly on my eyes for 1-2 minutes, then do the little zigzag motion while whiping it downwards. The mascara came off as well as some lashes. I will not use it again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t fallen in love just yet, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> discovering this, it is the only mascara I buy! It is easy to apply, looks nice, and comes off easily. I&#x27;m sensitive skinned and I haven&#x27;t had any problems using this.</li>
            <li> Lash primer makes lashes more lush!</li>
            <li> Horrible! I will never buy this again. It flakes/sheds so not worth the money or effort. I&#x27;m sorry for the manufacturer, but this is one of the worst mascaras I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I just picked up this mascara a few days ago. I was intrigued by the concept of the tubes, since I had never tried a tubing mascara before. It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and is very easy to remove - all you need is warm water and it will just wash away if you gently wipe it off your eyes. It gives really great length and volume, and although it makes my lashes stick together a little more than I would prefer, I still like the way it looks. I recommend letting the primer dry for a minute before putting on the actual mascara, or else it is really difficult to apply. When I applied it straight over the primer the first time, my lashes became gooey and stuck together and it looked awful. Unfortunately, I have to take a star from this mascara because it irritates my eyes. I wore it for 10+ hours for the first time today, and realized it was making my eyes itch. I will continue to wear it, but just for shorter periods of time. Hopefully they will make a new formula that is more gentle on eyes.</li>
