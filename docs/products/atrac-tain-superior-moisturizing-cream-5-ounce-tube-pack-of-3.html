            <li> Just so you know what your getting, this is the lotion you get in the hospital or doctors office for extremely dry skin. Yes it&#x27;s expensive (at least to me) but without it my hands truly do suffer. Apply twice a day and it&#x27;ll get rid of exema  in a week. As for my background, im a mechanic so needless to say i work with my hands and they can get pretty bad. Goes on smooth, dries in minutes, won&#x27;t wash off, and leaves absolutely no greasy feeling whatsoever.  My life would be over without this stuff!</li>

After week one (twice daily) of use most the fissures are gone, week two (one use in the morning) and you back to flip flops and sandals. Week 3 and on all you need to do is use the cream every other day at the start of your day. If you are hitting the beach or pool make sure you out some on before you hit the sack. GREAT Stuff and I would recommend this to anyone who has fissure cracks in their heels.</li>

            <li> I have been using this Atrac-Tain Moisturizing Cream for several years now and I would say this is one of the best moisturizing cream I have ever used for my usual extremely dry scaly skin.
