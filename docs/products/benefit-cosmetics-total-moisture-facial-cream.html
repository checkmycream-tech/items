            <li> This thick, creamy moisturizer is well worth the price and It feels the best in the wintertime for dry skin. As you apply the lightly scented cream, you&#x27;ll find yourself saying &amp;#34;ahhhh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the foaming cleanser, and all I can say is WOWWWW. I have combination skin, and this literally makes my face so SOFT. I notice the glow immediately, and throughout the day people actually compliment my face! Thanks Benefit!</li>
            <li> Bought this cream while I was deployed and it was really great to be able to have it shipped all the way to Afghanistan.  It&#x27;s my favorite face cream.  Will likely order through Amazon again since I never know where to buy it.</li>

            <li> To be honest with you I only use this moisture cream during winter. I combine it with the triple performing facial emulsion SPF 15 PA++ as my skin gets really dry. If you have combination skin I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes a difference after only a couple of applications. In fact, next morning I noticed my skin looked better ~ glowing, healthy. It smells divine, in short worth every penny. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  WORKS GREAT AND FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a poor college student but I can&#x27;t live without this stuff! I notice a visible difference in my skin immediately after application. The jar lasts a long time, too! I&#x27;m just now ordering my second jar, and I&#x27;ve had my first one since August (nearly a year!) LOVELOVELOVE this stuff. Does not clog my pores at all!</li>
            <li> I tried this moisturizer in an Ulta store- wow, i fell in love! I live in a very dry region of the US and this stuff keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day! Its nice to finally have a great moisturizer for my dry skin- without feeling oily or heavy.This will definately be a staple in my skin care regimen!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this face cream.  It goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t get watery like some other brands.  It really does lock in moisture.  I was breaking out a bit because my skin was really dry.  Once I got a hold of this cream, my face cleared up dramatically and my skin stopped peeling.  This product is well worth the $38.</li>
            <li> this product attracted my attention by claiming \\&quot;Total moisture\\&quot; and I have always had dry skin in such weather. However when i first use it, i found it is just oily.

I was hesitant to buy the full size because of the hefty price tag, but I eventually gave in a purchased it.    + Absorbs quickly  + Thick but not greasy  + Smells nice  + The jar is adorable!  - However, it&#x27;s a jar. I don&#x27;t like the fact that I&#x27;m dipping my fingers in it because it spreads germs  - Very pricey</li>
            <li> Highly moisturizing + not oily &#x3D; perfect product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also very suitable under makeup&lt;br /&gt;Love it so much</li>
            <li> The price is steep but its worth it! You have to use such a small amount and it really brightens the skin. Unlike most brighteners the effect isn&#x27;t covered by makeup. It makes my makeup look SO much better. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have to be careful of the products I use, this moisturizer is wonderful it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft without irritating it,</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, pale, combination skin that needs a lot of moisture at night. I&#x27;ve been using this for several months off and on. I use it as a night cream as it is quite heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are basic, beneficial, and moisturizing. Nothing really fancy, but not a bunch of cheap wood alcohols either. The fatty acids are very beneficial to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this stuff goes a long way. Be careful how much you use: once it settles onto your skin and warms up, it gets runny and can run into your eyes. So use a very, very small amount until you know how it will go, especially around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this, my skin is deeply moisturized and has a nice glow in the morning. I would repurchase, but the price is out of my skin care budget. It&#x27;s worth it though if you have the extra cash to spend and want something very pure, gentle, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin look great.  But it has a very strong fragrance which I find overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;To me it smells like a perfumed laundry detergent.  Too bad, because otherwise it would be my go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have spent countless years and money trying to find a good moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of brands but nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to Benefit Total Moisture. I have dry, flaky skin and have had so much trouble finding a moisturizer that will repair my skin, especially after a day&#x27;s worth of make up has been applied. When I get out of the shower at night I take a good dose of this moisturizer and slather it over my face and neck. Almost instantly I noticed a difference and after a week&#x27;s use I knew I was never going back. The cost is a bit on the high side, but I figure it&#x27;s worth it to shell out $40 every month or so to keep my skin feeling this great!</li>
