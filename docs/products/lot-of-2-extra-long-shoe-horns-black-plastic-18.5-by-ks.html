            <li>I am very pleased with these shoe horns.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, Great quality, Perfect, does the job, great price, flexible (works well), length helps with higher boots, great for all shoes</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest...</li>
            <li>It is a nice product IF you have nothing else to use, but not preferred.  </li>
            <li>So when I accidentally came across with this image, I was thrilled and bought them immediately.</li>
            <li>Now they each have their own at home.</li>
            <li>They work great for a person with knees that have seen too many injuries to fold up well any more.</li>
            <li>I ordered these before and loved them, so I ordered more for work.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice and inexpensive item and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It made it very easy to put on shoes standing up.</li>
            <li>Flexible, not too rigid but doesn&#x27;t seem like they will break very easy either.  </li>
            <li>I have a longer and heavier one that I like better but couldn&#x27;t find that kind anywhere.</li>
            <li>Awesome shoe horns, i must say how helpful these things are with an early morning start.</li>
            <li>They are much better than the kind with the spring between the shoehorn and the handle.</li>
            <li>These work great and are the right height</li>
            <li>It also makes putting my shoes on easily with one hand while holding my baby!</li>
            <li>The shoe horns came quickly and were exactly what my husband was looking for and at the perfect price.  </li>
            <li>The length is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Sure handy for quick slip ons!  </li>
            <li>But still: cheap!</li>
            <li>Invest in something more rigid.  </li>
            <li>More flexible than I thought they would be</li>
            <li>Metal is great, but you really do need a bit of flex.  </li>
            <li>The rounded top is helpful for placing the shoehorns on a hook when not in use.</li>
            <li>:)))</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the color and lenght</li>
            <li>Not too much more that I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>is that it tells me how many words I have to write.</li>
            <li>Now he just sits on a chair and, with the aid of this device, he is able to slip into his footwear with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to pay return shipping, which ate up most of my refund.</li>
            <li>what more could you want??</li>
            <li>the price is affordable but i would recommend investing on a more durable shoe horn.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for more than a year</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more.</li>
            <li>You get two :).</li>
            <li>they are ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27; cute?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely?</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m required to write more if I wish to give you my assessment....</li>
            <li>Thought these would be more sturdy.</li>
            <li>Works okay.  </li>
            <li>Perfect to put by our front door for guests to put their shoes back on.  </li>
            <li>and we love this item.  </li>
            <li>Great construction,  smooth operation, easy to use, good looking, high tech.  </li>
            <li>These 2 shoe horns are very strong and light too.</li>
            <li>Took a very long time to arrive but they work wonderful!</li>
            <li>i wish these were more rigid rather than bending so easily</li>
            <li>all better than what expected, I arrive all in perfect conditions, just the I gave that tapeworm that to arrive the things arrived</li>
            <li>These are not as rigid as most, but seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>A good thing as you get older :)</li>
            <li>very good and a big help</li>
            <li>functional n cheap :)</li>
            <li>Better to stick with the *cheap* plastic model.</li>
            <li>It works for me because I don&#x27;t need much assistance, but if I did, it would not be a good product.  </li>
            <li>Flexible and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The shoe horns were made of an easily bendable plastic.  </li>
            <li>So convient and easy to use, probably will utilize the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>so easy now for me to put on my shoes.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 lots of 2 because they&#x27;re not always easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Helps me easily put on my shoes without having to untie/tie my shoes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to carry in the bag.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had them about two months and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Also strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>They work just fine.  </li>
            <li>they work fine</li>

            <li>These have held up just fine.  </li>
            <li>These have nothing to break, and they are smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These will do fine.</li>
            <li>Perfect length for myself (5&#x27;5&amp;#34;) and my mother, who is about the same height.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>works especially great with my tight winter snow boots)</li>
            <li>The fit of the shoehorn in my shoes is fine.</li>
            <li>made a great gift for a person who was retiring, who back was sore from all the &amp;#34;bending over backwards&amp;#34; that he had to do at work.</li>
            <li>These are cheap.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic, flimsy.</li>
            <li>It is cheap but functional.</li>
            <li>And Cheap.</li>
            <li>Use these several times a day and work great.</li>
            <li>Now we both have and enjoy them.  </li>
            <li>so preventing any breakdown is important.</li>
            <li>Great help with my hip and back problems.</li>
            <li>The plastic it is made of is cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>I keep the primary in my room and the two auxiliaries between the dressing room and the downstairs.</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction, as described</li>
            <li>You get two, they are cheap, they work...</li>
            <li>Great price to simply replace!</li>
            <li>They are cheap.</li>
            <li>Great idea for anyone with back pain too.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Elegant design - just right.</li>
            <li>My new favorite item, I love these and my backscratcher, wouldn&#x27;t do without either of them.</li>
            <li>They work, but I would have given it a higher rating if they were made of a more rigid material or stiffer plastic.</li>
            <li>they are very long and work great..</li>
            <li>It just the right size and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works, good for older folks who can&#x27;t bend too much</li>
            <li>These are perfect to reach into boots &amp; hard to reach shoes</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t bring it on home to me now even though I live at the corner of Easy Street &amp; Lucky Charms in the City of Love.</li>
            <li>Works great as expected.</li>
            <li>Is that a good enough review?  </li>
            <li>Too soft and it bends too easy, it should be more sturdiness</li>
            <li>I have just starting using these shoehorns and find they are sturdy, just the right length and a great geometrically design for inserting the shoehorn in the right place in the heel to get your shoes on without strain.  </li>
            <li>The price was good, and we now have a shoe horn in 2 different places, making it more convenient for my relative to use it where he change shoes most often.  </li>
            <li>Grab and slide into the shoes quickly while on the run.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the seller (One Super Bargain), but shoe horns that I got are cheap-looking and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I love them, every old lady should have one !!</li>
            <li>These extra long shoe horns are perfect for putting on my shoes and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a nice long shoehorn for my mother when we found this 2 for 1 deal, hey, I&#x27;ll use one if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>They are goood as extra shoe horns to have around, and work better than not using one at all!    </li>
            <li>This shoe horn is a little flexible and works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great for just that little bit of help.  </li>
            <li>He has trouble after a stroke putting his shoes on, but these are a great help to him</li>
            <li>These shoehorns are so inexpensive that they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s more, he won&#x27;t bug me about throwing (accidently) his old one away.</li>
            <li>Really worth about a dollar each in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Works far better than metal and doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin.</li>
            <li>Had purchased much more expense one with spring feature and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>that is because I am old and they don&#x27;t wear out and I buy more than one pair of a shoe I like.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>The product is useful.</li>
            <li>This is such a inexpensive and easy to use product and makes it easy for my husband to put his shoes on.</li>
            <li>This shoe horn is  very good , simple  but works , I wish i found it long time</li>
            <li>This works well and the shoes slide right on</li>
            <li>Just the right length.</li>
            <li>I especially like the large hole which is handy for hanging.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve since gone back to tying and untying our shoes like before, but now that I&#x27;ve seen this shoe horn offered as a set at such a great price, I&#x27;m snapping it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While these shoe horns are adequate, they are substantially thinner and more flexible than one I purchased some time ago (probably at a higher price), even though they  look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old man and bending isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li>quick fast delivery.</li>
            <li>However, the price is very reasonable, and they will serve my needs.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price..</li>
            <li>And of course having a long shoe horn is great for people who don&#x27;t like to bend over to use the traditional ones.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Free shipping was an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what they say they are, and they work.</li>
            <li>Seems pretty sturdy ...</li>
            <li>Sti on my first one.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>Why pay more for the wooden etc shoe horns?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they care enough to do that.</li>
            <li>If bending to put on shoes is difficult, this is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think more is necessary!</li>
            <li>I guess thats what you get when you can&#x27;t see them first.  </li>
            <li>This is the first of two .</li>
            <li>one of them snapped on the first use.  </li>
            <li>very helpful and useful.</li>
            <li>I also am not able to bend over easily, so the extra length is great.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>These are hard to find in stores, so I was glad to get them so cheap!</li>
            <li>most people who order items such as this really need assistance.  </li>
            <li>And I got two for that reasonable price, and gave one away to a friend who likes it very much.</li>
            <li>I like them long to handle really challenging slip on boots.  </li>
            <li>The extra length proved handy, I can easily use it sitting down, without having to bend.</li>
            <li>If you can not bend back easily, get longer ones, unless you&#x27;re a leprechaun.</li>
            <li>I also worry they will break easily, but they are so flexible that maybe they will last longer than I think..</li>
            <li>They work great when you have a pair of shoes or boots that the back always slide down when you put them on.</li>
            <li>but the plastic is somewhat cheap, dont expect it to last too long but considering the price, it okay.</li>
            <li>If you can spend a few extra dollars, it&#x27;s better to get a slightly better one.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;could be longer&amp;#34; comment is really just me being picky.  </li>
            <li>can you get?\\&quot; but once we got used to using the shoe horn, it really made putting on already tied shoes a snap.</li>
            <li>Better made than expected.</li>
            <li>is a challenge, these really are a blessing.</li>
            <li>When you are all dressed who wants to bend over to fight with a shoe....</li>
            <li>These do the job at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is well designed so it does not take up too much space, is the correct length and a pleasure to use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>my mom got me from Japan, but I didn&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s called in US.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>These are very helpful with that.</li>
            <li>arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Knees are not what the used to be and this shoe horn really helps.  </li>
            <li>so my fat feet would feel the whole  piece of plastic as my foot goes in.  </li>
            <li>take it on vacation and doesn&#x27;t take much room.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>He is very over weight and his lower spine is all fused together from arthritis.</li>
            <li>The price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li>This was the only place that made this product available.</li>
            <li>They were received fast and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>They work really well for the price.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It keeps me from bending over so much.  </li>
            <li>Also, light enough to take with me on trips.  </li>
            <li>Go to IKEA and buy a real shoe horn.</li>
            <li>Leaving shoes at the door really helps.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful for elderly.</li>
            <li>fast delivery too</li>
            <li>what else can you really say about shoe horns?</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and very functional.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>These shoe horns are a relatively cheap plastic similar to what you would get in tupperware.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to bend over as much.</li>
            <li>but my back is ok so far</li>
            <li>Also great for people who have a stiff back, or arthritis, or just morning stiffness that doesn&#x27;t let you bend.</li>
            <li>I wanted strong, long shoe horns as to not have to bend over as much</li>
            <li>However, these shoe horns are so long that they are easily visible if they fall in the trash can.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t justify spending  $12-15 on a piece of plastic or wood like many other shoe horns.</li>
            <li>Looks like he is kind and will take it back, but that&#x27;s not an excuse to sell just junk.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Extra long length comes in handy.</li>
            <li>It is a little flexible but works fine and is worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>They are light and long and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>helps me get into my work shoes and not break down the backs any more.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you had loose shoes they would work fine.</li>
            <li>and they are better than the previous one.</li>
            <li>Why buy an expensive wooden one or name brand when these work just great!</li>
            <li>Steady.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who must limit their bending.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>A little flimsy, but I have found the more rigid ones break.  </li>
            <li>they are a little more flexible than i&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Compared to the plastic used on my regular shoehorns, these longer ones can bend and twist and generally are really cheap.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d want to spend a few more bucks for one of those wood handle metal horn models.  </li>
            <li>Clearly worth the price and shipping  cost, especially when you get two for the price of one.</li>
            <li>Back saver , worth every penny</li>
            <li>These are really great if you&#x27;re having trouble bending down (which I am).  </li>
            <li>Keeps me from bending down .It&#x27;s cheep and gets me into my shoes easily .I</li>
            <li>Sure, part of this is managing against negative reviews, but that&#x27;s the whole point of reviews...</li>
            <li>My kids may laugh, but these nifty long shoe horns are just the ticket for quickly slipping into running shoes and back into work shoes without wasting precious time.</li>
            <li>It bends a little more than I would&#x27;ve liked but it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li>These are entirely too flimsy for someone really needing aid with putting on their shoes!  </li>
            <li>I had purchased a more rigid (and more expensive) model which broke on the third use.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my 92 year old mother and she loves them!</li>
            <li>Not especially heavy plastic, but very flexible.  </li>
            <li>I have trouble bending over &amp; these make it easy to slip my shoes on.</li>
            <li>Maybe should have gotten one a little longer, but this one is doing fine.</li>
            <li>very useful, I needed it for a long time and finally found it.</li>
            <li>The black plastic is a bit flexible, but we find that actually helps better lever on the shoes.</li>
            <li>Plastic is a little cheap - but they work.  </li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get something that will last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly the same with my previous one, but it works great and seems durable enough.</li>
            <li>Yeah, that&#x27;s what happened to my old Ikea plastic shoe-tree, and why I purchased these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got for my husband who is an old school.</li>
            <li>So we start using it - my wife and two young children.</li>
            <li>extra length is very helpful.</li>
            <li>soft plastic that bends as soon as u put foot in shoe.</li>
            <li>Ordered item for my 79 year old dad.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more dollars and buy the wooden ones.</li>
            <li>well made, large, don&#x27;t get lost, hole is big enough to hang on anything but a door knob, and long enough I don;t have to bend over to use it effectively, These are thick enough that they will not break easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, especially for someone that cannot reach down to put their shoe on.</li>
            <li>Especially helpful for older folks like me, who don&#x27;t bend as well as we used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expect the same kind of hard plastic used on those smaller plastic shoehorns, but that&#x27;s not the case with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love that you don&#x27;t have to bend over so far using the extra long shoe horn in black plastic 18.5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They are a little too flexible, but pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>few weeks ago we lost it and honestly have been a little lost without it.</li>
            <li>of stiff plastic, smooth, long enough to not have to bend to put on shoe.... it works really well</li>
            <li>Seller is aware of product quality and attached a note that says - do not leave negative feedback, just contact him first.</li>
            <li>It is long enough to get your shoes on without bending over, but there are many other shoe horns with long handles.</li>
            <li>These are not stiff enough to help you get into boots.  </li>
            <li>These, and many other Chinese made shoehorns, are flexible which makes wedging process between the foot and the shoe less controllable.</li>
            <li>they are long enough so I can put my shoes on without bending over too much.  </li>
            <li>I like the extra long length, so I do not need to bend over to much to use this shoe horn.</li>
            <li>I expected too much from this plastic.</li>
            <li>.....there&#x27;s not much else to say really</li>
            <li>I keep one in my closet and one near the exit of my house, Dont have to bend with a smaller shoe horn nor do i have to put my finger in the shoe.</li>
            <li>Al all of those other choices are VERY expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If he is the one putting on his shoes, the extra length is helpful because he can&#x27;t always bend over far enough to use a shorter shoe horn.</li>
            <li>It works okay for the purpose in which I bought them (occasional travel), but not good for everyday use if I really needed it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that the 8&amp;#34; long shoe horn I bought before this also recently disappeared, apparently also going out in the trash.  </li>
            <li>Firm enough to make sure the backs of my shoes stay up but flexible enough to give a little in order to wedge my foot in.</li>
            <li>The product is very narrow for my foot and could be a little more longer.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping, Great quality, Perfect, does the job, great price, flexible (works well), length helps with higher boots, great for all shoes</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest...</li>
            <li> It is a nice product IF you have nothing else to use, but not preferred.  </li>
            <li> So when I accidentally came across with this image, I was thrilled and bought them immediately.</li>
            <li> Now they each have their own at home.</li>
            <li> They work great for a person with knees that have seen too many injuries to fold up well any more.</li>
            <li> I ordered these before and loved them, so I ordered more for work.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice and inexpensive item and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It made it very easy to put on shoes standing up.</li>
            <li> Flexible, not too rigid but doesn&#x27;t seem like they will break very easy either.  </li>
            <li> I have a longer and heavier one that I like better but couldn&#x27;t find that kind anywhere.</li>
            <li> Awesome shoe horns, i must say how helpful these things are with an early morning start.</li>
            <li> They are much better than the kind with the spring between the shoehorn and the handle.</li>
            <li> These work great and are the right height</li>
            <li> It also makes putting my shoes on easily with one hand while holding my baby!</li>
            <li> The shoe horns came quickly and were exactly what my husband was looking for and at the perfect price.  </li>
            <li> The length is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Sure handy for quick slip ons!  </li>
            <li> But still: cheap!</li>
            <li> Invest in something more rigid.  </li>
            <li> More flexible than I thought they would be</li>
            <li> Metal is great, but you really do need a bit of flex.  </li>
            <li> The rounded top is helpful for placing the shoehorns on a hook when not in use.</li>
            <li> :)))</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the color and lenght</li>
            <li> Not too much more that I can say about it.  </li>
            <li> is that it tells me how many words I have to write.</li>
            <li> Now he just sits on a chair and, with the aid of this device, he is able to slip into his footwear with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to pay return shipping, which ate up most of my refund.</li>
            <li> what more could you want??</li>
            <li> the price is affordable but i would recommend investing on a more durable shoe horn.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for more than a year</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more.</li>
            <li> You get two :).</li>
            <li> they are ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27; cute?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m required to write more if I wish to give you my assessment....</li>
            <li> Thought these would be more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Works okay.  </li>
            <li> Perfect to put by our front door for guests to put their shoes back on.  </li>
            <li> and we love this item.  </li>
            <li> Great construction,  smooth operation, easy to use, good looking, high tech.  </li>
            <li> These 2 shoe horns are very strong and light too.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to arrive but they work wonderful!</li>
            <li> i wish these were more rigid rather than bending so easily</li>
            <li> all better than what expected, I arrive all in perfect conditions, just the I gave that tapeworm that to arrive the things arrived</li>
            <li> These are not as rigid as most, but seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> A good thing as you get older :)</li>
            <li> very good and a big help</li>
            <li> functional n cheap :)</li>
            <li> Better to stick with the *cheap* plastic model.</li>
            <li> It works for me because I don&#x27;t need much assistance, but if I did, it would not be a good product.  </li>
            <li> Flexible and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The shoe horns were made of an easily bendable plastic.  </li>
            <li> So convient and easy to use, probably will utilize the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> so easy now for me to put on my shoes.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 lots of 2 because they&#x27;re not always easy to find.  </li>
            <li> Helps me easily put on my shoes without having to untie/tie my shoes.  </li>
            <li> Easy to carry in the bag.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had them about two months and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Also strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>

            <li> These have nothing to break, and they are smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These will do fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect length for myself (5&#x27;5&amp;#34;) and my mother, who is about the same height.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> works especially great with my tight winter snow boots)</li>
            <li> The fit of the shoehorn in my shoes is fine.</li>
            <li> made a great gift for a person who was retiring, who back was sore from all the &amp;#34;bending over backwards&amp;#34; that he had to do at work.</li>
            <li> These are cheap.  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, flimsy.</li>
            <li> It is cheap but functional.</li>
            <li> And Cheap.</li>
            <li> Use these several times a day and work great.</li>
            <li> Now we both have and enjoy them.  </li>
            <li> so preventing any breakdown is important.</li>
            <li> Great help with my hip and back problems.</li>
            <li> The plastic it is made of is cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I keep the primary in my room and the two auxiliaries between the dressing room and the downstairs.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction, as described</li>
            <li> You get two, they are cheap, they work...</li>
            <li> Great price to simply replace!</li>
            <li> They are cheap.</li>
            <li> Great idea for anyone with back pain too.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Elegant design - just right.</li>
            <li> My new favorite item, I love these and my backscratcher, wouldn&#x27;t do without either of them.</li>
            <li> They work, but I would have given it a higher rating if they were made of a more rigid material or stiffer plastic.</li>
            <li> they are very long and work great..</li>
            <li> It just the right size and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works, good for older folks who can&#x27;t bend too much</li>
            <li> These are perfect to reach into boots &amp; hard to reach shoes</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t bring it on home to me now even though I live at the corner of Easy Street &amp; Lucky Charms in the City of Love.</li>
            <li> Works great as expected.</li>
            <li> Is that a good enough review?  </li>
            <li> Too soft and it bends too easy, it should be more sturdiness</li>
            <li> I have just starting using these shoehorns and find they are sturdy, just the right length and a great geometrically design for inserting the shoehorn in the right place in the heel to get your shoes on without strain.  </li>
            <li> The price was good, and we now have a shoe horn in 2 different places, making it more convenient for my relative to use it where he change shoes most often.  </li>
            <li> Grab and slide into the shoes quickly while on the run.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the seller (One Super Bargain), but shoe horns that I got are cheap-looking and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I love them, every old lady should have one !!</li>
            <li> These extra long shoe horns are perfect for putting on my shoes and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a nice long shoehorn for my mother when we found this 2 for 1 deal, hey, I&#x27;ll use one if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> They are goood as extra shoe horns to have around, and work better than not using one at all!    </li>
            <li> This shoe horn is a little flexible and works great.  </li>
            <li> Works great for just that little bit of help.  </li>
            <li> He has trouble after a stroke putting his shoes on, but these are a great help to him</li>
            <li> These shoehorns are so inexpensive that they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s more, he won&#x27;t bug me about throwing (accidently) his old one away.</li>
            <li> Really worth about a dollar each in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works far better than metal and doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> Had purchased much more expense one with spring feature and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> that is because I am old and they don&#x27;t wear out and I buy more than one pair of a shoe I like.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> The product is useful.</li>
            <li> This is such a inexpensive and easy to use product and makes it easy for my husband to put his shoes on.</li>
            <li> This shoe horn is  very good , simple  but works , I wish i found it long time</li>
            <li> This works well and the shoes slide right on</li>
            <li> Just the right length.</li>
            <li> I especially like the large hole which is handy for hanging.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve since gone back to tying and untying our shoes like before, but now that I&#x27;ve seen this shoe horn offered as a set at such a great price, I&#x27;m snapping it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While these shoe horns are adequate, they are substantially thinner and more flexible than one I purchased some time ago (probably at a higher price), even though they  look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old man and bending isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li> quick fast delivery.</li>
            <li> However, the price is very reasonable, and they will serve my needs.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price..</li>
            <li> And of course having a long shoe horn is great for people who don&#x27;t like to bend over to use the traditional ones.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Free shipping was an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what they say they are, and they work.</li>
            <li> Seems pretty sturdy ...</li>
            <li> Sti on my first one.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> Why pay more for the wooden etc shoe horns?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they care enough to do that.</li>
            <li> If bending to put on shoes is difficult, this is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think more is necessary!</li>
            <li> I guess thats what you get when you can&#x27;t see them first.  </li>
            <li> This is the first of two .</li>
            <li> one of them snapped on the first use.  </li>
            <li> very helpful and useful.</li>
            <li> I also am not able to bend over easily, so the extra length is great.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to find in stores, so I was glad to get them so cheap!</li>
            <li> most people who order items such as this really need assistance.  </li>
            <li> And I got two for that reasonable price, and gave one away to a friend who likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I like them long to handle really challenging slip on boots.  </li>
            <li> The extra length proved handy, I can easily use it sitting down, without having to bend.</li>
            <li> If you can not bend back easily, get longer ones, unless you&#x27;re a leprechaun.</li>
            <li> I also worry they will break easily, but they are so flexible that maybe they will last longer than I think..</li>
            <li> They work great when you have a pair of shoes or boots that the back always slide down when you put them on.</li>
            <li> but the plastic is somewhat cheap, dont expect it to last too long but considering the price, it okay.</li>
            <li> If you can spend a few extra dollars, it&#x27;s better to get a slightly better one.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;could be longer&amp;#34; comment is really just me being picky.  </li>
            <li> can you get?\\&quot; but once we got used to using the shoe horn, it really made putting on already tied shoes a snap.</li>
            <li> Better made than expected.</li>
            <li> is a challenge, these really are a blessing.</li>
            <li> When you are all dressed who wants to bend over to fight with a shoe....</li>
            <li> These do the job at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is well designed so it does not take up too much space, is the correct length and a pleasure to use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> my mom got me from Japan, but I didn&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s called in US.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> These are very helpful with that.</li>
            <li> arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Knees are not what the used to be and this shoe horn really helps.  </li>
            <li> so my fat feet would feel the whole  piece of plastic as my foot goes in.  </li>
            <li> take it on vacation and doesn&#x27;t take much room.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> He is very over weight and his lower spine is all fused together from arthritis.</li>
            <li> The price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li> This was the only place that made this product available.</li>
            <li> They were received fast and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> They work really well for the price.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It keeps me from bending over so much.  </li>
            <li> Also, light enough to take with me on trips.  </li>
            <li> Go to IKEA and buy a real shoe horn.</li>
            <li> Leaving shoes at the door really helps.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful for elderly.</li>
            <li> fast delivery too</li>
            <li> what else can you really say about shoe horns?</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and very functional.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> These shoe horns are a relatively cheap plastic similar to what you would get in tupperware.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to bend over as much.</li>
            <li> but my back is ok so far</li>
            <li> Also great for people who have a stiff back, or arthritis, or just morning stiffness that doesn&#x27;t let you bend.</li>
            <li> I wanted strong, long shoe horns as to not have to bend over as much</li>
            <li> However, these shoe horns are so long that they are easily visible if they fall in the trash can.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t justify spending  $12-15 on a piece of plastic or wood like many other shoe horns.</li>
            <li> Looks like he is kind and will take it back, but that&#x27;s not an excuse to sell just junk.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Extra long length comes in handy.</li>
            <li> It is a little flexible but works fine and is worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> They are light and long and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> helps me get into my work shoes and not break down the backs any more.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you had loose shoes they would work fine.</li>
            <li> and they are better than the previous one.</li>
            <li> Why buy an expensive wooden one or name brand when these work just great!</li>
            <li> Steady.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who must limit their bending.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy, but I have found the more rigid ones break.  </li>
            <li> they are a little more flexible than i&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Compared to the plastic used on my regular shoehorns, these longer ones can bend and twist and generally are really cheap.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d want to spend a few more bucks for one of those wood handle metal horn models.  </li>
            <li> Clearly worth the price and shipping  cost, especially when you get two for the price of one.</li>
            <li> Back saver , worth every penny</li>
            <li> These are really great if you&#x27;re having trouble bending down (which I am).  </li>
            <li> Keeps me from bending down .It&#x27;s cheep and gets me into my shoes easily .I</li>
            <li> Sure, part of this is managing against negative reviews, but that&#x27;s the whole point of reviews...</li>
            <li> My kids may laugh, but these nifty long shoe horns are just the ticket for quickly slipping into running shoes and back into work shoes without wasting precious time.</li>
            <li> It bends a little more than I would&#x27;ve liked but it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> These are entirely too flimsy for someone really needing aid with putting on their shoes!  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a more rigid (and more expensive) model which broke on the third use.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my 92 year old mother and she loves them!</li>
            <li> Not especially heavy plastic, but very flexible.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble bending over &amp; these make it easy to slip my shoes on.</li>
            <li> Maybe should have gotten one a little longer, but this one is doing fine.</li>
            <li> very useful, I needed it for a long time and finally found it.</li>
            <li> The black plastic is a bit flexible, but we find that actually helps better lever on the shoes.</li>
            <li> Plastic is a little cheap - but they work.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get something that will last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly the same with my previous one, but it works great and seems durable enough.</li>
            <li> Yeah, that&#x27;s what happened to my old Ikea plastic shoe-tree, and why I purchased these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got for my husband who is an old school.</li>
            <li> So we start using it - my wife and two young children.</li>
            <li> extra length is very helpful.</li>
            <li> soft plastic that bends as soon as u put foot in shoe.</li>
            <li> Ordered item for my 79 year old dad.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more dollars and buy the wooden ones.</li>
            <li> well made, large, don&#x27;t get lost, hole is big enough to hang on anything but a door knob, and long enough I don;t have to bend over to use it effectively, These are thick enough that they will not break easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, especially for someone that cannot reach down to put their shoe on.</li>
            <li> Especially helpful for older folks like me, who don&#x27;t bend as well as we used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect the same kind of hard plastic used on those smaller plastic shoehorns, but that&#x27;s not the case with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love that you don&#x27;t have to bend over so far using the extra long shoe horn in black plastic 18.5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> They are a little too flexible, but pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> few weeks ago we lost it and honestly have been a little lost without it.</li>
            <li> of stiff plastic, smooth, long enough to not have to bend to put on shoe.... it works really well</li>
            <li> Seller is aware of product quality and attached a note that says - do not leave negative feedback, just contact him first.</li>
            <li> It is long enough to get your shoes on without bending over, but there are many other shoe horns with long handles.</li>
            <li> These are not stiff enough to help you get into boots.  </li>
            <li> These, and many other Chinese made shoehorns, are flexible which makes wedging process between the foot and the shoe less controllable.</li>
            <li> they are long enough so I can put my shoes on without bending over too much.  </li>
            <li> I like the extra long length, so I do not need to bend over to much to use this shoe horn.</li>
            <li> I expected too much from this plastic.</li>
            <li> .....there&#x27;s not much else to say really</li>
            <li> I keep one in my closet and one near the exit of my house, Dont have to bend with a smaller shoe horn nor do i have to put my finger in the shoe.</li>
            <li> Al all of those other choices are VERY expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If he is the one putting on his shoes, the extra length is helpful because he can&#x27;t always bend over far enough to use a shorter shoe horn.</li>
            <li> It works okay for the purpose in which I bought them (occasional travel), but not good for everyday use if I really needed it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that the 8&amp;#34; long shoe horn I bought before this also recently disappeared, apparently also going out in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Firm enough to make sure the backs of my shoes stay up but flexible enough to give a little in order to wedge my foot in.</li>
            <li> The product is very narrow for my foot and could be a little more longer.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shoe horn, and you can&#x27;t find them at shoe stores any more (except some very expensive ones).</li>
            <li> These are endorsed by the very airport folks that keep us safe from shoe throwers and other dangerous shoe meanies.  </li>
            <li> Another benefit of having these longer shoe horns is that he&#x27;s accidentally knocked off every other shoe horn we&#x27;ve had (both metal and plastic) into the trash can near where he changes into his athletic shoes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s long enough for me since I don&#x27;t have back problems, but my grandpa used to attach an extra stick on it to extend the length so that he didn&#x27;t have to bend at all when wearing shoes.</li>
            <li> They are long enough to do the job and sturdy enough to stay put and find the heel.</li>
            <li> I got these longer shoe horns for a gentleman who is 91, he struggled with the small sized ones and really can get his shoes on well all by himself now,</li>
            <li> Not quite long enough for me to use</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long enough.  </li>
            <li> The extra long handles on these keep me from having to bend over to slip on my shoes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend for those with back problems or elderly as they are long</li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar item at IKEA which also had a back scratcher on one end, and wanted to replace them since I had given one away and lost the other.  </li>
            <li> Can hardly find those things in the US with this reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t state that they are EXTRA long!!!</li>
            <li> And long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are shorter than I expected -- but the same length stated.</li>
            <li> Long for use when standing up.  </li>
            <li> I leave this handing on my bi-fold closed door and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to hunt around for my long show horn.</li>
            <li> But that is really a minor detail.  </li>
            <li> My in-laws wanted a shoe horn since they misplaced their old one.</li>
            <li> Just like the description says - long, flexible and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Hooray; been looking for them for a long time.</li>
            <li> Long and seems to be durable.</li>
            <li> Long, plastic shoe horn.</li>
            <li> These are very thin but seem to work just fine.</li>
            <li> These long, inexpensive shoe horns do the trick!</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for a long shoe horn for the longest time as he doesn&#x27;t like to bend down too low to put his shoe on with a shoe horn.</li>
            <li> Plastic has enough give, and pretty much lasts forever unless you leave it in your car on a cold day and it freezes, then you drop something heavy on it, and it cracks.  </li>
            <li> My father-in-law brought this down to our house once and left it there.</li>
            <li> The 18\\&quot; length makes it possible to put your shoes on without sitting down.  </li>
            <li> When donning shoes with padded backs they allow the back to fold down.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I bought one at Ikea the other day for $0.99 and it was very thick and sturdy, even had rubber grippies on the handle which my dad (stroke victim) really appreciated.</li>
            <li> I only need one, but still less than retail.</li>
            <li> They are plastic and thus perhaps less durable than a wooden or metal shoehorn.</li>
            <li> Also, like the title says, I can reach my shoes by bending only slightly.</li>
            <li> These shoe horns are long but extremely flimsy.</li>
            <li> Still using the old, broken, rigid one instead even though it isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> The length is long enough so that I only have to bend down slightly in order to insert one into my shoe; without sitting down.</li>
            <li> These are slightly flexible, thus less likely to break, long enough that I don&#x27;t have to bend down</li>
            <li> At 6&#x27; tall, there&#x27;s a very limited amount of choices for a shoe tree you can use without bending over at all.  </li>
            <li> It is plastic and bends a little, but its only supposed to aide your foot in sliding in place.</li>
            <li> A little softer than I had expected but actually helps me put on my shoes even easier!</li>
            <li> They work just as expected and needed.</li>
            <li> People over analyze a piece of plastic,these are heavy enough to do the job</li>
            <li> School-age grandsons used Grandpa&#x27;s shoe horn whenever they spent the night.</li>
            <li> They work as expected.  </li>
            <li> The product was what I expected, an inexpensive shoe horn.</li>
            <li> so this is not a real problem.</li>
            <li> It is a shoe horn, not much to say.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> Since they are so long, you can use them standing up or sitting down.  </li>
            <li> Very short, extremely flexible , narrow.</li>
            <li> My previous long handle shoe horn broke (my fault, not the shoe horn&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> The Shoe Horns are long enough to save me from having to bend too much and stress my bad lower back.  </li>
            <li> Aging joints keep having a harder and harder time bending to do mundane things like putting on shoes.  </li>
            <li> The small ring at one end made it convenient to hang next to the front door as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my shoe on due to the narrowness of the tongue.</li>
            <li> I have used some other brands and they were brittle and cracked at the heel.  </li>
            <li> one for home and the other to keep in my gym bag.  </li>
            <li> I needed something like this due to RA.</li>
            <li> Keep the other at work for when I switch to my dress shoes.</li>
            <li> But if I&#x27;m doing it, the extra length can get in my way if I have to reach behind his pant legs to line the shoe horn up with the back of his shoes.  </li>
            <li> &gt; My feet just slip into my sneakers without bending the backs down or fighting with socks not sliding past the back of the shoes.</li>
            <li> These are pretty thin plastic, and the horn is narrow too narrow for a size 11 shoe.  </li>
            <li> a large a waist that makes it difficult to bend over to put on my shoes.</li>
            <li> I have to buy very expensive, special shoes,</li>
            <li> item works for putting on shoes and helps keep me from having to bend down when putting on shoes</li>
            <li> Content with product, it is just a shoe horn and does the job without bending down for seniors.&lt;br /&gt;Durable plastic quality.</li>
            <li> I can use this product without having to bend all the way down.  </li>
            <li> and they need to be a little wider but other than that they do the job</li>
            <li> (e.g. insert foot slightly into shoe and then use horn to guide heel into shoe)</li>
            <li> If you a little over weight these are the ticket until you get down a little.</li>
            <li> These are a little too flimsy and flexible for a shoe horn.  </li>
            <li> Has a little flex to it which I know will add to the life of this product.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and little bit flexible.</li>
            <li> I Like the product, but its a little flimsey.....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> its been so hard to reach down and get shoes on.</li>
            <li> These shoe horns will help anyone who has trouble bending or is just lazy as i.</li>
            <li> At least when you step down to put your shoe on, it won&#x27;t flex.  </li>
            <li> (although my goal is to slim down so I can!!)</li>
            <li> (yes, I&#x27;m lazy).  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;How lazy</li>
            <li> Who needs the expensive shoe horns to do the same job?</li>
            <li> These two are not worth the $5 I paid; and, unfortunately, are not worth the trouble of rеturning them back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep one at home that I use daily getting into my casual shoes.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid shoehorns were made of hard material like metal or rigid plasic.</li>
            <li> Of course it may break if you push on it to hard</li>
            <li> These were for a friend to send to her brother as he has a hard time putting on his shoes.  </li>
            <li> No more slipping my feet into expensive sneakers and breaking the backs anymore!</li>
            <li> So I place one behind the door and one by his shoes.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Seriously, IT&#x27;S JUST A SHOEHORN!  </li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as the metal one I lost but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong if you get them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately one has to buy two of them when one (1) would suffice.</li>
            <li> For the cost of the shoe horn, you can not go wrong.  </li>
            <li> compare very poorly even to the ones you see in TJMax or Marshalls.</li>
            <li> He was unable to put his shoes on and felt humiliated as well as frustrated.</li>
            <li> Hate grass on the kitchen floor.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the worst product I ever bought online.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They work just as expected and needed.</li>
            <li> I expected too much from this plastic. I suppose if you had loose shoes they would work fine. But I knew what I was getting may not work like the old-fashioned metal shoe horns......</li>
            <li> made a great gift for a person who was retiring, who back was sore from all the &amp;#34;bending over backwards&amp;#34; that he had to do at work.</li>
            <li> These are great shoe horns.  I wanted strong, long shoe horns as to not have to bend over as much (yes, I&#x27;m lazy).  These served their purpose perfectly, and I have one for work and one for home.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> How did I ever get along without these?  They make it possible for arthritic me to get my shoes on in a hurry.  No bending or struggling required.  I keep one in the shoe closet and one in my overnight bag so I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what they are and cost</li>
            <li> Product arrived after I e-mailed the supplier about not receiving it. No complaints about product. Works fine.</li>
            <li> These shoehorns are so inexpensive that they are well worth the price. But. When I was a kid shoehorns were made of hard material like metal or rigid plasic. These, and many other Chinese made shoehorns, are flexible which makes wedging process between the foot and the shoe less controllable. But still: cheap! And long. And they work.</li>
            <li> Flexible and easy to use. Great price.</li>
            <li> functional n cheap :)</li>
            <li> They work just fine.  Good stress reducer.</li>
            <li> These are a little too flimsy and flexible for a shoe horn.  If you can spend a few extra dollars, it&#x27;s better to get a slightly better one.  However, for $2 each, what do you expect?  They are goood as extra shoe horns to have around, and work better than not using one at all!    And of course having a long shoe horn is great for people who don&#x27;t like to bend over to use the traditional ones.</li>
            <li> The shoe horns were made of an easily bendable plastic.  They work, but I would have given it a higher rating if they were made of a more rigid material or stiffer plastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break my back anymore. Great item to have.</li>
            <li> I love them, every old lady should have one !!</li>
            <li> The price was good, and we now have a shoe horn in 2 different places, making it more convenient for my relative to use it where he change shoes most often.  However, I find myself wishing I had a shorter shoe horn in the bedroom, where I can&#x27;t always see the back of his shoes when he&#x27;s wearing pants.  If he is the one putting on his shoes, the extra length is helpful because he can&#x27;t always bend over far enough to use a shorter shoe horn. But if I&#x27;m doing it, the extra length can get in my way if I have to reach behind his pant legs to line the shoe horn up with the back of his shoes.  But I would still purchase it again if he needed another one.  Another benefit of having these longer shoe horns is that he&#x27;s accidentally knocked off every other shoe horn we&#x27;ve had (both metal and plastic) into the trash can near where he changes into his athletic shoes.  I was surprised to see that the 8&amp;#34; long shoe horn I bought before this also recently disappeared, apparently also going out in the trash.  However, these shoe horns are so long that they are easily visible if they fall in the trash can.</li>
            <li> It just the right size and easy to use. It travels well.</li>
            <li> It does the job with no problems. The length is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to arrive but they work wonderful! Can hardly find those things in the US with this reasonable price.  Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;(It works especially great with my tight winter snow boots)</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest...most people who order items such as this really need assistance.  These are entirely too flimsy for someone really needing aid with putting on their shoes!  It is a nice product IF you have nothing else to use, but not preferred.  Invest in something more rigid.  It works for me because I don&#x27;t need much assistance, but if I did, it would not be a good product.  It works okay for the purpose in which I bought them (occasional travel), but not good for everyday use if I really needed it.</li>
            <li> This shoe horn is a little flexible and works great.  I had purchased a more rigid (and more expensive) model which broke on the third use.  This horn I have used repeatedly with excellent performance.  I highly recommend it to anyone who must limit their bending.</li>
            <li> More flexible than I thought they would be but bonus was the length.</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as the metal one I lost but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. It does the job.</li>
            <li> I have a longer and heavier one that I like better but couldn&#x27;t find that kind anywhere. This one will do.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;could be longer&amp;#34; comment is really just me being picky.  At 6&#x27; tall, there&#x27;s a very limited amount of choices for a shoe tree you can use without bending over at all.  Al all of those other choices are VERY expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that plastic just seems to work best.  Metal is great, but you really do need a bit of flex.  Wood will eventually splinter, and then it&#x27;s trashed.  Plastic has enough give, and pretty much lasts forever unless you leave it in your car on a cold day and it freezes, then you drop something heavy on it, and it cracks.  Yeah, that&#x27;s what happened to my old Ikea plastic shoe-tree, and why I purchased these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good deal if you want/need 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Great shoe horns.  My father was a big-time shoe horn user, so I guess it&#x27;s genetic.</li>
            <li> These work great and are the right height</li>
            <li> Like the length and that you get 2.  It is a little flexible but works fine and is worth the cost.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> took forever to arrive, but work great with my longer boots.  These are hard to find in stores, so I was glad to get them so cheap!</li>
            <li> People over analyze a piece of plastic,these are heavy enough to do the job and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;-7\\&quot; 290 lbs.  Of course it may break if you push on it to hard but IT&#x27;S PLASTIC.Good deal for 2 horns,Buy It.</li>
            <li> A necessary item after undergoing back surgery.  So convient and easy to use, probably will utilize the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Got for my husband who is an old school. He uses every day. It seems does the job and what&#x27;s more, he won&#x27;t bug me about throwing (accidently) his old one away. It&#x27;s bendable plastice &amp; comes with two. So I place one behind the door and one by his shoes.</li>
            <li> Everything was as described.  They are long enough to do the job and sturdy enough to stay put and find the heel.</li>
            <li> Perfect shoe horns!  These are perfect to reach into boots &amp; hard to reach shoes</li>
            <li> The price was right and the shipping was fast.  Since they are so long, you can use them standing up or sitting down.  They are the best.</li>
            <li> These are cheap.  Compared to the plastic used on my regular shoehorns, these longer ones can bend and twist and generally are really cheap.  I&#x27;d expect the same kind of hard plastic used on those smaller plastic shoehorns, but that&#x27;s not the case with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were you, I&#x27;d want to spend a few more bucks for one of those wood handle metal horn models.  At least when you step down to put your shoe on, it won&#x27;t flex.  Also, 18.5&amp;#34; is on the short side, you should try something a bit longer in the 24&amp;#34; and longer range.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, especially for someone that cannot reach down to put their shoe on.</li>
            <li> This works, enough said! My father-in-law brought this down to our house once and left it there. So we start using it - my wife and two young children. It made it very easy to put on shoes standing up. The black plastic is a bit flexible, but we find that actually helps better lever on the shoes. The small ring at one end made it convenient to hang next to the front door as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago we lost it and honestly have been a little lost without it. You might be thinking, \\&quot;How lazy can you get?\\&quot; but once we got used to using the shoe horn, it really made putting on already tied shoes a snap. We&#x27;ve since gone back to tying and untying our shoes like before, but now that I&#x27;ve seen this shoe horn offered as a set at such a great price, I&#x27;m snapping it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I tried a slightly more expensive [[ASIN:B004X6SW3O shoe horn]] with a grip handle and a spring attached horn, and it turned out to be a piece of junk. Better to stick with the *cheap* plastic model.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  I keep one in the car too.  I have a damaged leg and need a shoehorn for all kinds of shoes.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use these every day.  She keeps her jogging shoes tied and all she has to do is to insert the shoe horn into the shoe and effortlessly the foot slips into the shoe!  I use them every day also. Makes putting on shoes a simple ordeal.</li>
            <li> Well, I guess I got what I paid for. Cheap plastic, flimsy. Poor quality. What do you expect when you pay like $2? Actually, I bought one at Ikea the other day for $0.99 and it was very thick and sturdy, even had rubber grippies on the handle which my dad (stroke victim) really appreciated. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality and substantial plastic. Better made than expected.</li>
            <li> these are good. nothing fancy about them. they just work great.</li>
            <li> work just as intended.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I only need one, but still less than retail.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, yet the product so doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is NOT rigid enough to hold the shoe in place while using it.&lt;br /&gt;Unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me don&#x27;t loves me some of that... So don&#x27;t bring it on home to me now even though I live at the corner of Easy Street &amp; Lucky Charms in the City of Love.</li>
            <li> i have arthritis both knees so putting on my socks and shoes is a challenge, these really are a blessing. so easy now for me to put on my shoes.</li>
            <li> When you are all dressed who wants to bend over to fight with a shoe.... This works well and the shoes slide right on</li>
            <li> It is cheap but functional. A bit too flexible for my taste but I am not complaining because of the price.</li>
            <li> item works for putting on shoes and helps keep me from having to bend down when putting on shoes</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. They are sturdy and were delivered quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are shorter than I expected -- but the same length stated. I just underestimated the length that I would need.</li>
            <li> While these shoe horns are adequate, they are substantially thinner and more flexible than one I purchased some time ago (probably at a higher price), even though they  look exactly the same. However, the price is very reasonable, and they will serve my needs. And I got two for that reasonable price, and gave one away to a friend who likes it very much. Free shipping was an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar item at IKEA which also had a back scratcher on one end, and wanted to replace them since I had given one away and lost the other.  These are pretty thin plastic, and the horn is narrow too narrow for a size 11 shoe.  Despite these shortcomings they are satisfactory in that they save the backs of my shoes! they are long enough so I can put my shoes on without bending over too much.  Really worth about a dollar each in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what they say they are, and they work. I needed a new shoe horn, and you can&#x27;t find them at shoe stores any more (except some very expensive ones). These do the job at a reasonable price. The extra length proved handy, I can easily use it sitting down, without having to bend.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a firmer plastic.These shoe horns are long but extremely flimsy.I also feel that the tongue of the shoe horn should be wider.I couldn&#x27;t get my shoe on due to the narrowness of the tongue.I plan to buy a metal shoe horn through Amazon of course and will give you my review after I receive them.Not disappointed....stuff happens.</li>
            <li> Great for putting on work shoes in the garage.</li>
            <li> These shoe horns work very nicely. They are plastic and thus perhaps less durable than a wooden or metal shoehorn. But when I use them  I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re going to break. The length is long enough so that I only have to bend down slightly in order to insert one into my shoe; without sitting down. The fit of the shoehorn in my shoes is fine. The rounded top is helpful for placing the shoehorns on a hook when not in use.</li>
            <li> Works great for just that little bit of help.  Works far better than metal and doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin. Very reasonable price..</li>
            <li> Long for use when standing up.  Flexible, not too rigid but doesn&#x27;t seem like they will break very easy either.  And Cheap.</li>
            <li> Good product and an excellent price. Use these several times a day and work great. Highly recommend this product and seller.&lt;br /&gt;The extra length is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Purched these for my wife after she had her knee replaced. She just loves them. I have to fight with her just borrow one to use.</li>
            <li> My father loves these.  He has trouble after a stroke putting his shoes on, but these are a great help to him</li>
            <li> Too soft and it bends too easy, it should be more sturdiness, I guess u got what you pay for it</li>
            <li> I leave this handing on my bi-fold closed door and use it daily.  It is well designed so it does not take up too much space, is the correct length and a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt; My feet just slip into my sneakers without bending the backs down or fighting with socks not sliding past the back of the shoes. bl&lt;br /&gt;  My friend got a severe back problem and was wishing for one....  Now we both have and enjoy them.  They are well made.  Elegant design - just right.</li>
            <li> soft plastic that bends as soon as u put foot in shoe. This is not sturdy enough would not buy again</li>
            <li> Useless.  I finally bpught a steel; one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to buy one since I accidentally broke my shoe horn my mom got me from Japan, but I didn&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s called in US. So when I accidentally came across with this image, I was thrilled and bought them immediately. :))) It&#x27;s not exactly the same with my previous one, but it works great and seems durable enough. Plastic seems to have enough give to bend when I&#x27;m wearing shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s long enough for me since I don&#x27;t have back problems, but my grandpa used to attach an extra stick on it to extend the length so that he didn&#x27;t have to bend at all when wearing shoes. Thought it might be helpful for others who need some extra length from the shoe horn. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the color and lenght but the plastic is somewhat cheap, dont expect it to last too long but considering the price, it okay.</li>
            <li> very useful, I needed it for a long time and finally found it. thanks.</li>
            <li> School-age grandsons used Grandpa&#x27;s shoe horn whenever they spent the night. Now they each have their own at home. Seems pretty sturdy ... we&#x27;ll see over time if that is the case.</li>
            <li> Aging joints keep having a harder and harder time bending to do mundane things like putting on shoes.  This helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Content with product, it is just a shoe horn and does the job without bending down for seniors.&lt;br /&gt;Durable plastic quality.</li>
            <li> Not quite long enough for me to use</li>
            <li> I have just starting using these shoehorns and find they are sturdy, just the right length and a great geometrically design for inserting the shoehorn in the right place in the heel to get your shoes on without strain.  Clearly worth the price and shipping  cost, especially when you get two for the price of one.</li>
            <li> Convenient for me snce i have some physical problems. I have to buy very expensive, special shoes, so preventing any breakdown is important. These are very helpful with that. I also am not able to bend over easily, so the extra length is great.</li>
            <li> Great help with my hip and back problems.</li>
            <li> These 2 shoe horns are very strong and light too. Great buy. You won&#x27;t go wrong if you get them.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and inexpensive item and very easy to use. If you a little over weight these are the ticket until you get down a little.</li>
            <li> This plastic shoe horn did its job and has made getting the kids pre-laced shoes on a breeze. I recommend it</li>
            <li> The product is very narrow for my foot and could be a little more longer. The plastic it is made of is cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> These were for a friend to send to her brother as he has a hard time putting on his shoes.  They were perfect.</li>
            <li> works like I thought it would. arrived in a reasonable amount of time. good price for a good product. will buy another when it is needed</li>
            <li> A little softer than I had expected but actually helps me put on my shoes even easier!</li>
            <li> If you can not bend back easily, get longer ones, unless you&#x27;re a leprechaun.</li>
            <li> Great product and service !!!!</li>
            <li> The shoe horns came quickly and were exactly what my husband was looking for and at the perfect price.  Plus two of them for the price of one!  Yes!</li>
            <li> Awesome shoe horns, i must say how helpful these things are with an early morning start. These shoe horns will help anyone who has trouble bending or is just lazy as i.</li>
            <li> Perfect, does the job!! Had purchased much more expense one with spring feature and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> While I believe the bottom could be wider they work fine and I bought them so I didn&#x27;t have to hunt around for my long show horn. I keep the primary in my room and the two auxiliaries between the dressing room and the downstairs. I&#x27;m a man but I have a lot of shoes. that is because I am old and they don&#x27;t wear out and I buy more than one pair of a shoe I like.</li>
            <li> The shoe horns were inexpensive and the product verifies it.</li>
            <li> I like that I can use this product without having to bend all the way down.  Knees are not what the used to be and this shoe horn really helps.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Use it every day.  Sti on my first one.</li>
            <li> These are not stiff enough to help you get into boots.  I also worry they will break easily, but they are so flexible that maybe they will last longer than I think..</li>
            <li> Saved me when I broke my knee.  I could put on my own shoes!</li>
            <li> Shoehorn works.  Arrived without any problem.  Not too much more that I can say about it.  I would recommend this if you are looking for a shoehorn or two.</li>
            <li> ON time, works well,  I&#x27;d recommend The one reason I don&#x27;t fill out these reviews is that it tells me how many words I have to write.</li>
            <li> These extra long shoe horns are perfect for putting on my shoes and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Hey these are just like the ones the TSA have!  These are endorsed by the very airport folks that keep us safe from shoe throwers and other dangerous shoe meanies.  I like them long to handle really challenging slip on boots.  They are great because you get two!  One for me and one for you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple shoe horn. It works fine. I wish it was wider so my fat feet would feel the whole  piece of plastic as my foot goes in.  But that is really a minor detail.  I couldn&#x27;t justify spending  $12-15 on a piece of plastic or wood like many other shoe horns. This item fits the bill.  Inexpensive,  functions, and does not break- and no maintenance.</li>
            <li> These are so great for a number of reasons. They work great when you have a pair of shoes or boots that the back always slide down when you put them on. Grab and slide into the shoes quickly while on the run. Also great for people who have a stiff back, or arthritis, or just morning stiffness that doesn&#x27;t let you bend. Also works to dig shoes out of the closet. Worth the money</li>
            <li> Just the right length. Now I have two, one for travel and one to lose. I do recommend the purchase of these.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction, as described</li>
            <li> Keeps me from bending down .It&#x27;s cheep and gets me into my shoes easily .I take it on vacation and doesn&#x27;t take much room.</li>
            <li> just what i wanted. thanks</li>
            <li> very good and a big help</li>
            <li> perfect for putting on shoes</li>
            <li> Ordered item for my 79 year old dad. He is very over weight and his lower spine is all fused together from arthritis. He was unable to put his shoes on and felt humiliated as well as frustrated. Now he just sits on a chair and, with the aid of this device, he is able to slip into his footwear with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful to the inventor and seller of this product. They afforded an elderly man a piece of dignity</li>
            <li> Great construction,  smooth operation, easy to use, good looking, high tech.  Is that a good enough review?  Seriously, IT&#x27;S JUST A SHOEHORN!  Get over it.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 92 year old mother and she loves them!</li>
            <li> they are very long and work great.. a good buy</li>
            <li> They work as expected.  Very good.</li>
            <li> These plastic shoe horns do the job they are supposed to do. Am a senior in real good shape but&lt;br /&gt;have a large a waist that makes it difficult to bend over to put on my shoes. The panacea for your footwear ills.</li>
            <li> The shoe horns work great. I could not get my boots on without them. The price was also reasonable. This was the only place that made this product available.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst product I ever bought online.  It broke the first time I tried to use it.  I had to pay return shipping, which ate up most of my refund.</li>
            <li> The product is useful. Unfortunately one has to buy two of them when one (1) would suffice.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re inexpensive, they work and there&#x27;s two of them! Why pay more for the wooden etc shoe horns?  These are perfect.</li>
            <li> I just found out i have to have hip surgery and its been so hard to reach down and get shoes on. These will be wonderful, I can keep one downstairs and one upstairs in my bedroom. They were received fast and packaged very well. They will be excellent, I know.</li>
            <li> Very nice flexible horn great for helping with pull on boots. You get two, they are cheap, they work... what more could you want??</li>
            <li> the price is affordable but i would recommend investing on a more durable shoe horn. this is a bit too fragile for my liking</li>
            <li> For the cost of the shoe horn, you can not go wrong.  It is plastic and bends a little, but its only supposed to aide your foot in sliding in place.</li>
            <li> My in-laws wanted a shoe horn since they misplaced their old one. These are not as rigid as most, but seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> They work really well for the price. Who needs the expensive shoe horns to do the same job? Thank you</li>
            <li> They serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for more than a year and they truly are sturdy.  I have used some other brands and they were brittle and cracked at the heel.  These have held up just fine.  Just like the description says - long, flexible and sturdy.</li>
            <li> My new favorite item, I love these and my backscratcher, wouldn&#x27;t do without either of them.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;But what do you expect for the price point.</li>
            <li> Purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made of stiff plastic, smooth, long enough to not have to bend to put on shoe.... it works really well and I like that I can hang it from the loop on the end.</li>
            <li> Bought this two set - one for my husband; one for me.  We both use them daily.  No problems with bending/breaking.  We&#x27;ve had them about two months and still going strong.  Maybe should have gotten one a little longer, but this one is doing fine.</li>
            <li> I love these. Firm enough to make sure the backs of my shoes stay up but flexible enough to give a little in order to wedge my foot in. Also, like the title says, I can reach my shoes by bending only slightly.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, Great quality, Perfect, does the job, great price, flexible (works well), length helps with higher boots, great for all shoes</li>
            <li> The price was good.  Getting two was a plus.  They are sturdy enough and the length is helpful.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> does the job  just as advertised  perfect. would recoment it to anyone  low price is a plus makes life easier.</li>
            <li> These work really well. They are much better than the kind with the spring between the shoehorn and the handle. That one (different seller) kept falling apart. These have nothing to break, and they are smooth and easy to use. Prompt shipping and delivery also.</li>
            <li> These are really great if you&#x27;re having trouble bending down (which I am).  I keep one in the car and one in the house.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just what I needed.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Price is the governing factor in why I bought these. They work great for a person with knees that have seen too many injuries to fold up well any more.</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and was as described.  It keeps me from bending over so much.  A good thing as you get older :)</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected, an inexpensive shoe horn. But it is supposed to come with 2. And mine only came with 1. I contacted the company and they said that they&#x27;d send the second. I will update if it comes. Second Shoe horn was sent.  Good price.  A little flimsy, but I have found the more rigid ones break.  At this price, even if each one lasts a year, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> now I can put my shoes on again with out help or struggle to get them on and even though is made of plastic thay are verry durable</li>
            <li> Very happy I got these.  I much prefer these to heavy, steel/metal shoe horns because I hang these against the wall and these don&#x27;t harm/scratch the wall, whereas the steel ones will eventually leave a mark.  Also, light enough to take with me on trips.  The Shoe Horns are long enough to save me from having to bend too much and stress my bad lower back.  It&#x27;s a bit flexible, but it&#x27;s actually helpful in wedging it between your shoes and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the seller/service, I haven&#x27;t had to ask them for anything, but they include a note in the order thanking you for the purchase and asking that you give them a chance to resolve any issues.  Sure, part of this is managing against negative reviews, but that&#x27;s the whole point of reviews...good merchants who care get rewarded for their customer focus.  I&#x27;m glad they care enough to do that.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is great.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for..........good product.  Would definitely purchase again and recommend it to others.  Met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> I like the extra long length, so I do not need to bend over to much to use this shoe horn. Has a little flex to it which I know will add to the life of this product. I know I will not have to buy shoes as often using this shoe horn.</li>
            <li> If bending to put on shoes is difficult, this is wonderful.  Breakage is a fear, however, I have two so this is not a real problem.</li>
            <li> Works great as expected.</li>
            <li> i wish these were more rigid rather than bending so easily and they need to be a little wider but other than that they do the job</li>
            <li> A little flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;That is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don&#x27;t think more is necessary!</li>
            <li> Peace of junk. Very short, extremely flexible , narrow. Go to IKEA and buy a real shoe horn. They are sturdy and little bit flexible. Otherwise buy a metal one. Seller is aware of product quality and attached a note that says - do not leave negative feedback, just contact him first. Looks like he is kind and will take it back, but that&#x27;s not an excuse to sell just junk.&lt;br /&gt;And please don&#x27;t state that they are EXTRA long!!! That&#x27;s a lie.</li>
            <li> This shoe horn is  very good , simple  but works , I wish i found it long time a go , if you need one , inexpensive and good , get this one .</li>
            <li> Sure handy for quick slip ons!  Hate grass on the kitchen floor.  Leaving shoes at the door really helps.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy and bendable.  They&#x27;re long enough.  I bought 2 lots of 2 because they&#x27;re not always easy to find.  I&#x27;d purchased from WalMart and found those to be fragile.  They cracked and split and I ended up using scotch tape to hold them together.  These will do fine.</li>
            <li> Plastic is a little cheap - but they work.  I have trouble bending over &amp; these make it easy to slip my shoes on.</li>
            <li> It is a shoe horn, not much to say. It works as expected. It is long enough to get your shoes on without bending over, but there are many other shoe horns with long handles.</li>
            <li> I Like the product, but its a little flimsey.....If you want quality buy a metal one. Just didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot</li>
            <li> Was looking for a nice long shoehorn for my mother when we found this 2 for 1 deal, hey, I&#x27;ll use one if it&#x27;s available. Reviews looked good and the plastic is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it will break. Gets the job done and works great. Perfect length for myself (5&#x27;5&amp;#34;) and my mother, who is about the same height. No more slipping my feet into expensive sneakers and breaking the backs anymore! Why buy an expensive wooden one or name brand when these work just great! If it does break? Great price to simply replace!</li>
            <li> My previous long handle shoe horn broke (my fault, not the shoe horn&#x27;s) so I got these and they are better than the previous one. These are slightly flexible, thus less likely to break, long enough that I don&#x27;t have to bend down (although my goal is to slim down so I can!!) and they have a hole so I can hang them from a hook and not lose sight of them when I need &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old man and bending isn&#x27;t easy.  These long, inexpensive shoe horns do the trick! I put one at each door, as we remove shoes on entry.</li>
            <li> Everything a shoe horn should  do!</li>
            <li> Helps me easily put on my shoes without having to untie/tie my shoes.  It bends a little more than I would&#x27;ve liked but it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> Work great. Very helpful. Thank you.</li>
            <li> They are cheap. They do the job. You get two :). It is very helpful for elderly. Steady. Would buy again if needed,</li>
            <li> practical and gave them as gift</li>
            <li> My kids may laugh, but these nifty long shoe horns are just the ticket for quickly slipping into running shoes and back into work shoes without wasting precious time.</li>
            <li> I guess thats what you get when you can&#x27;t see them first.  My suggestion is to buy them from someone who has stronger ones.</li>
            <li> Got them two years ago when I got my knee replaced.  Still use them at home and at work, upstairs and downstaris</li>
            <li> I got these longer shoe horns for a gentleman who is 91, he struggled with the small sized ones and really can get his shoes on well all by himself now, Great idea for anyone with back pain too.</li>
            <li> they are a little more flexible than i&#x27;d like. Ideally they would be stiffer at this length. they are ok</li>
            <li> product is as advertised, but what the heck can you say about a shoehorn!!!!!!!!!!  It&#x27; cute? It&#x27;s lovely? It smells good???</li>
            <li> Great buy!  Inexpensive.  Two 18\\&quot; plastic shoe horns.  Not especially heavy plastic, but very flexible.  I think they will turn out to be sturdy enough.  The 18\\&quot; length makes it possible to put your shoes on without sitting down.  Especially helpful for older folks like me, who don&#x27;t bend as well as we used to.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but work beautifully!</li>
            <li> The extra long handles on these keep me from having to bend over to slip on my shoes. At my age, this is a very nice feature. I keep 1 in my closet &amp; 1 by the front door.</li>
            <li> The price was good and then I found out why when they came. Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> greally great to have 2.  one for home and the other to keep in my gym bag.  or give to someone else. made good and sturdy.  fast delivery too</li>
            <li> .....there&#x27;s not much else to say really but I&#x27;m required to write more if I wish to give you my assessment....what else can you really say about shoe horns?</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift scheduled for a hip replacement. This is the first of two . He likes them, shoul help him out after the surgery. It was a good price and was delivered on time .</li>
            <li> These two are not worth the $5 I paid; and, unfortunately, are not worth the trouble of rеturning them back.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the seller (One Super Bargain), but shoe horns that I got are cheap-looking and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;They compare very poorly even to the ones you see in TJMax or Marshalls.</li>
            <li> What can i say, its so convenient. I keep one in my closet and one near the exit of my house, Dont have to bend with a smaller shoe horn nor do i have to put my finger in the shoe.</li>
            <li> Like I said, one for each room ---- don&#x27;t have to go hunting!  These are strong/sturdy.  Also strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I ordered these before and loved them, so I ordered more for work.  Inexpensive and very functional. Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> purchased for my elderly mom. works well. no complaints. I think it is easier to use because its thinner.</li>
            <li> helps me get into my work shoes and not break down the backs any more. dont have to lean over to use like a short one but my back is ok so far so not a must just very nice feature.</li>
            <li> Good, serviceable. AS advertised.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for a long shoe horn for the longest time as he doesn&#x27;t like to bend down too low to put his shoe on with a shoe horn.</li>
            <li> These shoe horns are perfect! They are light and long and inexpensive.  Hooray; been looking for them for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is such a inexpensive and easy to use product and makes it easy for my husband to put his shoes on.</li>
            <li> love that you don&#x27;t have to bend over so far using the extra long shoe horn in black plastic 18.5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Back saver , worth every penny</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.  Thought these would be more sturdy.</li>
            <li> quick fast delivery. Item perfect. thanks</li>
            <li> Works fine. Extra long length comes in handy. Good value on the price for two.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Long and seems to be durable.</li>
            <li> Works, good for older folks who can&#x27;t bend too much</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic. Spend a few more dollars and buy the wooden ones. That&#x27;s what I ended up doing . .</li>
            <li> Too flexible to work well. When donning shoes with padded backs they allow the back to fold down.  Still using the old, broken, rigid one instead even though it isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> well made, large, don&#x27;t get lost, hole is big enough to hang on anything but a door knob, and long enough I don;t have to bend over to use it effectively, These are thick enough that they will not break easily.</li>
            <li> Shoe horns arrived smashed to pieces.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother.  The fact that there were two of them allowed him to keep one upstairs and one downstairs.  He just loves the fact that he does not have to bend over to get his shoes on.</li>
            <li> I needed something like this due to RA. These are very thin but seem to work just fine. I hope they hold up and don&#x27;t break. I do like that they can be hung from the hole, so they are on a hook in my closet.</li>
            <li> Works okay.  They are a little too flexible, but pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Brittle plastic, one of them snapped on the first use.  Spend a little more and get something that will last.</li>
            <li> These shoe horns are a relatively cheap plastic similar to what you would get in tupperware. They are not rigid but flex. If you know how to use a shoe horn correctly (e.g. insert foot slightly into shoe and then use horn to guide heel into shoe) then these work perfect. If you are looking for something to wedge your foot into a shoe, then save your money and go buy a wooden or metal shoe horn... then google how to use a shoe horn correctly or you could just re-read my instructions again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for anywhere or anyone. I keep one at home that I use daily getting into my casual shoes. Keep the other at work for when I switch to my dress shoes. Protects the heels of each shoe greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for those with back problems or elderly as they are long so you don&#x27;t have to bend over as much.</li>
            <li> all better than what expected, I arrive all in perfect conditions, just the I gave that tapeworm that to arrive the things arrived</li>
            <li> very helpful and useful.</li>
            <li> Wound be with out these!!</li>
            <li> Long, plastic shoe horn. Helpful after the TSA screening. Easy to carry in the bag. I keep one at work.</li>
            <li> Perfect to put by our front door for guests to put their shoes back on.  It also makes putting my shoes on easily with one hand while holding my baby!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these shoe horns.  They save my back and I use three of them in various places around my home and at work.  Again I am very happy with the delivery and the product.  I would recommend them to anyone and the price was great.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are in our 80&#x27;s and we love this item.  We need one in several places in the house.  I especially like the large hole which is handy for hanging.</li>
