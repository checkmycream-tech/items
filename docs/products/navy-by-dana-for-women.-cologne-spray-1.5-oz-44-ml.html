            <li>This is my favorite summer time cologne.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes</li>
            <li>This is one of my mom&#x27;s favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this scent in the 90s when I was college student in Iowa City.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite every day type fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Really love Navy for women</li>
            <li>Will be sure to order again.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved Navy perfume for years - especially since my husband comments kindly upon it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>Calming and not too strong.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a Great Cologne spray for Women, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the problems of a constant sneeze, or watery eyes!!</li>
            <li>And because of the great prices I only have to buy once or twice a year, But always buy from Amazon!!</li>
            <li>The scent is light and feminine.  </li>
            <li>for a light airy smell buy this</li>
            <li>I love the scent and have actually had men stop me to ask what perfume I was wearing, as they loved the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to find a scent I can actually wear all day.</li>
            <li>It seems to be getting more difficult to find at local stores so very glad that Amazon is a good source.</li>
            <li>my mom would wear this ALL the time because it&#x27;s her favorite perfume, but she saves it for special occasions as it has become VERY hard to find in stores or most any where online.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to 2013, and I wanted to buy my 13 year old daughter a perfume for Eid and wanted it to be a surprise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive when it comes to scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding Navy in the stores and was excited to discover it at Amazon and for a decent price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft floral, powdery smelling.  </li>
            <li>when I use Navy, There are only two different kinds of Cologne I can use, Because of my year round Allergys, and the first is Navy By Dana for Women Cologne, And the second Cologne I use is Lady Stetson.  </li>

            <li> I will keep this perfume since I still like it, but the moral of the story is, consult your teenage daughter if you&#x27;re buying a gift for her, even if you think there&#x27;s no way she will not absolutely love it.</li>

            <li> My mom loves this stuff, it&#x27;s harder and harder to find every year</li>
            <li> NAVY is geting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she did not like, saying it smells like an old lady!</li>
            <li> and you wouldn&#x27;t want to make an old lady sad</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that this size 1.5 oz was smaller than the last 1.5 oz I received.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding it in the stores.</li>
            <li> and she will be sad</li>
            <li> How could I go wrong?</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Navy perfume for years - especially since my husband comments kindly upon it every time I wear it. I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding Navy in the stores and was excited to discover it at Amazon and for a decent price. Amazon will remain my Navy go-to place into the future and hopefully it will be there when I need more of one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Navy for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> This perfume has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for years (and mine when she wears it!).  It seems to be getting more difficult to find at local stores so very glad that Amazon is a good source.</li>
            <li> my mom would wear this ALL the time because it&#x27;s her favorite perfume, but she saves it for special occasions as it has become VERY hard to find in stores or most any where online. so is why I bought 3 bottles :) it made her christmas morning &amp; mine!</li>
            <li> Calming and not too strong. I had a hard time finding it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandmother. No problems except that it looks a bit cheap, but it smells good. I recommend if you cannot find a gift.</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a gift, for a lady who loves this scent. I couldn&#x27;t begin to explain the scent, so I won&#x27;t be talking anyone into (or away from) this perfume. However, if you like the scent of Navy for Women by Dana, Amazon has the authentic product and at a great price. As a guy, I also appreciate not having to enter a smelly perfume store to buy it.</li>
            <li> Made a great Xmas gift for a special person. They enjoyed it and referred it to others and I told them where to get it at a great price.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff, it&#x27;s harder and harder to find every year so don&#x27;t go buying them all up, I need them every year for her and she will be sad and you wouldn&#x27;t want to make an old lady sad would you?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite summer time cologne.  I receive so many nice compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> NAVY is geting harder and harder to find.  This was a great price for the 1.5 oz package.  Stocking up while I can.</li>
            <li> I love the Navy Cologne at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for over 15 years. This was a good price for the product and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Navy since the eighties. I love the scent and have actually had men stop me to ask what perfume I was wearing, as they loved the scent. I was so happy to find it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will probably stop purchasing from Amazon, they have made even their &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; a pain in the you know what.  Who has decided that we all want to be writing out a review???  someone who has nothing else to do I guess</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes</li>
            <li> I have always Loved the smell, I have always used Lady&#x27;s Navy, Because of my Allergy&#x27;s, It&#x27;s a Great Cologne spray for Women, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the problems of a constant sneeze, or watery eyes!! when I use Navy, There are only two different kinds of Cologne I can use, Because of my year round Allergys, and the first is Navy By Dana for Women Cologne, And the second Cologne I use is Lady Stetson.  I use both Cologne sprays, Sprays last a long time, And I do make it a point to always Buy from Amazon because of the great prices I can get them for buying from Amazon, And because of the great prices I only have to buy once or twice a year, But always buy from Amazon!! I smell Great! And you can also buy it threw Amazon you will be happy you did!</li>
            <li> This is one of my mom&#x27;s favorite perfumes. It&#x27;s not my favorite, but isn&#x27;t bad. How could I go wrong? Good price and shipped quick!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent in the 90s when I was college student in Iowa City. The scent is light and feminine.  Fast forward to 2013, and I wanted to buy my 13 year old daughter a perfume for Eid and wanted it to be a surprise. Unfortunately, she did not like, saying it smells like an old lady! Just so that my ego didn&#x27;t get so badly bruised, I asked my 17 year old son, and he said, it has  \\&quot;a light scent and smells like a lady\\&quot;. Anyway, since my daughter didn&#x27;t like her perfume, I thought of returning it, but perfumes are non-returnable.  I will keep this perfume since I still like it, but the moral of the story is, consult your teenage daughter if you&#x27;re buying a gift for her, even if you think there&#x27;s no way she will not absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The scent is great but I was disappointed that this size 1.5 oz was smaller than the last 1.5 oz I received.</li>
            <li> My son and I bought this for my mom because we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere to purchase. She loved it!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite every day type fragrances.  It&#x27;s soft floral, powdery smelling.  I work with children and when I wear this, they always say &#x27;you smell good&#x27;.</li>
            <li> this is a great buy not to strong and smells great. will buy again once I run out. for a light airy smell buy this</li>
            <li> Really love Navy for women</li>
            <li> My step mom loves this scent.  I get her this every year for Christmas.  Great price and good seller.  Will be sure to order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive when it comes to scents. I smelled this on someone else and loved the smell so I thought I&#x27;d try it. I love it. It smells wonderful and I&#x27;ve not had runny eyes or headaches from it so that&#x27;s a big plus.  It&#x27;s nice to find a scent I can actually wear all day.</li>
