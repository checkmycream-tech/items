            <li>Good color saturation and no flaking!</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful in that palette</li>
            <li>Great value for what you pay.  </li>
            <li>The pigmentation is great, moreso on the matte shades than the shimmer but all around a great deal.</li>
            <li>I love this product, the selection is excellent and the nudes are in every shade you need.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;L&#x27;Oreal has a reputation for good, quality skin care, cosmetics and make-up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for daywear and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and can see how people of colour may take issue with the pigmentation of this palette but everything shows up on me since I am so fair.</li>
            <li>I think I paid about $15 for this palette which I think is a good value for the amount of shadows that you get.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and flattering and would work for most skin types.</li>
            <li>VERY interesting is that they include instruction ON the eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;ve got a great primer</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>The colors are fantastic, and the double-ended brush is great -</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a nice combination of matte and shimmer shadows</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a kind of &amp;#34;pain by number&amp;#34; showing you how to achieve these looks in four steps</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Colour Riche La Palette (nude) contains a nice selection of neutral shades.  </li>
            <li>Included are both matte and shimmer colors, so again, a nice choice.  </li>
            <li>; all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>The palette has a nice array of nude shades (for that no makeup look).</li>
            <li>This set has a nice range of colors, and I am very happy with it since I prefer a natural look.  </li>
            <li>Great natural palette for my fair and aging complextion.</li>
            <li>I would have given it a 5 if it had more matte colors.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors.</li>
            <li>I Love having a variety at my finger tips.  </li>
            <li>If you only get one palette a year like me - this is an excellent choice.  </li>
            <li>Yes, there are many more colors than sponges (2)</li>
            <li>and I mostly wear it to work and on the weekends but can still create some smokier effects with the darker shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>If your looking to have some a great variety that doesn&#x27;t cost much this is for you.</li>
            <li>The colors are well pigmented too :)</li>
            <li>I love nude palettes in my eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I do use the L&#x27;Oreal  Magic De-Crease Primer with this palette (and all eye shadows that I use).</li>
            <li>I find the most similarities between the L&#x27;oreal and the Coastal Scents Revealed since they both range around $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think the pigmentation and wear time is really better in this Nude 01 palette than the plum one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Colour Riche La Palette, Nude.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal products and this eyeshadow set did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Every morning, I am excited to choose which combinations of color I apply !</li>
            <li>This is an easy, elegant palette to speed you through your eye makeup application every day for any occasion.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that depending on my mood or my skin tone, I always have a neutral color available.</li>
            <li>Ok, because I am fair-medium skinned with light hair and blue-green eyes</li>
            <li>* More &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; available online</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend a nice mixing medium (I found a great DIY recipe for mixing medium on Pinterest if you don&#x27;t want to pay the high prices) to make the colors more vivid.</li>
            <li>I find these colours easy to blend</li>
            <li>They are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>It is my first time to use this kind of variation of eye shadow, but as a beginner, it is really easy to use it.</li>
            <li>It is smooth going on and doesn&#x27;t easily brush off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly and is easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>This palette is a pretty close dup another famous maker&#x27;s palette that goes for a much more.</li>
            <li>Love it, absolutely!!</li>
            <li>This eye shadow goes on smooth and covers well.  </li>
            <li>that come in both warm and neutral-to-cooler tones which I find very versatile.</li>
            <li>- the cheap ones fall apart in my make-up bag after some use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The powder goes on smooth and stays where you put it.</li>
            <li>I wear light eye-shadow and find that if I apply these using the tips I know to make them hold that the colors</li>
            <li>matter how experienced you are with applying cosmetics, you will also benefit by the expert tips illustrated on the back of the package.</li>
            <li>I got these beautiful nude colors last week and have been wearing them and having fun with them.</li>
            <li>overall this is a very enjoyable palette that is easy to use and easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li>that are about twice the cost of this one that I like better overall, this one has such excellent colors that I can&#x27;t not recommend it for my fellow nude enthusiasts.</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun with this palette!</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; has such a nice range of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; colors that I feel many women can find something for their skin</li>
            <li>I noticed that it starts on the warm side on one end, and starts on the cool side on the other end, so I used warm then cool on alternating days.</li>
            <li>I really like having so many choices in one pallet.  </li>
            <li>So if you have nice brushes to apply them, they are a beautiful set of colors, extremely practical and do very nicely even as eye liner if you have a thin lining brush that you mix in with some water.</li>
            <li>Most are very pigmented and go on beautifully, with a natural finish especially when used with eye shadow primer (I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance).</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>A good basic nude palette that will fit the bill for most of your needs, especially in regards to the cost</li>
            <li>Overall this is a very nice set and perfect for casual daytime makeup.</li>
            <li>There is a nice range of dark and light colors and each go on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest getting it because it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, and you have to put so many coats on to be able to see it.</li>
            <li>shimmer is very wearable, catches and reflects a bit of light but doesn&#x27;t give a metallic effect)</li>
            <li>The price is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>The one I have most issue with is the light vanilla color on the very left.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to be fun experimenting with these range of shades for daytime and nighttime wear.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe I would like it better, I feel like you can&#x27;t really see the eyeshadow as much when you put it on.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal is a nice palette, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Brushes are the most important part of the application process and eye shadow palettes rarely come with a decent enough brush.</li>
            <li>The shadow is soft and applies easily without a lot of fall out.</li>
            <li>if you have not tried sticking to the natural/nude shades, you have no idea how sophisticated and glam they can make you look by defining your eyes, keeping you very much on trend and most importantly not ageing you by dating your appearance!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I brought both palettes and they are gorgeous and all the colors work very well with each other.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love them.</li>
            <li>I love eyeshadow palettes and have several brown neutral palettes.</li>
            <li>I think it works for those who aren&#x27;t wanting to spend the money on higher end palettes that 3X the price.</li>
            <li>Not only is every single shade pretty in the case, they&#x27;re gorgeous on and I&#x27;d be really surprised to find someone who doesn&#x27;t look great in every single one.</li>
            <li>Since this is such a large set they should have included more brushes and blending pads.</li>
            <li>Usually, a palette is completely warm or neutral or cool.</li>
            <li>and I had more luck swiping it with my finger to blend (it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable, but didn&#x27;t blend as easily as the brand I usually use).  </li>
            <li>The colors are very neutral and go on so smooth and actually stay on!</li>
            <li>I really like this color palette.  </li>
            <li>it’s a very wearable every day palette</li>
            <li>I really like that this has both</li>
            <li>It seems reasonably priced for the quality.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this palette.</li>
            <li>The brush which is included in the kits helps (reasonable quality for the price ) and blended well into my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a nice set of basic neutral shades.</li>
            <li>It is a good everyday neutral palette for a natural look.</li>
            <li>It sure beats buying a bunch of little eye shadow duos and quads and hoping they are the right colors.  </li>
            <li>This is a quality eye shadow collection of subtle shades which will look natural and appealing on most, if not all, eye colors.  </li>
            <li>so enjoyed this range, that I purchased the other set of Nude from this company, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Why pay $$$$$ when L&#x27;Oreal gives you an item for a much lower price and has a high number of options?</li>
            <li>The brush that came with the set is a bit on the narrow side, so I used my own makeup brushes for most of it and used the narrow brush the set came with to apply a darker shade to the crease.</li>
            <li>I like most of the  colors in the kits and match well with my dark brown eye color.</li>
            <li>The matte colors make a great base and the shiny shades are a lovely add-on.</li>
            <li>* 10 highly pigmented shades curated to blend harmoniously</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>With the quality of the bush/applicator, that came with the set, was a little better.</li>
            <li>Get this one if you are really doing natural eye colors.</li>
            <li>Fun to play with the different layers of colors!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a week now and LOVE the two middle blending tones (third and fifth colors from the left) over anything I previously own (MUG and MAC).</li>
            <li>OVE the two middle blending tones (third and fifth colors from the left) over anything I previously own (MUG and MAC).</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to see the similarities of this palette and the Coastal Scents Revealed, Urban Decay Naked, and the Maybelline: The Nudes palettes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an economical find that is great for everyday looks and can be used to create a smokey eyes that&#x27;s subtle and sultry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New York</li>
            <li>The Urban Decay is priced at over $50 but has fantastic quality and lasting power.</li>
            <li>have only a couple of issues with this palette which I think are completely minor compared to how much I&#x27;ve used and enjoy this product so far in just a week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes from light colors (left), to mediums, to dark, back to light.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and long lasting!  </li>
            <li>If I can, I may also get the other palette later this year for more choices.</li>
            <li>The Maybelline Nudes is priced at under $10 and while it is a pretty palette, the pigmentation or lasting power is not there.</li>
            <li>These rich, warm, natural shades are all created to do what I believe makeup was invented to do -- enhance and sculpt the appearance without screaming out an artificial look.</li>
            <li>I still have sets of colors (which I purchased through Amazon), but I don&#x27;t have nearly the inventory I used to</li>
            <li>Generous amounts of shadow that so far haven&#x27;t creased up for me.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I applied it over dry eye lids.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a higher pigmentation to it, you may want to go with the Naked1 or Naked 2 from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>It is extremely powdery and the colors are pretty close to what you see.</li>
            <li>It goes on like dust and there is barely any color</li>
    </ol>

            <li> There is a nice range of dark and light colors and each go on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest getting it because it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, and you have to put so many coats on to be able to see it.</li>
            <li> shimmer is very wearable, catches and reflects a bit of light but doesn&#x27;t give a metallic effect)</li>
            <li> The price is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> The one I have most issue with is the light vanilla color on the very left.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be fun experimenting with these range of shades for daytime and nighttime wear.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe I would like it better, I feel like you can&#x27;t really see the eyeshadow as much when you put it on.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal is a nice palette, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Brushes are the most important part of the application process and eye shadow palettes rarely come with a decent enough brush.</li>
            <li> The shadow is soft and applies easily without a lot of fall out.</li>
            <li> if you have not tried sticking to the natural/nude shades, you have no idea how sophisticated and glam they can make you look by defining your eyes, keeping you very much on trend and most importantly not ageing you by dating your appearance!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I brought both palettes and they are gorgeous and all the colors work very well with each other.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love them.</li>
            <li> I love eyeshadow palettes and have several brown neutral palettes.</li>
            <li> I think it works for those who aren&#x27;t wanting to spend the money on higher end palettes that 3X the price.</li>
            <li> Not only is every single shade pretty in the case, they&#x27;re gorgeous on and I&#x27;d be really surprised to find someone who doesn&#x27;t look great in every single one.</li>
            <li> Since this is such a large set they should have included more brushes and blending pads.</li>
            <li> Usually, a palette is completely warm or neutral or cool.</li>
            <li> and I had more luck swiping it with my finger to blend (it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable, but didn&#x27;t blend as easily as the brand I usually use).  </li>
            <li> The colors are very neutral and go on so smooth and actually stay on!</li>
            <li> I really like this color palette.  </li>
            <li> it’s a very wearable every day palette</li>
            <li> I really like that this has both</li>
            <li> It seems reasonably priced for the quality.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this palette.</li>
            <li> The brush which is included in the kits helps (reasonable quality for the price ) and blended well into my skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a nice set of basic neutral shades.</li>
            <li> It is a good everyday neutral palette for a natural look.</li>
            <li> It sure beats buying a bunch of little eye shadow duos and quads and hoping they are the right colors.  </li>
            <li> This is a quality eye shadow collection of subtle shades which will look natural and appealing on most, if not all, eye colors.  </li>
            <li> so enjoyed this range, that I purchased the other set of Nude from this company, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why pay $$$$$ when L&#x27;Oreal gives you an item for a much lower price and has a high number of options?</li>
            <li> The brush that came with the set is a bit on the narrow side, so I used my own makeup brushes for most of it and used the narrow brush the set came with to apply a darker shade to the crease.</li>
            <li> I like most of the  colors in the kits and match well with my dark brown eye color.</li>
            <li> The matte colors make a great base and the shiny shades are a lovely add-on.</li>
            <li> * 10 highly pigmented shades curated to blend harmoniously</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> With the quality of the bush/applicator, that came with the set, was a little better.</li>
            <li> Get this one if you are really doing natural eye colors.</li>
            <li> Fun to play with the different layers of colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a week now and LOVE the two middle blending tones (third and fifth colors from the left) over anything I previously own (MUG and MAC).</li>

            <li> It is easy to see the similarities of this palette and the Coastal Scents Revealed, Urban Decay Naked, and the Maybelline: The Nudes palettes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an economical find that is great for everyday looks and can be used to create a smokey eyes that&#x27;s subtle and sultry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> New York</li>
            <li> The Urban Decay is priced at over $50 but has fantastic quality and lasting power.</li>
            <li> have only a couple of issues with this palette which I think are completely minor compared to how much I&#x27;ve used and enjoy this product so far in just a week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes from light colors (left), to mediums, to dark, back to light.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and long lasting!  </li>
            <li> If I can, I may also get the other palette later this year for more choices.</li>

            <li> These rich, warm, natural shades are all created to do what I believe makeup was invented to do -- enhance and sculpt the appearance without screaming out an artificial look.</li>
            <li> I still have sets of colors (which I purchased through Amazon), but I don&#x27;t have nearly the inventory I used to</li>
            <li> Generous amounts of shadow that so far haven&#x27;t creased up for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I applied it over dry eye lids.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a higher pigmentation to it, you may want to go with the Naked1 or Naked 2 from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> It is extremely powdery and the colors are pretty close to what you see.</li>
            <li> It goes on like dust and there is barely any color</li>
            <li> The color which I apply in the morning seems to last long in the day.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong, this palette is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> *  Eye-designer brush that is long with two tips: brush and sponge</li>
            <li> I always apply an eye base first to make my shadows glide on smoothly and stay on longer.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the long lasting type like some other eyeshadows I have.</li>
            <li> Wide mirror inside of the container helped a lot to use this palette in the car and in the hotel room.</li>
            <li> It has a sponge on one end and a brush at the other end.  </li>
            <li> I had some difficulty blending the colors, but that is probably due to the brush I was using</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed, and thought it would be way better.</li>
            <li> One end has a two-sided spongy applicator and the other end is a bristle tip.  </li>
            <li> so it may be a little bit of a hassle to carry around outside for someone like me who carries lots of stuff everyday.</li>
            <li> Palette is long and not so thin (0.5 inch deep)</li>
            <li> It lasted a few hours, but not much longer.</li>
            <li> The palette is missing a dark charcoal or black color in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred it to include a very dark color for those of us who use very dark shadows as eyeliner, to blend out eyeliner, or to set eyeliner.</li>

            <li> I use at least two and sometimes had a pop of color for a change.  </li>
            <li> you like to accent your eyes, but want the look to be subtle</li>
            <li> disappointed me, however, was that these are so low pigmented compared to the pricey ones.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this color palette.  I would have given it a 5 if it had more matte colors.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow goes on smooth and covers well.  I love all the colors. Lots of combinations. Some are shimmery and some are matte.  I really like having so many choices in one pallet.  It sure beats buying a bunch of little eye shadow duos and quads and hoping they are the right colors.  Usually I have 4 or 5 small ones with one or two colors empty and the others unused...this one is great!</li>
            <li> A good basic nude palette that will fit the bill for most of your needs, especially in regards to the cost but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a higher pigmentation to it, you may want to go with the Naked1 or Naked 2 from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> Great value for what you pay.  Fun to play with the different layers of colors!</li>
            <li> Perfect! I love it! Colors are perfectly balanced.</li>
            <li> I Love having a variety at my finger tips.  It is smooth going on and doesn&#x27;t easily brush off.  I love the fact that depending on my mood or my skin tone, I always have a neutral color available.</li>
            <li> Ok, because I am fair-medium skinned with light hair and blue-green eyes I thought that I might not like this one. Boy was I wrong, this palette is fantastic.  I wore it to church and choir practice and got several compliments.  The colors are very neutral and go on so smooth and actually stay on! I would use a primer for all day wear. However they stayed on all day even without one. Also, the colors did not irritate or make my eyes red (as an over 50 customer this is a big concern).  If you only get one palette a year like me - this is an excellent choice.  The price is so worth it.  If I can, I may also get the other palette later this year for more choices. The brush / sponge that comes with is also excellent.  It does have a bit of a stick when getting it open, but it also has a mirror on the inside. Get this one if you are really doing natural eye colors.</li>
            <li> can be a cosmetic fanatic, of sorts.  I remember buying all of the make-up kits at holiday time when I was younger.  I still have sets of colors (which I purchased through Amazon), but I don&#x27;t have nearly the inventory I used to have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal has a reputation for good, quality skin care, cosmetics and make-up.  They didn&#x27;t stop here.  This &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; has such a nice range of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; colors that I feel many women can find something for their skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found VERY interesting is that they include instruction ON the eye shadow.  It teaches what colors to use and where to put it.  The sponge, which I don&#x27;t always use, is multi-functional.  It has a sponge on one end and a brush at the other end.  Yes, there are many more colors than sponges (2) but the brush helps to take care of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and is easy to blend.  I&#x27;m a blue-eyes, dark-blonde haired women and I like neutral/brown colors.  I haven&#x27;t found I color I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why pay $$$$$ when L&#x27;Oreal gives you an item for a much lower price and has a high number of options?</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nude collection of shadows. The colors are beautiful and flattering and would work for most skin types. For my skin color (medium beige/NC 25 or NC 30) it’s a very wearable every day palette and I mostly wear it to work and on the weekends but can still create some smokier effects with the darker shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice combination of matte and shimmer shadows (NOTE: shimmer is very wearable, catches and reflects a bit of light but doesn&#x27;t give a metallic effect) that come in both warm and neutral-to-cooler tones which I find very versatile. Usually, a palette is completely warm or neutral or cool. I really like that this has both and this one palette does everything from highlighting, to medium blending, to shading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only a couple of issues with this palette which I think are completely minor compared to how much I&#x27;ve used and enjoy this product so far in just a week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The brush that comes with the palette is useless. I never bothered with it and threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;2. The shadows vary in pigmentation and texture. Most are very pigmented and go on beautifully, with a natural finish especially when used with eye shadow primer (I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance). The lighter shadows are powdery and not as pigmented. The one I have most issue with is the light vanilla color on the very left. It goes on like dust and there is barely any color payoff.&lt;br /&gt;3. The palette is missing a dark charcoal or black color in my opinion. It goes from light colors (left), to mediums, to dark, back to light. I would have preferred it to include a very dark color for those of us who use very dark shadows as eyeliner, to blend out eyeliner, or to set eyeliner. If you do this, you&#x27;re going to have to settle for the brown color or use a separate shadow for that. For me, lacking black/black-ish color makes the palette incomplete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall this is a very enjoyable palette that is easy to use and easy on the wallet. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a week now and LOVE the two middle blending tones (third and fifth colors from the left) over anything I previously own (MUG and MAC). At this price, I don&#x27;t mind tossing one into my gym bag for on the go.OVE the two middle blending tones (third and fifth colors from the left) over anything I previously own (MUG and MAC).

            <li> This is a quality eye shadow collection of subtle shades which will look natural and appealing on most, if not all, eye colors.  Features to appreciate about this collection by L&#x27;Oreal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 3 shadow finishes: shimmery satin, buttery matte, and sheens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 10 highly pigmented shades curated to blend harmoniously&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Eye-designer brush that is long with two tips: brush and sponge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sturdy case which should hold up well - the cheap ones fall apart in my make-up bag after some use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Mirror included for application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Illustrated directions on back on different looks for your eyes using this paletter: nude ombre, sultry angel, feline fancy and lady butterfly - it&#x27;s a kind of &amp;#34;pain by number&amp;#34; showing you how to achieve these looks in four steps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* More &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; available online so you can know how to apply shadow the way makeup artists know how&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to accent your eyes, but want the look to be subtle, you may wish to try this nude palette.  It seems reasonably priced for the quality.  It&#x27;s going to be fun experimenting with these range of shades for daytime and nighttime wear.  Am going to try &amp;#34;sultry angel&amp;#34; for my book group meeting today.  Will let you know how it works out.</li>
            <li> I got these beautiful nude colors last week and have been wearing them and having fun with them. Overall, I love them. The matte colors make a great base and the shiny shades are a lovely add-on. It&#x27;s perfect for daywear and it goes on smoothly. It is extremely powdery and the colors are pretty close to what you see. I do not use the brushes that come with it. Brushes are the most important part of the application process and eye shadow palettes rarely come with a decent enough brush. So if you have nice brushes to apply them, they are a beautiful set of colors, extremely practical and do very nicely even as eye liner if you have a thin lining brush that you mix in with some water. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I like this set. The powder goes on smooth and stays where you put it. It lasts several hours without creases. It blends well. It works using a brush or a pad. Since this is such a large set they should have included more brushes and blending pads.</li>
            <li> This set has a nice range of colors, and I am very happy with it since I prefer a natural look.  The colors are as they appear in the picture.  I had some difficulty blending the colors, but that is probably due to the brush I was using and I had more luck swiping it with my finger to blend (it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable, but didn&#x27;t blend as easily as the brand I usually use).  Overall, this is a nice set of basic neutral shades.</li>
            <li> Great color pallet!  Easy to use and long lasting!  With the quality of the bush/applicator, that came with the set, was a little better. Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Colour Riche La Palette (nude) contains a nice selection of neutral shades.  The eye shadows blend well, and stay on and in place.  There are helpful instructions on the underside of the compact showing how to create various looks.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I brought both palettes and they are gorgeous and all the colors work very well with each other. If your looking to have some a great variety that doesn&#x27;t cost much this is for you. The colors are well pigmented too :)</li>
            <li> I love nude palettes in my eyeshadow.  I use at least two and sometimes had a pop of color for a change.  This set has ten colors so there are a lot to choose from.  Included are both matte and shimmer colors, so again, a nice choice.  The shadow goes on well, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to give the coverage that I want, and it stays put for me, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so enjoyed this range, that I purchased the other set of Nude from this company, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the selection is excellent and the nudes are in every shade you need.  I wear light eye-shadow and find that if I apply these using the tips I know to make them hold that the colors stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**5/5 STARS:  Receiving this product through Amazon&#x27;s Vine Program did not influence my rating or review of this product.; all opinions are my own.**.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is great, moreso on the matte shades than the shimmer but all around a great deal. I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> This palette is a pretty close dup another famous maker&#x27;s palette that goes for a much more. I&#x27;ve used this palette a few times since I got it. The first time I used it, I applied it over dry eye lids. It lasted a few hours, but not much longer. The second time I used it I applied my Milani Eye Shadow Primer. That helped the shadow last until I took it off at bedtime. So eye shadow primer is a must with this product. The palette has a nice array of nude shades (for that no makeup look). I noticed that it starts on the warm side on one end, and starts on the cool side on the other end, so I used warm then cool on alternating days. The shadow is soft and applies easily without a lot of fall out. The brush that came with the set is a bit on the narrow side, so I used my own makeup brushes for most of it and used the narrow brush the set came with to apply a darker shade to the crease. Overall this is a very nice set and perfect for casual daytime makeup.</li>
            <li> With the popularity of nude palettes it was only a matter of time before a drug store brand jumped on the bandwagon and I&#x27;d dare say that L&#x27;Oreal has one of the prettiest. Not only is every single shade pretty in the case, they&#x27;re gorgeous on and I&#x27;d be really surprised to find someone who doesn&#x27;t look great in every single one. With 3 mattes and 7 shimmers it does lean on the sparkly side. If you&#x27;re looking for a versatile and affordable palette to explore the nude trend it&#x27;s an economical find that is great for everyday looks and can be used to create a smokey eyes that&#x27;s subtle and sultry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What disappointed me, however, was that these are so low pigmented compared to the pricey ones. Make sure you&#x27;ve got a great primer and I&#x27;d recommend a nice mixing medium (I found a great DIY recipe for mixing medium on Pinterest if you don&#x27;t want to pay the high prices) to make the colors more vivid. While I have palette&#x27;s that are about twice the cost of this one that I like better overall, this one has such excellent colors that I can&#x27;t not recommend it for my fellow nude enthusiasts.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I would like it better, I feel like you can&#x27;t really see the eyeshadow as much when you put it on. Doesn&#x27;t have the long lasting type like some other eyeshadows I have. Kinda disappointed, and thought it would be way better. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest getting it because it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, and you have to put so many coats on to be able to see it. (or maybe it just my skin type)</li>
            <li> I really do like this palette. I am fair skinned and can see how people of colour may take issue with the pigmentation of this palette but everything shows up on me since I am so fair. I use this palette almost every day for work. I do use the L&#x27;Oreal  Magic De-Crease Primer with this palette (and all eye shadows that I use). I find these colours easy to blend but they are a bit powdery, so you do need to tap off your brush before application or you will get some fall-out. I think I paid about $15 for this palette which I think is a good value for the amount of shadows that you get. It is a good everyday neutral palette for a natural look.</li>
            <li> Great natural palette for my fair and aging complextion. Not too glitter..just a touch of shimmer on a few</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;oreal Nude 01 is a brown neutral palette. I love eyeshadow palettes and have several brown neutral palettes. It is easy to see the similarities of this palette and the Coastal Scents Revealed, Urban Decay Naked, and the Maybelline: The Nudes palettes. There are definitely differences between the quality and the price between the palettes. The Urban Decay is priced at over $50 but has fantastic quality and lasting power. The Maybelline Nudes is priced at under $10 and while it is a pretty palette, the pigmentation or lasting power is not there. I find the most similarities between the L&#x27;oreal and the Coastal Scents Revealed since they both range around $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;oreal has 10 shades in satins, sheens, and mattes. The Coastal Scents has 20 different shades, all in satins, sheens, mattes as well. I like that there is not chunky glitter. All the eyeshadows are wearing shades for all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;oreal is a nice palette, especially for the price. I think it works for those who aren&#x27;t wanting to spend the money on higher end palettes that 3X the price. I also have the L&#x27;oreal Nude 02 palette which is a rosy-gold and plum palette. The colors are beautiful in that palette but I think the pigmentation and wear time is really better in this Nude 01 palette than the plum one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products mentioned:&lt;br /&gt;Urban Decay Naked 1&lt;br /&gt;Coastal Scents Revealed Eye-Shadow Palette, PL-036&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Colour Riche La Palette, Nude 02, 0.62 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline New York The Nudes Eyeshadow Palette 0.34 Ounce</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun with this palette! The colors are fantastic, and the double-ended brush is great - I don&#x27;t like sponge eye shadow tools, but this also comes with a brush end! I like that they&#x27;ve mixed matte and glossy so I can see what works for me! Generous amounts of shadow that so far haven&#x27;t creased up for me. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought! A lot of colors.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Colors are perfectly balanced.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Colour Riche La Palette, Nude. These rich, warm, natural shades are all created to do what I believe makeup was invented to do -- enhance and sculpt the appearance without screaming out an artificial look. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with highlighting with a bit of wild color now and then if you are so moved, but if you have not tried sticking to the natural/nude shades, you have no idea how sophisticated and glam they can make you look by defining your eyes, keeping you very much on trend and most importantly not ageing you by dating your appearance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how experienced you are with applying cosmetics, you will also benefit by the expert tips illustrated on the back of the package. I adore the numbers to help you create it all with ease. This is an easy, elegant palette to speed you through your eye makeup application every day for any occasion. Good color saturation and no flaking! These L&#x27;Oreal shadows were created to last. Love it, absolutely!!</li>
            <li> I love this palette. It is my first time to use this kind of variation of eye shadow, but as a beginner, it is really easy to use it. The brush which is included in the kits helps (reasonable quality for the price ) and blended well into my skin. I like most of the  colors in the kits and match well with my dark brown eye color. [Reviewer is Japanese.]  Every morning, I am excited to choose which combinations of color I apply ! The color which I apply in the morning seems to last long in the day. Palette is long and not so thin (0.5 inch deep) so it may be a little bit of a hassle to carry around outside for someone like me who carries lots of stuff everyday. I recently brought it on my trip to the beach. Wide mirror inside of the container helped a lot to use this palette in the car and in the hotel room.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal products and this eyeshadow set did not disappoint.  It contains ten colors and a dual tip applicator.  One end has a two-sided spongy applicator and the other end is a bristle tip.  There is a nice range of dark and light colors and each go on so smoothly.  I always apply an eye base first to make my shadows glide on smoothly and stay on longer.  On the bottom of the container are instructions for 4 different looks.  They are easy to follow.  If you take your makeup on the go, there is a mirror attached to the inside as well.  These colors are in shades of browns and nudes.  La Palette Nude 2 has the pinks and maroons.  I plan on getting those next.  I love them!</li>
