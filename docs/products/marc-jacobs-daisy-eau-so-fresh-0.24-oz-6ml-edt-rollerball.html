            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought perfume in YEARS, but one whiff of this had me angling for it for Mothers Day.  I got it and couldn&#x27;t love it more. This is a keeper!  I love the roller dispenser also...you can apply it in the right spots, and keep it from being overpowering that way. Well done Marc Jacobs!</li>
