            <li>My mom get a nice looking!</li>
            <li>It does take some fine tuning to perfect the application.</li>
            <li>For that you need a good moisturizer and line reducer.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been the best eye product that I have found yet, but sometimes I have to apply it 2 or 3 times to smooth my undereye area.</li>
            <li>well..... very pleased......</li>
            <li>I was excited because 100 ml for $35.00 is a very good deal.  </li>
            <li>Love the stuff!</li>
            <li>I love skincare products!</li>
            <li>I give it five stars for sure!</li>
            <li>So much better than surgery!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>but honestly it works beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But once it&#x27;s on right, boy does it look good!</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  Fabulous!!  </li>
            <li>This product is the most effective of all the products that claim to tighten the skin, specifically under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I recommend you play around with different layers of thickness to see what works best for your skin type.</li>
            <li>Its the best instant product I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>I found this is one of the many I have that works and delivers what it says.  </li>
            <li>Hope if I purchase it again I would get a better batch.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be SURE</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>BUY MORE</li>
            <li>ONE 1/2 OFF.OR BETTER</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love being able to take years off my face in under a minute, w/o going under a knife...</li>
            <li>This product is ok,  not as miraculous as it sounds</li>
            <li>My mom (74) always uses it sparingly and asks for more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>Love this and the face cream.</li>
            <li>but I am not going to buy Genie from this store any more either.  </li>
            <li>I say, I love the product, and I will use it</li>
            <li>After spending loads of money on many many products I am thinking there is really no \\&quot;fountain of youth\\&quot; and the best results I get are from cosmetic filler injections, just go easy on those.</li>
            <li>However, by far and away, I&#x27;ve had the best, most consistent results with the Genie line smoother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good value, as one bottle will last for months.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years,  I used to order from QVC, glad to see that it is available through Amazon as well,</li>
            <li>product was light and airy but most of all took care of the issue&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines disappeared and the results lasted all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, what works best is to first rub in a light layer of Nivea Facial Moisturizer for Men SPF 4,</li>
            <li>My problem area is with bags and it immediately tightens the skin and I look great and last all day or until I wash it off.</li>
            <li>a light layer all over face and neck.   </li>
            <li>YET BUY 2 GET 1 FREE.</li>
            <li>Fabulous</li>
            <li>I decided to look into it on Amazon to see what deals were available.  </li>
            <li>However, it is very easy to use too much Genie.</li>
            <li>First bought this on QVC many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Went to a wedding this w/e, and my smile lines are all smooth....</li>
            <li>product works well on puffiness under eyes and wrinkles and fine lines, but not so much on deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on fine lines.</li>
            <li>This product really does smooth out the lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing; even when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, it hides the bags and circles.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price if you can not afford the surgery of $6-7,000.00.</li>
            <li>He is always up on the latest products and beauty techniques that keep one looking young.</li>
            <li>Better than any product I have used thus far.  </li>
            <li>but it was fun to try.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>To put it on \\&quot;wet\\&quot; as the instructions tell you to you have to use a good bit so the bottle sure won&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>or it goes away right after you put the sunscreen on.   </li>
            <li>I have used Genie for several years and just love it.  </li>
            <li>, it does exactly as it says.  </li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>I have used Genie instant line smoother for many years.  </li>
            <li>He bought his bottle at a demo in Costco but after many trips back they no longer had it in  stock...</li>
            <li>it goes to show that marketing can make beef wellington out of a hot dog.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything i have tried,  but I do wish the white residue was easier to avoid.</li>
            <li>First bought years ago on TV AD.</li>
            <li>I love Genie instant line smoother.  </li>
            <li>It really tightens the skin, bags and wrinkles around my eyes - very noticably!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>You are ready to go out and enjoy looking younger!</li>
            <li>I am going to be very cautious about purchasing online.</li>
            <li>If I have a bit much on and it looks flakey, I just put a bit of moisturizer on and it takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li>A very vain and picky friend told me about this product.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really feel I was \\&quot;bait and switched.\\</li>
            <li>and it really improves my look immediately</li>
            <li>I am quoting this from the email sent to me by Amazon regarding this particular item.</li>
            <li>i am more than middle age , and just used this product again for the third time...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>a cheap chemical laden product made in a foreign country and way overpriced.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels very natural after it drys......</li>
            <li>The only positive I have to say is</li>
            <li>Otherwise I&#x27;ll just wait for it to dry naturally on its own in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well on the under eye area, both for bags and the area that gets sunken when I am tired.</li>
            <li>May very with different skin types</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old, almost 41</li>
            <li>and I just got tagged 24 years old by a 26 year old.</li>
            <li>Be carefull not to use to much or it will turn white when it dries.  </li>
            <li>However, it hasn&#x27;t really worked on my skin, the wrinkles seem just as deep as ever.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, it leaves a white residue and will crack.  </li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and all my friends keep saying how young I look.</li>
            <li>(BTW I am over 60+ years old</li>
            <li>As I have dry skin, I first apply a little eye gel, wait until absorbed then a drop of Genie which I pat gently onto the skin.</li>
            <li>Visibly reduces the appearance of small and fine lines.</li>
            <li>essentially, I paid about $6.00 more for the same amount of product I always get for less elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has been a major boost for me, taking away 10 years.</li>
            <li>This product does not really work really.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to put too much on</li>
            <li>I saw this page, offering the following deal, which is what I ordered (the notation below is copied and pasted directly from that page):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a little expermintation to get just the right amount, but when you do it smoothes out the lines and wrinkles and  your face look much younger.</li>
            <li>If you should put a little too much on ...</li>

            <li> If you should put a little too much on ...</li>
            <li> If it was applied too thickly (tightens up too much), I find that applying a very small light tab of water on a cue-tip or edge of wash cloth on the problem areas can fix it.</li>
            <li> wait a few minutes to dry, and then smooth (couple times back and forth for an even layer) a half a dime size drop of the Genie under each eye.</li>
            <li> Depending on how puffy or sunken, I might apply a little more if the effect is not good enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it with moisturizer applied first, then letting that soak in for at least 5 minutes, then applying Genie, and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> If you put a little bit on, it doesn&#x27;t do anything; if you put enough on, it leaves white paste on your face and the result goes away anyway shortly</li>
            <li> I wonder how long the product was sitting in the warehouse?</li>
            <li> It does give your face a smoother look but not for that long of a time, I think it tightens up with this film that dries</li>
            <li> In that case I apply just enough eye gel to moisten any white residue or to loosen up if the skin is too tight.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> 2.Let dry.  </li>
            <li> a layer on any wrinkled area and let dry.   </li>
            <li> This is quite dry and if you forget you have it on, it will flake off when you touch it.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much it gets white and pasty and unfortunately it does not last all day.  </li>
            <li> I have often been disappointed by product claims, but once you get the application right,  this one really works</li>
            <li> so only need a little mascara and blusher</li>
            <li> I have little hereditary bags under my eyes and this product totally removes them.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but my product shipped as I&#x27;d expected....</li>
            <li> You have to be careful though.  </li>
            <li> This product does NOT work, it is a total waste of my money and it smells like you don&#x27;t even want to know what....</li>
            <li> because I use a couple of other products as well, but it seems to help when applied under makeup.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> When applied correctly (and this can take some practice), it truly makes your under eye bags/circles disappear, at least for several hours.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Their return customer service was horrible: the supervisor tried to intimidate me first by saying the item is not refundable, then he was trying to say that something was wrong with me because it is a popular product....</li>
            <li> even with shipping it was less expensive!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once you start moving your face, talking , expressions, etc , that just loosens that tight film up</li>
            <li> It took a little bit of getting used of .....</li>
            <li> a little moisturizer&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my skin needs a little help)</li>
            <li> Though sometimes it doesn&#x27;t help and I just end up washing it all off and starting over which can get frustrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> It should take 2 or 3 minutes to firm and produce a noticeable tightening of the under eye area.</li>
            <li> and I sometimes reapply later if I look tired.</li>
            <li> Another waste of money on a beauty product that does not do what it claims</li>
            <li> well, as usual I checked out Amazon and found it for a price less than he had paid...</li>
            <li> Area applied to felt stiff</li>
            <li> a little watery than usual</li>
            <li> It seems expensive, but you only need a little amount.  </li>
            <li> you are not completely satisfied with the products you buy from us, email or call to arrange a replacement or refund..\\&quot;</li>
            <li> LONG AS ADVERTIZED RATHER EXPENSIVE FOR THE AMOUNT THAT&#x27;S IN THE SMALL BOTTLE.I&#x27;D</li>
            <li> Just remember a little bit goes along way!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a negative about shipping</li>
            <li> And if you put it on too thick the product dries lighter colored and patchy.</li>
            <li> the product and was sold in mere minutes.</li>

            <li> I encourage every woman out there to give it a try - you will not be disappointed, I promise.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product....  It took a little bit of getting used of ..... but honestly it works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;It feels very natural after it drys...... and it lasts all day..... If you should put a little too much on ... a little moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;works well..... very pleased......</li>
            <li> Works great, wouldn&#x27;t be without it.......</li>
            <li> I have literally tried over a dozen different skin care products that claim to instantly reduce the appearance of under eye bags and circles, as well as unconventional methods such as Pantene Pro-V with Shark Oil (supposedly what models used to use back in the day), chilled tea bags, cucumbers, and even facial exercises! However, by far and away, I&#x27;ve had the best, most consistent results with the Genie line smoother. When applied correctly (and this can take some practice), it truly makes your under eye bags/circles disappear, at least for several hours. I recommend you play around with different layers of thickness to see what works best for your skin type. I also recommend you try it with and without a moisturizer on underneath as from what I&#x27;ve read, everyone has different results (depending on skin type I guess). For me, what works best is to first rub in a light layer of Nivea Facial Moisturizer for Men SPF 4, wait a few minutes to dry, and then smooth (couple times back and forth for an even layer) a half a dime size drop of the Genie under each eye. If I&#x27;m in a rush I&#x27;ll fan my eyes for 30 seconds or so until it dries. Otherwise I&#x27;ll just wait for it to dry naturally on its own in a few minutes. If it was applied too thickly (tightens up too much), I find that applying a very small light tab of water on a cue-tip or edge of wash cloth on the problem areas can fix it. Though sometimes it doesn&#x27;t help and I just end up washing it all off and starting over which can get frustrating. But once it&#x27;s on right, boy does it look good! Hope this helps and best of luck to you.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> This product does not really work really. If you put a little bit on, it doesn&#x27;t do anything; if you put enough on, it leaves white paste on your face and the result goes away anyway shortly or it goes away right after you put the sunscreen on.   Their return customer service was horrible: the supervisor tried to intimidate me first by saying the item is not refundable, then he was trying to say that something was wrong with me because it is a popular product....this is in contradiction with \\&quot;If you are not completely satisfied with the products you buy from us, email or call to arrange a replacement or refund..\\&quot; I am quoting this from the email sent to me by Amazon regarding this particular item. I am going to be very cautious about purchasing online.</li>
            <li> does what it says it will do - I use it under my eyes every day...nobody knows the puffiness and bags I have...</li>
            <li> I have used Genie for several years and just love it.  Its the best instant product I&#x27;ve found, it does exactly as it says.  My problem area is with bags and it immediately tightens the skin and I look great and last all day or until I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Area applied to felt stiff</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time. I use this product under my eyes. I follow the directions and it works every time. If I have a bit much on and it looks flakey, I just put a bit of moisturizer on and it takes care of the problem. Just remember a little bit goes along way!!</li>
            <li> Love the stuff! Won&#x27;t go out of the house without it! Just be careful not to put too much on or you&#x27;ll have white around the eyes..</li>
            <li> This product works for me. May very with different skin types but I&#x27;m sold on it. Have been using it for several years. No problem ordering it through Amazon. Timely delivery.</li>
            <li> my order has not come yet for 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to complain .&lt;br /&gt;Let me know why the product doesn&#x27;t come once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  It really tightens the skin, bags and wrinkles around my eyes - very noticably!  Although it is temporary, it lasts all day on the skin until I wash it off at night.  The results are immediate.  It&#x27;s a very good value, as one bottle will last for months.</li>
            <li> At 52, my biggest age give away is bags under the eyes. This product has been a major boost for me, taking away 10 years. Really! I have often been disappointed by product claims, but once you get the application right,  this one really works and I wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it. I stock up on it whenever I can.</li>
            <li> I love skincare products! I am 40 years old, almost 41 and I just got tagged 24 years old by a 26 year old. I found this is one of the many I have that works and delivers what it says.  How I use it:  1.Put a light layer all over face and neck.   2.Let dry.  3.Apply foundation.  4.Put a layer on any wrinkled area and let dry.   5. You are ready to go out and enjoy looking younger!</li>
            <li> This product does an excellent job a reducing the appearance of lines and tightening skin.  Remember it&#x27;s just a short term fix and doesn&#x27;t actually solve the problem.  For that you need a good moisturizer and line reducer.  I like to use this on my eye lids under shadows.  It reduces puffiness and helps keep your shadow in place.</li>
            <li> a little watery than usual I wonder how long the product was sitting in the warehouse? Hope if I purchase it again I would get a better batch.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that does what it says.  Be carefull not to use to much or it will turn white when it dries.  It takes a little expermintation to get just the right amount, but when you do it smoothes out the lines and wrinkles and  your face look much younger.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be SURE it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;perfect cure&amp;#34; for wrinkles, etc. because I use a couple of other products as well, but it seems to help when applied under makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Visibly reduces the appearance of small and fine lines. I use it with or with out make-up.  I use it all over my face including around the eyes.  I have been using it for years,  I used to order from QVC, glad to see that it is available through Amazon as well,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a tightening gel. However, it hasn&#x27;t really worked on my skin, the wrinkles seem just as deep as ever. And if you put it on too thick the product dries lighter colored and patchy.</li>
            <li> product works well on puffiness under eyes and wrinkles and fine lines, but not so much on deeper wrinkles.  I wanted to use it for deep set wrinkles around my mouth.  If you use too much, it leaves a white residue and will crack.  Other than that, it works well!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT BUT DOESN&#x27;T LAST AS LONG AS ADVERTIZED RATHER EXPENSIVE FOR THE AMOUNT THAT&#x27;S IN THE SMALL BOTTLE.I&#x27;D BUY MORE IF THE PRICE WAS LOWER,LIKE BUY ONE AND GET 2ND ONE 1/2 OFF.OR BETTER YET BUY 2 GET 1 FREE.</li>
            <li> First bought this on QVC many years ago.  Excellent</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Use it sparingly and it will do wonders for you. I give it five stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I have tried this once and never stopped buying it. This product really does smooth out the lines and wrinkles. I am 62 years old and all my friends keep saying how young I look. I encourage every woman out there to give it a try - you will not be disappointed, I promise.</li>
            <li> Great product for those women who have bags under the eyes as I do. It seems expensive, but you only need a little amount.  It is worth the price if you can not afford the surgery of $6-7,000.00.</li>
            <li> This is quite dry and if you forget you have it on, it will flake off when you touch it.  AND I could still see the lines.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> i am more than middle age , and just used this product again for the third time...Went to a wedding this w/e, and my smile lines are all smooth....i cannot believe how great the pictures look...love being able to take years off my face in under a minute, w/o going under a knife...</li>
            <li> I use it solely for bags under my eyes.  Great product.  Lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> My mom get a nice looking!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years. It works well if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I use nothing but, its great.  I have used Genie instant line smoother for many years.  I have tried others and ALWAYS come back to Genie.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been the best eye product that I have found yet, but sometimes I have to apply it 2 or 3 times to smooth my undereye area.</li>
            <li> A very vain and picky friend told me about this product. He is always up on the latest products and beauty techniques that keep one looking young. He bought his bottle at a demo in Costco but after many trips back they no longer had it in  stock...well, as usual I checked out Amazon and found it for a price less than he had paid...even with shipping it was less expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the product and was sold in mere minutes. Fine lines disappeared and the results lasted all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a negative about shipping but my product shipped as I&#x27;d expected....I never want to go without a bottle of this great product...I am at the point of using only this as I have permanent makeup (eyeliner and lips) so only need a little mascara and blusher (BTW I am over 60+ years old so my skin needs a little help)</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work AT ALL!</li>
            <li> a cheap chemical laden product made in a foreign country and way overpriced. a bunch of hoopla over a marginal product. it goes to show that marketing can make beef wellington out of a hot dog.</li>
            <li> Love his stuff!! Need to reorder....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and can&#x27;t live without it.  I have little hereditary bags under my eyes and this product totally removes them.  I never leave the house without it on.  So much better than surgery!</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  Fabulous!!  Fabulous!!!  Better than any product I have used thus far.  Lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I really like it.  It works great for under your eyes for puffiness and line smoothing.  You have to be careful though.  If you use too much it gets white and pasty and unfortunately it does not last all day.  When applied correctly, it works!</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work, it is a total waste of my money and it smells like you don&#x27;t even want to know what.... Don&#x27;t order this - it is a loser!</li>
            <li> I NEVER leave the house without Genie!  It&#x27;s amazing; even when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, it hides the bags and circles. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> This product is ok,  not as miraculous as it sounds but it was fun to try.  I just don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.  To put it on \\&quot;wet\\&quot; as the instructions tell you to you have to use a good bit so the bottle sure won&#x27;t last long.  It does give your face a smoother look but not for that long of a time, I think it tightens up with this film that dries but once you start moving your face, talking , expressions, etc , that just loosens that tight film up and you are back to square one.  After spending loads of money on many many products I am thinking there is really no \\&quot;fountain of youth\\&quot; and the best results I get are from cosmetic filler injections, just go easy on those.</li>
            <li> Works very well on fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have used this product every day for 10 years and I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. It works amazingly well on the under eye area, both for bags and the area that gets sunken when I am tired. It does take some fine tuning to perfect the application.As I have dry skin, I first apply a little eye gel, wait until absorbed then a drop of Genie which I pat gently onto the skin. It should take 2 or 3 minutes to firm and produce a noticeable tightening of the under eye area. Depending on how puffy or sunken, I might apply a little more if the effect is not good enough. However, it is very easy to use too much Genie. In that case I apply just enough eye gel to moisten any white residue or to loosen up if the skin is too tight. It lasts through the day and I sometimes reapply later if I look tired. This product is the most effective of all the products that claim to tighten the skin, specifically under the eyes. I do not use it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It always works, that&#x27;s why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> My mom (74) always uses it sparingly and asks for more when it runs out. I (42) have used it and like the results.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of those wrinkles or bags under your eyes, you&#x27;ve got to try this stuff. This stuff is amazing. And it lasts all day ! You can definitely see the difference. Wish I had a picture to show you.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything i have tried,  but I do wish the white residue was easier to avoid.</li>
            <li> Another waste of money on a beauty product that does not do what it claims</li>
            <li> I chose this because of a wrinkle I have in my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was light and airy but most of all took care of the issue&lt;br /&gt;although temporary as stated it worked as it said it would&lt;br /&gt;and I was as satified as I could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:O)</li>
            <li> Love this and the face cream. First bought years ago on TV AD. only facial products I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> It is a miracle worker - lines just disappear!  You wont be sorry!  A must have for hiding lines.  Fabulous</li>
            <li> I love Genie instant line smoother.  I&#x27;ve been buying it from QVC for years.  I decided to look into it on Amazon to see what deals were available.  I saw this page, offering the following deal, which is what I ordered (the notation below is copied and pasted directly from that page):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Genie Instant Line Smoother by Genie Beauty Products&lt;br /&gt;$35.00 ($184.21/100 ml) (48 reviews)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With $7.95 s/h, I paid $42.95.  I was excited because 100 ml for $35.00 is a very good deal.  I took the bait and ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I received today:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A .63 oz./19 ml bottle, which is the very SAME size bottle as I have been buying from QVC for years which sells there for $29.94 plus $4.97 s/h plus tax, for a total of $37.00 even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So essentially, I paid about $6.00 more for the same amount of product I always get for less elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to return it over $6.00 but I am not going to buy Genie from this store any more either.  The only positive I have to say is, I received it very quickly.  It was shipped on a Friday and I had it on Monday.  Of course, for $7.95, it should come quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I say, I love the product, and I will use it but I am going back to QVC for future shipments.  I really feel I was \\&quot;bait and switched.\\&quot; I would not have ordered the 19 ml bottle here for $35.00.</li>
            <li> It works, but leaves a white residue when it dries.  I&#x27;ve tried it with moisturizer applied first, then letting that soak in for at least 5 minutes, then applying Genie, and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I use this when I&#x27;m not applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and have used it for a long time.  I am 70 and I use it under my eyes  and it really improves my look immediately and you can use it whenever you need a &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it works!!</li>
