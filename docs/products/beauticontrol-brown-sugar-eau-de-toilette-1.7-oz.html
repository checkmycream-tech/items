            <li> best Ever.  I get so many people telling me how good I smell and what am I wearing and where can I get it.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.  this is the only scent I wear.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents in an Eau De Toilette.  Receive compliments often</li>
            <li> This fragrance has never disappointed me and remains my favorite.  I just wish they&#x27;d make it in a larger size.  As long as they make it I will purchase it.  I thought I&#x27;d try something different, but nothing compares to Brown sugar.</li>
            <li> This is OK, but not like I remember it.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed this or what, but not like I remembered it smelling.  Will not purchase again.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume on a friend, and I couldn&#x27;t get over it!!! I asked her the name to it, and she said it was Brown Sugar. I had to order it!!! Smells GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> This item seemed to lack the lingering fragrance that i have always experienced.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if there has been a re-formulation or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May try it again at another time</li>
            <li> i get so many compliments, but refuse to tell my secret :) i love this perfume. getting more soon yes</li>
