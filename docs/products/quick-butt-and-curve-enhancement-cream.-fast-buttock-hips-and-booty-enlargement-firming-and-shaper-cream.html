            <li>So I was sure she didnt need this.</li>
            <li>When people leave feedback beware of the ones that are a whole paragraph, they are paid to write a great review.  </li>

            <li>I would have bought more.</li>
            <li>I may have to reorder and use more for better results</li>
            <li>My SECRECT is SAFE and SOUND.</li>

            <li>but overall it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Monitor your but with quick butt cream</li>
            <li>And it makes your skin soft! :)</li>
            <li>This is great product I&#x27;ve had it less than 3 weeks been using it twice a day along with exercising and eating right of course</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good to eat protein and drink water to get better results and at least work out 30 mins</li>
            <li>kinda worth the money.</li>
            <li>the only good thing about this cream is the smell, it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I barely write reviews and I&#x27;m not a paid customer righting this to be honest this actually works not gradually</li>
            <li>Great product i hav a flat butt diffenately saw improvment in the first week or two made my butt more round</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not like more womanly</li>

            <li>But after using it for a few days, I&#x27;m seeing more tone and definition in the buttocks region.</li>
            <li>Being that I already have a nice rear-end and wanted to enhance it a little, I have been using the cream as directed faithfully for the last two weeks.</li>
            <li>The new product had no effect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products in the past &amp; threw them all out.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting magical overnight unbelievable results, but continuing with my exercise &amp; the help of this cream, I&#x27;m seeing what I like and ecstatic of the results.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>

            <li> The lotion worked really well at making the skin smooth, which isn&#x27;t bad, but for the money I paid for it I could have bought ten times as much in a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> And they made me very hungry...and that&#x27;s not sexy.</li>
            <li> Big pink strawberry pills, seems like it reversed the results of the former product.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I was looking for a product that would enhance (tone/firm, however you want to call it)</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> no results whatsoever , no clear instructions , no time expectations etc.</li>
            <li> Really wanted this to work, but alas no such luck.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion because I was feeling down about my body image (had my son a while back</li>
            <li> When I came across this cream, I was skeptical at first, but then thought to give it a try anyways.</li>
            <li> BUT EVIDENTLY I WAS  WRONG...</li>
            <li> but my butt is slowly getting bigger</li>
            <li> Saw results in less than a week.</li>
            <li> and i see a little results cant wait to try it longer</li>
            <li> I wish I could find an everyday body lotion that smells like that!</li>
            <li> My butt has thicken up a lot in the past two weeks.  </li>
            <li> There was no growth and much disappointment to be had.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I ordered this because i had bought something just like this</li>
            <li> I am the one that will give a BAD REVIEW if the product didnt work</li>
            <li> Greatly disappointed.</li>

            <li> My wife feels like it added to her curves in a good way and as  a man I learned not to argue with her...LOL</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Love it!!! I&#x27;ve tried many products in the past &amp; threw them all out. When I came across this cream, I was skeptical at first, but then thought to give it a try anyways. I was pleasantly surprised. For a long time, I was looking for a product that would enhance (tone/firm, however you want to call it) the buttocks area, to give the extra \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;. I wasn&#x27;t expecting magical overnight unbelievable results, but continuing with my exercise &amp; the help of this cream, I&#x27;m seeing what I like and ecstatic of the results. Will definitely buy again!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Use this product for 3week it only made my butt smooth it didnt do anything  it says about the produc</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I ordered this because i had bought something just like this and it didn&#x27;t work. But this stuff is amazing to use it takes a while but you&#x27;ll start to notice how great your back side looks and the confidence you&#x27;ll have when you wear jeans or even shorts. So glad i bought this product.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using the BNB products and love them so far!!! I can feel my booty tingling after I use the cream and it smells soooooo amazing!!! I wish I could find an everyday body lotion that smells like that! And it makes your skin soft! :)</li>
            <li> Ok so I barely write reviews and I&#x27;m not a paid customer righting this to be honest this actually works not gradually but my butt is slowly getting bigger I&#x27;m planing on ordering this again and Honestly I have a butt , but it&#x27;s not like more womanly and I&#x27;m 18 but to enchance more I think it&#x27;s good to eat protein and drink water to get better results and at least work out 30 mins but overall it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST BOUT THIS ITEM..I THOUGHT THAT I WAS ABOUT TO GET A DEAL OF A LIFETIME....BUT EVIDENTLY I WAS  WRONG...SO LISTEN UP TO THE ONES THAT MAY BE FOOLED BY THE ADVERTISEMENT (LIKE I)...SAVE YOUR MONEY ON ANOTHER PRODUCT PLEASE...CAUSE THEY LIED BIG TIME...#JUSTSAYING</li>
            <li> Just started using the product about two weeks ago, haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet but I hope to see some results in about a month.</li>
            <li> This is great product I&#x27;ve had it less than 3 weeks been using it twice a day along with exercising and eating right of course and I have gained an inch so far YAY ME!! I don&#x27;t believe it will work without hitting some squats you have to work with it just my oppinion</li>
            <li> I used the cream for 50 days twice a day and i just wanted to say i didnt even increase in jean size it does not work like their saying it made my but a lil smaller i want my money back</li>
            <li> This thing is wasting of money..i use it for a month now and no change..its not working at all</li>
            <li> Great product when combined with any enhancement pills. Saw results in less than a week. Try it out.</li>
            <li> For me, I would have to honestly say that I like this cream way better than the pills. I tried the BNB pills too and they made me gain weight EVERYWHERE!!! It made chest bigger, arms bigger, and especially the belly...YUCK. And they made me very hungry...and that&#x27;s not sexy. Even my workout routine couldn&#x27;t handle the weight gain the pills did. But this cream has a very pleasent smell and I noticed a difference within about 2 weeks. You should try it for yourself. The pills didn&#x27;t work for me, but this cream did.</li>
            <li> Great product i hav a flat butt diffenately saw improvment in the first week or two made my butt more round and it stuck out more lotion expensive butt kinda worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had to come and give a feedback on this product.  When I first order it, I was skeptical thinking that \\&quot;Yea right, a bigger booty by rubbing cream on your buttock. Oh well, I&#x27;ll give it a try. Being that I already have a nice rear-end and wanted to enhance it a little, I have been using the cream as directed faithfully for the last two weeks. I MUST SAY!!!! I AM IMPRESSED!!!! My butt has thicken up a lot in the past two weeks.  For you WOMEN out there that want a nice rear-end or want to enhance what you already got...THIS IS THE PRODUCT.  I am the one that will give a BAD REVIEW if the product didnt work but this IS A MUST.  Even my finance&#x27; have notice the difference and swear he is the one that is doing it.  SIKE!!! but I let him think that.  My SECRECT is SAFE and SOUND. If you looking for that UMPH or more JUNK IN THE TRUNK.... THIS IS IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> no results whatsoever , no clear instructions , no time expectations etc. My girlfriend is been applying the cream with no results</li>
            <li> Have not see any changes yet!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any result so far using the cream. The new product had no effect. Big pink strawberry pills, seems like it reversed the results of the former product. I bought two 60 count bottles. Greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> i been using it for about a week now and i see a little results cant wait to try it longer thanks</li>
            <li> Just like the song, this is a curve and edge enhancement. Now, needless to say, my significant other is quite stunning and beautiful (and I promise, that is an unbiased statement). So I was sure she didnt need this. But after using it for a few days, I&#x27;m seeing more tone and definition in the buttocks region.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s not working and it&#x27;s been a week. Hopefully it starts working. I am looking forward to my results! (:</li>
            <li> the only good thing about this cream is the smell, it did absolutely nothing.  I am disappointed.  A complete waste of money.  When people leave feedback beware of the ones that are a whole paragraph, they are paid to write a great review.  yOU&#x27;RE BEING DUPED!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really wanted this to work, but alas no such luck. I got this lotion because I was feeling down about my body image (had my son a while back and my chest area has not been the same since). The lotion worked really well at making the skin smooth, which isn&#x27;t bad, but for the money I paid for it I could have bought ten times as much in a regular lotion. There was no growth and much disappointment to be had. Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money but maybe I&#x27;m just one of those people that this product does not work on.</li>
            <li> I love this product whish I would have bought more. Already working.  Monitor your but with quick butt cream really works(: and exercise nothing comes with out help</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve only used it for one month but dont see any difference. I may have to reorder and use more for better results</li>
