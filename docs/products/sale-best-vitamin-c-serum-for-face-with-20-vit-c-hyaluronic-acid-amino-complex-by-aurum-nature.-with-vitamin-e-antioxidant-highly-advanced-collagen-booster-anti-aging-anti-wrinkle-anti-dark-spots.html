            <li>This is a great product.</li>

            <li>Great stuff and a good price for the quality of it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>I have felt increased moisture in my face, and my skin feels good after application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried another brand, but this one is superior.</li>
            <li>wonderful to find a product made in the USA in a FDA and GMP certified facility that is anti-aging, anti-wrinkle and paraben free.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that it foams up when it comes out and the smell isn&#x27;t appealing to me, but it does work wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that the discoloration on her legs improved!  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Love Vitamin C, no matter who the manufacturer is!  </li>
            <li>So many things to talk about!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I feel this is truly an honest product for a great price that is well worth trying.</li>
            <li>At 63 years of age, having a youthful skin is very important.</li>
            <li>I have ordered two more because of that effect.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will eliminate lines or sun spots, but I think it&#x27;s helping to prevent more from appearing.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best item to put on your face especially at night before retiring.  </li>
            <li>It softened and brightened my skin, and think that it would show more results with more time.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.  </li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after using this.  </li>
            <li>I have used many anti aging serums.  </li>
            <li>Most are greasy.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it has made my complexion better and</li>
            <li>I love the pump bottle.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have spots or discolorations on my face, so use Vitamin c serum mostly for fine lines and prevention.  </li>
            <li>The serum is silky smooth when applying and feels soothing and refreshing when I apply it on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>It was great on our faces after long days in the drying heat and sun and worked as such a great refresher after our sunburns!</li>
            <li>It noticeably reduced fine lines.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work just fine</li>
            <li>I will be emailing the product owner to see if I can add a drop or two of essential oil to it for a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and not sticky</li>
            <li>Again, so far, so good.</li>
            <li>It feels light, and silky against the skin, and dries quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product</li>
            <li>really do recommend the Aurum Nature brand; contains no alcohol or parabens, and it is Made in the USA, and comes in a very nice, quality, pump action bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am seeing good results, only using it for couple of weeks</li>
            <li>This one is a thick gel formula which is wonderful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got some sort of citric/vinegar sort of smell, but it&#x27;s not really bad.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast but could be packaged better.</li>
            <li>My skin is more smooth, bright and full of moisture, and many imperfections such as age spots, wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>This one goes away quickly therefore</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin</li>
            <li>It goes on easily &amp; is absorbed fairly quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Very sensitive skin and many skin care products cause redness to my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my face super soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>shop bought products before, but this serum works as well as the cosmetic counter ones and additionally absorbs far more quickly, has nicer texture and makes my skin</li>
            <li>It feels very light and soft on my skin even before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>With one pump, I am able to out a light layer on my face, throat and neck, and with whatever is left on my hands, I rub onto the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Actually, I found it to be quite effective.  </li>
            <li>It dispenses just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I especially like that this is a natural, healthy, and safe product to use.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, is not sticky when dry, absorbs quickly, smells great, and my skin looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li>After 2-3 weeks of daily use I noticed difference in my skin, although I bought it to reduce the appearance of some light brown spots on my forehead, which are still there, I noticed that fine lines  around my eyes dissapeared and overall my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to seeing the results after continuing to use it since I have seen a difference so soon!</li>
            <li>I love it and would have given a five star if I thought it had actual correcting benefits</li>
            <li>My face was a bit sensative at first</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any weathering or wear on my face the whole time!</li>
            <li>The gel glides smoothly on my skin, leaving a natural non-greasy, satin finish look.</li>
            <li>First of all, this one has a pump dispenser which is easier to use.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a week, but will update after more use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a change for the better.  </li>
            <li>(Why do I do these things ;)</li>
            <li>Really like this vitamin c serum I have been using it on a scar I have for about a week and noticed it has softened it up some!</li>
            <li>This is not the first facial serum I have tried, but the first with a pump action top, which makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li>Very impressive; I have used similar (far more expensive)</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed some brightening, and a lessened appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a week and have really noticed that the tone of my skin seems to be evening out a lot</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need so much coverage.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit unusual, but tends to fade with time.  </li>
            <li>This Serum was not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>I really feel like it&#x27;s making a difference in my complexion and skin health.  </li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this product because it is made in the USA, and it is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>My skin really has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy&lt;</li>
            <li>So far I am enjoying using it, the thing that is different is it come out emulsified.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is small and compact and easy to fit in your makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I love how it smoothes the little lines around my mouth</li>
            <li>It smells great and does not leave any weird stickiness or residue.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum comes in a bottle that uses a pump to dispense which is so much better than using a messy dropper.  </li>
            <li>This Aurum Nature serum has 20% Vitamin C which some may think it too high if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>There is a very slight scent, but it&#x27;s pretty mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 59 yrs old -</li>
            <li>Like the natural look.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am a fan.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a Vitamin C Serum as when you apply it, it is very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this serum to anyone looking for a Vitamin C serum that wants instant results.</li>
            <li>I like the pump action style Bottle.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t bother my semi sensitive skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I use fit under my night cream and by the time I lay down, it&#x27;s absorbed so it doesn&#x27;t even mess up my sheets.</li>
            <li>my skin is not as dry and it looks so much brighter!</li>
            <li>In fact, despite the brutal heat and sun, My face looks better and more vibrant now!</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have one of those fake &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; smells that a lot of facial products do, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing since perfumes can sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I will mostly likely buy more -- but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Just one pump releases the right amount of serum you need to apply on your face without any mess and residues.  </li>
            <li>I also like that the pump action distributes exactly enough for one application.</li>
            <li>To try this out, I tried this on one dry, wrinkled area and didn&#x27;t do the other one right away.  </li>

            <li> Just one pump releases the right amount of serum you need to apply on your face without any mess and residues.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the pump action distributes exactly enough for one application.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for about a week and have really noticed that the tone of my skin seems to be evening out a lot and it seems softer.  It&#x27;s got some sort of citric/vinegar sort of smell, but it&#x27;s not really bad.  I hate the smell of vinegar and it isn&#x27;t strong enough to bother me.  It just doesn&#x27;t have one of those fake &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; smells that a lot of facial products do, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing since perfumes can sensitive skin.  I am really looking forward to seeing the results after continuing to use it since I have seen a difference so soon!</li>
            <li> Works well.  My skin is softer and my pores are tighter.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this does any permanent correction; but, it works as a temporary &amp;#34;facelife&amp;#34;.  I have ordered two more because of that effect.  I love it and would have given a five star if I thought it had actual correcting benefits</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 59 yrs old - I use this every morning and like the way my face feels after applying the serum, then moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t think it will eliminate lines or sun spots, but I think it&#x27;s helping to prevent more from appearing.  Anyway, I will mostly likely buy more -- but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin!  I apply it once or twice a day under moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My face was a bit sensative at first which is the 20% C.  My face has adjusted to it and I see an improve in my skin.  I use less makeup because my skin has cleared up and I don&#x27;t need so much coverage. Like the natural look.  A lot less dark spots and it is not at all dry.  Love it.  Will be reordering. Did I mention...great price.</li>
            <li> Love Vitamin C, no matter who the manufacturer is!  It&#x27;s the best item to put on your face especially at night before retiring.  It does wonders for the skin and the way you feel about how you look when you get up.  Good stuff</li>
            <li> I have been using the Serum for a little over a month. After 2-3 weeks of daily use I noticed difference in my skin, although I bought it to reduce the appearance of some light brown spots on my forehead, which are still there, I noticed that fine lines  around my eyes dissapeared and overall my skin looks better. I just got my second bottle. The shipping was super fast but could be packaged better. I rated it 4 stars because both bottles leaked. They had dried sirum on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I must have got a bad bottle - it was the consistency of water and it smelled terrible - like hydrogen peroxide.  Also, when I put on my foundation it balled up and flaked off my face.  I tried it for a couple evenings but couldn&#x27;t take the smell.  Back to Amazon it goes.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum! I love how it smoothes the little lines around my mouth and it feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li> I am seeing good results, only using it for couple of weeks</li>
            <li> This is not the first facial serum I have tried, but the first with a pump action top, which makes it easier to use. After two weeks of using, my skin seems brighter and less dry. It noticeably reduced fine lines. Love it so far.</li>
            <li> So many things to talk about!  I love the pump style bottle - it dispenses the perfect amount of serum.  It glides on smoothly, is not sticky when dry, absorbs quickly, smells great, and my skin looks fantastic!  I also have applied some to spots on my daughter&#x27;s legs where she has scars from cuts, scrapes, scabs, etc.  I was very pleased that the discoloration on her legs improved!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle will last a while, since a little goes a long way, but I will be reordering when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and I feel like I immediately have a glow! Can&#x27;t wait to see long-term results!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a little while now. So far, I am a fan. I have felt increased moisture in my face, and my skin feels good after application. I am not sure yet whether or not I have any spots that are fading, but I am going to continue to use it, as the other benefits are clear. A little goes a long way with this serum. With one pump, I am able to out a light layer on my face, throat and neck, and with whatever is left on my hands, I rub onto the backs of my hands. It feels light, and silky against the skin, and dries quickly and smoothly. I will be emailing the product owner to see if I can add a drop or two of essential oil to it for a more pleasant scent. Again, so far, so good.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a Vitamin C Serum as when you apply it, it is very sticky.  But with other serums, they seem to stay that way.  This one goes away quickly therefore I know that it has soaked in my skin and is keeg it firm.  The instant I apply this, I can feel my skin tighten and get firm.  I recommend this serum to anyone looking for a Vitamin C serum that wants instant results.</li>
            <li> To try this out, I tried this on one dry, wrinkled area and didn&#x27;t do the other one right away.  I definitely noticed some brightening, and a lessened appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  The scent is a bit unusual, but tends to fade with time.  I especially like that this is a natural, healthy, and safe product to use.  It softened and brightened my skin, and think that it would show more results with more time.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this serum!!! I just returned from a 10 day trip to Haiti for a mission and I shared this serum with the other women on the trip and we loooved it!!! It was great on our faces after long days in the drying heat and sun and worked as such a great refresher after our sunburns! I felt like my face was so well protected and hydrated after each use and during the day!! I didn&#x27;t get any weathering or wear on my face the whole time! In fact, despite the brutal heat and sun, My face looks better and more vibrant now! This serum is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for a speedy delivery of this wonderful serum. I like the pump action style Bottle.  Just one pump releases the right amount of serum you need to apply on your face without any mess and residues.  The gel glides smoothly on my skin, leaving a natural non-greasy, satin finish look. Love it! I have Very sensitive skin and many skin care products cause redness to my cheeks.  This Serum was not irritating at all. I have been using this product for a few days and already have noticed a rejuvenate look. My skin is more smooth, bright and full of moisture, and many imperfections such as age spots, wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable. I use it twice a day, on my face and throat,  at night before I go to bed and in the morning before applying my makeup.  At 63 years of age, having a youthful skin is very important. Thanks for a great product.  I give the Vitamin C Serum 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after using this.  I really feel like it&#x27;s making a difference in my complexion and skin health.  I don&#x27;t love that it foams up when it comes out and the smell isn&#x27;t appealing to me, but it does work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> This is really a great Vitamin C Serum. I&#x27;ve tried another brand, but this one is superior. First of all, this one has a pump dispenser which is easier to use. The other serum I tried had a dropper which was difficult to control the amount you dispensed. This one is a thick gel formula which is wonderful! It goes on easily &amp; is absorbed fairly quickly into the skin. There is a very slight scent, but it&#x27;s pretty mild. The other serum that I used smelled like children&#x27;s liquid vitamins - this one does not.  So far I am pleased with the results. I have only been using this for a week, but will update after more use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now on my acne-prone skin. I have a lot of dark spots from old blemishes, and amazingly enough they are already less noticeable. I have also notice that it seems to help heal my blemishes a little bit faster. I also like that the pump action distributes exactly enough for one application.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. It truly is department store quality serum without the overpriced price tag! The serum is silky smooth when applying and feels soothing and refreshing when I apply it on my face and neck. Watch out because the pump will feed out quite a bit of serum. A little bit does go a long way! I really appreciate this product because it is made in the USA, and it is not tested on animals. I feel this is truly an honest product for a great price that is well worth trying. I can&#x27;t wait to continue to use it and continue to see results!</li>
            <li> I have used many anti aging serums.  Most are greasy.  This however, is not greasy at all and smells great to. The bottle is small and compact and easy to fit in your makeup bag. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results over time.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face super soft and smooth!  I&#x27;ve been using it, not so faithfully,  for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a change for the better.  My one sunspot seems to be fading and my skin just looks brighter.  I will continue to use this serum!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product and it did not disappoint. It smells great and does not leave any weird stickiness or residue. I use fit under my night cream and by the time I lay down, it&#x27;s absorbed so it doesn&#x27;t even mess up my sheets. One bottle will last awhile, too, you only need a dab. Oh, but don&#x27;t taste it. (Why do I do these things ;)</li>
            <li> This Aurum Nature serum has 20% Vitamin C which some may think it too high if you have sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t bother my semi sensitive skin at all.  Actually, I found it to be quite effective.  I don&#x27;t have spots or discolorations on my face, so use Vitamin c serum mostly for fine lines and prevention.  I like to apply it on a slightly damp face and neck.  After it dries slightly and makes your skin feel ever so tight I apply my normal moisturizer with SPF and I feel like I&#x27;ve done just about everything I can to help age gracefully!  And my skin glows!  I feel like it has made my complexion better and some dude in Safeway gave me a compliment on my complexion yesterday, yes, he used the word &amp;#34;complexion&amp;#34; lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as I was writing this review, I realized that I wear less foundation now.  My skin really has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do recommend the Aurum Nature brand; contains no alcohol or parabens, and it is Made in the USA, and comes in a very nice, quality, pump action bottle.  Great stuff and a good price for the quality of it.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How wonderful to find a product made in the USA in a FDA and GMP certified facility that is anti-aging, anti-wrinkle and paraben free.  Vitamin C Serum comes in a bottle that uses a pump to dispense which is so much better than using a messy dropper.  It absorbs quickly into my skin and I still get even coverage when I apply my makeup.  My skin feels smooth and not sticky and I find a little of this product goes a long way.  Definitely will continue to use this product because Vitamin C is not produced by my body but is needed to produce collagen.  Like too that it is does have unnecessary fillers or extras.</li>
            <li> I love the pump bottle. It dispenses just the right amount. My face looks smoother already from just a couple weeks. I especially love it&#x27;s non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Very happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product. It feels very light and soft on my skin even before applying moisturizer. My face started looking smoother and healthier within a couple of days of using it.</li>
            <li> Very impressive; I have used similar (far more expensive) shop bought products before, but this serum works as well as the cosmetic counter ones and additionally absorbs far more quickly, has nicer texture and makes my skin shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed benefits after just 3 weeks:&lt;br /&gt;my pregnancy spots started fading and my skin tone looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that the product isn’t tested on animals</li>
            <li> Since the weather&#x27;s started getting colder, my skin&#x27;s been getting really dry and flaky on my forehead, and moisturizer hardly helped. I started using this serum a few days ago and my skin&#x27;s already showing improvement: my skin is not as dry and it looks so much brighter! This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum Hyaluronic Acid is a little different than others that I have purchased.  So far I am enjoying using it, the thing that is different is it come out emulsified.  I have noticed one of the age spots on my face is fading, so that is a great thing!</li>
            <li> Just started using it and it seems to work just fine</li>
            <li> Really like this vitamin c serum I have been using it on a scar I have for about a week and noticed it has softened it up some! So far so good!</li>
