            <li>Norvell has a great rep in the industry, and since I&#x27;m always looking for a fabulous solution to give my clients awesome results, it was time I tried out their line of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>A latex glove works best, but the free ones that come with hair coloring kits will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope this information is helpful and you enjoy this wonderful product.a spraying device and without any experience</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If they were able to tweak the solution a bit so the color guard/bronzer applied more evenly I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li>:)re evenly</li>

            <li>I am glad my client bared with me.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used it once I can say I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, since you wash your face more it does fade quicker.  </li>

            <li>We now look like a family who just returned from some exotic vacation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*I am pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*I am pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li>My clients and I love this product</li>
            <li>thinking it&#x27;s same as the others, and I very happily realized after I was done, that this Norvell DOES NOT SMELL</li>
            <li>Recommended to me by a friend and glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>how many people  think i went on vacation because of the brown tones  </li>
            <li>Time and bright light help significantly.  </li>
            <li>Time and bright light help significantly.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle, I did notice that familiar &amp;#34;stinky scent&amp;#34; that I ABHOR!!!  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend using this solution on clients with very light or fair skin, and I really place emphasis on this recommendation.</li>
            <li>Got here right on time and the clients love it!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s gluten free.</li>
            <li>That being said, Venetian is my FAVORITE, it is DARK and brown and beautiful!!!!!</li>
            <li>Light to medium skin is ok.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t purchase this solution again, hopefully the original formula will better suit my needs.</li>
            <li>You can get the mitts anywhere, they&#x27;re not expensive and you WILL BE GLAD you did!</li>
            <li>Anyway, after that first day I love the color!</li>
            <li>Washes off easily after you have waited 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Love it - gives me a very nice color and seems to last.  </li>
            <li>Norvell products are great in general.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too dark for me and fades great!</li>
            <li>but the rest of my body that wasn&#x27;t in the pool was fine.  </li>
            <li>Fades evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Nice color without the harmful effects of too much sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or do light spray on lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li>The color continues to intensify over 24 hours, for light skin use lightly or it may look unnatural.</li>
            <li>Everything was great except for the fact the solution expiration date was for last month.</li>
            <li>The color has a beautiful purple toned base...sounds scary, but develops beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many sunless brands over the years, and I am EXTREMELY happy to say that I believe my lifelong search is over!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and over 40, I use the Norvelle original til I get a natural sun glow tone</li>
            <li>It gave me a very nice tan overall...</li>
            <li>So if you are fair skinned, it will be very apparent that you got a spray tan.  </li>
            <li>The color was rich and flattering, not orangey.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to practice on inconspicuous areas first and then, when you like your technique, get that all over glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to practice on inconspicuous areas first and then, when you like your technique, get that all over glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would use original on lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with blending cosmetics</li>
            <li>I have always used Norvell products and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*You may have drips on the floor - clean up quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*You may have drips on the floor - clean up quickly.  </li>
            <li>This one gives a medium to dark beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>When I shower off it&#x27;s much better, but then the problem is really just on my lets, it seems like the solution sticks into my pours,</li>
            <li>In summation-it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>This is just my review, it may work for you, but in addition, I also experienced the &amp;#34;spotting&amp;#34; effect that other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>Other than that great product.</li>
            <li>but my husband is more fair skinned and thus one doesn&#x27;t seem to want to stick to him and turns him a little orange.</li>
            <li>solution arrived quickly and I could not wait to try it.  </li>
            <li>Use within 60 days product turns gray quickly</li>
            <li>( I have nice skin that&#x27;s not dry anyway, but still, you have to take special care with what you use when you spray tan.)</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, it is quite a dark solution though.  </li>
            <li>The real test will tell after waking up in the morning after a full nights application!</li>
            <li>No orange, long lasting, great smell!</li>
            <li>Very nice color , but it fades super fast.. especially after the first shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dark solution to begin with, but more importantly the freckling stands out much more, and it never fully blends in even after they shower.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning solution by far!</li>
            <li>The color the next day was nice though</li>
            <li>By far my favorite solution.</li>
            <li>well then you&#x27;ll know how to use it and your tan session will be a success.</li>
            <li>this is the only kind to use  there is one thats darker</li>
            <li>: The solution as a nice scent, and doesn&#x27;t have the strong, typical &amp;#34;spray tan&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Norvell products and the Venetian formula is superior.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>so far I used it twice since the first day it was delivered, and I am in Love with it.</li>
            <li>I used to use SUN laboratories ultra dark tanning lotion, which worked good, but decided to give spray tanning a try.  </li>
            <li>The first 24 hours are the best then fades down from there... lasts a total of maybe 5 days.</li>
            <li>Plus it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>Beautiful dark natural color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;she used a lot of tanning products and she really love it norvell Venetian!!&lt;br /&gt;i will continue buying in the future!</li>
            <li>I never use this solution if I know my client (or myself) has an event or is going out before their first shower, which allows the color guard (that causes the speckles) to rinse off.</li>
            <li>I personally like that color every once in awhile, though it works better for a summer solution.</li>
            <li>But there are definitely solutions that extend this for longer periods more than others.</li>
            <li>I first moisturize all over and let that sink in for about an hour</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>I exfoliate my skin using sugar and gloves first.  </li>
            <li>No weird smells,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am pleased with the results, but I realize everyone has different expectations.  </li>
            <li>First off, let me say that the color this solution gives off is perfection.</li>
            <li>but sadly is no longer on amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get a quick, super easy, dark, natural looking tan with this!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge problem because better brown than orange, but I feel kind of embarrassed sometimes when I&#x27;m not careful to keep the sprayer at a full arms length and for the next 8 hours until I shower</li>
            <li>If you have a spray technique you like, certainly stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get a quick, super easy, dark, natural looking tan with this!!you can get a line from your sports bra from sweating, so just keep that in mind when timing your spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottle is HUGE for personal use though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very divided on this tanning solution.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My whole family is using it now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for another coat.  </li>
            <li>After a few years of this expense, I decided to order my own supplies and try to apply it myself.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to place the cap right at your hairline or else you will have a very obvious white line on your forehead.  </li>
            <li>I have repurchased it several times and its definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I have light to medium yellow toned skin, and this was very, VERY natural looking once the guide color wore off.</li>
            <li>If my client is requesting the dark tone that this solution does give, I ALWAYS make sure to inform them up front that there will be a lot of freckling, but it does rinse off.</li>
            <li>I used a small synthetic sponge (the plastic kind) and rubbed it in thoroughly with a latex-gloved hand.  </li>
            <li>I always ALWAYS exfoliate and prep my skin with barrier cream before spraying, and also do the daily maintenance needed on spray tanned skin to ensure an even fade...i.e., moisturize with non oil based creams or lotions which don&#x27;t degrade tan quickly the way that oil based lotions can.</li>
            <li>If you decide to, I highly recommend this product, however, if it&#x27;s your first time it might be better to start off with a lighter color like their DARK solution because mistakes with the Venetian solution will be very apparent.  </li>
            <li>If you decide to, I highly recommend this product, however, if it&#x27;s your first time it might be better to start off with a lighter color like their DARK solution because mistakes with the Venetian solution will be very apparent.  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries much quicker than lotion, goes on more evenly, and gives you a dark, natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild compared to many other brands, and is slightly &amp;#34;cucumbery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call the color &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for what the average client desires, but if you want a very dark, almost brown color, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Then, I take the spray system apart, clean it with water, and let it dry.  </li>
            <li>It also gives a level of color in one 10 minute session that will normally take you hours or days to get in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product and also the St. Tropez professional classic bronzing mist with my tanning system, this is a comparison of the two.  </li>
            <li>I have used almost all tanning solutions and by far this one exceeds all others in realistic color and longevity.</li>
            <li>so very natural looking  </li>
            <li>I wear flip flops to prevent the bottom of my feet from absorbing the solution and being awkwardly super dark.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, makes me DARK and lasts about a week on me.</li>
            <li>I also wax before applying the spray or else you will get white patches where you wax after since waxing strips away all of the color on the first layer of your skin.  </li>
            <li>It list no DHA content as other products do but be assured it will produce a much darker and more realistic tan than any DHA content or other tanning solution that you have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I get right into bed after, I wake up with stained palms/other areas on my hand from sleeping on the solution and also it is less dark because more of it goes onto my sheets than my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your hands, feet, and face only need one coat as I&#x27;ve noticed they absorb the solution much better, and you don&#x27;t want your face to be too dark in comparison with the rest of your body.  </li>
            <li>As for myself it gives me a rich dark tan.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t just a problem with certain skin types, but is universal.</li>
            <li>I think this is common with spray tanning agents, but just make sure you don&#x27;t come into contact with any textiles you really care about shortly after use.</li>
            <li>This venetian solution is purple-based so it gives me a NATURAL brown tan.</li>
            <li>Color is natural looking.</li>
            <li>Did not provide much color and have to do multiple applications.</li>
            <li>I also set up a pair of old sheets on my bed to prevent any staining while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have not run into any issues with this solution.  </li>
            <li>So far, any stains have come off in the wash for me, even on my whites.  </li>
            <li>I am not a spray tan expert or professional; strictly a beginner.  </li>
            <li>It was a natural look.  </li>
            <li>The color looks natural....</li>
            <li>: I will say that after the first shower (which should only be taken at the bare minimum, 8 hours after application to avoid washing the tan off before it fully binds to the epidermis)</li>
            <li>The color is a little dark for light colored skin, however it still looks golden and the color faded naturally.</li>
            <li>Great product, sorry I didn&#x27;t discover this product sooner!</li>
            <li>They need to be consistent with pricing and to charge more just for a specific color is poor marketing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bolstered by my success, I moved on to other family members.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just one, steady stream that comes out, but covers multiple points of a surface).  </li>
            <li>Lastly, since I am older I like this product because it does not &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34</li>
            <li>There is little to no smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling and it lasts a full week before there are sign of fading.  </li>
            <li>For small spots that need to even out, dipping a gloved finger into the solution and rubbing it precisely where it is needed works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For small spots that need to even out, dipping a gloved finger into the solution and rubbing it precisely where it is needed works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But there are other solutions that give you a color just as dark and do not have the problem with speckling immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions!</li>
            <li>But there are other solutions that give you a color just as dark and do not have the problem with speckling immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions!</li>
            <li>I have yellow undertones to my skin so the regular solution which is more red based makes me look slightly orange.</li>
            <li>I have bought 5-6 different tanners lately and this seems to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>Naturally, how long your spray tan stays on varies due to several factors, such as skin condition at time of application (which is why it&#x27;s recommended to exfoliate prior to tanning), your skin&#x27;s natural shedding cycle, amount of shower, shaving areas  (as shaving often removes the top layer of skin), etc.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a major plus.</li>
            <li>But the application itself is where I have the major issue: It speckles...BADLY.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate periodically and you will have no regrets!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, Norvell Venetian solution gets a 3.5 out of 5 (though I rounded up to 4 as there&#x27;s no partial point system on Amazon).</li>
            <li>As someone who likes to stay out of the sun because I want to look as young as possible, this is perf.</li>
            <li>and it gave me a pretty dark tan.</li>
            <li>So..I sadly go and spray this on (with my own misting spray bottle)  </li>
            <li>There is no orange tint whatsoever, and it definitely gives you a SUPER dark, &amp;#34;I just got back from a Caribbean vacation where I was laying on the beach</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this solution because it truly does give you a fairly dark, natural looking tan without any UV damage to your skin.  </li>
            <li>The undertones are purplish (not red or orange), so tans consistently turn out dark and bronze.</li>
            <li>and when I tell them it&#x27;s fake they are surprised, some even jealous because they love tanning beds &amp; I try to convert them</li>
            <li>If this happens, it&#x27;s not cute and people will wonder what happened to you - wax first!  </li>
            <li>Remember to moisturize because I&#x27;ve found that it is a little drying on my skin and does last a little longer and more evenly if you use lotion (any brand will suffice).  </li>
            <li>The bronzer in it is so dark, it gives the client a VERY freckled look immediately after application.</li>
            <li>Because the coloring of this solution is so dramatic, you want to make sure there&#x27;s no surface left untouched.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling for long, only a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about this purchase being pretty pale.</li>
            <li>I generally find that applying two coats back to back is necessary for the color to fully blend and coat every part of the skin, or else</li>

            <li> Great product, beautiful color.</li>
            <li> Norvell is a great product but their costs are getting a bit prohibitive.</li>
            <li> Probably not an ideal color for someone with fair skin.</li>
            <li> This solutions goes on great</li>
            <li> My clients do like the smell and are happy with the Norvell results tho.</li>
            <li> lol  </li>

            <li> Norvell has a great rep in the industry, and since I&#x27;m always looking for a fabulous solution to give my clients awesome results, it was time I tried out their line of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> A latex glove works best, but the free ones that come with hair coloring kits will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope this information is helpful and you enjoy this wonderful product.a spraying device and without any experience</li>

            <li> If you think the price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Ordered Norvell VENETIAN Premium Solution - shipped quickly and was excactly what i wanted!!  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> If they were able to tweak the solution a bit so the color guard/bronzer applied more evenly I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li> :)re evenly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love it.</li>

            <li> This solution is ok.</li>
            <li> I am glad my client bared with me.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used it once I can say I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, since you wash your face more it does fade quicker.  </li>

            <li> We now look like a family who just returned from some exotic vacation.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;*I am pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li> My clients and I love this product</li>
            <li> thinking it&#x27;s same as the others, and I very happily realized after I was done, that this Norvell DOES NOT SMELL</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by a friend and glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> how many people  think i went on vacation because of the brown tones  </li>
            <li> Time and bright light help significantly.  </li>
            <li> Time and bright light help significantly.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle, I did notice that familiar &amp;#34;stinky scent&amp;#34; that I ABHOR!!!  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend using this solution on clients with very light or fair skin, and I really place emphasis on this recommendation.</li>
            <li> Got here right on time and the clients love it!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s gluten free.</li>
            <li> That being said, Venetian is my FAVORITE, it is DARK and brown and beautiful!!!!!</li>
            <li> Light to medium skin is ok.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase this solution again, hopefully the original formula will better suit my needs.</li>
            <li> You can get the mitts anywhere, they&#x27;re not expensive and you WILL BE GLAD you did!</li>
            <li> Anyway, after that first day I love the color!</li>
            <li> Washes off easily after you have waited 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Love it - gives me a very nice color and seems to last.  </li>
            <li> Norvell products are great in general.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too dark for me and fades great!</li>
            <li> but the rest of my body that wasn&#x27;t in the pool was fine.  </li>
            <li> Fades evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Nice color without the harmful effects of too much sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or do light spray on lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li> The color continues to intensify over 24 hours, for light skin use lightly or it may look unnatural.</li>
            <li> Everything was great except for the fact the solution expiration date was for last month.</li>
            <li> The color has a beautiful purple toned base...sounds scary, but develops beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many sunless brands over the years, and I am EXTREMELY happy to say that I believe my lifelong search is over!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and over 40, I use the Norvelle original til I get a natural sun glow tone</li>
            <li> It gave me a very nice tan overall...</li>
            <li> So if you are fair skinned, it will be very apparent that you got a spray tan.  </li>
            <li> The color was rich and flattering, not orangey.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to practice on inconspicuous areas first and then, when you like your technique, get that all over glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to practice on inconspicuous areas first and then, when you like your technique, get that all over glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would use original on lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with blending cosmetics</li>
            <li> I have always used Norvell products and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*You may have drips on the floor - clean up quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*You may have drips on the floor - clean up quickly.  </li>
            <li> This one gives a medium to dark beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> When I shower off it&#x27;s much better, but then the problem is really just on my lets, it seems like the solution sticks into my pours,</li>
            <li> In summation-it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> This is just my review, it may work for you, but in addition, I also experienced the &amp;#34;spotting&amp;#34; effect that other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> Other than that great product.</li>
            <li> but my husband is more fair skinned and thus one doesn&#x27;t seem to want to stick to him and turns him a little orange.</li>
            <li> solution arrived quickly and I could not wait to try it.  </li>
            <li> Use within 60 days product turns gray quickly</li>
            <li> ( I have nice skin that&#x27;s not dry anyway, but still, you have to take special care with what you use when you spray tan.)</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, it is quite a dark solution though.  </li>
            <li> The real test will tell after waking up in the morning after a full nights application!</li>
            <li> No orange, long lasting, great smell!</li>
            <li> Very nice color , but it fades super fast.. especially after the first shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark solution to begin with, but more importantly the freckling stands out much more, and it never fully blends in even after they shower.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning solution by far!</li>
            <li> The color the next day was nice though</li>
            <li> By far my favorite solution.</li>
            <li> well then you&#x27;ll know how to use it and your tan session will be a success.</li>
            <li> this is the only kind to use  there is one thats darker</li>
            <li> : The solution as a nice scent, and doesn&#x27;t have the strong, typical &amp;#34;spray tan&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Norvell products and the Venetian formula is superior.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> so far I used it twice since the first day it was delivered, and I am in Love with it.</li>
            <li> I used to use SUN laboratories ultra dark tanning lotion, which worked good, but decided to give spray tanning a try.  </li>
            <li> The first 24 hours are the best then fades down from there... lasts a total of maybe 5 days.</li>
            <li> Plus it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> Beautiful dark natural color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;she used a lot of tanning products and she really love it norvell Venetian!!&lt;br /&gt;i will continue buying in the future!</li>
            <li> I never use this solution if I know my client (or myself) has an event or is going out before their first shower, which allows the color guard (that causes the speckles) to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I personally like that color every once in awhile, though it works better for a summer solution.</li>
            <li> But there are definitely solutions that extend this for longer periods more than others.</li>
            <li> I first moisturize all over and let that sink in for about an hour</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate my skin using sugar and gloves first.  </li>
            <li> No weird smells,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am pleased with the results, but I realize everyone has different expectations.  </li>
            <li> First off, let me say that the color this solution gives off is perfection.</li>
            <li> but sadly is no longer on amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get a quick, super easy, dark, natural looking tan with this!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge problem because better brown than orange, but I feel kind of embarrassed sometimes when I&#x27;m not careful to keep the sprayer at a full arms length and for the next 8 hours until I shower</li>
            <li> If you have a spray technique you like, certainly stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get a quick, super easy, dark, natural looking tan with this!!you can get a line from your sports bra from sweating, so just keep that in mind when timing your spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottle is HUGE for personal use though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very divided on this tanning solution.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My whole family is using it now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for another coat.  </li>
            <li> After a few years of this expense, I decided to order my own supplies and try to apply it myself.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to place the cap right at your hairline or else you will have a very obvious white line on your forehead.  </li>
            <li> I have repurchased it several times and its definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I have light to medium yellow toned skin, and this was very, VERY natural looking once the guide color wore off.</li>
            <li> If my client is requesting the dark tone that this solution does give, I ALWAYS make sure to inform them up front that there will be a lot of freckling, but it does rinse off.</li>
            <li> I used a small synthetic sponge (the plastic kind) and rubbed it in thoroughly with a latex-gloved hand.  </li>
            <li> I always ALWAYS exfoliate and prep my skin with barrier cream before spraying, and also do the daily maintenance needed on spray tanned skin to ensure an even fade...i.e., moisturize with non oil based creams or lotions which don&#x27;t degrade tan quickly the way that oil based lotions can.</li>
            <li> If you decide to, I highly recommend this product, however, if it&#x27;s your first time it might be better to start off with a lighter color like their DARK solution because mistakes with the Venetian solution will be very apparent.  </li>
            <li> If you decide to, I highly recommend this product, however, if it&#x27;s your first time it might be better to start off with a lighter color like their DARK solution because mistakes with the Venetian solution will be very apparent.  </li>
            <li> Looks very natural!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries much quicker than lotion, goes on more evenly, and gives you a dark, natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild compared to many other brands, and is slightly &amp;#34;cucumbery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call the color &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for what the average client desires, but if you want a very dark, almost brown color, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Then, I take the spray system apart, clean it with water, and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> It also gives a level of color in one 10 minute session that will normally take you hours or days to get in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product and also the St. Tropez professional classic bronzing mist with my tanning system, this is a comparison of the two.  </li>
            <li> I have used almost all tanning solutions and by far this one exceeds all others in realistic color and longevity.</li>
            <li> so very natural looking  </li>
            <li> I wear flip flops to prevent the bottom of my feet from absorbing the solution and being awkwardly super dark.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, makes me DARK and lasts about a week on me.</li>
            <li> I also wax before applying the spray or else you will get white patches where you wax after since waxing strips away all of the color on the first layer of your skin.  </li>
            <li> It list no DHA content as other products do but be assured it will produce a much darker and more realistic tan than any DHA content or other tanning solution that you have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I get right into bed after, I wake up with stained palms/other areas on my hand from sleeping on the solution and also it is less dark because more of it goes onto my sheets than my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your hands, feet, and face only need one coat as I&#x27;ve noticed they absorb the solution much better, and you don&#x27;t want your face to be too dark in comparison with the rest of your body.  </li>
            <li> As for myself it gives me a rich dark tan.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t just a problem with certain skin types, but is universal.</li>
            <li> I think this is common with spray tanning agents, but just make sure you don&#x27;t come into contact with any textiles you really care about shortly after use.</li>
            <li> This venetian solution is purple-based so it gives me a NATURAL brown tan.</li>
            <li> Color is natural looking.</li>
            <li> Did not provide much color and have to do multiple applications.</li>
            <li> I also set up a pair of old sheets on my bed to prevent any staining while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have not run into any issues with this solution.  </li>
            <li> So far, any stains have come off in the wash for me, even on my whites.  </li>
            <li> I am not a spray tan expert or professional; strictly a beginner.  </li>
            <li> It was a natural look.  </li>
            <li> The color looks natural....</li>
            <li> : I will say that after the first shower (which should only be taken at the bare minimum, 8 hours after application to avoid washing the tan off before it fully binds to the epidermis)</li>
            <li> The color is a little dark for light colored skin, however it still looks golden and the color faded naturally.</li>
            <li> Great product, sorry I didn&#x27;t discover this product sooner!</li>
            <li> They need to be consistent with pricing and to charge more just for a specific color is poor marketing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bolstered by my success, I moved on to other family members.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just one, steady stream that comes out, but covers multiple points of a surface).  </li>
            <li> Lastly, since I am older I like this product because it does not &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34</li>
            <li> There is little to no smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling and it lasts a full week before there are sign of fading.  </li>
            <li> For small spots that need to even out, dipping a gloved finger into the solution and rubbing it precisely where it is needed works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> But there are other solutions that give you a color just as dark and do not have the problem with speckling immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions!</li>
            <li> But there are other solutions that give you a color just as dark and do not have the problem with speckling immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions!</li>
            <li> I have yellow undertones to my skin so the regular solution which is more red based makes me look slightly orange.</li>
            <li> I have bought 5-6 different tanners lately and this seems to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> Naturally, how long your spray tan stays on varies due to several factors, such as skin condition at time of application (which is why it&#x27;s recommended to exfoliate prior to tanning), your skin&#x27;s natural shedding cycle, amount of shower, shaving areas  (as shaving often removes the top layer of skin), etc.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a major plus.</li>
            <li> But the application itself is where I have the major issue: It speckles...BADLY.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate periodically and you will have no regrets!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, Norvell Venetian solution gets a 3.5 out of 5 (though I rounded up to 4 as there&#x27;s no partial point system on Amazon).</li>
            <li> As someone who likes to stay out of the sun because I want to look as young as possible, this is perf.</li>
            <li> and it gave me a pretty dark tan.</li>
            <li> So..I sadly go and spray this on (with my own misting spray bottle)  </li>
            <li> There is no orange tint whatsoever, and it definitely gives you a SUPER dark, &amp;#34;I just got back from a Caribbean vacation where I was laying on the beach</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this solution because it truly does give you a fairly dark, natural looking tan without any UV damage to your skin.  </li>
            <li> The undertones are purplish (not red or orange), so tans consistently turn out dark and bronze.</li>
            <li> and when I tell them it&#x27;s fake they are surprised, some even jealous because they love tanning beds &amp; I try to convert them</li>
            <li> If this happens, it&#x27;s not cute and people will wonder what happened to you - wax first!  </li>
            <li> Remember to moisturize because I&#x27;ve found that it is a little drying on my skin and does last a little longer and more evenly if you use lotion (any brand will suffice).  </li>
            <li> The bronzer in it is so dark, it gives the client a VERY freckled look immediately after application.</li>
            <li> Because the coloring of this solution is so dramatic, you want to make sure there&#x27;s no surface left untouched.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling for long, only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about this purchase being pretty pale.</li>
            <li> I generally find that applying two coats back to back is necessary for the color to fully blend and coat every part of the skin, or else</li>
            <li> out of 5 stars for longevity, as I&#x27;ve seen much better results from other brands, though much worse as well!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, and I personally have to &amp;</li>
            <li> Not sure its the real deal.</li>
            <li> Since I work out, the spray tan doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the color was still natural with the  guide color on after initially spraying it, just very very dark.)</li>
            <li> : This isn&#x27;t a very long lasting solution.</li>
            <li> The key to remember is giving yourself ample amount of time for the solution to dry on your skin.  </li>
            <li> your newly-applied tan dry for 12 hours, if possible, to let it set into your skin.  </li>

            <li> experience with spray tans was limited to my daughter&#x27;s yearly requirement to have one prior to her cheer competition.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was my next victim, at her request.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the darkest solution that I have used so little is needed.</li>
            <li> was grey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update soon as to how long it lasts for me and will try to upload some pics of my skin when done...</li>
            <li> But despite all my pre and post prep work, and after three different tries with this solution, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not for me, even though the color it produces is perfect for me, but that doesn&#x27;t negate how terrible it looks as it fades, and that&#x27;s half the battle.</li>
            <li> I will revert back to my other solutions.</li>
            <li> I personally like to do a second coat for a little darker look and to touch up any areas that need it.  </li>
            <li> I pat/air dry</li>
            <li> Sprays on well, longer dry time, feels a bit tacky when dry</li>
            <li> but this one is dark enough  </li>
            <li> Finally, I wipe down the area where I did the spray tan with a wet rag because it gets everywhere.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s definitely a no-go in the department, which is super disappointing.</li>
            <li> I think we may switch back to their other dark color though.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I tried the Venetian solution and haven&#x27;t gone back.</li>
            <li> After his shower, I applied it to his legs while they were still damp, but not dripping wet.  </li>
            <li> The colorant is not very forgiving.  </li>
            <li> The colorant is not very forgiving.  </li>
            <li> It is the only formula I have found that fades gradually, never looks orange or green.  </li>
            <li> The color is natural, but I feel a little dirty looking that first day.</li>
            <li> (I just use some duct tape and it tickles my feet like crazy when pulling of off tho..but worth it if you can&#x27;t afford the pads!</li>
            <li> Started using this color this past spring when it came out and my clients only want to use the Venetian since then.</li>
            <li> Knowing nothing about spray tans, I decided on this product after trying to make sense out of endless reviews.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells good-not like other sunless tanning sprays the problem that I have with it</li>
            <li> ; my skin as other brands have done.  </li>
            <li> One coat of spray tan never hits every surface, as spray guns produce super tiny, little streams of color (sorry if this is confusing to follow, but picture spraying Windex.</li>
            <li> No spraying means less mess, but still be careful of drips and spills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No spraying means less mess, but still be careful of drips and spills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dark shade however</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find that this was as dark as people mentioned.</li>
            <li> then I use this formula to a achieve the dark color I prefer.  </li>
            <li> It smells good but looks awful.</li>
            <li> I put it in a pump spray bottle and apply it with a typical tanning mitt.</li>
            <li> I showered, saw not much/very little of  the color washing down, so I&#x27;m thinking &amp;#34;ok..</li>
            <li> at first I said it looks as if I&#x27;m dirty or bruised.</li>
            <li> it looks a little odd.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a violet tint to it.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I feel like I look a little healthier when I have some color in my face and this solution gives you plenty of color.  </li>
            <li> so legs look a little dotted.</li>
            <li> After a few days when the tan has started to fade on my face, I spray a little Body Drench Tanner into my hands and pat it onto my face so my neck isn&#x27;t noticeably darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days when the tan has started to fade on my face, I spray a little Body Drench Tanner into my hands and pat it onto my face so my neck isn&#x27;t noticeably darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> almost dead looking...</li>
            <li> If you choose to apply this product without a spraying device and without any experience, here are a few lesson</li>
            <li> , here are a few lesson</li>
            <li> I personally like having a tan because you can wear any color clothing without looking washed out and I am guilty of not having learned how to do my make up without using a little bronzer yet.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up with this stuff</li>
            <li> At least St. Tropez fades evenly and I can usually redo my tan after about 4-5 days without anyone really noticing it fading badly the way they did with the Norvell solution.</li>
            <li> and I started using sunless tanner in high school when my uncle who is a surgeon convinced me how bad tanning beds are.  </li>
            <li> considering I am very very pale.</li>
            <li> SUPER orange tan and smells like bad fake tan.  </li>
            <li> I tried to pick out some type of spraying device, but that became too confusing</li>
            <li> Probably common sense for the non-impulsive personalities out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably common sense for the non-impulsive personalities out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I forced my son to be my tanning experiment.  </li>
            <li> But alas, the color wore off so patchy and unevenly, I just couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> OMG this solution is a game changer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not great</li>
            <li> Every single one of my clients hate it.</li>
            <li> Just a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with anything from Norvell, they have mastered the art if spray solution.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve never had anyone look &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; or fake with this solution.</li>
            <li> Too bad, not good, and not for me.</li>
            <li> That nasty smell has literally made me stop using sunless lotions for a long time..</li>
            <li> there are very dramatic color difference.</li>
            <li> so I tan like crazy in the sun,</li>
            <li> SO WELL that it&#x27;s almost impossible to get stained anywhere</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, but is what I expect for a sunless tanner.  </li>
            <li> A wast of a liter and money :(</li>
            <li> This is just awful.</li>
            <li> it was terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product. The color looks great on fair skin. Not orange at all.</li>
            <li> i bought that product for my mom....&lt;br /&gt;she used a lot of tanning products and she really love it norvell Venetian!!&lt;br /&gt;i will continue buying in the future!</li>
            <li> There was no born on date on the bottle... It&#x27;s needed to determine freshness.</li>
            <li> No Orange at all.  Perfect!!</li>
            <li> Great product, beautiful color. No orange, long lasting, great smell! I have been spray tanning for 10 years and absolutely love this solution</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, it is quite a dark solution though.  So if you are fair skinned, it will be very apparent that you got a spray tan.  Also the product seems to rub off onto sheets and clothing even after drying.  I think this is common with spray tanning agents, but just make sure you don&#x27;t come into contact with any textiles you really care about shortly after use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Color is awesome and lasts for about 9 days.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up with this stuff but after I sprayed myself I looked like was grey. It smells good but looks awful. The color the next day was nice though so I guess if you can deal with looking like you just rolled around in dirt for a day it&#x27;s good but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very divided on this tanning solution. I run a spray tan business, and have a unit at home that I spray myself with as well. Norvell has a great rep in the industry, and since I&#x27;m always looking for a fabulous solution to give my clients awesome results, it was time I tried out their line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION: The solution as a nice scent, and doesn&#x27;t have the strong, typical &amp;#34;spray tan&amp;#34; smell. That&#x27;s a major plus. It&#x27;s very mild compared to many other brands, and is slightly &amp;#34;cucumbery&amp;#34;. But the application itself is where I have the major issue: It speckles...BADLY. The bronzer in it is so dark, it gives the client a VERY freckled look immediately after application. It takes several hours to subside, after the epidermis of the skin has had time to absorb it properly and the solution spreads out a bit. I never use this solution if I know my client (or myself) has an event or is going out before their first shower, which allows the color guard (that causes the speckles) to rinse off. So it&#x27;s definitely a no-go in the department, which is super disappointing. This isn&#x27;t just a problem with certain skin types, but is universal. If my client is requesting the dark tone that this solution does give, I ALWAYS make sure to inform them up front that there will be a lot of freckling, but it does rinse off. I also feel that this isn&#x27;t a solution that you can just use for one coat. I generally find that applying two coats back to back is necessary for the color to fully blend and coat every part of the skin, or else there are very dramatic color difference. One coat of spray tan never hits every surface, as spray guns produce super tiny, little streams of color (sorry if this is confusing to follow, but picture spraying Windex. It&#x27;s not just one, steady stream that comes out, but covers multiple points of a surface).  Because the coloring of this solution is so dramatic, you want to make sure there&#x27;s no surface left untouched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do not recommend using this solution on clients with very light or fair skin, and I really place emphasis on this recommendation. It&#x27;s a dark solution to begin with, but more importantly the freckling stands out much more, and it never fully blends in even after they shower. (Three out of Five stars for Application).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS: I will say that after the first shower (which should only be taken at the bare minimum, 8 hours after application to avoid washing the tan off before it fully binds to the epidermis) the color looks quite nice. There is no orange tint whatsoever, and it definitely gives you a SUPER dark, &amp;#34;I just got back from a Caribbean vacation where I was laying on the beach non stop for seven days&amp;#34; look. I wouldn&#x27;t call the color &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for what the average client desires, but if you want a very dark, almost brown color, it&#x27;s great. I personally like that color every once in awhile, though it works better for a summer solution. Doesn&#x27;t look very believable in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;(4 out of 5 stars for color quality).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONGEVITY: This isn&#x27;t a very long lasting solution. Naturally, how long your spray tan stays on varies due to several factors, such as skin condition at time of application (which is why it&#x27;s recommended to exfoliate prior to tanning), your skin&#x27;s natural shedding cycle, amount of shower, shaving areas  (as shaving often removes the top layer of skin), etc. But there are definitely solutions that extend this for longer periods more than others. This doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, and I personally have to &amp;#34;re-up&amp;#34; within several days if I spray myself.&lt;br /&gt;-(3 out of 5 stars for longevity, as I&#x27;ve seen much better results from other brands, though much worse as well!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, Norvell Venetian solution gets a 3.5 out of 5 (though I rounded up to 4 as there&#x27;s no partial point system on Amazon). If they were able to tweak the solution a bit so the color guard/bronzer applied more evenly I&#x27;d love it. But there are other solutions that give you a color just as dark and do not have the problem with speckling immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions! Happy tanning! :)re evenly I&#x27;d love it. But there are other solutions that give you a color just as dark and do not have the problem with speckling immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask me any questions! Happy tanning! :)</li>
            <li> The bronzing effect comes off very easily. The underlying coverage last as stated.</li>
            <li> Amazing color! Great smell, too!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the Norvell Venetian. It gives me the perfect color and smells so good. I love the fact that it&#x27;s gluten free. I will definitely buy this again. Plus it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> Love the color of this product. Works great! Looks very natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Norvell products and the Venetian formula is superior. The color is a little dark for light colored skin, however it still looks golden and the color faded naturally.</li>
            <li> love love love! looks great! no orange!!</li>
            <li> Started using this color this past spring when it came out and my clients only want to use the Venetian since then. Norvell is a great product but their costs are getting a bit prohibitive. They need to be consistent with pricing and to charge more just for a specific color is poor marketing.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite solution. I have a medium olive complexion and this gives me that off-the-Mediterranean summer tan. it lasts up to 8 days if I moisturize daily to preserve the color. Fades evenly and smoothly. Probably not an ideal color for someone with fair skin. It has a reddish undertone, so you look sunkissed and bronzed, not orange.</li>
            <li> Nice color and lasted about 6-8 days before wearing off!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with anything from Norvell, they have mastered the art if spray solution. That being said, Venetian is my FAVORITE, it is DARK and brown and beautiful!!!!! I have repurchased it several times and its definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Bottle was slightly open when I got it.  SUPER orange tan and smells like bad fake tan.  Not sure its the real deal. Beware.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Cant wait to use!</li>
            <li> Good color so far best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon as an airbrush tech and we use regular norvell solution. I bought the norvell Venetian for personal use and OMG this solution is a game changer. I have yellow undertones to my skin so the regular solution which is more red based makes me look slightly orange. This venetian solution is purple-based so it gives me a NATURAL brown tan. It smells fantastic, makes me DARK and lasts about a week on me. I put it in a pump spray bottle and apply it with a typical tanning mitt. I first moisturize all over and let that sink in for about an hour so the solution goes on evenly. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it. As someone who likes to stay out of the sun because I want to look as young as possible, this is perf.</li>
            <li> I have always used Norvell products and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. A few years ago, I tried the Venetian solution and haven&#x27;t gone back. The undertones are purplish (not red or orange), so tans consistently turn out dark and bronze. We&#x27;ve never had anyone look &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; or fake with this solution. I also appreciate that it&#x27;s organic and has a tropical scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice color , but it fades super fast.. especially after the first shower.  The first 24 hours are the best then fades down from there... lasts a total of maybe 5 days. Even did 3 layers of spray</li>
            <li> After trying a number of tanning solutions i have found this to be the best one by far.  There is little to no smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling and it lasts a full week before there are sign of fading.  I will be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> This solutions goes on great but I wish Norvell would post the % DHA in it.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s around 10%?  I would like to order the 12.5% DHA in a norvell product but can only find that intensity in the Ocean products.  My clients do like the smell and are happy with the Norvell results tho.</li>
            <li> Love this. Amazing  color and scent. Dark shade however</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on this color.  My whole family is using it now.  Color last about 5 days</li>
            <li> Wayyyyyy to orange! Every single one of my clients hate it. I will revert back to my other solutions. This is just awful. A wast of a liter and money :(</li>
            <li> Color is natural looking. I think we may switch back to their other dark color though. Personal preference</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and so do my clients!</li>
            <li> Ordered Norvell VENETIAN Premium Solution - shipped quickly and was excactly what i wanted!!  Second time ordering with them!</li>
            <li> This product is really more ORANGE than a bronzed sun kissed look!! I won&#x27;t purchase this solution again, hopefully the original formula will better suit my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this product so i bought it for myself! When i sprayed it left my skin blotchy..almost dead looking...I had blotches of tan and then regular colored skin...it was terrible</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find that this was as dark as people mentioned. Did not provide much color and have to do multiple applications.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE the color! Also i love the party to sent this out! Another Party i bought Norvell solution from it was made 5 months before hand. This solution was just made not even a week ago!!</li>
            <li> This solution is ok. You have to wait 8 hours to shower. This product is different than others I have tried. It has a little bit of a violet tint to it. Washes off easily after you have waited 8 hours. Lasted about a week with me. Since I work out, the spray tan doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> Not Norvell! Doesn&#x27;t work! Don&#x27;t Buy. If you think the price is too good to be true. It is. I am returning. I am glad my client bared with me. Do not buy! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used it once I can say I love it. I actually don&#x27;t use it as a spray... I just pour it into a smaller bottle and use a tanning mit to rub it all over. It gave me a very nice tan overall... no orange at all considering I am very very pale. I left it on overnight and it gave me a pretty dark tan. I would repurchase when the time comes again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and I started using sunless tanner in high school when my uncle who is a surgeon convinced me how bad tanning beds are.  I&#x27;m Armenian so I tan like crazy in the sun, but without a tan I am very fair skinned.  I personally like having a tan because you can wear any color clothing without looking washed out and I am guilty of not having learned how to do my make up without using a little bronzer yet.  I used to use SUN laboratories ultra dark tanning lotion, which worked good, but decided to give spray tanning a try.  I LOVE this solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries much quicker than lotion, goes on more evenly, and gives you a dark, natural looking tan.  The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, but is what I expect for a sunless tanner.  I exfoliate my skin using sugar and gloves first.  I also wax before applying the spray or else you will get white patches where you wax after since waxing strips away all of the color on the first layer of your skin.  If this happens, it&#x27;s not cute and people will wonder what happened to you - wax first!  I put lotion on my knuckles, elbows, knees, and heels before applying this.  I also wear a hair cap to protect my hair.  Be sure to place the cap right at your hairline or else you will have a very obvious white line on your forehead.  I wear flip flops to prevent the bottom of my feet from absorbing the solution and being awkwardly super dark.  I also set up a pair of old sheets on my bed to prevent any staining while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Tubro Tan Airbrush spray system that gets the job done.  I spray one coat, beginning at my neck, do the rest of my body, then I spray my face last to avoid overdoing it.  I personally like to do a second coat for a little darker look and to touch up any areas that need it.  Your hands, feet, and face only need one coat as I&#x27;ve noticed they absorb the solution much better, and you don&#x27;t want your face to be too dark in comparison with the rest of your body.  I immediately wipe off my nails and toe nails with a tissue and water so they don&#x27;t get stained from the spray.  Then, I take the spray system apart, clean it with water, and let it dry.  Finally, I wipe down the area where I did the spray tan with a wet rag because it gets everywhere.  The key to remember is giving yourself ample amount of time for the solution to dry on your skin.  I&#x27;ve found that if I get right into bed after, I wake up with stained palms/other areas on my hand from sleeping on the solution and also it is less dark because more of it goes onto my sheets than my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this solution because it truly does give you a fairly dark, natural looking tan without any UV damage to your skin.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about extra wrinkles or skin cancer using this.  It also gives a level of color in one 10 minute session that will normally take you hours or days to get in the sun.  Nobody has time for that anymore!  I have extremely sensitive skin and have not run into any issues with this solution.  It lasts for a solid 5 days, by day 7 I&#x27;m ready for another coat.  People tell me all the time that I look tan and when I tell them it&#x27;s fake they are surprised, some even jealous because they love tanning beds &amp; I try to convert them lol  Frankly, I feel like I look a little healthier when I have some color in my face and this solution gives you plenty of color.  Remember to moisturize because I&#x27;ve found that it is a little drying on my skin and does last a little longer and more evenly if you use lotion (any brand will suffice).  The downside to spray tanning is that it does come off in patches in a pool or the ocean.  I noticed my legs lost their tan when I had them hanging in a pool in Miami but the rest of my body that wasn&#x27;t in the pool was fine.  Also, contrary to what the product description says, this will show up on your clothes, especially if you are sweating.  So far, any stains have come off in the wash for me, even on my whites.  If you go to the gym,you can get a line from your sports bra from sweating, so just keep that in mind when timing your spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give spray tanning a chance!  If you decide to, I highly recommend this product, however, if it&#x27;s your first time it might be better to start off with a lighter color like their DARK solution because mistakes with the Venetian solution will be very apparent.  Also, since you wash your face more it does fade quicker.  So far, the best solution that has worked for me is Body Drench Sunless Tanning Spray.  After a few days when the tan has started to fade on my face, I spray a little Body Drench Tanner into my hands and pat it onto my face so my neck isn&#x27;t noticeably darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a quick, super easy, dark, natural looking tan with this!!you can get a line from your sports bra from sweating, so just keep that in mind when timing your spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give spray tanning a chance!

            <li> good value and great even tan</li>
            <li> I am not a spray tan expert or professional; strictly a beginner.  If you have a spray technique you like, certainly stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with spray tans was limited to my daughter&#x27;s yearly requirement to have one prior to her cheer competition.  After a few years of this expense, I decided to order my own supplies and try to apply it myself.  For the cost of one tan, I could purchase an entire bottle of solution.  Makes sense, right?  Knowing nothing about spray tans, I decided on this product after trying to make sense out of endless reviews.  I tried to pick out some type of spraying device, but that became too confusing so I decided to just buy the solution and figure out the rest later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution arrived quickly and I could not wait to try it.  I still had no spraying device, but I had to do something (is anyone else impulsive, or is it just me?).  I forced my son to be my tanning experiment.  He has medium/dark skin tone.  After his shower, I applied it to his legs while they were still damp, but not dripping wet.  I used a small synthetic sponge (the plastic kind) and rubbed it in thoroughly with a latex-gloved hand.  The results were spectacular!  The color was rich and flattering, not orangey.  No weird smells, no grease.  It was a natural look.  I did it without spraying.  I could call it a &amp;#34;sponge tan&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;rub tan,&amp;#34; but that sounds rather strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bolstered by my success, I moved on to other family members.  My daughter was my next victim, at her request.  I was concerned how it would look on her, as her skin is very fair.  It looked good on her too!  Lastly, I applied it to myself.  We now look like a family who just returned from some exotic vacation.  No one turned orange or looked spotted.  Nice color without the harmful effects of too much sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the results, but I realize everyone has different expectations.  If you choose to apply this product without a spraying device and without any experience, here are a few lesson I learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The solution has a colorant to let you know where it is and how it has been applied - look closely.  Be sure to keep it even!  Reapply and rub whenever necessary.  For small spots that need to even out, dipping a gloved finger into the solution and rubbing it precisely where it is needed works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Experiment with the level of moisture you like skin to have when applying a tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Do not be in a hurry!  Do not apply in low lighting!  Time and bright light help significantly.  Probably common sense for the non-impulsive personalities out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please use gloves!  The colorant is not very forgiving.  A latex glove works best, but the free ones that come with hair coloring kits will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Faces seem to be particularly difficult - do them only when you are more experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*You may have drips on the floor - clean up quickly.  No spraying means less mess, but still be careful of drips and spills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Keep your newly-applied tan dry for 12 hours, if possible, to let it set into your skin.  Water drips and runs will remove the tanning solution and leave  streaks or splotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I am a 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; woman and use about 1 1/2 tablespoons to cover my legs, arms, shoulders, neck, and upper chest.  No spraying means virtually no waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I am pleased with my results.  Be sure to practice on inconspicuous areas first and then, when you like your technique, get that all over glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this information is helpful and you enjoy this wonderful product.a spraying device and without any experience, here are a few lesson I learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The solution has a colorant to let you know where it is and how it has been applied - look closely.

            <li> To start, a bit of background info....I have used this product and also the St. Tropez professional classic bronzing mist with my tanning system, this is a comparison of the two.  First off, let me say that the color this solution gives off is perfection. I have light to medium yellow toned skin, and this was very, VERY natural looking once the guide color wore off. The color has a beautiful purple toned base...sounds scary, but develops beautifully. Oh, and the color was still natural with the  guide color on after initially spraying it, just very very dark.) The smell was quite pleasant as well, not as strong or perfumey as the St.Tropez products. But alas, the color wore off so patchy and unevenly, I just couldn&#x27;t stand it. I always ALWAYS exfoliate and prep my skin with barrier cream before spraying, and also do the daily maintenance needed on spray tanned skin to ensure an even fade...i.e., moisturize with non oil based creams or lotions which don&#x27;t degrade tan quickly the way that oil based lotions can. ( I have nice skin that&#x27;s not dry anyway, but still, you have to take special care with what you use when you spray tan.) But despite all my pre and post prep work, and after three different tries with this solution, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not for me, even though the color it produces is perfect for me, but that doesn&#x27;t negate how terrible it looks as it fades, and that&#x27;s half the battle. At least St. Tropez fades evenly and I can usually redo my tan after about 4-5 days without anyone really noticing it fading badly the way they did with the Norvell solution. This is just my review, it may work for you, but in addition, I also experienced the &amp;#34;spotting&amp;#34; effect that other reviewers mentioned. Too bad, not good, and not for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome solution! Got here right on time and the clients love it! Thank You!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning solution by far!</li>
            <li> My clients and I love this product</li>
            <li> Gives great tan, smells good! Not recommended for fair and light skin. Light to medium skin is ok. Or do light spray on lighter skin tones. This one gives a medium to dark beautiful tan. I would use original on lighter skin tones. Color below this one. Other than that great product. And lasts 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> I have used almost all tanning solutions and by far this one exceeds all others in realistic color and longevity. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling for long, only a few minutes. The color continues to intensify over 24 hours, for light skin use lightly or it may look unnatural. This is by far the darkest solution that I have used so little is needed. It list no DHA content as other products do but be assured it will produce a much darker and more realistic tan than any DHA content or other tanning solution that you have ever used. Great product, sorry I didn&#x27;t discover this product sooner!</li>
            <li> Beautiful dark natural color.</li>
            <li> The color looks natural.... Looks a bit orange when it starts to fade... But will order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many sunless brands over the years, and I am EXTREMELY happy to say that I believe my lifelong search is over! When I first opened the bottle, I did notice that familiar &amp;#34;stinky scent&amp;#34; that I ABHOR!!!  That nasty smell has literally made me stop using sunless lotions for a long time..the smell was totally intolerable!! So..I sadly go and spray this on (with my own misting spray bottle)  thinking it&#x27;s same as the others, and I very happily realized after I was done, that this Norvell DOES NOT SMELL AT ALL!! Hmmm! I said to myself! The real test will tell after waking up in the morning after a full nights application! So I wake up &amp; I swear I had NO STINKY skin at all!! I&#x27;ve had this product for one week now, so far I used it twice since the first day it was delivered, and I am in Love with it. Moving on now to the color..at first I said it looks as if I&#x27;m dirty or bruised. Let me say this to you now..I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF USING A TANNING MITT and sticky feet pads!! (I just use some duct tape and it tickles my feet like crazy when pulling of off tho..but worth it if you can&#x27;t afford the pads! Anyway..WITHOUT THIS MITT, your tanning WILL BE A DISASTER! The mitt literally blends the product SO SO SO WELL that it&#x27;s almost impossible to get stained anywhere you don&#x27;t want to! If you&#x27;re familiar with blending cosmetics well then you&#x27;ll know how to use it and your tan session will be a success. I just started using this mitt and I honestly will never EVER apply sunless again without it! You can get the mitts anywhere, they&#x27;re not expensive and you WILL BE GLAD you did! The next day..I showered, saw not much/very little of  the color washing down, so I&#x27;m thinking &amp;#34;ok..see! I knew there had to be a catch! It&#x27;s washing off!&amp;#34; To my surprise..I pat/air dry and I know NOW that was the excess tint that is supposed to wash off! I can&#x27;t even put into words how much I LOVE the color!! After only 2 applications, I am done!! No smell, Igot a deep violet-ish bronze color!! I gotta go now and catch up with work..I know I almost wrote a book here, but I really REALLY am so happy! I&#x27;ll update soon as to how long it lasts for me and will try to upload some pics of my skin when done...b4 and afters..</li>
            <li> Sprays on well, longer dry time, feels a bit tacky when dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about five different tanning products and this solution tips then all. The color is a gorgeous chocolate. Norvell products are great in general. Will be buying again</li>
            <li> Was as described and its amazon prime delivered in 2 days great.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good-not like other sunless tanning sprays the problem that I have with it is that it is too BROWN. It&#x27;s not a huge problem because better brown than orange, but I feel kind of embarrassed sometimes when I&#x27;m not careful to keep the sprayer at a full arms length and for the next 8 hours until I shower I look...well I&#x27;ve got brown hair and everything on me is the same color, so it looks a little odd. When I shower off it&#x27;s much better, but then the problem is really just on my lets, it seems like the solution sticks into my pours, so legs look a little dotted. I don&#x27;t think this solution lasts threw a couple of shaves as well as the ocean product I used to use but sadly is no longer on amazon. In summation-it&#x27;s not bad it&#x27;s just not great, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work with a variety of skin tones. Definitely for the darker toned people, who probably don&#x27;t use airbrush anyways because they&#x27;re blessed with bronzed skin!</li>
            <li> Love it - gives me a very nice color and seems to last.  Recommended to me by a friend and glad I bought it.  Bottle is HUGE for personal use though.</li>
            <li> This product arrived expired and opened. I will never order again.</li>
            <li> Works great for me but my husband is more fair skinned and thus one doesn&#x27;t seem to want to stick to him and turns him a little orange. As for myself it gives me a rich dark tan. The difference in skin tones tells me to order separate items for the both of us.</li>
            <li> Best color out there - I&#x27;m really fair and this last ALL week even while I workout daily! The color is not orange at all and it gives you a glow, I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> I have bought 5-6 different tanners lately and this seems to be my favorite. The color is natural, but I feel a little dirty looking that first day. (Also, I spray myself before bed and then wake up to shower bMaybe because I&#x27;m doing 2 coats?) Anyway, after that first day I love the color! Lasts about 5 days also.</li>
            <li> Everything was great except for the fact the solution expiration date was for last month. Hopefully it won&#x27;t effect my clients tan results. Just a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the one hour drying time but it was a bit orange , although norvelle is by far to me to be the best solution on the market ! I will buy again for the one hour aspect!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and over 40, I use the Norvelle original til I get a natural sun glow tone then I use this formula to a achieve the dark color I prefer.  My husband is the sprayer and it comes out perfect everytime! It is the only formula I have found that fades gradually, never looks orange or green.  Exfoliate periodically and you will have no regrets!  Lastly, since I am older I like this product because it does not &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; my skin as other brands have done.  For a faux tan this product is the best for just wanting a tan anytime. --CLD</li>
            <li> Love love love! One of the best solutions. Works for all skin tones. No orange color just a gorgeous golden brown!</li>
            <li> love the color of this! gives a good dark color that complements my olive skin tone perfectly!</li>
            <li> Perfect for fair skin.  You can&#x27;t tell its sunless at all!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about this purchase being pretty pale. I used it and it&#x27;s great!! It wasn&#x27;t too dark for me and fades great! I use it all the time and I don&#x27;t feel orange!!</li>
            <li> Use within 60 days product turns gray quickly</li>
            <li> no orange  never found a self tanner that didn &#x27;t turn me orange  so very natural looking  its amazing how many people  think i went on vacation because of the brown tones  this is the only kind to use  there is one thats darker but this one is dark enough  if u want darker do another coat  excellent product</li>
