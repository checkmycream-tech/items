            <li> As usual, believe it, I always have an allergic skin reaction to the clips used with some medical equipment such as EKG&#x27;s, Heart Monitors, etc.  </li>
            <li> I broke out, again, as usual, with a skin rash where each clip was placed on my skin and also attached to the medical equipment.</li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t help me I don&#x27;t know if I got bad batch but would like a free package</li>
            <li> I tried each item in the kit and within a week and a half, my skin has cleared up.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema really bad and the soap and the creams give him tremendous relief.</li>
            <li> Then I would use the mitesol cream as an everyday moisturizer and use the sulpher butter as a night time cream.</li>
            <li> The soap lathered plesantly, giving an annoying and unpleasant situation a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> This kit relieved the skin rashes in  a timely manner that was unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Some areas were worse than others.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have not received the Mitesil cream in my package.</li>

            <li> I have had eczema for years. I tried each item in the kit and within a week and a half, my skin has cleared up. I did not see a sheet of instructions so this is how I used the items. I would wash with the bar of soap. I then made an astringent with the tea tree, neem oil and witch hazel and used a cotton ball to dab on the affected area. Then I would use the mitesol cream as an everyday moisturizer and use the sulpher butter as a night time cream. My skin is also very soft.</li>
            <li> Love the sulfur soap!</li>
            <li> it works will recommend anytime</li>
            <li> I didnt like these products at all ... Did absolutely nothing..:/</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help me I don&#x27;t know if I got bad batch but would like a free package</li>
            <li> The products were ok. My tea tree oil was open and was all in the box.  Thank u and have a nice day. Tina  Styles</li>
            <li> No it did not work i used all of it I will never buy it again I was very disapointed</li>
            <li> The items work well so far but unfortunately I have not received the Mitesil cream in my package.</li>
            <li> the product works for me</li>
            <li> Good product. Needs application information though.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and gave relief to itching even quicker. The essential oils alone are worth the package and the soaps are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great products! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Exceeded our expectations. Helped us get rid of scabies. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I had severe scabies from (undocumented ?) Honduran in our area. The standard meds worked but it was a fight, I am not sure I was winning. The Mite S Pack  helped stop the reinfection that happens with scabies.</li>
            <li> The products exceeded my expectations!  I was hoping to receive products that would be satisfactory and maybe help with my kids skin irritations.  It was a pleasant surprise to receive high quality products that successfully clear up the skin irritations!  Thank you Braunfels Lab!</li>
            <li> As usual, believe it, I always have an allergic skin reaction to the clips used with some medical equipment such as EKG&#x27;s, Heart Monitors, etc.  During a recent ER visit, the largest clips I&#x27;d ever seen were attached to my skin.  I broke out, again, as usual, with a skin rash where each clip was placed on my skin and also attached to the medical equipment. Some areas were worse than others.  This kit relieved the skin rashes in  a timely manner that was unbelievable.  The soap lathered plesantly, giving an annoying and unpleasant situation a pleasant experience. The creamy skin butter and ointment were a nice aftertouch, as well as the essential oils, which I used so quickly, I almost forgot that they actually part of this kit...a truly pleasant experience. Thank you!</li>
            <li> no instructions at all with it</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Easy to use, no problems at all.  Recommend for anyone having skin itch problems due to mites of any type.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product! It worked wonders for me, I would recommend it as well as purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema really bad and the soap and the creams give him tremendous relief.</li>
