            <li> It&#x27;s a small basic kit.</li>

            <li> but they so small</li>
            <li> Needless to say, neither of our piercings got infected</li>

            <li> It was great. Needles are sharp and easy to push through. Do sterilize before use even if it says it&#x27;s already sterilized.</li>
            <li> Everything was as stated. Just wish it came with piercing jewelry and not costume jewelry</li>
            <li> Everything came on time with the quality I expected (:</li>
            <li> Fast delivery sharper needles and cute jewelry i will def be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> No complaints. Everything came as pictured. I&#x27;m very pleased considering I paid less than ten dolors for this - which I used to pierce my own belly button along with a friend. Needless to say, neither of our piercings got infected</li>
            <li> IT is very sharp! Works great. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was there clamps. Over all though it was a great product especially because of the price! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the tongue ring is link not red and the belly dangle jewlry was broken.</li>
            <li> I pierced my navel as soon as I got it.  It was a smooth process. The needle are sharp and everything is sterile. Plus the Rings are so cute!!</li>
            <li> when i got this kit it came on time and everything was there but the ring opener and the closer were very cheep and didnt really help anything but i didnt really get it for that purpose. anyway i pierced my labret and the studs and pretty much everything is all standard size so my lip begins to swell typical but the labret started to embedded itself in my lips and it hurts sooooo bad! i wouldnt have gotten this kit  i would have bought the needles and stud or whatever u want in a different kit</li>
            <li> came on time everything they said was in there was vary pleased with product be sided the jewlery it was vary small but other then that vary happy</li>
            <li> Everything was as advertised.  And it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It came on time...the rings a cute..but they so small</li>
            <li> Neat to be able to do my own piercing</li>
            <li> iv got so much use out of this package !!!! its really every thing you need</li>
            <li> quick delivery, got it before the date said but on serious gross out feature there was a hair in with one of the blue forceps... cleaning with alcohol but still not something you want to find in a bag of piercing utensils..</li>
            <li> I pierced my belly button right away and had no problems at all.  The clamps are kind of cheap but they get the job done. The needles are very sharp and make the actual piercing very easy. This is my first body piercing and I was pleasantly surprised at how  painless the whole prosses was and I&#x27;m pretty sure this kit was the main reason I was able to do this myself with no problems whatsoever.  The jewlary is very cute too. Red is my favorite color so this was perfect for me!!!</li>
            <li> I like this. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small basic kit. everything is unopened and sterilized the forceps are useable but I recommend stainless steel ones. the metal rings are nice but the red navel ring is a little cheap.</li>
            <li> this was a great thing for the ears</li>
