            <li>Yes, they are greasier than you would expect, but that&#x27;s what helps with the amazing moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Nice but would prefer to buy separately rather than a set of 4.</li>
            <li>More of a balm than a scrub but still good.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and leaves my lips feeling so smooth!</li>

            <li>I love this product, I used like 20 times a day</li>

            <li>Glad I found a scrub for just lips.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS product.  </li>
            <li>I love them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I absolutely love these here is my video review on</li>
            <li>Love this lip scrub.</li>
            <li>Love what the product does.</li>
            <li>Flavor good ..tried it for the first..</li>
            <li>I love how my lips feel afterwards and as time gos by I have noticed how smooth my lips are</li>
            <li>They smell wonderful and got most of the dead skin off.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve tried others that are better but still gets the job done so not bad</li>
            <li>This lip scrub is really good, it leaves your lips very soft and its smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a very good product and definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li>These made my lips feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>they keep my lips so smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth with I guess the grit that does the exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>(OMH - Horchata - which is fabulous)...</li>
            <li>But other then that was a good purchase!</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t leave my lips perfectly smooth after the first use, after a couple more uses in the week, my lips were nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I had to clean my sink afterwards...</li>
            <li>It came to me stacked together and individually wrapped, my mother is using the almond one while I gush over the cheery and apple.</li>
            <li>and honestly they are natural nothing aggressive like a lot out on the market</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>These are great for getting rid of the dead skin.</li>
            <li>fun purchase though.</li>
            <li>When I wash it off, for a short time afterward, my lips feel kind of.. greasy?</li>
            <li>Fun flavors.</li>
            <li>and I love these little cute containers they are colorful</li>
            <li>Their also great for small gifts.</li>
            <li>not sure that should be needed lol.</li>
            <li>My only complaint was the feeling of the scrub against my teeth, but that&#x27;s just my own carelessness. :P</li>
            <li>I was interested</li>
            <li>first time using a lip scrub</li>
            <li>I refused to spend $20 to $30 for a jar of lip scrub pretty close in size to one of these jars.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I thought it&#x27;d be..</li>
            <li>LEAVE MY LIFTS SOFT AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>The scrub works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>When I use an exfoliating lip treatment, I want to do the entire lip including the edges because that is where the wrinkles are most visible.  </li>
            <li>but besides that does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
            <li>My lips get chapped and dry very easily.</li>
            <li>they leave my lips super soft !!</li>
            <li>They do moisten my lips quite nicely after wiped with a warm washcloth but failed to remove excess skin from my lip.</li>
            <li>I use them in the shower every night and my lips feel better than they have in a very, very, long time.</li>
            <li>They smell is very nice and the only thing is that they leave your lips slightly sticky</li>
            <li>Kinda stick good scrub though just the liquid is hard to get off</li>
            <li>I believe I will pay a little more for better quality next time</li>
            <li>Love the flavored, but the scrub was a bit harsher than expected.</li>
            <li>So much residue.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
            <li>shipping was fast will reorder again..</li>
            <li>DIDNT REALLY LIKE THE CHERRY ONE.</li>
            <li>These lip scrubs have no smell and are really greasy.</li>
            <li>My lips seems smooth enough after the scrub, but...  </li>
            <li>The containers are a little smaller than I anticipated, but the product is very nice.</li>
            <li>Basically start off with clean lips, get a tiny swab with a q-tip, wouldn&#x27;t really use my fingers because it gets stuck under my nails.</li>
            <li>The brand I mentioned above - the scrub is loose - just like a sugar srub for your body -and rinses off clean and easy...</li>
            <li>so these are not cheap they kinda remind me of all natural and my lips love this stuff and after my Iips look so juicy and plumped up and ready for lip condtioners</li>
            <li>it had far too much vegetable oil or</li>
            <li>It can be a little  waxy and hard to remove  the grit, but works incredibly  well</li>
            <li>and it keeps my lips so soft!</li>
            <li>The Elf exfoliating stick is easier to use and clear. -Colleen</li>
            <li>My lips feel moisturized, they are smoother and they feel so soft when I am finished using this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why so many people were saying negative things about these.</li>
            <li>Though I use lip balm everyday, this scrub has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other scrubs &amp;amp; those you could actually &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; but these you have to wipe off, which IMO is the less appealing option.  </li>
            <li>I wanted some variety to the only lip scrub I&#x27;ve purchased so far</li>
            <li>candy accidentally sent me the wrong product at first, but then corrected it promptly and sent me the original product with a BONUS 6 piece lip gloss set.</li>
            <li>It is a little too much wax or oil in it so it is hard to clean off.</li>
            <li>She likes the result of soft lips, but the scrub is very oily and the oil is hard to get off if you get it on your face or around your lips.</li>

            <li> It feels gritty like a salt scrub but doesn&#x27;t have sharp pieces or larger chunks like some of the nutshell exfoliants</li>
            <li> I mean they are moisturizing and somewhat exfoliating, just really wish they didn&#x27;t use petroleum..</li>
            <li> the only downfall it&#x27;s not edible like some other brands</li>
            <li> It does help with dry winter lips though.  </li>
            <li> Only issue is the next day you can still see some dead skin and splits in your lip.  </li>
            <li> First off the reviews are very confusing</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one downside, but since I&#x27;ve never used lip scrub previous to these, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just all lip scrubs.</li>
            <li> I used this when my lips were very dry.</li>
            <li> Although it has a sticky texture it actually works on removing dead skin from lips.</li>
            <li> Works well on lips; not really any &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; in them that I could tell</li>
            <li> Because of the tint in some of the treatments the skin around your mouth gets a pink stain.  </li>
            <li> Product works well without being to rough of the lips.</li>
            <li> Due to this I will give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> It is not oily like other lip scrubs.</li>
            <li> sticky, hard on your lips, not a good product for such a sensitive part of our body.</li>
            <li> Addicted to how soft this makes my lips feel!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick but a tiny bit gos a long way.  </li>
            <li> My only big complaint is the artificial color used- particularly in the Dark Cherry.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is they are not sugar scrubs</li>
            <li> I tried the Dark Cherry yesterday and the consistency is like PASTE and it stains your lip area...</li>
            <li> .. felt like it left a thick greasy feeling and couldn&#x27;t come off with water.</li>
            <li> No more flaky, dry lips after I started using this a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> just less money .&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am not sure if this is due to the moisturizer I am using, perhaps it is not moistening my lips as they should.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is a little tough to take off.</li>
            <li> Takes off all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> One was missing.</li>
            <li> The scrubs are okay--the problem is that they are very oily and so it is very difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> Had very little scrub use.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if i&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> Echoing another reviewer&#x27;s thoughts - Cheaper is NOT better...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not pleased.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why they even have a flavor choice.</li>
            <li> So thick.</li>
            <li> the residue was so thick..</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; as I can&#x27;t tell any difference in taste, some have a tiny bit of a scent.  </li>
            <li> Very thick like lip gloss.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even worse I will be getting pimples around my mouth</li>
            <li> leave the nasty thick film on your lip doesn&#x27;t get rid of any dry skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money!!!!</li>
            <li> it was nearly impossible to get off...</li>
            <li> and I shouldn&#x27;t of have really bad product</li>
            <li> AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Horrible.. IS NOT A SCRUB..</li>
            <li> awful stuff..</li>
            <li> Smell and taste is horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great for me :D I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These made my lips feel fantastic. My lips get chapped and dry very easily. These are great for getting rid of the dead skin. They are really great quality for their price. I love them. I would definitely purchase them again</li>
            <li> they keep my lips so smooth</li>
            <li> Love the flavored, but the scrub was a bit harsher than expected.</li>
            <li> So much residue. So thick. AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Although it has a sticky texture it actually works on removing dead skin from lips. Also, this lasts ages! I&#x27;ve been using the vanilla bean one (sometimes twice) a week for 7 months now i it&#x27;s still going on. Not sure if i&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It came to me stacked together and individually wrapped, my mother is using the almond one while I gush over the cheery and apple. The vanilla doesn&#x27;t quite have a smell to it. Overall it&#x27;s a very good product and definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li> Awesome scrubs and they smell great. My only complaint is they are not sugar scrubs so if you end up tasting it, its like eating sand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it.  It was too oily and sticky at times.  I ended up throwing them all away.</li>
            <li> Addicted to how soft this makes my lips feel!</li>
            <li> leave the nasty thick film on your lip doesn&#x27;t get rid of any dry skin the particles in to use to scrub disintegrate quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and God did I mention the film!&lt;br /&gt;and I have oily skin so trust me now it&#x27;s even worse I will be getting pimples around my mouth</li>
            <li> It leaves a gunk on your lips I read the review before purchasing and ignored it and I shouldn&#x27;t of have really bad product</li>
            <li> I think they work but I&#x27;ve only used them twice. They smell is very nice and the only thing is that they leave your lips slightly sticky but I just might not be washing the scrub off enough.</li>
            <li> Love these. Works great, and has a wonderful sent.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this s*** ! Damn things pissed me off ,$7 for 4 tiny ass lip scrubs ! Like got damn</li>
            <li> This is a Wonderful product same&lt;br /&gt;Stuff as lush product just less money .&lt;br /&gt;And you get four instead of one.</li>
            <li> I love these!  I never knew there was a scrub just for your Lips!! I was interested so I ordered thing set.  And I love them.  1st I love the smells. It&#x27;s very thick but a tiny bit gos a long way.  It&#x27;s smooth with I guess the grit that does the exfoliating.  I love how my lips feel afterwards and as time gos by I have noticed how smooth my lips are but my skin looks better.  I love theses!!!!</li>
            <li> A greet value and buy! These will last me a long time! Their also great for small gifts. I love them!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Almond creme is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye candy accidentally sent me the wrong product at first, but then corrected it promptly and sent me the original product with a BONUS 6 piece lip gloss set. The lip glosses are equally amazing and I could not be any more thrilled with the products I received. Thank you Eye Candy!</li>
            <li> Excellent product-exactly as described. Arrived one day earlier than anticipated-everything was perfect. Never have had a problem with anything I have ordered!!</li>
            <li> I bought this four pack for my daughter. She likes the result of soft lips, but the scrub is very oily and the oil is hard to get off if you get it on your face or around your lips. She can only use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works well on lips; not really any &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; in them that I could tell</li>
            <li> Kinda stick good scrub though just the liquid is hard to get off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other scrubs &amp;amp; those you could actually &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; but these you have to wipe off, which IMO is the less appealing option.  It does help with dry winter lips though.  Follow with a good lip moisturizer to increase the effect.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well</li>
            <li> Flavor good ..tried it for the first..the vanilla bean loved it..shipping was fast will reorder again..first time using a lip scrub</li>
            <li> I love the smells! They are great scrubs, I use them in the shower. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is a little tough to take off. It is a little too much wax or oil in it so it is hard to clean off. I have to exfoliate with regular face wash after exfoliating...not sure that should be needed lol. fun purchase though.</li>
            <li> I refused to spend $20 to $30 for a jar of lip scrub pretty close in size to one of these jars. For a fraction of the cost I was able to get four jars of this lip scrub and I&#x27;m sold. A little goes a long way and so far I have only one of them. My lips feel moisturized, they are smoother and they feel so soft when I am finished using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I used like 20 times a day and it keeps my lips so soft! I too it off with some eos Chapstick and it just completes it. Used it once and I saw a total difference. Takes off all the dead skin off. The only downside to this product is that it&#x27;s not edible lol but it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I thought it&#x27;d be.. but make sure you ley people know iy contains or was made from nuts, from the walnut!</li>
            <li> LEAVE MY LIFTS SOFT AND SMOOTH. GIVE IT A TRY! VANILLA BEAN IS THE BEST FLAVOR. DIDNT REALLY LIKE THE CHERRY ONE.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price but I&#x27;ve tried others that are better but still gets the job done so not bad</li>
            <li> sticky, hard on your lips, not a good product for such a sensitive part of our body. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Loveee them .. they leave my lips super soft !!</li>
            <li> Great price for four pieces! They last forever, too. There&#x27;s only one downside, but since I&#x27;ve never used lip scrub previous to these, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just all lip scrubs. When I wash it off, for a short time afterward, my lips feel kind of.. greasy? Like they still have something on them. Maybe because I wash it off with my hands instead of a cloth? It&#x27;s not a big deal, though, since the feeling doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Horrible.. IS NOT A SCRUB.. Is a lip balm.. And it&#x27;s not eligible for returns..</li>
            <li> Great for smoother lip&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these for people with very and easily chapped lips!!! Also, the texture is abit pasty. But on the plus side they came about a day before the estimated shipping day. They smell wonderful and got most of the dead skin off. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be wasting your money with this product!</li>
            <li> Nice but would prefer to buy separately rather than a set of 4.</li>
            <li> These lip scrubs have no smell and are really greasy. They do moisten my lips quite nicely after wiped with a warm washcloth but failed to remove excess skin from my lip. I believe I will pay a little more for better quality next time I buy lip scrub.</li>
            <li> Glad I found a scrub for just lips. No more flaky, dry lips after I started using this a couple times a week. Seals in moisture and has pleasant smells/flavors. Though I use lip balm everyday, this scrub has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS product.  Felt my lips feeling great.</li>
            <li> The containers are a little smaller than I anticipated, but the product is very nice. While it didn&#x27;t leave my lips perfectly smooth after the first use, after a couple more uses in the week, my lips were nice and soft. My only complaint was the feeling of the scrub against my teeth, but that&#x27;s just my own carelessness. :P</li>
            <li> The scrub works pretty well.  Only issue is the next day you can still see some dead skin and splits in your lip.  i am not sure if this is due to the moisturizer I am using, perhaps it is not moistening my lips as they should.  My lips seems smooth enough after the scrub, but...  Due to this I will give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> More of a balm than a scrub but still good.</li>
            <li> This lip scrub is really good, it leaves your lips very soft and its smells fantastic. It is not oily like other lip scrubs.</li>
            <li> Honestly... they&#x27;re okay. I feel like the consistency of the scrubs are that of petroleum and molasses.. if you are intending on buying this I&#x27;m going to tell you the best way to use them. Basically start off with clean lips, get a tiny swab with a q-tip, wouldn&#x27;t really use my fingers because it gets stuck under my nails. Apply it on JUST your lips with the q-tip and then make a big smiley face and scrub your lips against each other (or use your finger for extra scrubbing). After this, grab a moist paper towel or washcloth and then you can wipe it off. Overall, I did not like it.. felt like it left a thick greasy feeling and couldn&#x27;t come off with water. I mean they are moisturizing and somewhat exfoliating, just really wish they didn&#x27;t use petroleum..</li>
            <li> Meh.  This is basically petroleum jelly with a gritty walnut shell exfoliant inside.  It feels gritty like a salt scrub but doesn&#x27;t have sharp pieces or larger chunks like some of the nutshell exfoliants have so that is good!  I was disappointed with the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; as I can&#x27;t tell any difference in taste, some have a tiny bit of a scent.  My only big complaint is the artificial color used- particularly in the Dark Cherry.  When I use an exfoliating lip treatment, I want to do the entire lip including the edges because that is where the wrinkles are most visible.  Because of the tint in some of the treatments the skin around your mouth gets a pink stain.  Bleck.  Don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.  The Elf exfoliating stick is easier to use and clear. -Colleen</li>
            <li> These are very lovely! I ordered them on November 29 and they just got here on December 1.&lt;br /&gt;They are not to sugary&lt;br /&gt;But I love them.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish there was more sugar.</li>
            <li> First off the reviews are very confusing so I ignored and went with my gut feeling and I love these little cute containers they are colorful and honestly they are natural nothing aggressive like a lot out on the market so these are not cheap they kinda remind me of all natural and my lips love this stuff and after my Iips look so juicy and plumped up and ready for lip condtioners so this is the way to go if you don&#x27;t want to make your lips irritated this is it..</li>
            <li> Echoing another reviewer&#x27;s thoughts - Cheaper is NOT better... I wanted some variety to the only lip scrub I&#x27;ve purchased so far (OMH - Horchata - which is fabulous)... Thought I was getting a great deal - and instead what I got was STICKY GOB! I tried the Dark Cherry yesterday and the consistency is like PASTE and it stains your lip area... it was nearly impossible to get off... had to use a cloth with makeup remover.. the residue was so thick.. I had to clean my sink afterwards... awful stuff.. While I get they are trying to keep your lips moisturized while exfoliating... it had far too much vegetable oil or whatever else they used.... The brand I mentioned above - the scrub is loose - just like a sugar srub for your body -and rinses off clean and easy... this product is so inferior - I wouldn&#x27;t even use it on my feet... I&#x27;m tossing them all... Save your money - and try another brand.</li>
            <li> It can be a little  waxy and hard to remove  the grit, but works incredibly  well</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these here is my video review on youtube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Great product i love it just not my taste in flavors, would prefer Peach, Strawberry, Lemon &amp; Grape or Tangerine</li>
            <li> Love this lip scrub. Smells so good and leaves my lips feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li> too greasy, did not taste good either or provide a good scrub for lips</li>
            <li> Items were as described and made great gifts.</li>
            <li> The scrubs are okay--the problem is that they are very oily and so it is very difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> Did not receive all 4 lip scrubs. One was missing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not pleased. I don&#x27;t like the feel or texture of this. It just feels gross. I&#x27;m probably just going to make my own homemade lip scrubs from here on out.</li>
            <li> Works great! No smell or flavor so I&#x27;m not sure why they even have a flavor choice. But other then that was a good purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product for great price. Yes you have to wipe it off, but it states that in the description. Fun flavors. Product works well without being to rough of the lips.</li>
            <li> I like it. the only downfall it&#x27;s not edible like some other brands but besides that does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why so many people were saying negative things about these. I use them in the shower every night and my lips feel better than they have in a very, very, long time. No Kore peeling lips. Also they smell super good too. Yes, they are greasier than you would expect, but that&#x27;s what helps with the amazing moisturizing. I will probably keep my bathroom stocked with these always.</li>
            <li> Junk!  Very thick like lip gloss. Had very little scrub use.  Smell and taste is horrible.  Don&#x27;t waste ur money!!!!</li>
            <li> Love what the product does. I just wish there was a way to wash it off in the shower, instead of wiping it off. It leaves this oily residue that I am not a fan of.</li>
            <li> Nice feel on the lips and smooths  nicely.  Very nice flavor while scrubbing.  would def by again when I run out of this product</li>
            <li> I used this when my lips were very dry. It helped to exfoliate and moisturize them. I gave some of them away as stocking stuffers.</li>
