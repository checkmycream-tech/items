            <li>But it is definitley a good product !</li>
            <li>However, it works great on acne scars and brown spots.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about NADINOLA is once you start seeing results, you will be able to see progress after each use</li>

            <li>This amazing cram</li>
            <li>Nadinola is one of the best fade creams you can purchase at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>just because I thought I looked better in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My skin never felt better.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong but not offensive.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs easily, has a light smell and no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I tried using this stuff for a significant amount of time...</li>
            <li>It leave your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Of all of the fade creams I&#x27;ve used from Ambi to Porcelana, this is the only one that actually smells NICE!!  </li>
            <li>and this isn&#x27;t important, but you can easily peel the label right off and rinse out the jar when it&#x27;s empty and reuse it for something else.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with Nadinola but let me preface that it&#x27;s part of a TOTAL regimen I use.</li>
            <li>My freckles have lightened so much, some of them are gone!  </li>
            <li>I really like this product it helps even out ur skin tone.</li>
            <li>, that is to say: this is a very satisfactory product.  </li>
            <li>gradually it&#x27;s a moisturerizer and very nutritional  </li>
            <li>i recommand this item to my family and friends thanks for doing bussiness w/ me the item was as it was decribed.</li>
            <li>It contains Hydroquinone which has been banned in most countries due to is high level of toxicity.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>this item was highly recommend, i have used it for the one week and no progress.</li>
            <li>This does not mean that it will not work for you.</li>
            <li>It really does work in helping clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li>I could possibly have not bought it for the right purpose, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>My face is one smooth yellow color and it looks like I am 24 years younger.  </li>
            <li>It is really strong though, so I tend not to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I tested it on my hand, and I could not believe that all of the early signs of aging and sun damage are COMPLETELY gone!.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had a recent outbreak of under-the-jaw cystic acne that may have been the result of a new and intense exercise-sauna-steam regimen.</li>
            <li>My skin got darker, then started to peel and then got clear.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dual action make your skin.clear</li>
            <li>It might be a bit heavy for someone that likes a lighter lotion, but I like the clean soft smelling feel of it.</li>
            <li>while I have only had this product a short while, and do not expect too much from it, I look forward to putting in on at night.</li>
            <li>This is the LEAST expensive and very best!  </li>
            <li>I am a light skinned African American (Puerto Rican and Black).  </li>
            <li>My long time black spots on face being faded away slowly and skin tone looks to be good.</li>
            <li>I am having better results with this product in comparison to other fade creams I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>and my skin will be clear enough to only have to use smidgen of concealer over the spots.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend finding some other method of treatment.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend finding some other method of treatment.</li>
            <li> Had a black mark on the nose dues to pimples that was there for 3 weeks and showed no signs of lightening, applied Nadinola and it was gone completely in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy on the skin, (but they ALL are) and in the summer, you WILL sweat and feel this cream, but if you want to lighten those freckles or blemishes fast, without a prescription, then Nadinola is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> My moisturizing mix of lotion/organic oils absorb really well over the thin layer of Nadinola.  </li>
            <li> I keep my powdered mineral makeup in my empty jars.</li>
            <li> I had pretty low self esteem in my early 20&#x27;s and like an idiot, I wore make up to bed</li>
            <li> Results for me are usually noticed by the 3rd week.</li>
            <li> It has virtually no effect that I could see and was not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> and I av started to see slight changes on my discoloration.  </li>
            <li> Nadinola is considerable less expensive and offer 3% hydroquinone.  </li>
            <li> Everything got messy on two parts of my face and the darkness around healing acne marks is part of the process.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I notice my skin looking dull I will use it.  </li>
            <li> My mother used this on very bad dark sun spots she had in her hands and in less than 3 months they were half gone.</li>
            <li> Improvements on my face are not as dramatic as my hands, but still I do see slow improvement.  </li>
            <li> I do have a small broken blood vessel on my nose and it has not changed the color of that whatsoever, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I did a number on my poor face, resulting in acne scaring.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed with the product came very late two weeks after I made the order, also not as big as it looks in the picture!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is just false!  </li>
            <li> I have used prescription strength 4% hydroquinone in a very expensive leading brand product that smelled so BAD, I had to stop using that product.  </li>
            <li> very disappointment with this</li>
            <li> This stuff is dangerous!!!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I applied as it says but no results.... I dont recommend it. . .&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy it ... It does not work</li>
            <li> I had pretty low self esteem in my early 20&#x27;s and like an idiot, I wore make up to bed just because I thought I looked better in the morning.  I never wanted to be seen without make up on, even if it was smeared all over my face from the night before.  I did a number on my poor face, resulting in acne scaring.  I also have brown spots from burning my face on a cruise I took.  This stuff works fantastic.  I buy it regularly.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I notice my skin looking dull I will use it.  I do have a small broken blood vessel on my nose and it has not changed the color of that whatsoever, unfortunately.  However, it works great on acne scars and brown spots.  Will continue to buy as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> Its really good product. My long time black spots on face being faded away slowly and skin tone looks to be good.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with Nadinola but let me preface that it&#x27;s part of a TOTAL regimen I use. My dermatologist wanted over $100 for his private label 4% hydroquinone product but I couldn&#x27;t afford it at the time. I&#x27;d had a recent outbreak of under-the-jaw cystic acne that may have been the result of a new and intense exercise-sauna-steam regimen. No matter. Everything got messy on two parts of my face and the darkness around healing acne marks is part of the process. I use Nadinola at night about 4 nights a week (the others night I use a retin A cream and I use Lerosett as a mask every night). My skin got darker, then started to peel and then got clear. I figure I have about another 3 weeks and my skin will be clear enough to only have to use smidgen of concealer over the spots.  I started using Nadinola about 4-5 weeks ago. I am African-American.</li>
            <li> Had a black mark on the nose dues to pimples that was there for 3 weeks and showed no signs of lightening, applied Nadinola and it was gone completely in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it helps even out ur skin tone. I have discoloration around my nose and ears. I av Been using this product for about  3 weeks and I av started to see slight changes on my discoloration.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work over night, it takes a while but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> while I have only had this product a short while, and do not expect too much from it, I look forward to putting in on at night. It smells good and I like the feel of it.  It might be a bit heavy for someone that likes a lighter lotion, but I like the clean soft smelling feel of it.</li>
            <li> I tried using this stuff for a significant amount of time...It has virtually no effect that I could see and was not worth the money.  I could possibly have not bought it for the right purpose, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used prescription strength 4% hydroquinone in a very expensive leading brand product that smelled so BAD, I had to stop using that product.  Nadinola is considerable less expensive and offer 3% hydroquinone.  I waited for 3 months to report my experience, that is to say: this is a very satisfactory product.  The smell is strong but not offensive.  I tested it on my hand, and I could not believe that all of the early signs of aging and sun damage are COMPLETELY gone!.  Improvements on my face are not as dramatic as my hands, but still I do see slow improvement.  I am taking sequential photos for an objective comparison.  This is a good value for a good product.</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily, under my moisturizing regimen and I have noticed that the hyperpigmentation has lessened since I started using this product about a month ago.  It absorbs easily, has a light smell and no greasy residue.  My moisturizing mix of lotion/organic oils absorb really well over the thin layer of Nadinola.  My skin never felt better.  A must try.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with the product came very late two weeks after I made the order, also not as big as it looks in the picture!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is dangerous!!!  It contains Hydroquinone which has been banned in most countries due to is high level of toxicity.  This stuff can turn your skin blue and do permanent damage.  Don&#x27;t believe me ....  GOOGLE the Hydroquinone danger!!!!  Highly recommend finding some other method of treatment.</li>
            <li> I am getting results with this cream. Can&#x27;t compare to others because it&#x27;s the only I&#x27;ve tried, so I gave it a 4.  Have used for a month to 6 weeks and brown spots are fading. Easy to use and great price, plus contains SPF.</li>
            <li> I have  some freckles and sun spots on my cheeks and this product got rid of them in a week  ,I use it religiously ,but the only thing to keep the result is you have to use it twice or 3times a week so the spots won&#x27;t come back .....highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over one month for hyperpigmentation on my chin. I am having better results with this product in comparison to other fade creams I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy a product with over 2mg of Hydroquinone without a prescription.  With a script, you can get a 4mg cream.  But this company somehow gets away with making and selling a 3mg product and I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now.  My freckles have lightened so much, some of them are gone!  I use this cream every morning and every night and the best part?  Of all of the fade creams I&#x27;ve used from Ambi to Porcelana, this is the only one that actually smells NICE!!  It&#x27;s a little heavy on the skin, (but they ALL are) and in the summer, you WILL sweat and feel this cream, but if you want to lighten those freckles or blemishes fast, without a prescription, then Nadinola is the way to go.  I buy it at Amazon, cheaper than ebay even!  Another thing I like and this isn&#x27;t important, but you can easily peel the label right off and rinse out the jar when it&#x27;s empty and reuse it for something else.  I keep my powdered mineral makeup in my empty jars.</li>
            <li> This amazing cram it&#x27;s dual action make your skin.clear gradually it&#x27;s a moisturerizer and very nutritional  To your ski  what better than this!</li>
            <li> this item was highly recommend, i have used it for the one week and no progress. very disappointment with this</li>
            <li> For me at this moment NADINOLA is the best. It leave your skin nice and soft. The best thing about NADINOLA is once you start seeing results, you will be able to see progress after each use</li>
            <li> I like this product! It really does work in helping clear up blemishes. It is really strong though, so I tend not to use it everyday. But it is definitley a good product !</li>
            <li> The reality is lightening/ fading hyper-pigmentation of the skin is a lengthy task. But I can say in my experience Nadinola is one of the best fade creams you can purchase at a reasonable price. Results for me are usually noticed by the 3rd week.</li>
            <li> My mother used this on very bad dark sun spots she had in her hands and in less than 3 months they were half gone.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to try to even up my skin tone.  It did not work for me.  This does not mean that it will not work for you.</li>
            <li> i recommand this item to my family and friends thanks for doing bussiness w/ me the item was as it was decribed.</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned African American (Puerto Rican and Black).  I uses it a a daily facial to reduce the \\&quot;Shaving Shadow\\&quot; from decades of shaving AND from being out in the sun working out at the park!  IT WORKS EXCELLENT.  I take two dabs and put them on each cheek.  Then, I take both hands and do my ENTIRE face from forehead, eyes, ears, back of ears and neck (including all your chin and neck areas).  My face is one smooth yellow color and it looks like I am 24 years younger.  Further there is NO danger of hydroquinone as one reviewer states.  This is just false!  All tanning and SPF lotions have it with no affects.  This is the LEAST expensive and very best!  See my picture!!!</li>
