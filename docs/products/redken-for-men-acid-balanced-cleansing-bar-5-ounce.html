    <ol>

            <li>I have sensetive skin and this soap is great for it!</li>
            <li>Not to mention it smells great!</li>
            <li>Ive been using these for 30+ years, perfect for hair and skin!</li>
            <li>Best shampoo ever!</li>
            <li>Love it!!!  </li>
            <li>so it is a very good value item.  </li>
            <li>It can be used all over as a hair and body shampoo (great for travel/camping).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to shave with.  </li>
            <li>This soap is non-drying and has an exceptional scent that stays with you all day.  </li>
            <li>And it has a great \\&quot;Woodspice\\&quot; fragrance that you&#x27;ll enjoy every time you use it!  </li>
            <li>Love this , works well, smells great.</li>
            <li>He is thrilled.  </li>
            <li>It does smell really nice</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else has this particular perfect man&#x27;s fragrance or works as well on my skin or hair..</li>
            <li>I love how this product makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I do love the smell though.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if I were to buy him soap, conditioner and shampoo, I&#x27;d probably spend more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since my junior year of college and love it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent soap for bearded men or men with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Great Product, PH balanced for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Still the best men&#x27;s face bar for me; have been using this since it first debuted as Redken Amino-Pon back in the 80&#x27;s..</li>
            <li>Wish Redkin would come back with the rose scented bar</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Personally I think it is a very high quality soap and smells \\&quot;clean\\&quot; without smelling cheap or smelling too \\&quot;manly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but if I was I would absolutely use it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, lasts long if properly drained after use.</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t live without this soap!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>A skin expert turned me on to this soap about 35 years ago and with the right moisturizers God Bless you, you will look years younger too!</li>
            <li>His skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and everyone thinks I am 47!</li>
            <li>It is acid balanced for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming hard to find and the price has gone way up</li>
            <li>Even though it is for men it is apparently ph balanced</li>
            <li>but, really that is too much, and he&#x27;ll go back to what he was using before which was plain Dove soap.</li>
            <li>One note, is a soft bar and needs to be kept dry unless you&#x27;re using it.</li>

            <li> No soapy residue and doesn&#x27;t dry our your skin, especially your face.  </li>
            <li> I know it lasts long</li>
            <li> Expensive, although I didn&#x27;t find this to dissipate as quickly as others.  </li>
            <li> The only problem with this soap is that it is not milled hard enough.</li>
            <li> She has always said not to lather up with the soap in your hand, but rather wet a washcloth and rub the soap into it.</li>
            <li> But we will probably not get it again due to the cost.  </li>
            <li> My mom has been using this product since I was a little girl.</li>

            <li> My husband used this faithfully for years and they could never find it in the stores.  We thought they did not make it anymore.  Found it here and I bought it for a gift. He is thrilled.  But we will probably not get it again due to the cost.  With shipping 2 bars of soap was $27.00.  I know it lasts long but, really that is too much, and he&#x27;ll go back to what he was using before which was plain Dove soap.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap for bearded men or men with dry skin.  My husband finds it the only soap that stops the winter dry skin itch.  Smells nice, lasts long if properly drained after use.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my skin feel.  Wish Redkin would come back with the rose scented bar but the man smell works too!</li>
            <li> The perfect cleansing bar for all skin types</li>
            <li> Been using it since 1970.  Guess that should speak for the product.</li>
            <li> For over 30 years I&#x27;ve been using Redkens&#x27; cleansing bar.  It is acid balanced for sensitive skin.  It can be used all over as a hair and body shampoo (great for travel/camping).  It&#x27;s great to shave with.  And it has a great \\&quot;Woodspice\\&quot; fragrance that you&#x27;ll enjoy every time you use it!  One note, is a soft bar and needs to be kept dry unless you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this soap is that it is not milled hard enough. Thus it does not last as long as it should. I do love the smell though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30 years - its still the same. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;However I was most unhappy that I paid for two bars of soap, and was finally sent just onw.&lt;br /&gt;Never again - no mas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Torres Ph.D.</li>
            <li> Still the best men&#x27;s face bar for me; have been using this since it first debuted as Redken Amino-Pon back in the 80&#x27;s..&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else has this particular perfect man&#x27;s fragrance or works as well on my skin or hair..&lt;br /&gt;Hope they keep making it forever..</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this product since I was a little girl. Even though it is for men it is apparently ph balanced and she swears by it. She has always said not to lather up with the soap in your hand, but rather wet a washcloth and rub the soap into it. That way this pricey soap lasts longer. Personally I think it is a very high quality soap and smells \\&quot;clean\\&quot; without smelling cheap or smelling too \\&quot;manly\\&quot;. I do not use it personally because I am not that picky but if I was I would absolutely use it.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and everyone thinks I am 47! Go figure! A skin expert turned me on to this soap about 35 years ago and with the right moisturizers God Bless you, you will look years younger too!</li>
            <li> Love this , works well, smells great.</li>
            <li> I have sensetive skin and this soap is great for it! Not to mention it smells great! I even use it on my face with no issues!</li>
            <li> Ive been using these for 30+ years, perfect for hair and skin!</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t live without this soap!  It does smell really nice and he uses it all over, no shampoo.  It&#x27;s becoming hard to find and the price has gone way up but if I were to buy him soap, conditioner and shampoo, I&#x27;d probably spend more.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. He shampoos with it every day and lots of times uses it for soap&lt;br /&gt;as well.  Each bar lasts him about four months so it is a very good value item.  Don&#x27;t ever stop making&lt;br /&gt;this product!</li>
            <li> This soap is non-drying and has an exceptional scent that stays with you all day.  Expensive, although I didn&#x27;t find this to dissipate as quickly as others.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great Product, PH balanced for sensitive skin. No soapy residue and doesn&#x27;t dry our your skin, especially your face.  I would recommend this product over any bar soap on the market.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since my junior year of college and love it.  Best shampoo ever!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  only face soap that works for me.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this soap. His skin is very sensitive. And he only uses this soap.</li>
