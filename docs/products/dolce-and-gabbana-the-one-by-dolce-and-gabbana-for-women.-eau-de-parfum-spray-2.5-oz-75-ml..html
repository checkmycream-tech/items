            <li> I love Dolce &amp; Gabbana The One.  Although this is &amp;#34;for women,&amp;#34; I like wearing it because the scent is not too feminine.  Perfect scent.  Sexy and romantic.  I get a lot of attention (in a good way) when wearing this.</li>
            <li> great price. my wife loves the perfume,I shopped for this product at department stores. Half the size for more than what I paid.</li>
            <li> The only con to this was being late, but the packaging was consistent with buying it new at the store, and it was protected in the package. Still sealed, and smells as it always has. I love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> A purchased dolce gabana the one from geneva switzerland and this product i ordered is not the same. Smells totally different. More flowery.ni think they use bottles and fillbthem up with fake scent..be careful</li>
            <li> I guess we all have a favorite fragrance and this is definitely mine...so for me the name &amp;#34;THE ONE&amp;#34; says it all!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing..</li>
            <li> It smells nice once it does down but it&#x27;s just so dry! I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but dry. I like it still, maybe I&#x27;ll get some use out of it in the future.  I&#x27;m still searching for &#x27;the one&#x27; perfume.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Great price and great Xmas gift.</li>
            <li> I am stuck on this fragrance - light and fresh smelling...continue to purchase every time I run out. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> My signature scent. Subtle, but stays with you all day. Always get lots of compliments from men, women and children!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance and long lasting. Never so my compliments from both males and females. Absolutely delicious. Will continue to purchase this Parfume.</li>
            <li> this perfume makes a great gift but I know the numbers on makes it cost effective.it is convenient without having to go I&#x27;m trying different perfumes I know this is my wife&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; favorite!!  I get complimented on it and I absolutely love it, what more can I say???</li>
            <li> I HAVE PURCHASED THE SCENT BEFORE FROM A DIFFERENT SELLER AND IT LAST ALL DAY LONG.  ...THIS SELLER HAD IT FOR CHEAP SO I PURCHASED IT AND NOW I HAVE TO WALK AROUND WITH A 2.5 oz  BOTTLE OF NOTHING IN MY PURSE.I PUT IT ON AT 12 AND BY 12:30 ITS GONE. IM VERY UPSET WITH THIS PURCHASE</li>
