    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but none have performed as AWESOME as Nelson&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It worked great!  </li>
            <li>I still believe that eliminating refined sugar from the diet is the best way to improve skin, but this is a reasonably-priced alternative!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this myself but when your kids say it&#x27;s the best stuff for acne</li>
            <li>some point in time, seemingly coincidentally, I noticed that the ingredient \\&quot;Tea Tree Oil\\&quot; was showing up in a lot of shampoos, conditioners, lotions and deodorants that I have tried and been impressed with.  </li>
            <li>In my case it paid off wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very handy beauty product!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product.</li>
            <li>It has an impressive, honest ingredient listing.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Homeopathy is greatly debated as a pseudoscience.</li>
            <li>works great as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love this product, excellent for acne.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product that I was sure I would never find again.  </li>
            <li>If you can handle strong scents, then this product might be great for you - I ordered it because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>And my favorite part, I know they&#x27;re using a product with no toxic ingredients!</li>
            <li>Wish it was a bit stronger, but I place a nice size gob on blemish for 2 days and most it is gone!  </li>
            <li>Then I heard that Tea Tree Oil can be effective against acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>It is very strong.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to use acne spot treatments...</li>
            <li>most of the drugstore brands cause my skin to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>you order again. :-)</li>
            <li>more healthy acne treatments</li>
            <li>I wanted it to work better; we applied it under moisturizer and make-up.  </li>
            <li>It does smell herbal and refreshing, though.</li>
            <li>in fact i believe it contributed to more breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Best is not to touch blemish, place a good amount on it and as stated usually just takes 2-3 days and no scarring and its gone.</li>
            <li>It is one of the absolute best acne products on the market, and the fact that it is all natural and not tested on animals just makes it that much better!</li>
            <li>It works great on her mild/moderate acne that breaks through her normal washing and cleansing regimen.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say this might be best for non-inflammatory acne or people with the occasional light breakout.</li>
            <li>But more importantly, did it work?</li>
            <li>So far so good :) and so cheap!</li>
            <li>I loved how gentle this treatment was.  </li>
            <li>All Nelsons Pure and Clear products are wonderful!</li>
            <li>The product smells just as strong as Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>I have acquired very stubborn cystic acne with this pregnancy, and that could have something to do with this review, but honestly this product does not seem to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how gentle and no drying this was on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a week now, but I have already experienced a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years, and its very good</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have acne or similar skin problems on body parts farther away from your face, it would be good to try the product there.</li>
            <li>It feels good and fresh but I don&#x27;t think it really helps to decrease the size of pimples fast.</li>
            <li>Delievered very promptly, everything one expects from a reputable vendor</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong like tea tree oil or eucalyptus, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li>very pure and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I first bought it an out- of- the- way shop!</li>
            <li>It also helps to calm any redness that has formed.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old cousin uses it as well and is quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>My take on it is that it won&#x27;t ever cause you any real harm, but it most likely won&#x27;t work for most people either.</li>
            <li>I found that my old Clearasil spot treatment works much better.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, she was right.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was the inconsistent diet and sleep, but a spot on my face was getting larger and angrier and 2 more were growing.</li>
            <li>I am a Naturopathic Doctor, and, of course, would love my teenage nieces and nephews to improve their diets to decrease acne/pimples.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>But after reading tons and tons of great reviews for this product, I decided for the price I had to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>I applied it for the first time</li>
            <li>Used it successfully in the past.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love it as I lean towards more natural cures in general, and especially at pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s deep under the skin, but now that I have the gel handy, I will only be applying it to fresh acne.</li>
            <li>Being realistic, I know most teens aren&#x27;t likely to change their diets much, so I ordered some for a niece to try.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice cooling sensation when you put it on; face feels a bit tight afterwards.</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>When looking through some Nelson/Bach products online one day, I found this homeopathic acne gel at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It really turned my stomach.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really does work, both to help reduce blemishes, and as a gentle protectant.  </li>
            <li>It smells natural and fresh and the smell does go away after about 30 min</li>
            <li>Not only has it worked very well for me, it also has not broken out or dried out my sensitive skin, which I am very pleased about!</li>
            <li>What I love is that it does not dry out your skin and eventually a tiny scab falls off and your blemish is gone.  </li>
            <li>Better than proactive or any other OTC acne product, In my opinion!</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m getting a bit older, I&#x27;ve started using anti-aging products instead...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this affordable product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Nelsons&#x27; Pure &amp; Clear Acne Treatment Gel didn&#x27;t cause any adverse reactions, but didn&#x27;t help with my acne.</li>
            <li>This is natural and works very well.</li>
            <li>Because it takes the light &amp; easy homeopathic route, the active ingredients tend to be very minimal.</li>
            <li>It will treat the pimples you have and prevent new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered it when I used to live in the UK, at the ubiquitous Boots</li>
            <li>There is no other product out there that really can compare to this.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products in the past, including Proactiv.</li>
            <li>May smell a little strong, but it clears up blemishes without drying.</li>
            <li>Each day and night I have applied the gel, the older acne has gotten smaller, however, when I&#x27;ve applied the gel to fresh acne, it&#x27;s practically gone the next day.</li>
            <li>Since menopause, I have had problems with large red, swollen pimples erupting.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily clear up my face completely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised no one has mentioned the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>It only gives me the most minimal of dryness, but it also continues to prevent acne no matter moisturizer or facial wash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and have struggled with acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Always on the hunt for a better product, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different pimple and blemish treatments in the past including those herbal roll-ons</li>
            <li>At the first indication a pimple is starting, I apply Nelson&#x27;s Acne Gel and it soothes the redness and helps to prevent the pimple from growing into a flashing red cyst!  </li>
            <li>I do think older acne just takes longer to get rid of, especially acne</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a major change in my skin!</li>
            <li>Again, not a bad product--didn&#x27;t break me out or destroy my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would HIGHLY suggest and recommend this product, especially to those who want to try something natural and those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to rub over your entire face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time purchaser of this product- at least 5 years or more.  </li>
            <li>At 22, I haven&#x27;t used acne medication in a while and with a recent breakout, I wanted to find a natural way to treat it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as a spot treatment as it suggests, I more use it as a preventive measure and put a thin layer all over my face.</li>
            <li>The idea is to take certain active ingredients and dilute them intensively using either water or alcohol.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old son has been hit with an ugly case of acne on his fair skin...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work for me,and make me break out, cuz before i use this product, i just have several pimple and acne scar, since i use this, my face became more worse.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, my acne stayed the same throughout the whole tube.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with minor adult acne forever.  </li>
            <li>If I am a day or two late applying the gel, it does provide healing properties and, again, it prevents a full blown pimple eruption.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> If I am a day or two late applying the gel, it does provide healing properties and, again, it prevents a full blown pimple eruption.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and it absorbs well compared to other acne gels.</li>
            <li> The smell of the gel is very strong but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Now when pimples or blackheads start, I exfoliate and use some Nelson&#x27;s overnight to reverse a red bump or dry a blackhead all without the dry flaking skin some spot treatments cause.</li>
            <li> I mean, it was originally regular old teenage acne, but when it didn&#x27;t go away at age 18, nor at age 21, nor at age 25...  </li>
            <li> years ago after trying all the other stuff you can buy over the counter at the local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> It does take a while for the gel to heal the acne itself, but it does so without drying it out and leaving your skin dry.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re tired of just \\&quot;putting up with\\&quot; oxy 10 (or similar), then it&#x27;s definitely worth a few bucks to give this a shot.  </li>
            <li> the next morning I noticed the size and puffiness of the acne was less than the night before.</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s oily in some areas and dry in other places.</li>
            <li> and she keeps bringing me empty tubes of Nelsons Acne Gel to reorder.</li>
            <li> got by on Oxy 10 (benzoyl peroxide) for years, but it was never completely effective, and once every couple months I would use just a tiny dab too much (or combine with the wrong facial soap), and I would suffer extreme redness and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a miracle gel thoygh have to use along with other products for this to work wonders......</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne that can sometimes feel tight, sore and itchy, but the gel calms it down for me.</li>
            <li> Although sometimes it will burn a little bit after you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> I find it also helps to reduce razor bumps or the little rashes that appear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s homeopathic, and I&#x27;m usually skeptical about some health products, but this seems to really work, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> I ended up just throwing it away, what a waste of $6.</li>
            <li> once the gel has dried.</li>
            <li> Other have complained about the smell, which I didn&#x27;t find at all off-putting:</li>
            <li> I must&#x27;ve applied Nelson&#x27;s 4 times that day and found it was difficult to re-locate the pimple the next day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I like this, but am not sure how well it works.</li>
            <li> Not to mention its hard to get him to wash his face without rushing...</li>
            <li> Hard to find sometimes even at health food stores,</li>
            <li> The dilution of the active ingredients isn&#x27;t too bad and tea tree is an antibacterial, which should tame acne.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my skin out or have any unpleasant fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I can&#x27;t tell you if it works or not because I could not get past the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I tried to put it on a couple of times and each time I was forced to take it off just minutes later because of the awful smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very good product. May smell a little strong, but it clears up blemishes without drying. It also helps to calm any redness that has formed. Have been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> I love this product, excellent for acne.  I would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I very pure and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> At 22, I haven&#x27;t used acne medication in a while and with a recent breakout, I wanted to find a natural way to treat it. I looked at Nelsons and hopeful by skeptical, I ordered it. The dilution of the active ingredients isn&#x27;t too bad and tea tree is an antibacterial, which should tame acne. But more importantly, did it work? Yes, it did; I don&#x27;t have any breakouts and I can spot treat any problems as soon as they appear. Other have complained about the smell, which I didn&#x27;t find at all off-putting: it&#x27;s just tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I have acquired very stubborn cystic acne with this pregnancy, and that could have something to do with this review, but honestly this product does not seem to make a difference.  It has an impressive, honest ingredient listing.  I wanted to love it as I lean towards more natural cures in general, and especially at pregnancy.  I could not however notice a difference after using it.  Sadly will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> great product. really works.</li>
            <li> I bought Nelson&#x27;s Acne Gel on a cross-country road trip stop in Boulder, CO. Maybe it was the inconsistent diet and sleep, but a spot on my face was getting larger and angrier and 2 more were growing. Nelson&#x27;s literally reduced the 2 smaller pimples overnight and put the larger one on the path to healing (reduced swelling, pain and redness). Now when pimples or blackheads start, I exfoliate and use some Nelson&#x27;s overnight to reverse a red bump or dry a blackhead all without the dry flaking skin some spot treatments cause. Another time I was home sick and discovered a pimple on my jawline. I must&#x27;ve applied Nelson&#x27;s 4 times that day and found it was difficult to re-locate the pimple the next day. Always on the hunt for a better product, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different pimple and blemish treatments in the past including those herbal roll-ons but none have performed as AWESOME as Nelson&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old son has been hit with an ugly case of acne on his fair skin... nothing seem to work.  Not to mention its hard to get him to wash his face without rushing... My mother went to Canada and came back with this acne gel... It has been heaven sent even with his bad habit!!!</li>
            <li> I am a Naturopathic Doctor, and, of course, would love my teenage nieces and nephews to improve their diets to decrease acne/pimples.  When looking through some Nelson/Bach products online one day, I found this homeopathic acne gel at a reasonable price.  Being realistic, I know most teens aren&#x27;t likely to change their diets much, so I ordered some for a niece to try.  It worked great!  Four of my nieces and nephews are now using it.  I still believe that eliminating refined sugar from the diet is the best way to improve skin, but this is a reasonably-priced alternative!</li>
            <li> Nelson&#x27;s acne gel immediately soothes, cleanses, and reduces redness. It is one of the absolute best acne products on the market, and the fact that it is all natural and not tested on animals just makes it that much better!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I can&#x27;t tell you if it works or not because I could not get past the terrible smell. I tried to put it on a couple of times and each time I was forced to take it off just minutes later because of the awful smell. I ended up just throwing it away, what a waste of $6.</li>
            <li> The product smells just as strong as Tea Tree Oil. Nothing I want to use in my face. Maybe if you have acne or similar skin problems on body parts farther away from your face, it would be good to try the product there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled acne for over 10 years now and have been using this gel all over my face at night and I have noticed a major change in my skin! It doesn&#x27;t necessarily clear up my face completely but I think it definitely controls my breakouts and I notice my pores look smaller in the mornings. I don&#x27;t use it as a spot treatment as it suggests, I more use it as a preventive measure and put a thin layer all over my face. So far so good :) and so cheap!</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I was sure I would never find again.  I first bought it an out- of- the- way shop!</li>
            <li> This WORKS. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never been able to use acne spot treatments... most of the drugstore brands cause my skin to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to me by a makeup artist (I&#x27;m an actress). She asked us to use it ALL OVER our faces in the weeks leading up to a five week shoot. I was terrified, but gave it shot. Lo and behold, she was right. It&#x27;s gentle enough to rub over your entire face. It will treat the pimples you have and prevent new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I&#x27;d remove my makeup with coconut oil and follow with Nelsons. Now that I&#x27;m getting a bit older, I&#x27;ve started using anti-aging products instead... but I will ALWAYS use Nelsons!</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I feel any cystic acne coming on, keeps the acne from hitting the surface.  It&#x27;s homeopathic, and I&#x27;m usually skeptical about some health products, but this seems to really work, at least for me.  Hard to find sometimes even at health food stores, so I order on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years.  Wish it was a bit stronger, but I place a nice size gob on blemish for 2 days and most it is gone!  Bye bye blemish.  What I love is that it does not dry out your skin and eventually a tiny scab falls off and your blemish is gone.  There is no other product out there that really can compare to this.  Best is not to touch blemish, place a good amount on it and as stated usually just takes 2-3 days and no scarring and its gone. I have adult acne and am very pleased with it. My 15 year old cousin uses it as well and is quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This product has a very strong smell. It does help combat my acne issues but the scent no joke gives me a headache. Not a miracle gel thoygh have to use along with other products for this to work wonders......</li>
            <li> I cannot tell if this treatment it working. It goes on clear and it absorbs well compared to other acne gels. Although sometimes it will burn a little bit after you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> Has a nice cooling sensation when you put it on; face feels a bit tight afterwards. Didn&#x27;t help with my breakouts so I&#x27;d say this might be best for non-inflammatory acne or people with the occasional light breakout. Again, not a bad product--didn&#x27;t break me out or destroy my skin. Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised no one has mentioned the smell of this product. It is very strong. It smells like tee tree oil mixed with something else. It really turned my stomach. Customer service did not seem to believe me or offer any acceptable recourse. If you can handle strong scents, then this product might be great for you - I ordered it because of the great reviews. I can&#x27;t speak to how it works b/c I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Since menopause, I have had problems with large red, swollen pimples erupting.  I never suffered from acne problems prior to menopause so I was at a loss as to how to treat this problem.  Nelson&#x27;s Acne Gel provides almost immediate relief.  At the first indication a pimple is starting, I apply Nelson&#x27;s Acne Gel and it soothes the redness and helps to prevent the pimple from growing into a flashing red cyst!  If I am a day or two late applying the gel, it does provide healing properties and, again, it prevents a full blown pimple eruption.  I never want to be without this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have been trying creams for years and nothing has ever worked or done what it promises . This is natural and works very well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s enough for me. I haven&#x27;t used this myself but when your kids say it&#x27;s the best stuff for acne you order again. :-) And my favorite part, I know they&#x27;re using a product with no toxic ingredients!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff.  It works great on her mild/moderate acne that breaks through her normal washing and cleansing regimen.  I bought her three or four different more healthy acne treatments years ago after trying all the other stuff you can buy over the counter at the local pharmacy.  She tried them all.  The others went in the trash and she keeps bringing me empty tubes of Nelsons Acne Gel to reorder.</li>
            <li> This gel works alright.  I wanted it to work better; we applied it under moisturizer and make-up.  However, it did not keep the break-outs away.  It does smell herbal and refreshing, though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years, and its very good I&#x27;ve referred it to several of my friends an it worked well for them too. I would highly recommend this affordable product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It worked in just 3 days!! highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> this did not work for me at all...in fact i believe it contributed to more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with minor adult acne forever.  I mean, it was originally regular old teenage acne, but when it didn&#x27;t go away at age 18, nor at age 21, nor at age 25...  at some point I had to recognize that this went beyond a passing adolescent phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got by on Oxy 10 (benzoyl peroxide) for years, but it was never completely effective, and once every couple months I would use just a tiny dab too much (or combine with the wrong facial soap), and I would suffer extreme redness and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point in time, seemingly coincidentally, I noticed that the ingredient \\&quot;Tea Tree Oil\\&quot; was showing up in a lot of shampoos, conditioners, lotions and deodorants that I have tried and been impressed with.  Then I heard that Tea Tree Oil can be effective against acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I searched the web for an acne lotion with Tea Tree Oil, and I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic.  A tiny bit does wonders.  It only gives me the most minimal of dryness, but it also continues to prevent acne no matter moisturizer or facial wash I pair it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can search the NIH PubMed site for dermatology studies about Tea Tree Oil and acne.  There is growing medical data to support this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re tired of just \\&quot;putting up with\\&quot; oxy 10 (or similar), then it&#x27;s definitely worth a few bucks to give this a shot.  In my case it paid off wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I really liked how gentle and no drying this was on my skin. The scent is pretty strong like tea tree oil or eucalyptus, so be prepared for that. Otherwise it made my skin feel refreshed and relaxed. I have cystic acne that can sometimes feel tight, sore and itchy, but the gel calms it down for me. It does take a while for the gel to heal the acne itself, but it does so without drying it out and leaving your skin dry. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Nelsons&#x27; Pure &amp; Clear Acne Treatment Gel didn&#x27;t cause any adverse reactions, but didn&#x27;t help with my acne. Because it takes the light &amp; easy homeopathic route, the active ingredients tend to be very minimal. The idea is to take certain active ingredients and dilute them intensively using either water or alcohol. Homeopathy is greatly debated as a pseudoscience. My take on it is that it won&#x27;t ever cause you any real harm, but it most likely won&#x27;t work for most people either. Take with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time purchaser of this product- at least 5 years or more.  I discovered it when I used to live in the UK, at the ubiquitous Boots and I just love it.  It really does work, both to help reduce blemishes, and as a gentle protectant.  I find it also helps to reduce razor bumps or the little rashes that appear when you wax/thread.  It&#x27;s a very handy beauty product!!</li>
            <li> All Nelsons Pure and Clear products are wonderful! I am amazed by them.  Better than proactive or any other OTC acne product, In my opinion!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for me,and make me break out, cuz before i use this product, i just have several pimple and acne scar, since i use this, my face became more worse.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week now, but I have already experienced a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m 30 years old and have struggled with acne since my early teens. I have combination skin. It get&#x27;s oily in some areas and dry in other places. I also have extremely sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used many products in the past, including Proactiv. It either didn&#x27;t work and/or I broke out into a rash, which is what the case was with using Proactiv. But after reading tons and tons of great reviews for this product, I decided for the price I had to at least give it a try. I Initially bought this to try to get rid of some deep under the skin acne along my jaw line / chin area that had been hanging around for about a week or so prior to using the gel. I applied it for the first time (you only need to use just a dap) before I went to bed and the next morning I noticed the size and puffiness of the acne was less than the night before. Each day and night I have applied the gel, the older acne has gotten smaller, however, when I&#x27;ve applied the gel to fresh acne, it&#x27;s practically gone the next day. I do think older acne just takes longer to get rid of, especially acne that&#x27;s deep under the skin, but now that I have the gel handy, I will only be applying it to fresh acne. Not only has it worked very well for me, it also has not broken out or dried out my sensitive skin, which I am very pleased about! The smell of the gel is very strong but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant. It smells natural and fresh and the smell does go away after about 30 min once the gel has dried. Overall, I would HIGHLY suggest and recommend this product, especially to those who want to try something natural and those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like this, but am not sure how well it works. It feels good and fresh but I don&#x27;t think it really helps to decrease the size of pimples fast.</li>
            <li> Used it successfully in the past.  works great as advertised. Delievered very promptly, everything one expects from a reputable vendor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad skin but I do get a pimple once in a while. When I put this on the affected area, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I found that my old Clearasil spot treatment works much better.</li>
            <li> I loved how gentle this treatment was.  It didn&#x27;t dry my skin out or have any unpleasant fragrances.  On the other hand, my acne stayed the same throughout the whole tube.  There were no improvements in appearance or tone of skin.</li>
