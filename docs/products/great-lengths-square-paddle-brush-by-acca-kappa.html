            <li>I was told by the store that it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I have extensions but was told that regardless it&#x27;s  a great brush.</li>

            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>Get your own!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush</li>
            <li>Borders on erotic somehow.  </li>
            <li>I have more than 100 Great Lengths extensions in my hair, and this brush helps me keep them beautiful and knot free.</li>
            <li>Love this hair brush!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser introduced me to this hair brush - it is the absolute best thing I have ever put through my hair!  </li>
            <li>Best brush for when i have extensions and when i have natural hair .</li>
            <li>Feels great on scalp and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that this brush does help bring gorgeous luster and shine to your locks.</li>
            <li>This brush is not only amazing for hair extensions, but also the best for de-tangling fine hair with out breakage.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I think it would work better with shorter and thinner hair.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>And that I may never be able to even look at another brush again.</li>
            <li>And I still want more.  </li>
            <li>Using this brush has become more of a chore than a luxury.</li>
            <li>I love, love it.  </li>
            <li>However I have to clean this brush more than I do with my own hair.</li>
            <li>an absolute MUST if you have any kind of extensions!</li>
            <li>I HAD A GREAT LENGTHS PADDLE BRUSH FOR 10 YEARS AND REPLACED IT WITH THIS NEW ONE.</li>
            <li>Brushing feels so good that it kind of scares me actually.  </li>
            <li>A great investment if you want healthy, long hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>It made my hair look really nice, took frizz out, detangled really well AND gave my hair body and bounce.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on his scalp :-)</li>
            <li>The other ones were worn out after many many many years of use.</li>
            <li>yay super hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot more maintenance, but I do love how feminine long hair looks on me.</li>
            <li>Works great for little girls hair.</li>
            <li>Worth.</li>
            <li>worth the $50.</li>
            <li>After I had my new extensions put it, they looked great, but blow drying and brushing them out became a whole different matter than before.  </li>
            <li>I do not have extensions but from reading the reviews I saw that it worked great for natural long hair.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t owned that many different kinds to know.  </li>
            <li>less tugging and much greater ease in the care of my fabulous extensions.  </li>
            <li>I WANT to brush my hair the whole time since I bought it today.  </li>
            <li>That brush is the best brush ever mad in the marketing</li>
            <li>I brushed my hair more today than I did all last year.</li>
            <li>Will be buying a few more.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been searching for a good combo nylon/boar bristle brush, but either the plastic/nylon bristles have been to harsh on my scalp, or the boar bristles have been too soft or too short to get through my mane.</li>
            <li>I fear I may become helplessly addicted to this super sexy brush.</li>
            <li>Got the round brush version from the salon &amp; ordered flat brush &amp; the quality is the same &amp; looks great.</li>
            <li>Although pricey for a hairbrush, it is of professional makeup/hair stylist quality and would never want to give it up, even if I have my extensions removed!  </li>
            <li>It detangles your hair without pulling and is gentle enough that you feel no pain!  </li>
            <li>My natural hair stopped breaking with this brush.</li>
            <li>After combing out the dead skin from every single brushing, and washing out the grease from the bristles every other day, then my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s expensive, but it is amazing for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Really adds fluff to ur hair</li>
            <li>B000KQ73KE Phyto 7 Daily Intense Hydrating Cream for Dry Hair, 1.7-Ounce]].</li>
            <li>Starting a daily brushing ritual because of the sheer awesomeness of this extraordinaire, high quality brush.</li>
            <li>Gentle brush helps to remove tangles for less sheading.</li>
            <li>Other brushes don&#x27;t seem to distribute natural hair oils like this one does, and other brushes don&#x27;t seem to massage and caress every molecule of every hair in such an intimate, invigorating way.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Everyone in our family loves this brush.  Will be buying a few more.</li>
            <li> Both my sister and I have been waiting for the opportunity to get out hands on another one of these brushes. The other ones were worn out after many many many years of use. This brush is fantastic. No pulling on my hair, de-tangles with ease, lifts and separates the hair.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great for hair that knots all the time without tears.  Works great for little girls hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this hair brush - it is the absolute best thing I have ever put through my hair!  Worth. Every. Penny.</li>
            <li> My sister is a hair dresser. She told me to buy this brush to blow dry my hair with. It&#x27;s a good brush but I think it is not for my type of hair. I have a very curly and thick hair. It doesn&#x27;t grasp my hair. I think it would work better with shorter and thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive, but it is amazing for your hair.  It detangles your hair without pulling and is gentle enough that you feel no pain!  I do not have extensions but I use it anyway.  A great investment if you want healthy, long hair. Use it with this Oribe product[[ASIN:B00203Q9B4 Oribe Hair Care - Supershine Moisturizing Crème - 5 oz]] or this Phyto product[[ASIN:B000KQ73KE Phyto 7 Daily Intense Hydrating Cream for Dry Hair, 1.7-Ounce]]. yay super hair.</li>
            <li> an absolute MUST if you have any kind of extensions!</li>
            <li> Very good service and product!</li>
            <li> That brush is the best brush ever mad in the marketing so fare.. i do not have hair extan-tion but i do have very long and curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t brake my hair like the others brush does. It is amazing and worst every penny on it!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is not only amazing for hair extensions, but also the best for de-tangling fine hair with out breakage.</li>
            <li> After I had my new extensions put it, they looked great, but blow drying and brushing them out became a whole different matter than before.  This brush definitely came to the rescue....less tugging and much greater ease in the care of my fabulous extensions.  Although pricey for a hairbrush, it is of professional makeup/hair stylist quality and would never want to give it up, even if I have my extensions removed!  Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> Just as described!  Got the round brush version from the salon &amp; ordered flat brush &amp; the quality is the same &amp; looks great.</li>
            <li> I have more than 100 Great Lengths extensions in my hair, and this brush helps me keep them beautiful and knot free.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever!!!! I just got Great Length Extensions and this brush is like a massage on my head! It doesn&#x27;t pull the bonds at all. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love this hair brush! I&#x27;ve never been one to get too wrapped up in a utensil before ... but this brush is a must have for all ladies!</li>
            <li> This brush cracked within a couple of months. I&#x27;ve had other hair extension brushes that have lasted years and were a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I HAD A GREAT LENGTHS PADDLE BRUSH FOR 10 YEARS AND REPLACED IT WITH THIS NEW ONE. THEY ARE THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I wore out the other one.  UPDATE:  This brush is a must if you have Great Length Extensions, however, this brush cracked after about six months.  Not good considering the price.</li>
            <li> Starting a daily brushing ritual because of the sheer awesomeness of this extraordinaire, high quality brush. Other brushes don&#x27;t seem to distribute natural hair oils like this one does, and other brushes don&#x27;t seem to massage and caress every molecule of every hair in such an intimate, invigorating way.  What is that I hear?  Angels singing?  No.  I am just brushing my hair. And I can&#x27;t stop. Brushing feels so good that it kind of scares me actually.  Borders on erotic somehow.  I fear I may become helplessly addicted to this super sexy brush. And that I may never be able to even look at another brush again. I brushed my hair more today than I did all last year. And I still want more.  If anyone even touches my brush I will guard it like a feral animal.  It is MINE!  MINE!!!!!!!!! Get your own!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that this brush does help bring gorgeous luster and shine to your locks. However I have to clean this brush more than I do with my own hair. After combing out the dead skin from every single brushing, and washing out the grease from the bristles every other day, then my hair looks amazing. It may seem like I&#x27;m lazy, but I&#x27;m new to maintaining long locks. I&#x27;m probably realizing that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot more maintenance, but I do love how feminine long hair looks on me. I do not have extensions but from reading the reviews I saw that it worked great for natural long hair. No one gave a negative review on here, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the $50. It&#x27;s hard to keep clean, ( if your brush is dirty, your hair will be too!). Using this brush has become more of a chore than a luxury.</li>
            <li> Best brush for when i have extensions and when i have natural hair . Gentle brush helps to remove tangles for less sheading. Really adds fluff to ur hair</li>
            <li> Works great with hair extensions! Not big on the price, but the product is terrific. Might want to buy BEFORE you get extensions. Regular hair brushes hurt.</li>
            <li> I just bought this brush for $60.  I was told by the store that it is a great product.  I have extensions but was told that regardless it&#x27;s  a great brush. I have to say it is a really great brush. I was gonna say the best but I haven&#x27;t owned that many different kinds to know.  I love, love it.  I WANT to brush my hair the whole time since I bought it today.  It made my hair look really nice, took frizz out, detangled really well AND gave my hair body and bounce.  I didn&#x27;t know a brush could make such a difference !</li>
            <li> Bought for my extensions but will use whether I have them or not. Feels great on scalp and worth the price. Am going to buy another for my mom.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist turned me on to this brush for minimal pulling on extentions. It worked great. I&#x27;ve long since discarded extensions but the brush stays. My natural hair stopped breaking with this brush. Even my almost bald boyfriend loves it. It&#x27;s gentle on his scalp :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extensions, but do have very long, very thick, straight hair. For years I&#x27;ve been searching for a good combo nylon/boar bristle brush, but either the plastic/nylon bristles have been to harsh on my scalp, or the boar bristles have been too soft or too short to get through my mane. This brush is the perfect balance! I don&#x27;t plan on ever buying from another brand ever again.</li>
