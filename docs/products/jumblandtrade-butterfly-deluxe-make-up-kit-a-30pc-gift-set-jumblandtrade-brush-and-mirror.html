            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old daughter. As soon as you open the case the eye shadows are in the shape of a butterfly. I am sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Got this for my Granddaughter for Christmas can&#x27;t wait till she opens it. :)  It is exactly as shown, very pretty.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 8th birthday. I opened it today and realized how small this is. The picture really makes it look big. The butterfly sections seem very cheaply made. It probably won&#x27;t last long unless she is very careful with it. It&#x27;s also kind of difficult to open. If I was looking at it in the store I would have picked something different.</li>
            <li> This arrived damaged ): I was going to exchange it for another but, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the quality of make up. Its also very small. It looks bigger in the picture. I guess this would be good for a young girl , but not for a teenager &amp; older.</li>
            <li> This is a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Very nice kit with everything she wanted.</li>
            <li> recipient loved this.  great gift idea</li>
            <li> Love these! Order them my daughters birthday the girls thought these were the coolest. The top butterfly fell apart on about 6 of them so that was a bummer:(</li>
            <li> Very nice. Perfect first make up for a teen.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to play with and she loved it....I would recommend this for little girls to play with</li>
            <li> We got this for a friends twin girls 7th Birthday party. We got one for each of them and they loved them.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Slightly smaller than expected. Good value for price</li>
            <li> When this item arrived, there was makeup powder everywhere on the outside of the case, and when I opened it, all of the blush/eyeshadow inside was smashed. Needless to say, I immediately returned. Next time I&#x27;ll just buy something like this at Target.</li>
            <li> All busted up when received  forgot to send back</li>
            <li> As one niece put it, &amp;#34;make-up is always appreciated.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This make up set is cute and very small.  It is about the size of a compact.  As I had not paid attention to the size in  the description I was a bit surprised at how small the package was. That being said it was greatly appreciated by the 10 year old recipient who found it absolutely adorable.  It makes for a good play set or a disposable set for a children&#x27;s beauty party.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It came really quick and I love the assortment of colors :)</li>
