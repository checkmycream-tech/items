            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>brushes are durable and my dentist is delighted with my home care so why not ?</li>
            <li>but this sonicare is surprisingly good and does feel compatible to those at dentist office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and the brush head is still in good shape.</li>
            <li>I like it , dose a good job</li>

            <li>Good price.</li>

            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I really love my Philips Sonicare!</li>
            <li>and I received it on Dec 9.thats amazing.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my toothes nice and shinery.</li>
            <li>however, the soni noise is kind of noisy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush teeth feel great after brushing it does what it says I have no complaints love the timer</li>
            <li>I also bought one for my granddaughter and she is equally enthusiastic.</li>
            <li>Very good for the price, brusheads are very large.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The neck of brush head is very easy to break.</li>
            <li>wow, I got a great deal on this!</li>
            <li>Comfortable and timed for good brushing.</li>
            <li>This is incredible and my teeth feel so much cleaner than before.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this fresh from the dentist feeling!!!  </li>
            <li>All the good said about them is true</li>
            <li>I needed to replace a Sonicare Elite toothbrush that I&#x27;d had for many years and couldn&#x27;t find the Elite version anymore.  </li>
            <li>This Essence version is very similar in design and a great price!  </li>
            <li>Both me and my husband have the Essence toothbrush by Philips Sonicare and love them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, meh, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d say definitely better than that of oral-b.</li>
            <li>i hope it won&#x27;t affect my ear drums :).</li>
            <li>After using for the last 2 weeks, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Love it for its simplicity.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>Bought this as gift, and my daughter and grandson just love it.  </li>
            <li>This was a much better deal considering discounts and additional replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>product is OK, but have to charge for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the built-in timer.  </li>
            <li>It vibrates faster than the others, and I feel as though my teeth are being cleaned better.  </li>
            <li>I like the rotating head type better.</li>
            <li>I love it and my dentist does, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that makes glad that the product fulfills the user&#x27;s expectations</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying electric powered vibes in my facehole!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This is a great deal and vibrates just as fast as the $150 ones.</li>
            <li>It helps make my dentist visits better</li>
            <li>I have been using the sonicare toothbrush for many many years.</li>
            <li>and I love the tingle I feel after I get done brushing.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Best bargain for under $30.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more for all family when this goes on sale again.</li>
            <li>Not the top of the line but got it at a discount</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Keeps me healthy and also my teeth cleaner and Heather.</li>
            <li>Yes this cost more</li>
            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>and I feel is best for women or people with smaller mouths.</li>
            <li>Mine needs to put on the charger about once every week or more...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more heads for this</li>
            <li>these work so much better than spin brushes</li>
            <li>My dentist told me to floss more.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that so many of my family members did not use electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Love the power of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, and I highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li>A year later, this toothbrush is still going strong and is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>He actually loves brushing his teeth and claims it&#x27;s the best and most clean feeling he&#x27;s ever had after brushing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, tickles a bit at first but in a good way, and reaches and effectively cleans all surfaces.</li>
            <li>I purchased the item at an incredible price in December, when it was bundled w/ an extra brush head as part of the &amp;#</li>
            <li>makes my whole mouth feal good  </li>
            <li>and I do not feel very comfortable when I use it to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>I guess all the hoopla is true!</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt more clean and I swear it has made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>The transaction process was also really easy.  </li>
            <li>Brush is easy to get used to and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to move around the mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this essence seriese is not as strong as premium model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice to get this with the extra head at a good price.</li>
            <li>Hands down the BEST ever!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>It uses the same E Series brush heads which work great at keeping my teeth clean!  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Despite this design problem, if cleaned regularly, it does an excellent job ;-)</li>
            <li>Overall, great product at affordable price.</li>
            <li>We received the Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush and really enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great they&#x27;ve come up with an affordable, basic model.</li>
            <li>I particularly enjoy the rubberized sides which makes griping it easier.</li>
            <li>If you buy these deal packages, which come around every year around the holidays, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you need to toss the handles in the trash periodically because you are basically getting them for free anyway.  </li>
            <li>It does take some time to adjust to the sound and vibration but you will.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrushes are cheap made.</li>
            <li>Great price for a Sonicare brush that does not have all the bells and whistles of different speeds etc.</li>
            <li>Make brushing your teeth fun!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>Works great, except that water always leaks into chamber between the brush head and handle, requiring me to towel dry it out to prevent mildew from growing in it.</li>
            <li>two minius work can clean the tooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mid range good buy type shopper and this item fit the description and is all it promised to be.  </li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>Actually has good quality</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush so much.</li>
            <li>Feels like I just got back from the dentist (in a good way)</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy</li>
            <li>not bad.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the mold issue that some of the other reviewers were talking about though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this new model!</li>
            <li>I love my new toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Powerful and effective, uses induction charging so completely waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Quickly too.</li>
            <li>I believe it stimulates blood flow to my gum line and gets around my crowns much better than normal floss and brushing.</li>
            <li>Not much maintenance for a pleasant product.</li>
            <li>After the initial adjustment phase, I love using this!</li>
            <li>Amazing addition to my daily routine!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;whine&amp;#34; sound makes you really believe it is &amp;#34;sonic.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed this toothbrush so far.  </li>
            <li>and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>it is definitely worth upgrading from a manual toothbrush to an electric one.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you don&#x27;t change the head frequently.</li>
            <li>Powerful vibration.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Sonicare that I had for more than 10 years with this one.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this if you are new to electronic toothbrushes or if you want a nice sonicare.</li>
            <li>The price was right, so I bought this one.  </li>
            <li>The newer models, for all of their so called new features, do not actually do anything more or better.  </li>
            <li>Cleans your teeth much better than a traditional brush and does a super job for the price.</li>
            <li>My husband enjoys it so much he would like it to last more than two minutes!  </li>
            <li>My old one still is going strong after 7 years with no sign of wear or battery</li>
            <li>I truly feel it is giving me a far superior cleaning experience than my prior brush.  </li>
            <li>I am able to clean areas that were harder to reach using a manual brush.</li>
            <li>and it is a great toothbrush and for the price, it is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife as her first sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the blue stripes are free because they do not seem to add much.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what they wanted and more, the extra head was a bonus too!</li>
            <li>I actually kind of expected to end up returning it</li>
            <li>next time i would buy more toothbursh head.</li>
            <li>I know it works 10 times  better then a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>My second Sonicare, I love them.</li>
            <li>I got a sonicare and at the next visit he complimented me on flossing more</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I also have one of their top models which is slimmer and with 3 different speed settings etc.  </li>
            <li>I hope it stands the test of time, I&#x27;ve used electric brushes for years and this is my first Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li>They are very effective and last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I will say, my most recent dental appointment went very well.  </li>
            <li>its good, just expect to invest a lot more money because the replacements are expensive and you need them often.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush head is way too small and the plastic parts of the head may rub against your teeth and it does not feel good having an intense vibration hit a tooth.</li>
            <li>Also, helps to whiten teeth with certain toothpaste well.  </li>
            <li>it automatically turns off after a certain amount of time, so</li>
            <li>Thanks for having this particular type brush!</li>
            <li>philips sonicare cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have bluetooth sync to my car, but it brushes teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I also notice my gums are much redder</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>but this brand is a very reliable item..</li>
            <li>The light will flash when you have plenty of power left, so it won&#x27;t just shut off.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>This model is really all any of us need.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner than with a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li>Really, I haven&#x27;t had cleaner teeth unless I went to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this model, eaiser to hold (not as skinny) and does what it was made for.</li>
            <li>i like it, it is a kind of daily essential.  </li>
            <li>Battery lasts a long time between charges so easy to travel with, not requiring to haul your charger.</li>
            <li>but Still 100 times better than other motorized brushes.</li>
            <li>Other than that the brush is ok.</li>
            <li>The brush head is the perfect size to get brush behind teeth, battery still holds charge for a long time in between recharges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes a couple of weeks to get over the tickle of it and slow down like I&#x27;m polishing each tooth, but me and my dentist are happy!</li>
            <li>my teeth felt like they were professionally cleaned the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I had heard about how terrific this toothbrush is and it is so true.  </li>
            <li>would skip this design and go for the kind with the thinner brush head, not this big hollow design.</li>
            <li>I had the older model about 10 years ago but have not had one since.</li>
            <li>only thing I dislike is that the timer is 2 minutes in total, and does not beep in 4 increments like most electric toothbrushes do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I particularly like this brand ...</li>
            <li>He raves about the aggressive but gentle action the vibrations give to really scrub your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the much more expensive Oral-B that I have.  </li>
            <li>this particular one was when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and for such quick service, too..</li>
            <li>The other type is way easier to clean and lasts much longer!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations before the purchase.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is another electronic toothbrush (battery operated and highly rated) that I will probably try out.</li>
            <li>Vibrations are tough to acclimate to, but provides a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>Apparently that is the higher dollar</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;d say it was a good purchase, but not a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new dental hygienist recommended that I purchase a sonicare about 3 years ago</li>
            <li>The real test will be the next time I have my teeth cleaned to see how much I get yelled at by the dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>Feels like you get your teeth cleaned professionally!</li>
            <li>first was that I thought I was buying the model that lets you know when enough time has passed on each section of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>and WOW does it work!</li>
            <li>Your battery will last much longer if you only put it on the charger once you get the low battery flashing light indication.  </li>
            <li>have had an an arm and hammer toothbrush and a different sonicare one in the past, but this one beats both of them handily.</li>
            <li>Seems a little more powerful and less leaky than the old one.  </li>
            <li>It is not too big or bulky, definitely makes a difference when brushing, and to come with an extra brush was a huge deal</li>
            <li>Every time I use it feels just like vetting your teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect a stinkin&#x27; toothbrush to make a difference in the way that my teeth not only felt but looked.</li>
            <li>Works well; offers a 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li>and this toothbrush is completely moldy.  </li>
            <li>Just replacing the one I had for over $15 years, which I was completely satisfies with, it does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>It seems to get my mouth so much cleaner than just a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>My old one had what they now call a quad timer which paused every 30 seconds for each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I had to replace an old Sonic boy</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like they are professionally cleaned every time I use it.</li>
            <li>as far as  </li>
            <li>I had an old school one that Konked out, so this is a replacement.  </li>
            <li>She said my gums are healthier than some of her 30 year old patients.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is an old model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve attached a picture here to show the mild issues in a less than 2 month old Sonicare toothbrush of this design.</li>
            <li>You can frequently buy these cheap Essence models with an included extra brush head, which ends up being only slightly more expensive than buying the two included brushes without the handle &amp; charger.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is pretty loud and moves really, really fast so with a small head, you have to be careful not to hit your teeth, but this toothbrush cleans better than any other toothbrush I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone starting using electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, especially for the price (got mine for $30) as opposed to $100 in stores.</li>
            <li>I have read about the Sonicare toothbrushes in the past, and felt like I pretty much knew what I was</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any real advantages in the more expensive models of Sonicare&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li>Takes up little space and does a powerful job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t stay on top of cleaning the well out it does get pretty dirty.</li>
            <li>inhale been using a oral b cross action for years and having to replace almost yearly.</li>
            <li>I had left over heads when my old one died (or so I thought).  </li>
            <li>Works well and is a replacement for my 4 year old model that finally died.</li>
            <li>My mother in law&#x27;s old Phillips finally died (after 45 years)...</li>
            <li>It does the job well and very affordable compared to other products out there.</li>
            <li>Mold will grow there if you don not disassemble the brush at least once a week and clean out the connection point.</li>
            <li>And if you have more than one dwelling where you stay regularly, you can have a handle and charger in each one for very little if any expenditure other than what you would have paid for the brush head replacements anyway.  </li>
            <li>My head was spinning after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>The only feature I feel I am missing is the \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; timer; I think this would help me pace my 2 minutes better and keep from getting impatient</li>
            <li>I am not able to compare it to another make or model, however, I can say it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>46 year old gums might get to keep their teef for a long time!</li>
            <li>but now the food practically glides right past my tooth and goes where it&#x27;s supposed to (which is not sticking on my teeth).</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t pause every 30 seconds to tell you to move to new section of your teeth like some other units.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical because I wasn&#x27;t used to using a mechanical tooth brush but after using it a few times my teeth looked and felt so clean!</li>

            <li> brushes are durable and my dentist is delighted with my home care so why not ?</li>
            <li> but this sonicare is surprisingly good and does feel compatible to those at dentist office.</li>

            <li> and I received it on Dec 9.thats amazing.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my toothes nice and shinery.</li>
            <li> however, the soni noise is kind of noisy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush teeth feel great after brushing it does what it says I have no complaints love the timer</li>
            <li> I also bought one for my granddaughter and she is equally enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price, brusheads are very large.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The neck of brush head is very easy to break.</li>
            <li> wow, I got a great deal on this!</li>
            <li> Comfortable and timed for good brushing.</li>
            <li> This is incredible and my teeth feel so much cleaner than before.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fresh from the dentist feeling!!!  </li>
            <li> All the good said about them is true</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a Sonicare Elite toothbrush that I&#x27;d had for many years and couldn&#x27;t find the Elite version anymore.  </li>
            <li> This Essence version is very similar in design and a great price!  </li>
            <li> Both me and my husband have the Essence toothbrush by Philips Sonicare and love them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, meh, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d say definitely better than that of oral-b.</li>
            <li> i hope it won&#x27;t affect my ear drums :).</li>
            <li> After using for the last 2 weeks, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love it for its simplicity.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> Bought this as gift, and my daughter and grandson just love it.  </li>
            <li> This was a much better deal considering discounts and additional replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> product is OK, but have to charge for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the built-in timer.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates faster than the others, and I feel as though my teeth are being cleaned better.  </li>
            <li> I like the rotating head type better.</li>
            <li> I love it and my dentist does, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that makes glad that the product fulfills the user&#x27;s expectations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying electric powered vibes in my facehole!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and vibrates just as fast as the $150 ones.</li>
            <li> It helps make my dentist visits better</li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicare toothbrush for many many years.</li>
            <li> and I love the tingle I feel after I get done brushing.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Best bargain for under $30.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more for all family when this goes on sale again.</li>
            <li> Not the top of the line but got it at a discount</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Keeps me healthy and also my teeth cleaner and Heather.</li>
            <li> Yes this cost more</li>
            <li> Love love love it</li>
            <li> and I feel is best for women or people with smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> Mine needs to put on the charger about once every week or more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting more heads for this</li>
            <li> these work so much better than spin brushes</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to floss more.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that so many of my family members did not use electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Love the power of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, and I highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> A year later, this toothbrush is still going strong and is awesome.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> He actually loves brushing his teeth and claims it&#x27;s the best and most clean feeling he&#x27;s ever had after brushing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, tickles a bit at first but in a good way, and reaches and effectively cleans all surfaces.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item at an incredible price in December, when it was bundled w/ an extra brush head as part of the &amp;#</li>
            <li> makes my whole mouth feal good  </li>
            <li> and I do not feel very comfortable when I use it to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I guess all the hoopla is true!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt more clean and I swear it has made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> The transaction process was also really easy.  </li>
            <li> Brush is easy to get used to and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to move around the mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this essence seriese is not as strong as premium model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice to get this with the extra head at a good price.</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST ever!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It uses the same E Series brush heads which work great at keeping my teeth clean!  </li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Despite this design problem, if cleaned regularly, it does an excellent job ;-)</li>
            <li> Overall, great product at affordable price.</li>
            <li> We received the Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush and really enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great they&#x27;ve come up with an affordable, basic model.</li>
            <li> I particularly enjoy the rubberized sides which makes griping it easier.</li>
            <li> If you buy these deal packages, which come around every year around the holidays, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you need to toss the handles in the trash periodically because you are basically getting them for free anyway.  </li>
            <li> It does take some time to adjust to the sound and vibration but you will.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrushes are cheap made.</li>
            <li> Great price for a Sonicare brush that does not have all the bells and whistles of different speeds etc.</li>
            <li> Make brushing your teeth fun!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> Works great, except that water always leaks into chamber between the brush head and handle, requiring me to towel dry it out to prevent mildew from growing in it.</li>
            <li> two minius work can clean the tooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid range good buy type shopper and this item fit the description and is all it promised to be.  </li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li> Actually has good quality</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush so much.</li>
            <li> Feels like I just got back from the dentist (in a good way)</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy</li>
            <li> not bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the mold issue that some of the other reviewers were talking about though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this new model!</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Powerful and effective, uses induction charging so completely waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Quickly too.</li>
            <li> I believe it stimulates blood flow to my gum line and gets around my crowns much better than normal floss and brushing.</li>
            <li> Not much maintenance for a pleasant product.</li>
            <li> After the initial adjustment phase, I love using this!</li>
            <li> Amazing addition to my daily routine!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;whine&amp;#34; sound makes you really believe it is &amp;#34;sonic.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this toothbrush so far.  </li>
            <li> and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> it is definitely worth upgrading from a manual toothbrush to an electric one.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you don&#x27;t change the head frequently.</li>
            <li> Powerful vibration.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Sonicare that I had for more than 10 years with this one.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you are new to electronic toothbrushes or if you want a nice sonicare.</li>
            <li> The price was right, so I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> The newer models, for all of their so called new features, do not actually do anything more or better.  </li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth much better than a traditional brush and does a super job for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband enjoys it so much he would like it to last more than two minutes!  </li>
            <li> My old one still is going strong after 7 years with no sign of wear or battery</li>
            <li> I truly feel it is giving me a far superior cleaning experience than my prior brush.  </li>
            <li> I am able to clean areas that were harder to reach using a manual brush.</li>
            <li> and it is a great toothbrush and for the price, it is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as her first sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately the blue stripes are free because they do not seem to add much.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what they wanted and more, the extra head was a bonus too!</li>
            <li> I actually kind of expected to end up returning it</li>
            <li> next time i would buy more toothbursh head.</li>
            <li> I know it works 10 times  better then a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My second Sonicare, I love them.</li>
            <li> I got a sonicare and at the next visit he complimented me on flossing more</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I also have one of their top models which is slimmer and with 3 different speed settings etc.  </li>
            <li> I hope it stands the test of time, I&#x27;ve used electric brushes for years and this is my first Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> They are very effective and last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I will say, my most recent dental appointment went very well.  </li>
            <li> its good, just expect to invest a lot more money because the replacements are expensive and you need them often.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush head is way too small and the plastic parts of the head may rub against your teeth and it does not feel good having an intense vibration hit a tooth.</li>
            <li> Also, helps to whiten teeth with certain toothpaste well.  </li>
            <li> it automatically turns off after a certain amount of time, so</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this particular type brush!</li>
            <li> philips sonicare cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have bluetooth sync to my car, but it brushes teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I also notice my gums are much redder</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> but this brand is a very reliable item..</li>
            <li> The light will flash when you have plenty of power left, so it won&#x27;t just shut off.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> This model is really all any of us need.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner than with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li> Really, I haven&#x27;t had cleaner teeth unless I went to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this model, eaiser to hold (not as skinny) and does what it was made for.</li>
            <li> i like it, it is a kind of daily essential.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time between charges so easy to travel with, not requiring to haul your charger.</li>
            <li> but Still 100 times better than other motorized brushes.</li>
            <li> Other than that the brush is ok.</li>
            <li> The brush head is the perfect size to get brush behind teeth, battery still holds charge for a long time in between recharges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a couple of weeks to get over the tickle of it and slow down like I&#x27;m polishing each tooth, but me and my dentist are happy!</li>
            <li> my teeth felt like they were professionally cleaned the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I had heard about how terrific this toothbrush is and it is so true.  </li>
            <li> would skip this design and go for the kind with the thinner brush head, not this big hollow design.</li>
            <li> I had the older model about 10 years ago but have not had one since.</li>
            <li> only thing I dislike is that the timer is 2 minutes in total, and does not beep in 4 increments like most electric toothbrushes do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I particularly like this brand ...</li>
            <li> He raves about the aggressive but gentle action the vibrations give to really scrub your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the much more expensive Oral-B that I have.  </li>
            <li> this particular one was when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and for such quick service, too..</li>
            <li> The other type is way easier to clean and lasts much longer!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations before the purchase.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is another electronic toothbrush (battery operated and highly rated) that I will probably try out.</li>
            <li> Vibrations are tough to acclimate to, but provides a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> Apparently that is the higher dollar</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;d say it was a good purchase, but not a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new dental hygienist recommended that I purchase a sonicare about 3 years ago</li>
            <li> The real test will be the next time I have my teeth cleaned to see how much I get yelled at by the dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> Feels like you get your teeth cleaned professionally!</li>
            <li> first was that I thought I was buying the model that lets you know when enough time has passed on each section of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> and WOW does it work!</li>
            <li> Your battery will last much longer if you only put it on the charger once you get the low battery flashing light indication.  </li>
            <li> have had an an arm and hammer toothbrush and a different sonicare one in the past, but this one beats both of them handily.</li>
            <li> Seems a little more powerful and less leaky than the old one.  </li>
            <li> It is not too big or bulky, definitely makes a difference when brushing, and to come with an extra brush was a huge deal</li>
            <li> Every time I use it feels just like vetting your teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect a stinkin&#x27; toothbrush to make a difference in the way that my teeth not only felt but looked.</li>
            <li> Works well; offers a 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> and this toothbrush is completely moldy.  </li>
            <li> Just replacing the one I had for over $15 years, which I was completely satisfies with, it does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> It seems to get my mouth so much cleaner than just a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My old one had what they now call a quad timer which paused every 30 seconds for each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace an old Sonic boy</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they are professionally cleaned every time I use it.</li>
            <li> as far as  </li>
            <li> I had an old school one that Konked out, so this is a replacement.  </li>
            <li> She said my gums are healthier than some of her 30 year old patients.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is an old model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attached a picture here to show the mild issues in a less than 2 month old Sonicare toothbrush of this design.</li>
            <li> You can frequently buy these cheap Essence models with an included extra brush head, which ends up being only slightly more expensive than buying the two included brushes without the handle &amp; charger.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is pretty loud and moves really, really fast so with a small head, you have to be careful not to hit your teeth, but this toothbrush cleans better than any other toothbrush I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone starting using electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, especially for the price (got mine for $30) as opposed to $100 in stores.</li>
            <li> I have read about the Sonicare toothbrushes in the past, and felt like I pretty much knew what I was</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any real advantages in the more expensive models of Sonicare&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li> Takes up little space and does a powerful job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t stay on top of cleaning the well out it does get pretty dirty.</li>
            <li> inhale been using a oral b cross action for years and having to replace almost yearly.</li>
            <li> I had left over heads when my old one died (or so I thought).  </li>
            <li> Works well and is a replacement for my 4 year old model that finally died.</li>
            <li> My mother in law&#x27;s old Phillips finally died (after 45 years)...</li>
            <li> It does the job well and very affordable compared to other products out there.</li>
            <li> Mold will grow there if you don not disassemble the brush at least once a week and clean out the connection point.</li>
            <li> And if you have more than one dwelling where you stay regularly, you can have a handle and charger in each one for very little if any expenditure other than what you would have paid for the brush head replacements anyway.  </li>
            <li> My head was spinning after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> The only feature I feel I am missing is the \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; timer; I think this would help me pace my 2 minutes better and keep from getting impatient</li>
            <li> I am not able to compare it to another make or model, however, I can say it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> 46 year old gums might get to keep their teef for a long time!</li>
            <li> but now the food practically glides right past my tooth and goes where it&#x27;s supposed to (which is not sticking on my teeth).</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t pause every 30 seconds to tell you to move to new section of your teeth like some other units.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because I wasn&#x27;t used to using a mechanical tooth brush but after using it a few times my teeth looked and felt so clean!</li>
            <li> The footprint is as small as they get (so far as I know), and the toothbrush has been reliable so far.</li>
            <li> It holds an incredibly long charge obviously!</li>
            <li> second is that the actual brush head is very small, and doesn&#x27;t hold much toothpaste, so I feel like I need to replenish it about halfway through brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a replacement for another one (same type) that become unusable due to how much gross, smelly gunk/mold built up inside under the replaceable brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using oral-b for a long time.</li>
            <li> I see no reason for long comments.</li>
            <li> Why did I go so long without an electric toothbrush?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Two minor disappointments:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> No 30 second indicator, but I am already used to the 2 minute time frame, so not really needed.</li>
            <li> I have sonicare for very long time</li>
            <li> It seems too much vibration, not good for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day, my teeth would normally feel icky and grimy with leftover food and what not</li>
            <li> Try taking off the brush head every time you brush to let both the brush head and handle air dry!  </li>
            <li> After the next checkup with my dentist they noticed my teeth were noticably cleaner, less gum bleeding, etc.</li>
            <li> Go for something with a slim design where water cannot get trapped in the middle.</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t have a 30 sec.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased a second package for my fiancee after trying mine for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Once I have gotten  used to the toothbrush and am careful how I use it, I would not have another one.</li>
            <li> Only had it a few days</li>
            <li> The overall design of this toothbrush could also be better, as water and gunk tends to accumulate in the well beneath where the head attaches to the base.</li>
            <li> I bought 12 total this past Christmas for family members and friends.  </li>
            <li> I think the idea of putting something that vibrates that intense on a tooth is not ideal</li>
            <li> It was a little weird getting used to (kinda tickled my mouth at first), but I have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> Price has went down.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it does not fit in the travel case I already had for the previous brush.</li>
            <li> Shipping was crazy fast! ...</li>
            <li> does* get a little grody inside the head casing...</li>
            <li> it is bit heavy as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using one for a few years and it makes your teeth feel like you just had them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I am using it for over two years and my hygienist noticed the difference after just using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Note that you need to take them apart and clean under the brush head regularly or they can get a bit nasty.</li>
            <li> The included thin case is usable for travel and the handles will usually work for at least a week&#x27;s worth of twice daily brushing for one person; the base will not fit into the travel case, however.</li>
            <li> Other brands I&#x27;ve tried have all failed me after a few months.</li>
            <li> Had to replace old one, because battery went bad.  </li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare for a least 10 yrs.  </li>
            <li> That was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> This has a very small brush on it</li>
            <li> only problem is that the brush needs to be disconnected from the base every few days as it collects water and it becomes dirty/moldy all the time.  </li>
            <li> only bad thing</li>
            <li> He says it makes the old $10 battery-operated toothbrush seem really worthless.  </li>
            <li> have very disappointed the difference is not only design but also the power down.</li>
            <li> I have cleaned and rinsed repeatedly, but it just gets worse.  </li>
            <li> The head is expensive when you exchange</li>
            <li> So sorry I didn&#x27;t find this toothbrush years ago.  </li>
            <li> You wont be sorry</li>
            <li> But as silly as it sounds</li>
            <li> I can go on a week trip and leave the charger base behind without worries.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find one with the Type E replacement heads of which she is so fond...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he wanted one so badly.  </li>
            <li> Its pulsating with the 33,000 brush strokes but base model without all the rif raf.  </li>
            <li> , bad me did not floss!</li>
            <li> Both the brush head and the base are disgusting.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> aPhilips Sonicare HX5612/09 Essence Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush Holiday</li>
            <li> I am so impressed.  inhale been using a oral b cross action for years and having to replace almost yearly. This tooth brush is solid and ten times the power.  Every time I use it feels just like vetting your teeth professionally cleaned.  Not to mention it has a 2 1/2year warranty.</li>
            <li> Keeps my toothes nice and shinery.</li>
            <li> my teeth felt like they were professionally cleaned the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attached a picture here to show the mild issues in a less than 2 month old Sonicare toothbrush of this design. It was a replacement for another one (same type) that become unusable due to how much gross, smelly gunk/mold built up inside under the replaceable brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would skip this design and go for the kind with the thinner brush head, not this big hollow design. The other type is way easier to clean and lasts much longer!</li>
            <li> Has all the features of the more expensive models. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing addition to my daily routine!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sonicare.  Good product. The head is expensive when you exchange</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a Sonicare Elite toothbrush that I&#x27;d had for many years and couldn&#x27;t find the Elite version anymore.  This Essence version is very similar in design and a great price!  I did take off one star only because it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second quadrant reminder that the Elite model did which I do miss but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.  It uses the same E Series brush heads which work great at keeping my teeth clean!  TIP FOR THOSE WHO SAID THEY HAVE MOLD!  I&#x27;ve never had that problem when using the toothbrush that uses the E series brush heads.  I ALWAYS remove the brush head after every time I brush and have a holder that came with the Elite that I place it on.  I&#x27;m guessing that the mold may be from leaving the brush head on all of the time.  ???  Try taking off the brush head every time you brush to let both the brush head and handle air dry!  I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Bought one for my daughter and grandson for Christmas. They love it!  I am going on my sixth year of&lt;br /&gt;having one. Charger just went out, buying another.</li>
            <li> Both me and my husband have the Essence toothbrush by Philips Sonicare and love them.  My daughter wanted one so I bought her the same one.  She loves it and tells me all the time.  Says it feels like she just left the dentist every time she brushes her teethe!  Very pleased with item and price!</li>
            <li> Brushing &#x3D; A+++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping water out of the thing &#x3D; D-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, meh, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! Cleans your teeth much better than a traditional brush and does a super job for the price.</li>
            <li> This is another excellent toothbrush from Sonicare.  All the good said about them is true and I&#x27;ve yet to find any bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this toothbrush as a spare.  My old one still is going strong after 7 years with no sign of wear or battery fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with Sonicare is the cost of the replacement brush heads and I solved that gripe by continuing to use a brush head way, way, way, WAY beyond their recommended life. . .The brushes are durable and my dentist is delighted with my home care so why not ?</li>
            <li> I love this! Gets my teeth real clean! I bought my boyfriend one too, he hasn&#x27;t used it yet though</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as her first sonicare.  It is perfect for travel or as an entry level sonicare toothbrush.  I would highly recommend this if you are new to electronic toothbrushes or if you want a nice sonicare.</li>
            <li> philips sonicare cleans my teeth very well. i&#x27;d say definitely better than that of oral-b. I&#x27;ve been using oral-b for a long time. but this sonicare is surprisingly good and does feel compatible to those at dentist office. however, the soni noise is kind of noisy. i hope it won&#x27;t affect my ear drums :). just used it twice. don&#x27;t know how about the rusting and cleaning. it is bit heavy as well. for the price, this is definitely excess expectation!</li>
            <li> Overall, great product at affordable price. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations before the purchase. After using for the last 2 weeks, I am very happy with it. It does the job well and very affordable compared to other products out there. Love it for its simplicity. Highly recommended for anyone starting using electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> We received the Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush and really enjoy using it.  I have never had an electric toothbrush that worked and this one makes me feel like I just had my teeth cleaned at Dentist.</li>
            <li> it is a real great thing. But it is charged by110v, there is only 220V in my home. I have to buy a transformer in order to use it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used one of these forever, they improve over time but she has always used the sonicare, hers died and I got this one. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I have sonicare for very long time and I love it~~~!&lt;br /&gt;this essence seriese is not as strong as premium model.&lt;br /&gt;I have very disappointed the difference is not only design but also the power down. but Still 100 times better than other motorized brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. I have been using one for a few years and it makes your teeth feel like you just had them cleaned at the dentist. Great plaque control.</li>
            <li> Bought this as gift, and my daughter and grandson just love it.  Feels like you get your teeth cleaned professionally!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  I bought one for everybody in the house and they all like theirs too.  It cleans your teeth and gums and runs for two minutes so you don&#x27;t have to time yourself.</li>
            <li> Good with the coupon, the electricity shaking feels very good. Actually has good quality, I might consider buy it again if I need</li>
            <li> I had heard about how terrific this toothbrush is and it is so true.  It is light weight and easy to use.  It has a built in timer which is helpful.  I can&#x27;t wait to go to my dentist for my checkup to see how well it is cleaning.  I would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I had left over heads when my old one died (or so I thought).  The newer models, for all of their so called new features, do not actually do anything more or better.  This was a much better deal considering discounts and additional replacement heads.  Seems a little more powerful and less leaky than the old one.  Fortunately the blue stripes are free because they do not seem to add much.</li>
            <li> product is OK, but have to charge for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s the defective or not, because electric razor can last for month.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Took a few times to get the hang of it, but once I did, it worked very well.  The real test will be the next time I have my teeth cleaned to see how much I get yelled at by the dental hygienist.  With any luck that should be at a minimum.  I love the built-in timer.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Timer is great and works well.  Also, helps to whiten teeth with certain toothpaste well.  Additional head is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush teeth feel great after brushing it does what it says I have no complaints love the timer</li>
            <li> It was a gift, and that person loved it! It was exactly what they wanted and more, the extra head was a bonus too!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have bluetooth sync to my car, but it brushes teeth very well.  I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for years and it&#x27;s great they&#x27;ve come up with an affordable, basic model.</li>
            <li> OMG! I love this toothbrush so much. I had own electronic toothbrush before but none of them work as well as this philips! ^_^</li>
            <li> I have owned three different power toothbrushes, and I wish I had found this one sooner.  It vibrates faster than the others, and I feel as though my teeth are being cleaned better.  The footprint is as small as they get (so far as I know), and the toothbrush has been reliable so far.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect a stinkin&#x27; toothbrush to make a difference in the way that my teeth not only felt but looked. Geez! I actually kind of expected to end up returning it but no way! Anyone touches my sonicare toothbrush and they have hell to pay! This thing is awesome! My teeth have never felt more clean and I swear it has made my teeth whiter. Throughout the day, my teeth would normally feel icky and grimy with leftover food and what not but now the food practically glides right past my tooth and goes where it&#x27;s supposed to (which is not sticking on my teeth). Very nice!</li>
            <li> Works great, except that water always leaks into chamber between the brush head and handle, requiring me to towel dry it out to prevent mildew from growing in it.</li>
            <li> It seems too much vibration, not good for my teeth. maybe just me. I like the rotating head type better. But my wife loves it. Considering the price I got, I&#x27;ll give it a five star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for years. I love it and my dentist does, too. I particularly enjoy the rubberized sides which makes griping it easier.</li>
            <li> i like it, it is a kind of daily essential.  i use it everyday and i also bought two for my parents.</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas; have now been using for 2 months. This is supposed to have a cycle that \\&quot;eases\\&quot; the user into the electric toothbrush; however, I don&#x27;t think mine was working. My head was spinning after the first few uses. After the initial adjustment phase, I love using this! I haven&#x27;t owned an electric toothbrush before, so this was an affordable upgrade from a traditional toothbrush. Works well; offers a 2 minute timer. The only feature I feel I am missing is the \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; timer; I think this would help me pace my 2 minutes better and keep from getting impatient (2 minutes still seems like forever sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 2014:  5 months later and this toothbrush is completely moldy.  Both the brush head and the base are disgusting.  I have cleaned and rinsed repeatedly, but it just gets worse.  I have not tried cleaning in the dishwasher because honestly, it is so gross it is not an ongoing problem I want to deal with.  I will say, my most recent dental appointment went very well.  I would recommend an electric toothbrush to everyone now!  Just not this one.  Go for something with a slim design where water cannot get trapped in the middle.</li>
            <li> when I asked the recipient how he or she likes the toothbrush, the reply was &amp;#34;AWESOME&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that makes glad that the product fulfills the user&#x27;s expectations</li>
            <li> Great brush! My husband enjoys it so much he would like it to last more than two minutes!  We love it!</li>
            <li> Pleased with the price, works great. Included extra brush. I&#x27;m enjoying electric powered vibes in my facehole!&lt;br /&gt;My 46 year old gums might get to keep their teef for a long time!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because I wasn&#x27;t used to using a mechanical tooth brush but after using it a few times my teeth looked and felt so clean! It&#x27;s great, and I highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> It is the same model I had prior to this and it is a great toothbrush and for the price, it is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Just replacing the one I had for over $15 years, which I was completely satisfies with, it does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> ...and, I didn&#x27;t have to get yelled at about flossing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside, this does a great job. It&#x27;s powerful, tickles a bit at first but in a good way, and reaches and effectively cleans all surfaces. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and the brush head is still in good shape. It *does* get a little grody inside the head casing...but now that I know that I just wipe it out when I remember.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to step up from a standard manual brush, don&#x27;t bother with those $5-$10 AA battery powered one. This is a great deal and vibrates just as fast as the $150 ones. It just doesn&#x27;t have the chime to tell you to change quadrants. Personally I just count. If i do all 4 quads before the timer shuts off at 2 minutes, I just go back through quicker until it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare for a least 10 yrs.  Had to replace old one, because battery went bad.  10+ yrs not bad.  It helps make my dentist visits better</li>
            <li> I like it , dose a good job makes my whole mouth feal good  only bad thing it don&#x27;t have a 30 sec. indecider on it</li>
            <li> I bought this while it was on sale, and I received an additional discount from Amazon via a $10 off coupon. This was cheaper than any price in any of the stores I looked at. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I really notice a difference. I am able to clean areas that were harder to reach using a manual brush. I like that it automatically turns off after a certain amount of time, so I know that I am done. It was a little weird getting used to (kinda tickled my mouth at first), but I have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> the feeling of using it is good. two minius work can clean the tooth. next time i would buy more toothbursh head.</li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicare toothbrush for many many years. They are very effective and last for a very long time. This is my second one. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You can frequently buy these cheap Essence models with an included extra brush head, which ends up being only slightly more expensive than buying the two included brushes without the handle &amp; charger.  I don&#x27;t see any real advantages in the more expensive models of Sonicare&#x27;s line.  If you buy these deal packages, which come around every year around the holidays, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you need to toss the handles in the trash periodically because you are basically getting them for free anyway.  And if you have more than one dwelling where you stay regularly, you can have a handle and charger in each one for very little if any expenditure other than what you would have paid for the brush head replacements anyway.  The included thin case is usable for travel and the handles will usually work for at least a week&#x27;s worth of twice daily brushing for one person; the base will not fit into the travel case, however.</li>
            <li> I had the older model about 10 years ago but have not had one since. I love this new model! It seems to get my mouth so much cleaner than just a regular tooth brush. I also notice my gums are much redder and I love the tingle I feel after I get done brushing. I believe it stimulates blood flow to my gum line and gets around my crowns much better than normal floss and brushing. I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Powerful and effective, uses induction charging so completely waterproof.  Battery lasts a long time between charges so easy to travel with, not requiring to haul your charger.</li>
            <li> Quality toothbrush.  My teeth feel much cleaner.  I love it.  The transaction process was also really easy.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. Best bargain for under $30.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more for all family when this goes on sale again.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this toothbrush so far.  I truly feel it is giving me a far superior cleaning experience than my prior brush.  This brush was recommended by my dentist and I am looking forward to my next exam to see my results.</li>
            <li> Everybody in our family is using this product and it does an excellent job.  I am using it for over two years and my hygienist noticed the difference after just using it for a few weeks.  The batteries in the rechargeable units last for over a week, and we  plug it into the charger only when it beeps for low battery.  We also have one which uses a battery (it is used with a an Eneloop  rechargeable battery) and the battery needs to be recharged every couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the brush needs to be disconnected from the base every few days as it collects water and it becomes dirty/moldy all the time.  Despite this design problem, if cleaned regularly, it does an excellent job ;-)</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Much better than I expected. Takes up little space and does a powerful job on my teeth.  Quickly too.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing else to say except they could have made the battery replaceable. I see no reason for long comments.</li>
            <li> Who needs a dental cleaning with this toothbrush?  I am amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth.  I do feel like I&#x27;ve just returned from the dentist each time I use it.  It does take some time to adjust to the sound and vibration but you will.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.  I bought one for my wife, children, and some family members for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of cleaning teeth. Works well and is a replacement for my 4 year old model that finally died. Took 1 star off because it said it had the timer but it is only a 2 minute timer.  My old one had what they now call a quad timer which paused every 30 seconds for each quadrant of your mouth.  It was easier to move to the next quadrant than all of a sudden having the thing just stop.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have owned an electric toothbrush, and boy have I been missing it! My teeth instantly feel cleaner and look whiter. I will never go back to a manual toothbrush again. I am not able to compare it to another make or model, however, I can say it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they were polished by a dentist every time I brush my teeth. Easily the best investment you could make for your mouth/teeth. I purchased the item at an incredible price in December, when it was bundled w/ an extra brush head as part of the &amp;#34;holiday package&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike is that the timer is 2 minutes in total, and does not beep in 4 increments like most electric toothbrushes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased a second package for my fiancee after trying mine for a few weeks. I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fresh from the dentist feeling!!!  Brush is easy to get used to and easy to use.  Make brushing your teeth fun!</li>
            <li> I had to replace an old Sonic boy this was a steal of a deal! Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a while&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they are professionally cleaned every time I use it.</li>
            <li> as far as  I know it works 10 times  better then a regular tooth brush. can&#x27;t wait till my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> Been using Sonicare for years now. Nice to get this with the extra head at a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Philips Sonicare for several years and like them quite a lot. This one is the replacement for the one that the battery quit holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Great price and works great. It came with a extra head. This made the price even more attractive. Getting one for Granddaughter next.</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes are cheap made. They only last 3 weeks each.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great. Vibrations are tough to acclimate to, but provides a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> wow, I got a great deal on this! It is not too big or bulky, definitely makes a difference when brushing, and to come with an extra brush was a huge deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid range good buy type shopper and this item fit the description and is all it promised to be.  Not the top of the line but got it at a discount and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I moved 2 months ago and have yet to charge my toothbrush since the night before I left!  It holds an incredibly long charge obviously! I will never go back to a regular toothbrush. My teeth feelike great every time I use this product!  Love it. Highly recommend, especially for the price (got mine for $30) as opposed to $100 in stores. Get one!!!</li>
            <li> i like it , very good</li>
            <li> I particularly like this brand ...this is my second one seven years....nothing last forever but this brand is a very reliable item..</li>
            <li> Great price, does what I want and I don&#x27;t even miss the 30 second beeps of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Good price. Arrived timely. Works well.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Should have got one years ago, like having a dental cleaning every day.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.  I had one for over five years before it would not hold a charge.  Price has went down.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable electric toothbrush. It does what it suppose to.  it is definitely worth upgrading from a manual toothbrush to an electric one.</li>
            <li> I really love my Philips Sonicare! Keeps me healthy and also my teeth cleaner and Heather.</li>
            <li> The neck of brush head is very easy to break. Make sure that you don&#x27;t change the head frequently. In addition, &amp;#34;BRUSH HEAD IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY&amp;#34; should be put in product description.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> its good, just expect to invest a lot more money because the replacements are expensive and you need them often.</li>
            <li> So sorry I didn&#x27;t find this toothbrush years ago.  Hands down the BEST ever!!!!!!  I will never try another brand, even a cheaper one.  Yes this cost more but there is a reason, it actually gets the tartar off.  Love love love it</li>
            <li> Feels like I just got back from the dentist (in a good way) every time I use it!</li>
            <li> Why did I go so long without an electric toothbrush?  Well the price always steered me away.  Great price and dentist clean teeth equals a happy mouth.</li>
            <li> Got the toothbrush for my grandson.  It works great and he is brushing longer and better.  Very good product and good price.</li>
            <li> This has a very small brush on it and I feel is best for women or people with smaller mouths. However,  I think you can buy some larger after-market generic refills for this.  NOTE: DO NOT keep the brush on the charger all the time.  Your battery will last much longer if you only put it on the charger once you get the low battery flashing light indication.  The light will flash when you have plenty of power left, so it won&#x27;t just shut off.  Mine needs to put on the charger about once every week or more...brushing three times a day.</li>
            <li> The brush does not come with the quadpacer timer as advertised.  That was a big disappointment.  Other than that the brush is ok.</li>
            <li> Im in China . I bought it on December 1 and I received it on Dec 9.thats amazing. its convenient,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he wanted one so badly.  He actually loves brushing his teeth and claims it&#x27;s the best and most clean feeling he&#x27;s ever had after brushing.  I&#x27;ll be getting more heads for this so we can both use it!  He raves about the aggressive but gentle action the vibrations give to really scrub your teeth.  He says it makes the old $10 battery-operated toothbrush seem really worthless.  I guess all the hoopla is true!</li>
            <li> I have read about the Sonicare toothbrushes in the past, and felt like I pretty much knew what I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two minor disappointments:&lt;br /&gt;The first was that I thought I was buying the model that lets you know when enough time has passed on each section of your mouth.  Apparently that is the higher dollar model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second is that the actual brush head is very small, and doesn&#x27;t hold much toothpaste, so I feel like I need to replenish it about halfway through brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d say it was a good purchase, but not a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another electronic toothbrush (battery operated and highly rated) that I will probably try out.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the much more expensive Oral-B that I have.  Very good for the price, brusheads are very large.</li>
            <li> delivery and packaging excellent and very satisfied with performance</li>
            <li> To teenagers or middle school students should use this they are just gross with their teeth. Market it to them</li>
            <li> Teeth feel much cleaner.  This model is really all any of us need.  Its pulsating with the 33,000 brush strokes but base model without all the rif raf.  I do wish this model had an attachment that cleans gums too.  Brush heads are 8.50 - 10.00 to replace every three months.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is amazing.  My new dental hygienist recommended that I purchase a sonicare about 3 years ago, I had gum disease and lots of tarter build up.  Since using it, I no longer have gum disease and I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since either!</li>
            <li> only downside is that water accumulates inbetween the head and the batter protion. Mold will grow there if you don not disassemble the brush at least once a week and clean out the connection point. Not a big deal. these work so much better than spin brushes..Highly reccomend. You wont be sorry</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush!  I had an old school one that Konked out, so this is a replacement.  The price was right, so I bought this one.  I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> excellent item for good dental health. This replaced the one I got 8-10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping teeth clean. Comfortable and timed for good brushing.</li>
            <li> Terrific! My teeth are slippery and white. With my dental tech&#x27;s agreement, I changed the frequency of her cleaning from every 4 to every 6 months. I&#x27;m 89 with all my teeth including 3 of 4 wisdom teeth. She said my gums are healthier than some of her 30 year old patients. I also bought one for my granddaughter and she is equally enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> I been using sonicare for two months and it been greatest electric toothbrush I have ever had that why I have giver it a five stars</li>
            <li> Easy to use and I can feel the difference. After the next checkup with my dentist they noticed my teeth were noticably cleaner, less gum bleeding, etc. All around improvement in only three months. Imagine if I always used it twice a day and actually flossed! haha</li>
            <li> My second Sonicare, I love them. My teeth feel so much cleaner than with a manual brush. Much cheaper on Amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li> This is the third Sonicare I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the value this particular one was when I purchased it.  But, it works just as good as the one it replaced.  Does a great job.</li>
            <li> Long battery life. Powerful vibration. Easy to move around the mouth. Did a good job in cleaning the teeth. Good price.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric toothbrush for years - the under $10 variety. There is no comparison! This is incredible and my teeth feel so much cleaner than before. The &amp;#34;whine&amp;#34; sound makes you really believe it is &amp;#34;sonic.&amp;#34; Want to give everyone in the family one.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to floss more. I got a sonicare and at the next visit he complimented me on flossing more, bad me did not floss! Takes a couple of weeks to get over the tickle of it and slow down like I&#x27;m polishing each tooth, but me and my dentist are happy!</li>
            <li> I was amazed that so many of my family members did not use electric toothbrushes.  Sonicare makes an awesome brush.  Cleans your teeth so well that you will feel like you do not need to floss anymore.  I bought 12 total this past Christmas for family members and friends.  Great starter electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Makes you feel like you&#x27;re holding a jack hammer to your face. The tooth brush head is way too small and the plastic parts of the head may rub against your teeth and it does not feel good having an intense vibration hit a tooth. I feel like this is an old model. I think the idea of putting something that vibrates that intense on a tooth is not ideal</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel clean and it&#x27;s not just me. My dentist said they look great too! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review a year after I purchased this. A year later, this toothbrush is still going strong and is awesome. The brush head is the perfect size to get brush behind teeth, battery still holds charge for a long time in between recharges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the mold issue that some of the other reviewers were talking about though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had an an arm and hammer toothbrush and a different sonicare one in the past, but this one beats both of them handily. I can go on a week trip and leave the charger base behind without worries.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is pretty loud and moves really, really fast so with a small head, you have to be careful not to hit your teeth, but this toothbrush cleans better than any other toothbrush I have ever had. My teeth feel like I just had a cleaning at the dentist, but without the anxiety of actually going to the dentist. Once I have gotten  used to the toothbrush and am careful how I use it, I would not have another one. You don&#x27;t put any pressure at all on your teeth, you just let it do its work and WOW does it work! Really, I haven&#x27;t had cleaner teeth unless I went to the dentist for a cleaning. I really love this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THE  sONICARE TOOTH BRUSHES FOR YEARS.  bY THE WAY PLEASE DON&#x27;T CALL ME &amp;#34;BEANS&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU, gRACE sTONEHAM</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Sonicare that I had for more than 10 years with this one. It has been working as I thought it would. It holds a charge for almost 2 weeks. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was crazy fast! ...thanks! In my opinion you cant go wrong with a sonic brush, we love them, and this one is no different.</li>
            <li> I like the sonicare toothbrushes and picked this one up on sale so I could give it to someone who had not yet experienced them. I have happily used them for years. Note that you need to take them apart and clean under the brush head regularly or they can get a bit nasty. Not much maintenance for a pleasant product.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended for me to use this brush.  It works well and I like it a lot.  However, it you are not use to an electric tooth brush, it is best to put it in your mouth and then close your mouth before you hit the on button.  It might save you from some cleaning and a change of cloths.  I got my son one for Christmas and I warned him to close his mouth before he turned it on.  He knew what happened and busted out laughing at me.</li>
            <li> For the cost, this is a great electric toothbrush. But as silly as it sounds I miss the 30 second interval reminders of the more expensive version of this toothbrush. The overall design of this toothbrush could also be better, as water and gunk tends to accumulate in the well beneath where the head attaches to the base. If you don&#x27;t stay on top of cleaning the well out it does get pretty dirty. Overall a good buy and I would recommend it, but keep those things in mind if you&#x27;re going to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement toothbrush, and works great.  No 30 second indicator, but I am already used to the 2 minute time frame, so not really needed. The only complaint I have is that it does not fit in the travel case I already had for the previous brush.</li>
            <li> Love the power of this toothbrush. Only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t pause every 30 seconds to tell you to move to new section of your teeth like some other units. It does however automatically shutoff after 2 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> It is too big to hold and I do not feel very comfortable when I use it to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is a no frills tooth brush, just what I wanted.  Great price for a Sonicare brush that does not have all the bells and whistles of different speeds etc. I also have one of their top models which is slimmer and with 3 different speed settings etc.  I much prefer this model, eaiser to hold (not as skinny) and does what it was made for.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this particular type brush! My mother in law&#x27;s old Phillips finally died (after 45 years)... It is almost impossible to find one with the Type E replacement heads of which she is so fond...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and for such quick service, too..</li>
            <li> Great power toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Only had it a few days and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far. I hope it stands the test of time, I&#x27;ve used electric brushes for years and this is my first Sonicare brush.  Other brands I&#x27;ve tried have all failed me after a few months.</li>
