    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>have to say I am impressed!</li>
            <li>These work great!!</li>
            <li>This one however gave the best result in a minimum amount of time.</li>
            <li>Excellent whitener.</li>
            <li>Happy whitening everybody!</li>
            <li>Great price for this product!!</li>
            <li>Very glad I purchased this item!</li>
            <li>Works great and have been using for years now.  </li>
            <li>the prodact works great</li>
            <li>works well, great price.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Nothing works as good as using the cheaper strips every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as going to a dentist and get a whitening treatment.</li>
            <li>I bought this 2-pack from another retailer, so that both my husband and I could use them for the price of one (good deal, btw!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be good for a year or two.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good value.</li>
            <li>Also, surprisingly, I saw a difference after just the one treatment.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED the 2 hour express whitestrips and was bummed to see them discontinued.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it in conjunction with crest 3D toothpaste/mouth wash!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with them and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I found this product to be effective.  </li>
            <li>The current product is awesome, fantastic and gives brilliant results.  </li>
            <li>This buy one get one free for $40 is a great deal though, can&#x27;t find a better price</li>
            <li>it was great loved it very</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, brighter smile, excellent quality - not much tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>, i got it very fast to israel, great value for 2 packages</li>
            <li>Follow the direction and they work fine!</li>
            <li>I love Crest Whitestrips and 1 Hr Express strips.  </li>
            <li>Going to try 3 more</li>
            <li>I tend to use these on a more &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; basis.  </li>
            <li>dont use it for more then the 1 hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i dont know if is because i used it more then an hour</li>
            <li>Yellowish and even brownish hues are more superficial surface stains and can be removed with a whitening system.</li>
            <li>I have gotten a professional treatment before and this does just as good plus WAY cheaper!</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>well&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had anything else noticeably work so fast, and I&#x27;m pretty happy about that.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not diamond white</li>
            <li>Great value compared to buying at your local store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had excellent results (significantly noticeable after only a week) with that - and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than the strips.</li>
            <li>ok just try it right know</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>This double pack is good value for money</li>
            <li>It gives the best results (super bright white teeth), in one treatment, and with less pain, but the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever seen it is $500 and as high as $1,000.</li>
            <li>Do you need to use super glue to get these things to stick to your teeth?  </li>
            <li>but there is significant difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I received it on time and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>and it really does work!  </li>
            <li>esp since they recommend not brushing shortly before use&lt;br /&gt;Dramatic results for more than 1/10 the cost of professional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will stick these on during my commute if I know my drive will last more than an hour.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty neat to see in my mirror</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used crest white strips for years but this type is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference with the first use.</li>
            <li>I just hope that they continue to whiten as well as the first time.</li>
            <li>this was my first try</li>
            <li>if i can update the review i will give more feed back\\ Update the tingling sensation stop the next day</li>
            <li>If you are willing to spend the money, I would go with laser whitening.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>At Costco you get two great big boxes with a total of 16 strips in them when unpackaged are smaller than a 1/2 deck of cards.  </li>
            <li>Used 3 whitestrips in a week and really didn&#x27;t notice a real brightness.  </li>
            <li>For the price this product really can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>Teeth are much whiter after 2 applications.</li>
            <li>I have had very little sensitivity, which is good since I have sensitive teeth and was expecting some pain or something.  </li>
            <li>The box says &amp;#34;years of yellow disappear&amp;#34; - this just ain&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are super white and are staying that way.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t used most of them trying to whiten my teeth, I would have sent them back for my money back.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never used white strips and was apprehensive, since I&#x27;ve used both BriteSmile in-office whitening ($600 at the time) and GoSmile Advanced Formula B-1 (several times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I quit smoking and bought these all the years of smoking gone looking like a professional job I do recommend getting teeth cleaned at dentist before so ur not whitening ur tarter !</li>
            <li>Then the next super, dooper strip is developed - more expense, less strips in the box; not much difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can irritate your gums and tongue a little, but it&#x27;s not terrible and not lasting.</li>
            <li>my teeth became overly sensitive.</li>
            <li>you have any sensitive spots on your teeth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say they work as well as having your teeth professionally whitened, but they do noticeably whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a real saving pack since the local prices would get me three packs from this offer.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth and don&#x27;t like pain, don&#x27;t get these.</li>
            <li>The result was a natural one, not chiclets.  </li>
            <li>Produce as expected , quick delivery, reasponably priced now the next step is to try the product and see from there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only done one set so far, but so far it&#x27;s gone well.  </li>
            <li>I resolved this by purchasing some clear numbing gel for my mouth and by the next morning I was back to normal again.</li>
            <li>Very little whitening occurred, I expected more from a Crest product.  </li>
            <li>I used the strips once daily for 4 days and the results were comparable to the BriteSmile laser whitening treatment -- probably 8-10 shades difference vs the 12 shades when I had the professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only noticed this from one sensitive spot on a lower tooth</li>
            <li>and they say it how they left their gums sensitive</li>
            <li>my teeth look even whiter now after the time i used apparently they get whiter as time passes</li>
            <li>I have only used them the one time because my teeth just got back to normal</li>
            <li>I have previously tried and reviewed the 2 hour system, which I think worked a little better.</li>
            <li>She had moderate success after her treatments (slightly whiter).</li>
            <li>However, I used both boxes (8 strips total) and I barely notice a difference in shade.</li>
            <li>tooth sensitivity was minimal and my teeth are very sensitive to other whitening strips, could beat the price on this particular kit.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice a real difference after using these strips - maybe a slight difference.</li>
            <li>also have a couple of very sensitive areas on a few of my teeth - which will scream if I don&#x27;t use sensitive toothpaste every once in a while -</li>

            <li> well THIS DONT at least well here on my first try</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Crest 3d white strips are not sensitive and stick to your teeth</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find a product that really does work and is not just false advertising!&lt;br /&gt;Refreshing !!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and was a little concerned that these strips would hurt.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth, and both gave me quite a bit of pain during the whitening process, and for about 3 days after, however, my teeth got a little whiter with the 2 hour...</li>
            <li> These whiten but not nearly as drastically as advertised.</li>
            <li> The pain was constant even when I was eating or drinking that only a pain reliver would slightly help.</li>
            <li> I only had a little discomfort with the tail end of the last strip.</li>
            <li> I did not start with horribly yellow teeth as I have used other crest whitestrip varieties.  </li>
            <li> I drink tea daily and and haven&#x27;t noticed any color setting in since the treatment a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth so sensitive for few days and unavailable to drink anything cold or too hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i seen other products review</li>
            <li> I on the other hand have the &amp;#34;no pain, no gain&amp;#34; attitude and just deal with it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The change isn&#x27;t as dramatic as you would get from a professional whitening</li>
            <li> I noticed a little difference after one use.</li>
            <li> Well, I suppose my teeth are a little whiter but</li>
            <li> you will start to feel some pain within a few hours of application.</li>
            <li> 1 hour strips work no better than the 30 min. strips, and I have used these for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
            <li> , they just did not have any gel on them, i ended up throwing half of them away, I will not purchase this type of whitening agent again!!</li>
            <li> Too bad you couldn&#x27;t spend $5 on a single treatment and call it a day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic change.  </li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing, half of the strips did not stick to my teeth</li>
            <li> the sensitivity to cold things went up about a thousand percent.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say if you already have cold sensitivity don&#x27;t use these.</li>
            <li> Very expensive</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The worst part of these strips is the junk seeps your throat for 1 hour instead of 1/2 hour.  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

            <li> Works great and have been using for years now.  This double pack is good value for money</li>
            <li> These whiten but not nearly as drastically as advertised. The box suggests using only twice a year. I&#x27;ve used them five times in six months and the results just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> 1 hour express is legit</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it really does work!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used crest whitestrips for years and I have always had white teeth.  However, I used both boxes (8 strips total) and I barely notice a difference in shade.</li>
            <li> I love Crest Whitestrips and 1 Hr Express strips.  I am so glad to find a product that really does work and is not just false advertising!&lt;br /&gt;Refreshing !!!</li>
            <li> Crest whitestrips are getting like AVON&#x27;s miracle results facial creams.  The current product is awesome, fantastic and gives brilliant results.  Then the next super, dooper strip is developed - more expense, less strips in the box; not much difference.  Look the same, feel the same, taste the same.  At Costco you get two great big boxes with a total of 16 strips in them when unpackaged are smaller than a 1/2 deck of cards.  This is marketing hype and we consumers are taking the bait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 hour strips work no better than the 30 min. strips, and I have used these for quite a while.  The box says &amp;#34;years of yellow disappear&amp;#34; - this just ain&#x27;t true.  Nothing works as good as using the cheaper strips every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of these strips is the junk seeps your throat for 1 hour instead of 1/2 hour.  You try not to swallow, but it is an automatic reflex.  That is my feedback on these strips.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and was a little concerned that these strips would hurt. I only had a little discomfort with the tail end of the last strip. My teeth are super white and are staying that way. Love this!</li>
            <li> I bought this pack since it was a deal and who would&#x27;nt want to whiten their teeth in 1 hour! I did not feel pain immediately while using the strips, but about 6 hours after using the product my teeth became overly sensitive. I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything. The pain was constant even when I was eating or drinking that only a pain reliver would slightly help. About 24 hours after use, the pain finally subsided. Did I see a difference and whiter teeth after all that agony? I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic change.  Used 3 whitestrips in a week and really didn&#x27;t notice a real brightness.  Going to try 3 more and that&#x27;s it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as going to a dentist and get a whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a big difference after 3 treatments. Stopped using them.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2-pack from another retailer, so that both my husband and I could use them for the price of one (good deal, btw!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used white strips and was apprehensive, since I&#x27;ve used both BriteSmile in-office whitening ($600 at the time) and GoSmile Advanced Formula B-1 (several times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am impressed! I used the strips once daily for 4 days and the results were comparable to the BriteSmile laser whitening treatment -- probably 8-10 shades difference vs the 12 shades when I had the professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Can do anytime -- esp since they recommend not brushing shortly before use&lt;br /&gt;Dramatic results for more than 1/10 the cost of professional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any sensitive spots on your teeth you will start to feel some pain within a few hours of application. I resolved this by purchasing some clear numbing gel for my mouth and by the next morning I was back to normal again. I only noticed this from one sensitive spot on a lower tooth but my uppers were totally fine.&lt;br /&gt;It can irritate your gums and tongue a little, but it&#x27;s not terrible and not lasting.</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not diamond white but there is significant difference after the first use. Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> These work great!! I can&#x27;t say they work as well as having your teeth professionally whitened, but they do noticeably whiten your teeth. I&#x27;m very happy with them and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> For the price this product really can&#x27;t be beat.  You&#x27;re getting two packs with four treatments each - that&#x27;s a total of 8 treatments.  I will stick these on during my commute if I know my drive will last more than an hour.  It&#x27;s pretty neat to see in my mirror the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; - all during a car ride.  The change isn&#x27;t as dramatic as you would get from a professional whitening but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a couple of very sensitive areas on a few of my teeth - which will scream if I don&#x27;t use sensitive toothpaste every once in a while - but these don&#x27;t bother my teeth at all.  I tend to use these on a more &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; basis.  I&#x27;ve used two in one  month and then I&#x27;ve gone almost a six months without using them at all.  Still no change in the sensitivity levels.</li>
            <li> Bought the 2-pack so that my daughter and I could both use it. She had moderate success after her treatments (slightly whiter). I had none at all. Our gums didn&#x27;t burn, and neither one of us had any tooth sensitivity after using, so I guess that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: instead of the whitestrips, try the 3D white toothpaste. I&#x27;ve had excellent results (significantly noticeable after only a week) with that - and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than the strips.</li>
            <li> the prodact works great, one stip enough to whittening my teeth, i got it very fast to israel, great value for 2 packages</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing, half of the strips did not stick to my teeth and yes I was putting the correct side on, they just did not have any gel on them, i ended up throwing half of them away, I will not purchase this type of whitening agent again!!</li>
            <li> Do you need to use super glue to get these things to stick to your teeth?  Never had one of these not to stick before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used crest white strips for years but this type is definitely my favorite. I noticed a difference with the first use. I would definitely recommend this product for at home whitening</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a real difference after using these strips - maybe a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims. Teeth are much whiter after 2 applications. Very expensive</li>
            <li> I found this product to be effective.  I used it one time for one hour and my teeth look whiter.  I did not start with horribly yellow teeth as I have used other crest whitestrip varieties.  This one however gave the best result in a minimum amount of time.</li>
            <li> Yeah, one time and I&#x27;m gleaming. My teeth were already white but these were the icing on the cake. This comes with 8 treatments too. I think it said something about four. I&#x27;ll be good for a year or two. I drink tea daily and and haven&#x27;t noticed any color setting in since the treatment a few weeks ago. Definitely a good value. Too bad you couldn&#x27;t spend $5 on a single treatment and call it a day.</li>
            <li> Excellent whitener. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the results.  Very little whitening occurred, I expected more from a Crest product.  I will try the second strip soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done one set so far, but so far it&#x27;s gone well.  I have had very little sensitivity, which is good since I have sensitive teeth and was expecting some pain or something.  Also, surprisingly, I saw a difference after just the one treatment.  I&#x27;ve never had anything else noticeably work so fast, and I&#x27;m pretty happy about that.  I just hope that they continue to whiten as well as the first time.</li>
            <li> Produce as expected , quick delivery, reasponably priced now the next step is to try the product and see from there</li>
            <li> works well, great price.</li>
            <li> ok just try it right know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS they work this was my first try and i can see the difference  like no BS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip dont use it for more then the 1 hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS i dont know if is because i used it more then an hour but i have this tingly sensation(like chewing a rubber  balloon sensation) on my teeth like i dosent hurt but its just tingly A LOT its like a freaking chain reaction hopefully tomorrow it will stop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i seen other products review and they say it how they left their gums sensitive well THIS DONT at least well here on my first try if i can update the review i will give more feed back\\ Update the tingling sensation stop the next day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPXDATE 5/15/14  my teeth look even whiter now after the time i used apparently they get whiter as time passes</li>
            <li> I quit smoking and bought these all the years of smoking gone looking like a professional job I do recommend getting teeth cleaned at dentist before so ur not whitening ur tarter ! Lol</li>
            <li> works as described, tooth sensitivity was minimal and my teeth are very sensitive to other whitening strips, could beat the price on this particular kit.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I received it on time and started using it right away. I only needed to use one set of treatment (one box/ 4 strips) and didn&#x27;t need to use the second one since I got the results I needed. As it was stated by the manufacturer, I did get some teeth sensitivity, but they would wear off after I finish the treatment and wash my mouth. This is a real saving pack since the local prices would get me three packs from this offer. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried and reviewed the 2 hour system, which I think worked a little better. I have extremely sensitive teeth, and both gave me quite a bit of pain during the whitening process, and for about 3 days after, however, my teeth got a little whiter with the 2 hour...I even left the 1 hour ones on for about an hour and 15 minutes but they still didn&#x27;t get quite as white. If you have sensitive teeth and don&#x27;t like pain, don&#x27;t get these. I on the other hand have the &amp;#34;no pain, no gain&amp;#34; attitude and just deal with it. This buy one get one free for $40 is a great deal though, can&#x27;t find a better price anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that this only works for yellow stained teeth. If you have a greyish hue to your teeth, these won&#x27;t work for you because it is ingrained in the teeth themselves. Yellowish and even brownish hues are more superficial surface stains and can be removed with a whitening system. I just think you can&#x27;t beat the price. If you are willing to spend the money, I would go with laser whitening. It gives the best results (super bright white teeth), in one treatment, and with less pain, but the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever seen it is $500 and as high as $1,000. Happy whitening everybody!</li>
            <li> I noticed a little difference after one use. They do make my teeth hurt a lot the net day but that part of the deal. Worth the price! Follow the direction and they work fine!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, brighter smile, excellent quality - not much tooth sensitivity.  Very glad I purchased this item! Be sure to use it in conjunction with crest 3D toothpaste/mouth wash!</li>
            <li> The strips whitened my teeth but it definitely didn&#x27;t stay. You would have to make this product a part of your monthly budget in order to get continuous results.</li>
            <li> I like to call myself a teeth whitener aficionado. I LOVED the 2 hour express whitestrips and was bummed to see them discontinued. I bought these and found that they have not changed the color of my teeth at all. If I hadn&#x27;t used most of them trying to whiten my teeth, I would have sent them back for my money back. Don&#x27;t buy. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Got both of these for the price thats lower than 1 at the store it was great loved it very</li>
            <li> Well, I suppose my teeth are a little whiter but the sensitivity to cold things went up about a thousand percent.  I have only used them the one time because my teeth just got back to normal so I&#x27;d say if you already have cold sensitivity don&#x27;t use these.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Leaves my teeth so sensitive for few days and unavailable to drink anything cold or too hot. I don&#x27;t recommed using this product at all!</li>
            <li> I have gotten a professional treatment before and this does just as good plus WAY cheaper! Especially with the convenience of just an hour and 4 treatments you&#x27;ll be pearly white!</li>
            <li> Great value compared to buying at your local store&lt;br /&gt;Crest 3d white strips are not sensitive and stick to your teeth well&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Great price for this product!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Lots of coffe means using these a lot. Teeth are somewhat sensitive so have to be careful too.</li>
            <li> Works!  I used strips a week apart to avoid tooth sensitivity.  The result was a natural one, not chiclets.  I do have naturally white teeth,&lt;br /&gt;but coffee, etc darkens them.</li>
            <li> they worked well…noticed a bit of a difference</li>
