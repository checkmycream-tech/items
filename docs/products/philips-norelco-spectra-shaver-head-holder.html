            <li>I was glad to see they had that this company had the part.  </li>
            <li>What more can be said about a spare part?</li>
            <li>Just make sure it matches to the number of your shaver.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;guts &amp;#34; of the old unit fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>If this razor was an animal, I would hug it, kiss it, and feed it healthy portions of filet mignon every day.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find that this item existed as a separate part.  </li>
            <li>just what I needed to get another 6 years out of my favorite shaver</li>
            <li>good as new!! :)</li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to get the replacement part, the original one broke while cleaning.</li>
            <li>It was promptly shipped, arrived in excellent shape, and worked as I expected.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly on my husbands razor and saved me alot of money in not having to buy a whole new razor...</li>
            <li>Fairly priced instead of having to buy a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Great product as a replacement for my current shaver head holder.</li>
            <li>This part fits the shaver perfectly and allowed us to use the shaver for another few years.</li>
            <li>This head holder was to replace my original Spectra head holder</li>
            <li>Matches original equipment and provides continued use of shaver.  </li>
            <li>Easy replacement, perfect fit, now in use almost 3 years, it may be time for another replacement as one of the 3 shaving hears are starting to become a bit loose.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com has my full support and recommendation.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the part fit just fine.</li>
            <li>But with this new head holder, it&#x27;s given my beloved razor new life for years and years and years to come!</li>
            <li>I ordered it and it quickly arrived.  </li>
            <li>This works fine, but you may also need a retaining bracket if you lose the whole assembly.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, accurate and well priced.</li>
            <li>only part that seems to wear out on my Norelco nice to find a source</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This new head carrier restored the shaver to original.</li>
            <li>When the original broke, I thought I would have to throw it away and buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The holder worked exactly as I had hoped.   </li>
            <li>The product was an exact replacement for the part I needed.</li>
            <li>Allowed me to put my favorite razor back into service.  </li>
            <li>and it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Was surprised it fit so well.</li>
            <li>I own a Philishave 8825 that is only three years old, but Philips has already discontinued the production of spare parts.</li>
            <li>With this part I was able to keep my old but reliable shaver in action.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars but it too 15 days to arrive which seems long in this era of two day delivery for most items.  </li>
            <li>It is built well, never fails, and cuts really close like it&#x27;s supposed to without leaving your face feeling like you scrubbed it with a brillo pad.</li>
            <li>The price is right and certainly far better than having to replace the entire shaver.</li>
            <li>It was very reasonably priced and arrived in a decent time period.  </li>
            <li>When I got back I bought this replacement and it works fine.</li>
            <li>The deliver time was reasonable taking into account that had to be delivered in Spain.</li>
            <li>As advertised, fast shipping</li>
            <li>It saved me from having to buy the whole head/blade assembly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller for listing this part and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>The Shaver Head Holder that I ordered as a replacement for my Razor was an exact 1:1 replacement part, making replacement of the old part a literal &#x27;snap&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Razor is like new again!</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend to others to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li>A lot cheaper than buying a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li>The head and the shaver a like new every time.</li>
            <li>Saved me the price of a new razor.  </li>
            <li>compared to the cost of a new one.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to other individuals needing this item since the seller was quick in delivery.</li>
            <li>My 8825XL has been going for nearly two decades.  </li>
            <li>Old part the cutters kept falling out during a shave.  </li>
            <li>This part is exactly like the original, and should last as long as the previous.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of investing in a 3 generations old shaver, but it turns out that the new Norelcos are not as good as, and more expensive than the old ones.</li>
            <li>If you order this, you should also order new heads as it makes sense to change both at the same time.</li>
            <li>It was a little high priced but in weighing the difference in price and having to decide on a new shaver I got this one.</li>
            <li>There are a few things in life that you can rely on and will never fail you, and this razor is one of them.</li>
            <li>I was surprised parts can still be found for the 8825, so here I am and will continue to purchase here to keep it going as long as possible.  </li>

            <li> This works fine, but you may also need a retaining bracket if you lose the whole assembly. The 8831 XL bracket for mine is not available anymore, so I wasted my money buying this.</li>

            <li> There was absolutely no issue with this item. I found the quality to be the same as buying in the store. The price was very reasonable. I would highly recomend to others to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> Ordered part at the begining of the week and within five days had the part at my house.  Delivery was fast and the part fit just fine. Will have my razor for another 3years or so.</li>
            <li> My daughter had broken my other head holder and I was hard pressed to find one anywhere.  I was glad to see they had that this company had the part.  I ordered it and it quickly arrived.  There is also a part that attaches to this piece that is not included, so don&#x27;t get rid of anything until you have received this or you may end up missing a part that you need.</li>
            <li> The Shaver Head Holder that I ordered as a replacement for my Razor was an exact 1:1 replacement part, making replacement of the old part a literal &#x27;snap&#x27;.  During the order process I received expert assistance from the Staff insuring that I ordered the correct part. I wish that all on-line stores operated like that. Amazon.com has my full support and recommendation. Thank you Gentlemen.</li>
            <li> It was the perfect fit for my razor and it works perfectly.  When the original broke, I thought I would have to throw it away and buy a new shaver.  This thing saved the day.</li>
            <li> What more can be said about a spare part? I own a Philishave 8825 that is only three years old, but Philips has already discontinued the production of spare parts. Shame on them and their unsustainability!</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement for my broken one.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, accurate and well priced. The packaging was efficient and suitable - overall very happy!</li>

            <li> It was great and worked well. Arlend Denzel</li>

            <li> It is all I spected, worked perfect on my philips and it arrived on time. I defenetely would buy another one next time i need it.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly, price great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  It was very reasonably priced and arrived in a decent time period.  The product was an exact replacement for the part I needed.</li>
            <li> Difficult for a piece of plastic to Not perform like it should.... It fit perfectly and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it after almost a year of use.</li>
            <li> It lives again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your required headline and summary length are ridiculous time wasted.  How long do I have to keep going.  Could you get rid of that?</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> My shaver fell to the floor and the shaver head holder broke. Fortunatly,I found this peace on Amazon, it fits perfect. Just make sure it matches to the number of your shaver.</li>
            <li> only part that seems to wear out on my Norelco nice to find a source</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get. The &amp;#34;guts &amp;#34; of the old unit fit perfectly. I did also buy the blades however. I have used Norelco shaver for years and will buy nothing else. I could not find replacement &amp;#34;guts&amp;#34; else i would have also bought those.</li>
            <li> My 8825XL has been going for nearly two decades.  I have tried the newer Norelco triple-headers, but always go back to my trusted confidant.  I was surprised parts can still be found for the 8825, so here I am and will continue to purchase here to keep it going as long as possible.  This part is exactly like the original, and should last as long as the previous.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor maybe about 10 years ago. There are a few things in life that you can rely on and will never fail you, and this razor is one of them. If this razor was an animal, I would hug it, kiss it, and feed it healthy portions of filet mignon every day. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this razor. It is built well, never fails, and cuts really close like it&#x27;s supposed to without leaving your face feeling like you scrubbed it with a brillo pad. Just change the replacement heads maybe once a year and you&#x27;re good to go! I changed the head holder because it was wearing out a bit. But with this new head holder, it&#x27;s given my beloved razor new life for years and years and years to come!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Allowed me to put my favorite razor back into service.  Old part the cutters kept falling out during a shave.  Now no mishaps since installation.  (keeping fingers crossed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edh</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly on my husbands razor and saved me alot of money in not having to buy a whole new razor...good as new!! :)</li>
            <li> It works just as it should.</li>
            <li> ihave to send back because it doen&#x27;t my razor</li>
            <li> This head holder was to replace my original Spectra head holder and it was exactly as described.  I think it is great since the razor was in still good condition and works very well.  Thanks to the seller for listing this part and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> With this part I was able to keep my old but reliable shaver in action.  If I had to bring the shaver n for repairs, it wouldn&#x27;t have made sense.  Easy replacement, perfect fit, now in use almost 3 years, it may be time for another replacement as one of the 3 shaving hears are starting to become a bit loose.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find that this item existed as a separate part.  It saved me from having to buy the whole head/blade assembly.  It was promptly shipped, arrived in excellent shape, and worked as I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product as a replacement for my current shaver head holder. It was a little high priced but in weighing the difference in price and having to decide on a new shaver I got this one. It works great</li>
            <li> My Norelco shaver head holder broke just in time for my vacation. When I got back I bought this replacement and it works fine. A lot cheaper than buying a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> Does the job every time.  This is the third shaver head over seven years.  The head and the shaver a like new every time.</li>
            <li> Hard to find but they had it.  The weakest part of an otherwise terrific electric razor.</li>
            <li> Saved me the price of a new razor.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This part fits the shaver perfectly and allowed us to use the shaver for another few years. The price is right and certainly far better than having to replace the entire shaver.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect. One head kept popping out of the old one, no more problems now.  Was surprised it fit so well.</li>
            <li> Matches original equipment and provides continued use of shaver.  Well worth it compared to the cost of a new one.</li>
            <li> just what I needed to get another 6 years out of my favorite shaver</li>
