    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>One of the best floride fee toothpaste&#x27;s I have used.</li>
            <li>My husband and I were looking for a fluoride-free toothpaste that didn&#x27;t taste like or have the consistency of baking soda, and this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>This tooth paste works very good.</li>
            <li>Absolutely GREAT product, order time was excellent</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate makes great products, and this tooth gel is no exception.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste without the flouride!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flavor is not all that great either.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great and will def.</li>
            <li>Anyone paying good attention to news has to notice that no one is advertising about how good fluoride is for your teeth anymore!</li>
            <li>Best of all it&#x27;s Fluoride free</li>
            <li>My advice though...definitely stay away from the cool mint!!!</li>
            <li>That would be the ideal one, but Nature&#x27;s Gate cool mint toothpaste is a good one.</li>
            <li>LOVE this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>anything better than this product!</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>The load of cool mint feels wonderful that I find myself brushing my teeth more often.</li>
            <li>The price is fairly good considering I have been paying to purchase fluoride poison for most of my life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In comparison, the Honest Company Mint Toothpaste is also rated a 3 (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/624355/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Toothpaste%2C_Fresh_Mint/)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Listed on MSDS as hazardous.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste for many years</li>
            <li>I ordered the 6 pack, so we&#x27;re now stuck with 5 more tubes of this.</li>
            <li>I am just glad that there is a company who makes toothpaste without fluoride.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m liking it even better than Amway&#x27;s Glister toothpaste!&lt;br</li>
            <li>GLYCERIN (synthetic)(MSDS) draws moisture from inside the skin, and holds it on the surface for a better \\&quot;feel\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>but it still was ok in taste.</li>
            <li>I use gel toothpaste but am trying to go more natural/organic</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>toothpaste is ok</li>
            <li>Love the taste, nice clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a great flavor, keeps breath fresh, and is a great price -- lower than buying them individually at the store (if you can even find it there).</li>
            <li>anyway, I decided to purchase this toothpaste and give it a try, as the ingredients are pretty good, and the price is also affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff for cleaning teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yummy toothpaste, not sickening.</li>
            <li>Sweet deal!</li>
            <li>love this toothpaste with no bad chemicals</li>
            <li>My family really likes the Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste as the taste is much better than most all natural toothpastes and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a good flavor and much better ingredients than conventional toothpaste (I don&#x27;t want my children using anything with a poison control warning on it, that&#x27;s for sure).  </li>
            <li>Makes my mouth taste clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>With the gel my teeth feel clean all day.</li>
            <li>&quot; Cool Mint Gel from Nature&#x27;s Gate.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who is used to regular toothpaste/gel (Colgate, Crest, etc.), and is looking to transition to a product that is healthier for the body and the environment, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this toothpaste but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I used to get this cool mint gel all the time.</li>
            <li>This product works well - it leaves my teeth feeling clean and my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and fresh after use.</li>
            <li>The old formula had goldenseal in it and it &amp;#34;foamed up&amp;#34; better leaving you a clean fresh feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>Get your pearly whites shiny and fresh without the use of a known neurotoxin.</li>
            <li>I actually like my toothpaste to have a greater &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; in the flavor, but this does leave your mouth feeling clean and</li>
            <li>Still looking for the right one.</li>
            <li>Got my shipment right away.</li>
            <li>Good Quality, leaves the mouth fresh, nice flavor, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>With this product is the opposite, it tastes great and ur breath is fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>which is why I got it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my family enjoys using and what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>Oh well next time will make sure I order my preference</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really look forward to brushing my teeth with it,</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for flouride free toothpaste look no further!</li>
            <li>It does not foam that much.</li>
            <li>Kind of a thick (reminds me of a medicine gel cream), hardish gel.  </li>
            <li>I just received a case of six tubes of the \\&quot;New and Improved\\</li>
            <li>Do not order this \\&quot;New and Improved\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li>It should say \\&quot;New and Disgusting\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like the new one...</li>
            <li>First they took out the blue color</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste without all the artificial ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use teeth sensitive toothpaste now either.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of using all natural products</li>
            <li>but wow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be my imagination, but I think my teeth are whiter just after brushing the Nature&#x27;s Gate Natural Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, all of Nature&#x27;s Gates natural toothpastes contain glycerin.  </li>
            <li>Trying to find a natural toothpaste that my son and I like.</li>
            <li>Sooo not anything like the gel toothpastes you buy in the non natural versions.  </li>
            <li>We have been using this toothpaste for several years and really like it.</li>
            <li>We are all about using natural products.</li>
            <li>After centuries of lies about how good  fluoride is  for us, I now have read volumes of information on how dangerous fluoride really is.</li>
            <li>I switched back to Tom&#x27;s of Main fluoride-free.</li>
            <li>Well, the 2 year old and four year old stick with the Tom&#x27;s children&#x27;s toothpaste because this Nature&#x27;s Gate is a little too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for them.</li>

            <li> only complaint is that I don&#x27;t really like the gel formulation.</li>
            <li> Have tried a few that were ok but not great...or ended up having some unhealthy ingredient in them.</li>
            <li> Other toothpastse don&#x27;t have this problem as such.</li>
            <li> Hoping to find a powerful green toothpaste - but unfortunately, this did not do the trick and left me feeling like I brushed with water.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it&#x27;s hard to get out of the flip-top, I just remove the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I also purchased some of their other flavors that we have not tried yet.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought 6 packs of the new formula and now I don&#x27;t know what to do with them.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Wintergreen-flavored gel over this one - it seems a little smoother and mintier.</li>
            <li> And not cheap either.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is a little bit difficult to squeeze out of the tube sometimes but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Does the job without all the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried natural toothpastes before and hated it them, not only the taste</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of the tube, you almost need a pair of pliers to squeeze this stuff out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Hard to squeeze from tube</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite put my finger to it, but it seems almost too thick and somewhat sticky.</li>
            <li> I purposefully choose oral care products that do not contain fluoride and other questionable ingredients.</li>
            <li> but you would get bad breath shortly after.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely horrible, after brushing, there is no fresh minty feeling, I feel like I haven&#x27;t even brushed.  </li>
            <li> Weird feel.  </li>
            <li> Hope they aren&#x27;t bad as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand who makes these stupid decisions.  </li>
            <li> I will never order this horrible product again...</li>
            <li> I always wondered what its like to wash my mouth out with soap and now I know, truly disgusting</li>
            <li> However, this flavor of Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste is the worst tasting toothpaste my son and I have ever had!</li>
            <li> It is truly nasty with a terrible aftertaste.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I just received a case of six tubes of the \\&quot;New and Improved\\&quot; Cool Mint Gel from Nature&#x27;s Gate.  I have been using this toothpaste for many years and I have to say I saw no reason to change the formula.  It is absolutely horrible, after brushing, there is no fresh minty feeling, I feel like I haven&#x27;t even brushed.  I will never order this horrible product again...why screw with the formula Nature&#x27;s Gate??  I don&#x27;t understand who makes these stupid decisions.  Do not order this \\&quot;New and Improved\\&quot; product.  It should say \\&quot;New and Disgusting\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love the taste, nice clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste without all the artificial ingredients.  My family really likes the Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste as the taste is much better than most all natural toothpastes and it works great.  My teeth and mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate makes great products, and this tooth gel is no exception. This product works well - it leaves my teeth feeling clean and my mouth feeling fresh. I prefer the Wintergreen-flavored gel over this one - it seems a little smoother and mintier. For anyone who is used to regular toothpaste/gel (Colgate, Crest, etc.), and is looking to transition to a product that is healthier for the body and the environment, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this toothpaste but didn&#x27;t. It has a funky flavor and an even funkier texture. I ordered the 6 pack, so we&#x27;re now stuck with 5 more tubes of this. I do like the Nature&#x27;s Gate mint tooth PASTE that we purchased from here on Amazon though. I thought that that&#x27;s what I was ordering again when I ordered this, but missed the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; part. So my mistake. Overall it&#x27;s not hideous, but it&#x27;s none of our favorites either.</li>
            <li> LOVE this toothpaste!  No fluoride.</li>
            <li> I am just glad that there is a company who makes toothpaste without fluoride. After centuries of lies about how good  fluoride is  for us, I now have read volumes of information on how dangerous fluoride really is. Anyone paying good attention to news has to notice that no one is advertising about how good fluoride is for your teeth anymore! The load of cool mint feels wonderful that I find myself brushing my teeth more often. I wish someone would make a toothpaste without sodium bicarb, but with lots of mint. That would be the ideal one, but Nature&#x27;s Gate cool mint toothpaste is a good one. The price is fairly good considering I have been paying to purchase fluoride poison for most of my life.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste works very good. My mouth feels clean and fresh after use. One of the best floride fee toothpaste&#x27;s I have used.</li>
            <li> I have never ordered Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste before and was suprised when I realized that it didnt contain Fluoride...but I am taking this back to my grocer in the hopes that they will give me a tube of something- anything better than this product! I always wondered what its like to wash my mouth out with soap and now I know, truly disgusting</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste without the flouride!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and way cheaper than the co-op</li>
            <li> I purposefully choose oral care products that do not contain fluoride and other questionable ingredients. Based on the 2009 formulation - which may have been updated - the Skin Deep Cosmetic database rated this toothpaste as a 3 (see here: http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/295444/Nature%27s_Gate_Cool_Mint_Gel_Toothpaste_%282009_formulation%29/).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison, the Honest Company Mint Toothpaste is also rated a 3 (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/624355/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Toothpaste%2C_Fresh_Mint/)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I decided to purchase this toothpaste and give it a try, as the ingredients are pretty good, and the price is also affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do we like it? Well, the 2 year old and four year old stick with the Tom&#x27;s children&#x27;s toothpaste because this Nature&#x27;s Gate is a little too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for them. I actually like my toothpaste to have a greater &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; in the flavor, but this does leave your mouth feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t really like the gel formulation. I can&#x27;t quite put my finger to it, but it seems almost too thick and somewhat sticky. I don&#x27;t really look forward to brushing my teeth with it, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my personal preference. In all, I don&#x27;t mind using it because of the cleaner ingredients. When we run out, however, I think I&#x27;ll keep looking for a different brand.</li>
            <li> Hoping to find a powerful green toothpaste - but unfortunately, this did not do the trick and left me feeling like I brushed with water.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste.  I ordered it because I was looking for a gel.  However, I don&#x27;t like the plastic tube itself.  I prefer a tube that will roll up as the contents are used.</li>
            <li> love this toothpaste with no bad chemicals and I don&#x27;t have to use teeth sensitive toothpaste now either. thank you</li>
            <li> Has a different consistency than regular toothpaste. Hard to get out of the tube, you almost need a pair of pliers to squeeze this stuff out of the tube. I like the idea of using all natural products but wow. The flavor is not all that great either. Would use in a last resort only. Still have five tubes left. Any body want one ? hahahahahahahhaha  lol</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff for cleaning teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m liking it even better than Amway&#x27;s Glister toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be my imagination, but I think my teeth are whiter just after brushing the Nature&#x27;s Gate Natural Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Good Quality, leaves the mouth fresh, nice flavor, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula and I don&#x27;t like the new one...The old formula had goldenseal in it and it &amp;#34;foamed up&amp;#34; better leaving you a clean fresh feel after brushing. Unfortunately, I bought 6 packs of the new formula and now I don&#x27;t know what to do with them. Maybe I&#x27;ll donate them?</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, all of Nature&#x27;s Gates natural toothpastes contain glycerin.  GLYCERIN (synthetic)(MSDS) draws moisture from inside the skin, and holds it on the surface for a better \\&quot;feel\\&quot;.  Listed on MSDS as hazardous.</li>
            <li> Trying to find a natural toothpaste that my son and I like. Have tried a few that were ok but not great...or ended up having some unhealthy ingredient in them. Still looking for the right one. However, this flavor of Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste is the worst tasting toothpaste my son and I have ever had! We both used it once and never again. It is truly nasty with a terrible aftertaste. We had to rinse our mouths with mouthwash because it was so unbearable. What a waste of money! And not cheap either. I also purchased some of their other flavors that we have not tried yet. Hope they aren&#x27;t bad as well. Will definitely report on them when we try them. My advice though...definitely stay away from the cool mint!!! Yuck!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for flouride free toothpaste look no further! Get your pearly whites shiny and fresh without the use of a known neurotoxin. This toothpaste has a great flavor, keeps breath fresh, and is a great price -- lower than buying them individually at the store (if you can even find it there).</li>
            <li> I used to get this cool mint gel all the time. First they took out the blue color but it still was ok in taste. Now, whatever it is it leaves a numbing to sides of mouth and tongue for hours that just won&#x27;t go away. Can&#x27;t taste anything after using it. Other toothpastse don&#x27;t have this problem as such. Look at your ingredients - they&#x27;ve changed. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find in local store.  I use gel toothpaste but am trying to go more natural/organic so I ordered this to try.  Sooo not anything like the gel toothpastes you buy in the non natural versions.  Kind of a thick (reminds me of a medicine gel cream), hardish gel.  Weird feel.  Hard to squeeze from tube, a child would probably need help using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great and will def. use it up but I think I will go back to the paste version of this brand and just have to use mouth wash for the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling to last.  When I use the paste, after about 3 hours I start getting that &amp;#34;not brushed&amp;#34; feeling unless I use mouthwash after I brush.  With the gel my teeth feel clean all day.</li>
            <li> It does not foam that much. I guess it is expected out of a natural toothpaste without SLS. I switched back to Tom&#x27;s of Main fluoride-free.</li>
            <li> Love this. Not too spicey</li>
            <li> We have been using this toothpaste for several years and really like it. We are all about using natural products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried natural toothpastes before and hated it them, not only the taste but you would get bad breath shortly after. With this product is the opposite, it tastes great and ur breath is fresh for a long time. Best of all it&#x27;s Fluoride free which is why I got it in the first place. Got my shipment right away.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste! Does the job without all the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> Absolutely GREAT product, order time was excellent and so was the price. Sweet deal! Keep it up.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth taste clean and fresh! My husband and I were looking for a fluoride-free toothpaste that didn&#x27;t taste like or have the consistency of baking soda, and this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it&#x27;s hard to get out of the flip-top, I just remove the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Yummy toothpaste, not sickening.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a good flavor and much better ingredients than conventional toothpaste (I don&#x27;t want my children using anything with a poison control warning on it, that&#x27;s for sure).  The toothpaste is a little bit difficult to squeeze out of the tube sometimes but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my family enjoys using and what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> toothpaste is ok but I ordered the jell and would rather have the paste.  Oh well next time will make sure I order my preference</li>
