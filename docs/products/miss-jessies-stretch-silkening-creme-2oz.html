            <li>This product will stretch my curls and hold continuous moisture in my hair for 5-7 days, and this is great!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the best results using Miss Jessie&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Formula Intensive Spot Serum Hair and Scalp Treatment 4oz]]work excellent on my hair!!  </li>
            <li>Turns out of all the Miss Jessie&#x27;s products the Buttercreme works best on my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it !!!</li>
            <li>But once I started to moisturize my hair from root to tip with the Dr. Miracle&#x27;s Serum, and then applying this product, it was a much better result!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this product however; I followed the directions and it perform wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Delivery was good for this product</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be &#x27;the product&#x27;, but it&#x27;s a good substitute.</li>
            <li>[ASIN:0517881519 Good Hair: For Colored Girls Who&#x27;ve Considered Weaves When the Chemicals Became Too Ruff]].</li>
            <li>works so good on hair.</li>
            <li>me clarify, the scent smells very good, it is just too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing .</li>
            <li>The product was sent super fast and i am a very happy customer.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE the product.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so if Miss Jessie could reduce the strength of the scent of this product, i will definately use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>I wish it had a bit more shine.    </li>
            <li>I found that I like Miss Jessie Curly Pudding better for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I love Miss Jessie products.</li>
            <li>And I love the smell .</li>
            <li>I love this line.</li>
            <li>I used it for a two-strand twists and it came out ok.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer could do a better job of describing the hair types suited for this product.  </li>
            <li>Hair looking better</li>
            <li>I do wish it could stretch more than it does.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>However the scent of the product does smell great, and  is very loud and strong to the point where the scent  triggers my allergies</li>
            <li>Most importantly it moisturizes the curl.</li>
            <li>worked good too much money for the amount.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for a different kind of hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well to create defined, non-sticky curls, but even with chin-length, very fine hair, I have to use a ton of it.</li>
            <li>the reviews had me sooo excited about using the product, couldnt wait to get product.  </li>
            <li>And my buns look so slick and perfect when I use this product .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Curly Pudding about 5 times and while I get good curl definition, the second day results are nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>However, it is good for occasional use.</li>
            <li>This particular product works better</li>
            <li>Also I learned a great deal about black hair care and styling from reading  [</li>
            <li>I mix this in with a few drops of argan oil to give my curls a great curl.</li>
            <li>It keeps the length, removes most frizz and adds soft definition.</li>
            <li>I use most of Ms Jessie&#x27;s products on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought the smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li>It was a great read and my hair, which never grew as a child, is past my collar bone and all natural!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want my hair straight</li>
            <li>As much as anything on the market.</li>
            <li>I need about 1/8 of the pot to go over my whole head, and I really don&#x27;t want to spend $9.40 on hair products every 8 days.</li>
            <li>Have other products from Miss Jessies that I love.</li>
            <li>I actually really liked this because after a few minutes of applying it, I had curl definition that I usually never have.</li>
            <li>I have super coarse natural 3c/4a hair that is prone to dryness and frizz.</li>
            <li>Small sample, works OK.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft and defined</li>
            <li>, it does not shine my hair, and I didnt feel it softly</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing it claims; my curls still has shrinkage and it left flakes all in my hair.</li>
            <li>but I wanted the curls loosened by preventing my hair from curling up when it dries naturally.</li>
            <li>Glad that I only ordered the small jar.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried tons, upon tons of different products and find that non ever give me the complete look that I want, so</li>
            <li>I have natural fine/thick African American kinky curls</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot to begin with, about a thin layer of the serum and just enough of the creme to dampen my hair, but because I use the two products, they seem to work better and longer together than they do apart.   </li>
            <li>At first I tried using this product alone from root to tip for that kinky/curl look to blend with my Indian weave and just using this product dried my hair out.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much a guessing game</li>
            <li>But for those ladies who are coming out of a perm with a few inches of new growth, this is definitely a method to try with these products before you revert back to old habits!   </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good product for a different kind of hair.  It did not work well with my hair.  So glad I bought the smaller bottle.  Delivery was good for this product but I do think that Ms. Jessie&#x27;s products are a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I posted 4 stars for this product and i will explain.  I LOVE, LOVE the product.  This product will stretch my curls and hold continuous moisture in my hair for 5-7 days, and this is great!  However the scent of the product does smell great, and  is very loud and strong to the point where the scent  triggers my allergies and  i am continuously sneezing, as well as my eyes would tear during the day at work.  Ok, so if Miss Jessie could reduce the strength of the scent of this product, i will definately use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me clarify, the scent smells very good, it is just too strong for me.  I actually would prefer Miss Jessies&#x27;s stretch silkening creme over the baby buttercreme if the scent was lighter.</li>
            <li> I have super coarse natural 3c/4a hair that is prone to dryness and frizz. I actually really liked this because after a few minutes of applying it, I had curl definition that I usually never have. Application has slip too. Makes my hair really soft and defined</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent (it&#x27;s very plain), this product works well for 3B curls. It keeps the length, removes most frizz and adds soft definition. I wish it had a bit more shine.    It won&#x27;t be &#x27;the product&#x27;, but it&#x27;s a good substitute.</li>
            <li> the reviews had me sooo excited about using the product, couldnt wait to get product.  Not impressed! Glad that I only ordered the small jar. Separated curls but did not \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; them out like product claims to do.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this product however; I followed the directions and it perform wonderfully. I found that I like Miss Jessie Curly Pudding better for my hair type. I love Miss Jessie products.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing . And I love the smell . It stretches my type 4a with no heat . And my buns look so slick and perfect when I use this product . Love it !!!</li>
            <li> This product definitely does what it claims it would. Does make my hair stiff or crunchy. Most importantly it moisturizes the curl.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the creme but it doesnt do what it said it does, it does not shine my hair, and I didnt feel it softly</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the best results using Miss Jessie&#x27;s products. I&#x27;ve tried the Curly Pudding about 5 times and while I get good curl definition, the second day results are nothing to write home about. So when I saw the Stretch Silkening Creme on clearance I decided to try it. I used it for a two-strand twists and it came out ok. Next time I&#x27;ll follow the instructions on the jar.</li>
            <li> I have natural fine/thick African American kinky curls and I&#x27;ve tried tons, upon tons of different products and find that non ever give me the complete look that I want, so I tend to  use at least two products when styling my hair.
