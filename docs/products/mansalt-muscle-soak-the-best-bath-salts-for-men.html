            <li>Still great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>The salts are as advertised, feel great, and don&#x27;t seem to be drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>The plus side is the nice scent!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, non-pefume-scent.  </li>
            <li>Good item</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my fiance who enjoys soaks in the tub after a good work out.</li>
            <li>he loved it.</li>
            <li>We just loved it.</li>
            <li>And his wife loved the smell too.  </li>
            <li>It is a very great product, nice smell without being too strong.</li>
            <li>The best part about this product, in addition to the wonderful scent, is that it actually works.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the ManSalt Muscle Soak I received from you.  </li>
            <li>Very glad I ordered.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, not girly at all!</li>
            <li>It smells so amazing..</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, and does what it says.</li>
            <li>But it works nice, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to bathe in smells like rose and lavender</li>
            <li>The salts smelled really good and my boyfriend enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good concept and maybe the company will continue to develop this product but you can do a lot better for the price.</li>
            <li>This is nice and relaxing but does not have the bubbles or provide the massage effect.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried a bath salt from the store on a whim and kinda liked the way it made the water softer but was not so keen on the floral scent, so I decided to look for a bath salt for men.  </li>
            <li>I did feel like it helped in recovering faster, and the nice smell and the cleansing feeling it has on your skin was a bonus.  </li>
            <li>The stuff really does smell awesome, my fiancee likes it maybe more than I do.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice the &amp;#34;mudflap girl&amp;#34; on the front of the package, but it was a funny surprise that we laughed at!</li>
            <li>This product works fine and smells really good.</li>
            <li>The salt smells great, and you get a fair amount; but it&#x27;s still priced a tad high for soaking salt.</li>
            <li>That kind of versatility puts ManSalt over the top.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, works as advertised and pretty spiffy graphics for the labelling.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, fresh and clean, with a more &#x27;manly&#x27; scent (though I would use it too!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too overwhelming either.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to buying another one for him :)</li>
            <li>really enjoyed receiving the muscle soak</li>
            <li>AND, Mansalt is much more affordable than the Aramis product I used.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to using more of their products.</li>
            <li>coming out of the tub with mansalt&#x27;s nice fragrance would be a huge plus.</li>
            <li>It smells ok</li>
            <li>I ordered ManSalt with this in mind, not that in love with the more &#x27;aromatherapy&#x27; versions my wife</li>
            <li>these 3 workouts leave me the most sore.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t exactly place the exact scent, I have to say it&#x27;s excellent.  </li>
            <li>though that it could have more of an aroma but besides that it worked as stated.</li>
            <li>Is this safe to use.</li>
            <li>Will give it another shot for sure.</li>
            <li>It is a good thing that I stumbled upon Mansalt and ordered right away.</li>
            <li>the mansalt and the whole house smelled very nice when used in the tub.</li>
            <li>Good smell, large bag!</li>
            <li>A good hot soak can work wonders on a sore body.  </li>
            <li>I would describe it as pleasantly neutral and can imagine that it would appeal to women just as much as men, despite the branding.</li>
            <li>More like a very light, fresh cologne.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit strong, but got used to it.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product, the scent is very pleasant and it remedies soreness better than some other bath salts out there.</li>
            <li>Wish the packaging was better as it&#x27;s hard to close the bag, but besides that great product!</li>
            <li>Smells great and definitely helps with muscle soreness.</li>
            <li>I really like the product and it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Yes it costs more than a bag of Epsom salts, but it is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it did really seem to help recovery after long bike rides.</li>
            <li>This product works great to help reduce inflammation after those long runs.</li>
            <li>I feel better after soaking in hot water with the salts dissolved in it.  </li>
            <li>:)  Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the first time using this type of product and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Enter Mansalt, the more manly way to take a hot relaxing bath.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing after a hard work out great Bath Salt also smells good  </li>
            <li>I initially purchased these salts as a gift for my dad and he loved them.  </li>
            <li>I had loved the aramis bath salts and was looking for something that created a similar bubble and massage factor.  </li>
            <li>He wants me to get him more.  </li>
            <li>I just wish the instructions gave more specifics about how much to use instead of just &amp;#34;a handful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Works well, smells good, I use w/ regular epsom salt as well and feel great afterwords usually helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li>I really like this product mostly for the scent and the value.</li>
            <li>He loved it and the entire bag was used up in a week.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for bath salts that contained dead sea salt and smelled good, and this product did the trick!</li>
            <li>You have to use a lot of it, other than that, the scent is great.  </li>
            <li>The older I get the more</li>
            <li>Product was as described, arrived quickly, and there were no issues.</li>
            <li>My partner and I both enjoyed it so much that 2 weeks later we&#x27;ve already ordered more!</li>
            <li>favorite - highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this gave a great alternative, while also really helping relieve muscle soreness and minimal pain (though unsure if that was more the salt or just soaking in hot water, since he refused to take a bath since it was &amp;#34;manly&#x27;)</li>
            <li>I feel great non the less.</li>
            <li>So, get your message straight, and make your marketing message more consistent, congruent.</li>
            <li>Used it in a bath for two people and didn&#x27;t have to add more (usually with Epsom, you have to dump in a good pound for a soak).</li>
            <li>but it left your body with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>He has tried various other salts and products but he says that ManSalt has worked best out of everything he has tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I am very pleased with Mansalt which is a mixture of Epson Salt with several other components that provides a nice smell along with a relaxing and soothing soak.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a cure-all, but it&#x27;s a nice relief after a long day.</li>
            <li>For example, I used muscle soak &amp;#34;Escape for Men&amp;#34; made by Calvin Klein for years (actually still have some left) and that smell was great as well</li>
            <li>Thanks for putting something out there for the spoiled man!</li>
            <li>First, I don&#x27;t take baths.  </li>
            <li>This really helped eased my husbands sore muscles!  </li>
            <li>I use this in a whirlpool tub on days I don&#x27;t workout, so between the hot whirlpool and the mansalt</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering some more for him.</li>
            <li>Mansalt does exactly what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that the salts are gentle enough to use as a face and body scrub.  </li>
            <li>I have found that there is nothing better than coming home and taking a long bath with Mansalt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally hesitant with personal care products directed at men because the scents are way too over the top (think Axe), but that is not the case at all with ManSalt.  </li>
            <li>but the scent is strong, as in it took over my entire bathroom.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to buy a product first time via web without prior knowledge - this chance worked out great.</li>
            <li>My bathtub is huge, so I use around 4 cups of regular cheapo epsom salt from the supermarket (it&#x27;s something like $2 for a 2 pound bag)</li>
            <li>My boyfriend got this as a christmas gift, and really enjoys the aroma, and the softness to his skin.</li>
            <li>I had strained my muscles too much during a workout.</li>
            <li>I have very sore core muscles and this really helps me after a workout.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>will tell friends and family thanks agian</li>
            <li>He really enjoys Man Salt since it does the job</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and soothing after a herd workout.</li>
            <li>From all reports, he has found it to be very relaxing.</li>
            <li>but it was much stronger then</li>
            <li>My husband really likes the product though.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>, so I guess the smell really does get the ladies going.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>in a few days they did fallow up to see how I liked it tho</li>
            <li>Good luck to the new small company making this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the Original</li>
            <li>After a hard workout, or even just a long day... or hell, pretty much anytime I get a chance... I enjoy a nice soak in the tub.</li>
            <li>It hard to describe what Mansalt smells like other than saying it is natural and perfect for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to feel like he is bathing in aromatherapy oils and smell like a flower garden afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent price and helps sooth my aches.</li>
            <li>Man Salt smells graeat and VERY masculine (from a woman&#x27;s point of view), and both boys gave Man Salt high praises!</li>
            <li>I ordered the 2lb bag to sample, but will be ordering a much larger quantity very soon (that said, the small bag has lasted surprisingly long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>However, I think the price is a bit high for what it is.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how large the bag of ManSalt Soak was and it has lasted quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>With Fathers Day approaching, I know exactly what I am ordering him!</li>
            <li>It works well on sore muscles, and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>OK, long story short, I got into a little \\&quot;accident\\&quot; while trying to clean up the garage.</li>
            <li>Other than the sad packaging look, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>Package came with the product wet and full of liquid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 27 yea old professional student and my main hobby is bodybuilding.</li>
            <li>Certain fragrances can cause headaches for me and it would be a shame to order a bag of ManSalt only to find out that I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li>only recommendation I would have for them to improve is to have option for Gentleman Packaging (little more reserved to make this easier to send to my dad who enjoys jacuzzi baths without having to explain the packaging to mom).</li>
            <li>and a huge waste of time, not to mention water.  </li>
            <li>Although buying regular old epson salt from the supermarket is much cheaper, I do like the manly smell of this product</li>
            <li>My husband is an avid long distance runner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so was surprised to see the name ManSalt Muscle Soak on my order.  </li>
            <li>He works in construction, so he frequently mentions that he gets muscle aches and pains.  </li>
            <li>I would get frequent soreness from doing Insanity Workout, Les Mills Pump and Combat but ManSalt</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t last because I use it so much when I&#x27;m sore from playing hockey..</li>
            <li>I also have to mention if you have sensitive skin, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>find that my nightly baths with Mansalt really help reduce the soreness in my muscles and prepare me for the workout the next day.</li>
            <li>and it made me very relaxed so this stuff will be used regularly in our house!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different additives to my ritual and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order a bag again as soon as mine runs out (which will probably take a few more weeks).</li>
            <li>bought this product a few times and plan to buy it several more</li>
            <li>With a little soap in the tub the mansalt scent becomes less effective.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product, it just seemed a little small for the price.</li>
            <li>I try to minimize my use of advil since apparently it can inhibit your gains, so</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t consider myself a &amp;#34;metro&amp;#34; guy and my grooming routine is pretty minimal.</li>
            <li>I have tried other bath salts but have not enjoyed the frilly garden/spice fragrance that most have.</li>
            <li>I do a decent amount of strenuous work, and actually enjoy dragging in sore and tired enough for a soak.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time walking for a couple of days and spent most of my time online.</li>
            <li>I expected a dry salt like consistently like Epsom salts.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the only reason I take a bath after a hard day, because it smells fantastic, and it actually does help you relax.  </li>
            <li>In addition to soothing your tired muscles after working in the yard or on a long bike run, we love the smell of the salts...</li>
            <li>The other night he used his new salt</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Then I tried a bath salt from the store on a whim and kinda liked the way it made the water softer but was not so keen on the floral scent, so I decided to look for a bath salt for men.  </li>
            <li> I did feel like it helped in recovering faster, and the nice smell and the cleansing feeling it has on your skin was a bonus.  </li>
            <li> The stuff really does smell awesome, my fiancee likes it maybe more than I do.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice the &amp;#34;mudflap girl&amp;#34; on the front of the package, but it was a funny surprise that we laughed at!</li>
            <li> This product works fine and smells really good.</li>
            <li> The salt smells great, and you get a fair amount; but it&#x27;s still priced a tad high for soaking salt.</li>
            <li> That kind of versatility puts ManSalt over the top.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, works as advertised and pretty spiffy graphics for the labelling.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, fresh and clean, with a more &#x27;manly&#x27; scent (though I would use it too!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too overwhelming either.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to buying another one for him :)</li>
            <li> really enjoyed receiving the muscle soak</li>
            <li> AND, Mansalt is much more affordable than the Aramis product I used.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to using more of their products.</li>
            <li> coming out of the tub with mansalt&#x27;s nice fragrance would be a huge plus.</li>
            <li> It smells ok</li>
            <li> I ordered ManSalt with this in mind, not that in love with the more &#x27;aromatherapy&#x27; versions my wife</li>
            <li> these 3 workouts leave me the most sore.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t exactly place the exact scent, I have to say it&#x27;s excellent.  </li>
            <li> though that it could have more of an aroma but besides that it worked as stated.</li>
            <li> Is this safe to use.</li>
            <li> Will give it another shot for sure.</li>
            <li> It is a good thing that I stumbled upon Mansalt and ordered right away.</li>
            <li> the mansalt and the whole house smelled very nice when used in the tub.</li>
            <li> Good smell, large bag!</li>
            <li> A good hot soak can work wonders on a sore body.  </li>
            <li> I would describe it as pleasantly neutral and can imagine that it would appeal to women just as much as men, despite the branding.</li>
            <li> More like a very light, fresh cologne.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit strong, but got used to it.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product, the scent is very pleasant and it remedies soreness better than some other bath salts out there.</li>
            <li> Wish the packaging was better as it&#x27;s hard to close the bag, but besides that great product!</li>
            <li> Smells great and definitely helps with muscle soreness.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Yes it costs more than a bag of Epsom salts, but it is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, it did really seem to help recovery after long bike rides.</li>
            <li> This product works great to help reduce inflammation after those long runs.</li>
            <li> I feel better after soaking in hot water with the salts dissolved in it.  </li>
            <li> :)  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this type of product and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Enter Mansalt, the more manly way to take a hot relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing after a hard work out great Bath Salt also smells good  </li>
            <li> I initially purchased these salts as a gift for my dad and he loved them.  </li>
            <li> I had loved the aramis bath salts and was looking for something that created a similar bubble and massage factor.  </li>
            <li> He wants me to get him more.  </li>
            <li> I just wish the instructions gave more specifics about how much to use instead of just &amp;#34;a handful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells good, I use w/ regular epsom salt as well and feel great afterwords usually helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li> I really like this product mostly for the scent and the value.</li>
            <li> He loved it and the entire bag was used up in a week.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for bath salts that contained dead sea salt and smelled good, and this product did the trick!</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot of it, other than that, the scent is great.  </li>
            <li> The older I get the more</li>
            <li> Product was as described, arrived quickly, and there were no issues.</li>
            <li> My partner and I both enjoyed it so much that 2 weeks later we&#x27;ve already ordered more!</li>
            <li> favorite - highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this gave a great alternative, while also really helping relieve muscle soreness and minimal pain (though unsure if that was more the salt or just soaking in hot water, since he refused to take a bath since it was &amp;#34;manly&#x27;)</li>
            <li> I feel great non the less.</li>
            <li> So, get your message straight, and make your marketing message more consistent, congruent.</li>
            <li> Used it in a bath for two people and didn&#x27;t have to add more (usually with Epsom, you have to dump in a good pound for a soak).</li>
            <li> but it left your body with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> He has tried various other salts and products but he says that ManSalt has worked best out of everything he has tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I am very pleased with Mansalt which is a mixture of Epson Salt with several other components that provides a nice smell along with a relaxing and soothing soak.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a cure-all, but it&#x27;s a nice relief after a long day.</li>
            <li> For example, I used muscle soak &amp;#34;Escape for Men&amp;#34; made by Calvin Klein for years (actually still have some left) and that smell was great as well</li>
            <li> Thanks for putting something out there for the spoiled man!</li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t take baths.  </li>
            <li> This really helped eased my husbands sore muscles!  </li>
            <li> I use this in a whirlpool tub on days I don&#x27;t workout, so between the hot whirlpool and the mansalt</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering some more for him.</li>
            <li> Mansalt does exactly what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that the salts are gentle enough to use as a face and body scrub.  </li>
            <li> I have found that there is nothing better than coming home and taking a long bath with Mansalt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally hesitant with personal care products directed at men because the scents are way too over the top (think Axe), but that is not the case at all with ManSalt.  </li>
            <li> but the scent is strong, as in it took over my entire bathroom.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to buy a product first time via web without prior knowledge - this chance worked out great.</li>
            <li> My bathtub is huge, so I use around 4 cups of regular cheapo epsom salt from the supermarket (it&#x27;s something like $2 for a 2 pound bag)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this as a christmas gift, and really enjoys the aroma, and the softness to his skin.</li>
            <li> I had strained my muscles too much during a workout.</li>
            <li> I have very sore core muscles and this really helps me after a workout.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> will tell friends and family thanks agian</li>
            <li> He really enjoys Man Salt since it does the job</li>
            <li> Very relaxing and soothing after a herd workout.</li>
            <li> From all reports, he has found it to be very relaxing.</li>
            <li> but it was much stronger then</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the product though.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> , so I guess the smell really does get the ladies going.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> in a few days they did fallow up to see how I liked it tho</li>
            <li> Good luck to the new small company making this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the Original</li>
            <li> After a hard workout, or even just a long day... or hell, pretty much anytime I get a chance... I enjoy a nice soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> It hard to describe what Mansalt smells like other than saying it is natural and perfect for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to feel like he is bathing in aromatherapy oils and smell like a flower garden afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent price and helps sooth my aches.</li>
            <li> Man Salt smells graeat and VERY masculine (from a woman&#x27;s point of view), and both boys gave Man Salt high praises!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 2lb bag to sample, but will be ordering a much larger quantity very soon (that said, the small bag has lasted surprisingly long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> However, I think the price is a bit high for what it is.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how large the bag of ManSalt Soak was and it has lasted quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> With Fathers Day approaching, I know exactly what I am ordering him!</li>
            <li> It works well on sore muscles, and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> OK, long story short, I got into a little \\&quot;accident\\&quot; while trying to clean up the garage.</li>
            <li> Other than the sad packaging look, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Package came with the product wet and full of liquid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 yea old professional student and my main hobby is bodybuilding.</li>
            <li> Certain fragrances can cause headaches for me and it would be a shame to order a bag of ManSalt only to find out that I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> only recommendation I would have for them to improve is to have option for Gentleman Packaging (little more reserved to make this easier to send to my dad who enjoys jacuzzi baths without having to explain the packaging to mom).</li>
            <li> and a huge waste of time, not to mention water.  </li>
            <li> Although buying regular old epson salt from the supermarket is much cheaper, I do like the manly smell of this product</li>
            <li> My husband is an avid long distance runner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so was surprised to see the name ManSalt Muscle Soak on my order.  </li>
            <li> He works in construction, so he frequently mentions that he gets muscle aches and pains.  </li>
            <li> I would get frequent soreness from doing Insanity Workout, Les Mills Pump and Combat but ManSalt</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last because I use it so much when I&#x27;m sore from playing hockey..</li>
            <li> I also have to mention if you have sensitive skin, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> find that my nightly baths with Mansalt really help reduce the soreness in my muscles and prepare me for the workout the next day.</li>
            <li> and it made me very relaxed so this stuff will be used regularly in our house!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different additives to my ritual and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order a bag again as soon as mine runs out (which will probably take a few more weeks).</li>
            <li> bought this product a few times and plan to buy it several more</li>
            <li> With a little soap in the tub the mansalt scent becomes less effective.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product, it just seemed a little small for the price.</li>
            <li> I try to minimize my use of advil since apparently it can inhibit your gains, so</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t consider myself a &amp;#34;metro&amp;#34; guy and my grooming routine is pretty minimal.</li>
            <li> I have tried other bath salts but have not enjoyed the frilly garden/spice fragrance that most have.</li>
            <li> I do a decent amount of strenuous work, and actually enjoy dragging in sore and tired enough for a soak.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time walking for a couple of days and spent most of my time online.</li>
            <li> I expected a dry salt like consistently like Epsom salts.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only reason I take a bath after a hard day, because it smells fantastic, and it actually does help you relax.  </li>
            <li> In addition to soothing your tired muscles after working in the yard or on a long bike run, we love the smell of the salts...</li>
            <li> The other night he used his new salt</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t much of a bath guy in the past.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a 5-star.</li>
            <li> If I could change one thing, it would be to go a little old school and add eucalyptus to the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m against using NSAIDs to reduce inflammation after my long runs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who is a cook and after long shifts of being on his feet, loves to relax in a bath.</li>
            <li> I do Crossfit in the mornings and spend long hours at the office during the day...</li>
            <li> He also used it after a long workout!  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overly feminine like some other bath salts, and whether or not it&#x27;s psychosomatic when I have sore muscles or an achy back</li>
            <li> I have dealt with a back and shoulder injury for the past couple of years and found that few things help as much as muscle soaking baths.  </li>
            <li> and he was surprised, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> never really took baths because both bath salts and bubble bath smell &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> that day after you do squats, deadlifts, or military press...</li>
            <li> Epsom salts are OK, but I got sick of smelling like a cough drop.  </li>
            <li> The actual product is small for the price and doesn&#x27;t have a scent once you pour it out of the bag, but works as described...</li>
            <li> I like the packaging I don&#x27;t know why other people were so  prude about it.</li>
            <li> small suggestion would be to give a short description of each of the scents since the names don&#x27;t give an indication.  </li>
            <li> Football, other sports, 21 years in the military and time as a police officer and still very active.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a birthday gift for a close male friend of mine who works out hard and has pain due to some wounds he sustained in combat.</li>
            <li> and it not super fragrant, like other salts can be.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was with the label.</li>
            <li> but you can buy Epsom salt for a lot less than this their customer service</li>
            <li> The black sticker had been rubbed off in some sections and was just a bit worn looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again, if it was stronger, you could use less, and it lasted longer.  .</li>
            <li> After soaking for 30 minutes I feel a lot less pain in the incision area.</li>
            <li> I have used other slats in the past.</li>
            <li> I would purchase it again if it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is no overwhelming odors, which some other salts I used had.</li>
            <li> I use it after heavy workouts.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead taking a bubble bath unless there&#x27;s a girl in the tub with me, but that&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> For years I used Aramis Muscle Soak for Men when I needed a hot bath to soothe my aching muscles, and I was disappointed when I could no longer find that product.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the Aramis muscle soak that I had used for the past thirty years</li>
            <li> fact is, I appreciate small companies that make quality products.</li>
            <li> Soaking my foot with this along with some cold water made a big difference.</li>
            <li> He works long hours out in the cold and is always complaining about his aching body.</li>
            <li> I seriously feel rejuvenated and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Epsom salt has been scientifically proven to relieve tense, sore muscle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t make a habit of reviewing products, which is terrible given how much time I spend reading them...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for bath salts that contained dead sea salt and smelled good, and this product did the trick! Wish the packaging was better as it&#x27;s hard to close the bag, but besides that great product!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this as a christmas gift, and really enjoys the aroma, and the softness to his skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff for my boyfriend as he often complains of sore muscles, so I was hoping that this stuff would help. And it did! He used almost every night and said that he felt so relaxed. I didn&#x27;t know what the smell would be like, but he and I both loved the smell! It&#x27;s not too overwhelming either. Looking forward to buying another one for him :)</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, and does what it says. This isn&#x27;t some breakthrough stuff. But it works nice, and smells nice. So does what it says, I&#x27;ll buy from agian.</li>
            <li> Good item but you can buy Epsom salt for a lot less than this their customer service it great tho with in a few days they did fallow up to see how I liked it tho</li>
            <li> My husband is an avid long distance runner.&lt;br /&gt;He really enjoyed receiving the muscle soak and he smells awesome after his bath :-)&lt;br /&gt;My order was delivered promptly!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I had strained my muscles too much during a workout. 20 min with this soak in a bath helped a lot. The fragrance is a bit strong, but got used to it.</li>
            <li> Soothes muscles great!</li>
            <li> This was the best soaking salts I have used. I have very sore core muscles and this really helps me after a workout.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to buy your man that has EVERYTHING..... you have to buy him some of this incredible ManSalt~!  I found this online for my husbands birthday and he was surprised, to say the least.  Well we are both sold on it!  In addition to soothing your tired muscles after working in the yard or on a long bike run, we love the smell of the salts... With Fathers Day approaching, I know exactly what I am ordering him! I was surprised how large the bag of ManSalt Soak was and it has lasted quite awhile.  Thanks for putting something out there for the spoiled man!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my fiancé. He enjoys using it to soak in the tub. The actual product is small for the price and doesn&#x27;t have a scent once you pour it out of the bag, but works as described... Helps soothe muscle aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I am using my second 2 pound bag of Mansalt Muscle Soak. For years I used Aramis Muscle Soak for Men when I needed a hot bath to soothe my aching muscles, and I was disappointed when I could no longer find that product.  However, I am very pleased with Mansalt which is a mixture of Epson Salt with several other components that provides a nice smell along with a relaxing and soothing soak.  AND, Mansalt is much more affordable than the Aramis product I used.  I would say the makers of Mansalt have hit a home run.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to bathe in smells like rose and lavender so when I saw this I had to snag it.  The stuff really does smell awesome, my fiancee likes it maybe more than I do.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I found this after searching for back relief, while working a 2 week plant turnaround.  This isn&#x27;t a cure-all, but it&#x27;s a nice relief after a long day. I&#x27;d provide a video review, but I don&#x27;t want Amazon to block me.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! The best part about this product, in addition to the wonderful scent, is that it actually works. I&#x27;m against using NSAIDs to reduce inflammation after my long runs. However, inflammation is the enemy of distance runners. This product works great to help reduce inflammation after those long runs. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have ordered two bags and they are awesome.  I use them to relax my muscles and it does a great job</li>
            <li> Several years later &amp; this bath salt is still a family favorite - highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to buy a product first time via web without prior knowledge - this chance worked out great. It is a very great product, nice smell without being too strong. Best of all, it did really seem to help recovery after long bike rides. My daughter also used it after her boxing aerobic workout and likes it as well (we&#x27;ll be trying the Women&#x27;s salt next time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only recommendation I would have for them to improve is to have option for Gentleman Packaging (little more reserved to make this easier to send to my dad who enjoys jacuzzi baths without having to explain the packaging to mom).</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the ManSalt Muscle Soak I received from you.  I thought I was ordering the Aramis muscle soak that I had used for the past thirty years so was surprised to see the name ManSalt Muscle Soak on my order.  I decided not to question the order and go ahead and try it and I love it!!  Good luck to the new small company making this product -- I wish them well and will continue to use ManSalt (even though I&#x27;m a woman!)</li>
            <li> Smells great and definitely helps with muscle soreness. Looking forward to using more of their products. I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Mansalt is the best!! It smell really good and make you feel soo relaxed!! Highly recommended. I use it after heavy workouts. I feel like a champ after I use mansalt.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased these salts as a gift for my dad and he loved them.  He works in construction, so he frequently mentions that he gets muscle aches and pains.  He has tried various other salts and products but he says that ManSalt has worked best out of everything he has tried.&lt;br /&gt;I can vouch for the product myself.  I would get frequent soreness from doing Insanity Workout, Les Mills Pump and Combat but ManSalt helped to relieve the soreness.  Overall this is a great product, the scent is very pleasant and it remedies soreness better than some other bath salts out there.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product, it just seemed a little small for the price. The salts smelled really good and my boyfriend enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t take baths.  Inherently, baths are kinda gross to me (you never rinse!) and a huge waste of time, not to mention water.  However, my wife picked this up for me as a gift, and I used it once.  This stuff is the only reason I take a bath after a hard day, because it smells fantastic, and it actually does help you relax.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Very relaxing after a hard work out great Bath Salt also smells good  will tell friends and family thanks agian</li>
            <li> Seems like a good concept and maybe the company will continue to develop this product but you can do a lot better for the price. Also, don&#x27;t let the picture fool you; the order only comes with one bag.</li>
            <li> Decent price and helps sooth my aches. It smells neutral I guess, no lavender ha ha, but not like body odor either.</li>
            <li> Great for muscle strain relief. I use it for doctor directed sitz baths for a diagnosed medical condition. ManSalts helped me get the pain relief I needed</li>
            <li> Good smell, large bag! Very glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who is a cook and after long shifts of being on his feet, loves to relax in a bath. I thought this would be the perfect gift. I love the smell, not girly at all! My only complaint was with the label. The black sticker had been rubbed off in some sections and was just a bit worn looking. Other than the sad packaging look, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> I had loved the aramis bath salts and was looking for something that created a similar bubble and massage factor.  This is nice and relaxing but does not have the bubbles or provide the massage effect.  My tub ends up getting a yellow ring which I hadn&#x27;t gotten with the aramis.  My husband does like this since we can&#x27;t get aramis anymore but I am still on the look for an aramis replacement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t make a habit of reviewing products, which is terrible given how much time I spend reading them... but this isn&#x27;t about me being a leech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is, I appreciate small companies that make quality products. After a hard workout, or even just a long day... or hell, pretty much anytime I get a chance... I enjoy a nice soak in the tub. I am a bath type of guy... don&#x27;t judge me. I have tried a few different additives to my ritual and this has been my favorite. I ordered the 2lb bag to sample, but will be ordering a much larger quantity very soon (that said, the small bag has lasted surprisingly long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note is that the scent is not strictly &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34;. I would describe it as pleasantly neutral and can imagine that it would appeal to women just as much as men, despite the branding.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my fiance who enjoys soaks in the tub after a good work out. He really enjoys Man Salt since it does the job and it not super fragrant, like other salts can be.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t much of a bath guy in the past.  Then I tried a bath salt from the store on a whim and kinda liked the way it made the water softer but was not so keen on the floral scent, so I decided to look for a bath salt for men.  Amazon led me to Man Salt and I tried it out.  I think it&#x27;s great!  My partner and I both enjoyed it so much that 2 weeks later we&#x27;ve already ordered more!</li>
            <li> Great value and the product lived up to its name. Very relaxing and soothing after a herd workout. The service was impecibale.</li>
            <li> This really helped eased my husbands sore muscles!  He had the flu and it took away the aches and pains!  He also used it after a long workout!  He wants me to get him more.  It had a pleasant scent and works as well as epsom salts!  The plus side is the nice scent!</li>
            <li> I ordered three bags of these bath salts for my husband and son. They are both runners and needed something that would relax their muscles and wouldn&#x27;t make them smell \\&quot;pretty\\&quot;.  Man Salt smells graeat and VERY masculine (from a woman&#x27;s point of view), and both boys gave Man Salt high praises! I will be ordereing this again. Would make a great additon to a teen/adult Easter basket or Christmas stocking!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overly feminine like some other bath salts, and whether or not it&#x27;s psychosomatic when I have sore muscles or an achy back I feel better after soaking in hot water with the salts dissolved in it.  I like the packaging I don&#x27;t know why other people were so  prude about it. I just wish the instructions gave more specifics about how much to use instead of just &amp;#34;a handful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product works fine and smells really good. However, I think the price is a bit high for what it is.</li>
            <li> Great stuff to soak in. I use it often. Shame it doesn&#x27;t last because I use it so much when I&#x27;m sore from playing hockey..</li>
            <li> I put the bath salt in the bathroom and it gives a very pleasant smell. Hope they can provide a larger size and cheaper price.</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot of it, other than that, the scent is great.  It suggests a handful, but it took much more in a tub to get even a faint scent, or to even know you were using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again, if it was stronger, you could use less, and it lasted longer.  .</li>
            <li> This was a gift from me to my son. From all reports, he has found it to be very relaxing. It has a pleasant, non-pefume-scent.  Has already suggested it as a gift in the future.</li>
            <li> got as a gift for a lifter. he loved it. never really took baths because both bath salts and bubble bath smell &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;...this gave a great alternative, while also really helping relieve muscle soreness and minimal pain (though unsure if that was more the salt or just soaking in hot water, since he refused to take a bath since it was &amp;#34;manly&#x27;)</li>
            <li> I have used other slats in the past. This did not help at all and there was a big hole in the bag.</li>
            <li> An excellent muscle soak with a very pleasant smell. It works well on sore muscles, and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and it smells really nice. I would just want the fragrance to be stronger. For example, I used muscle soak &amp;#34;Escape for Men&amp;#34; made by Calvin Klein for years (actually still have some left) and that smell was great as well but it was much stronger then the mansalt and the whole house smelled very nice when used in the tub. We just loved it. Not a knock on mansalt because I think it works well but coming out of the tub with mansalt&#x27;s nice fragrance would be a huge plus. The Calvin Klein wasn&#x27;t over bearing but it left your body with a nice scent. With a little soap in the tub the mansalt scent becomes less effective. I use this in a whirlpool tub on days I don&#x27;t workout, so between the hot whirlpool and the mansalt.........OH YEAH!!!</li>
            <li> Man Salt Muscle Soak arrived as promised.  However, I think it&#x27;s over priced for what you get.  It smells ok but the scent is strong, as in it took over my entire bathroom.  I also have to mention if you have sensitive skin, this is not for you.  Man salt burned my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
            <li> The salt smells great, and you get a fair amount; but it&#x27;s still priced a tad high for soaking salt. I would purchase it again if it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son in law.  He loves the mansalt Muscle Soak so this was a repeat order.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE IT!! I seriously feel rejuvenated and refreshed. Maybe it&#x27;s a placebo affect. I feel great non the less. Great for my soar legs!! Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a 5-star.</li>
            <li> I do Crossfit in the mornings and spend long hours at the office during the day...I have found that there is nothing better than coming home and taking a long bath with Mansalt. I have tried other bath salts but have not enjoyed the frilly garden/spice fragrance that most have. It hard to describe what Mansalt smells like other than saying it is natural and perfect for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to feel like he is bathing in aromatherapy oils and smell like a flower garden afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that my nightly baths with Mansalt really help reduce the soreness in my muscles and prepare me for the workout the next day. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Get this for my dad every Christmas, he looks forward to it.</li>
            <li> I do a decent amount of strenuous work, and actually enjoy dragging in sore and tired enough for a soak. My wife does too, and we tend to seek a 30 minute or so bath after such days. I ordered ManSalt with this in mind, not that in love with the more &#x27;aromatherapy&#x27; versions my wife likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we opened the ManSalt package  - with me over her shoulder - it looked like hooker bait. The message of &#x27;muscle therapy&#x27; was lost somewhere in a message of &#x27;these salts will help you attract this nude red-headed vamp&#x27;. So, get your message straight, and make your marketing message more consistent, congruent. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Great product for my husband for valentine&#x27;s day. Didn&#x27;t notice the &amp;#34;mudflap girl&amp;#34; on the front of the package, but it was a funny surprise that we laughed at! My husband really likes the product though. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He works long hours out in the cold and is always complaining about his aching body. The other night he used his new salt and he said &amp;#34;I think it actually worked&amp;#34;.. which is a lot coming from him! As for me.. when I smelt the man salt aroma coming from the bathroom.. I almost died.. in a good way! It smells so amazing.. honestly one of the best things I&#x27;ve smelled in my life! So that was enough for me to give it a try and it made me very relaxed so this stuff will be used regularly in our house!</li>
            <li> Works well, smells good, I use w/ regular epsom salt as well and feel great afterwords usually helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li> Really excellent product!</li>
            <li> Football, other sports, 21 years in the military and time as a police officer and still very active. I have muscle aces every day and I like to soak in the tub on the weekends. I really like this product mostly for the scent and the value. If I could change one thing, it would be to go a little old school and add eucalyptus to the product.  Still great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> my husband &amp; I are both a big fan</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my husband-------------he loves it.  He loves that he can relax and not have to smell girly!!!!  :)  Thanks!</li>
            <li> OK, long story short, I got into a little \\&quot;accident\\&quot; while trying to clean up the garage. I had a hard time walking for a couple of days and spent most of my time online. It is a good thing that I stumbled upon Mansalt and ordered right away. Soaking my foot with this along with some cold water made a big difference. Took of some of the sting. I would definitely order a bag again as soon as mine runs out (which will probably take a few more weeks).</li>
            <li> Smells great, works as advertised and pretty spiffy graphics for the labelling. Used it in a bath for two people and didn&#x27;t have to add more (usually with Epsom, you have to dump in a good pound for a soak).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of time.  If I had used it longer, I would probably give it another star.  I had been a quite a lot&lt;br /&gt;of pain and I don&#x27;t think a couple of times is enough time to rate it.</li>
            <li> I am recovering from four back surgeries. After soaking for 30 minutes I feel a lot less pain in the incision area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 yea old professional student and my main hobby is bodybuilding. I definitely don&#x27;t consider myself a &amp;#34;metro&amp;#34; guy and my grooming routine is pretty minimal. I&#x27;ve been using epsom salt for years to relieve sore muscles after my workouts. Epsom salt has been scientifically proven to relieve tense, sore muscle. You know what I&#x27;m talking about....that day after you do squats, deadlifts, or military press...these 3 workouts leave me the most sore. I try to minimize my use of advil since apparently it can inhibit your gains, so epsom baths help helps me minimize the amount of advil I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Although buying regular old epson salt from the supermarket is much cheaper, I do like the manly smell of this product and I like that it doesn&#x27;t make &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34;....I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead taking a bubble bath unless there&#x27;s a girl in the tub with me, but that&#x27;s just me haha. You actually need to use a lot of epsom salt if you want it to work properly. My bathtub is huge, so I use around 4 cups of regular cheapo epsom salt from the supermarket (it&#x27;s something like $2 for a 2 pound bag) and then just 1 cup of this, so that it lasts longer. My girlfriend literally can&#x27;t keep her hands off me after I get out of the bath whenever I use this, so I guess the smell really does get the ladies going. I&#x27;ve only tried the Original but I just ordered the &amp;#34;Verdis&amp;#34; one since I prefer woodsy smells over anything &amp;#34;sporty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with a back and shoulder injury for the past couple of years and found that few things help as much as muscle soaking baths.  Epsom salts are OK, but I got sick of smelling like a cough drop.  Enter ManSalt.  I&#x27;m normally hesitant with personal care products directed at men because the scents are way too over the top (think Axe), but that is not the case at all with ManSalt.  While I can&#x27;t exactly place the exact scent, I have to say it&#x27;s excellent.  More like a very light, fresh cologne.  The salts are as advertised, feel great, and don&#x27;t seem to be drying out my skin.  I also love the fact that the salts are gentle enough to use as a face and body scrub.  That kind of versatility puts ManSalt over the top.  Yes it costs more than a bag of Epsom salts, but it is absolutely worth it.  I will definitely be buying this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small suggestion would be to give a short description of each of the scents since the names don&#x27;t give an indication.  Certain fragrances can cause headaches for me and it would be a shame to order a bag of ManSalt only to find out that I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this type of product and enjoyed it. I though that it could have more of an aroma but besides that it worked as stated.</li>
            <li> Package came with the product wet and full of liquid. Is this the way it is supposed be? I expected a dry salt like consistently like Epsom salts. Is this safe to use. Anyone have a similar experience? Please advise. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a birthday gift for a close male friend of mine who works out hard and has pain due to some wounds he sustained in combat. He loved it and the entire bag was used up in a week.  And his wife loved the smell too.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering some more for him.</li>
            <li> Mansalt does exactly what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;Ive bought this product a few times and plan to buy it several more</li>
            <li> Purchased for my fiance so he doesn&#x27;t have to use all my floral scented salts/ bath products. The smell is great, fresh and clean, with a more &#x27;manly&#x27; scent (though I would use it too!).</li>
            <li> The older I get the more I have to focus on recovery after exercise, especially basketball. Enter Mansalt, the more manly way to take a hot relaxing bath. Product was as described, arrived quickly, and there were no issues. What I like about it is no overwhelming odors, which some other salts I used had. Would order from again.</li>
            <li> A good hot soak can work wonders on a sore body.  I have this product a shot, using it after some strenuous bike rides and also after deep tissue massage.  I did feel like it helped in recovering faster, and the nice smell and the cleansing feeling it has on your skin was a bonus.  Will give it another shot for sure.</li>
