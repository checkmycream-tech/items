            <li>I am so happy it&#x27;s available at amazon because CVS no longer carries it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called Sally Hansen Fast  and Flawless airbrush make up.  </li>
            <li>I really love the spray foundation, I just need to order a lighter color for a fair-skinned woman.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on and how it evens my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the dewy look and how it softens age lines.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it would be better if it sprayed well.</li>
            <li>I enjoy a lighter coverage and this is not it!</li>
            <li>My estimated use of this product was (8) yrears or more until it became scarce</li>
            <li>- THE SERVICE WAS GREAT AND VERY PROFESSIONAL -</li>
            <li>this product was available in most all stores than sold sally hansen products.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and covers well.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and it looks like you have on caked makeup.  </li>
            <li>Does feel light not like wearing thcted.ick makeup.  </li>
            <li>I had to return it at my expense but the credit for my original purchase was given immediately.</li>
            <li>It does not provide very good coverage, and is messy to apply.</li>
            <li>Product is great, but color is way too dark.</li>
            <li>It did good on my face,  just a little  too dark for my very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I received better coverage and even skin tone from Bare Minerals powder.  </li>
            <li>Coverage is very light, definitely does not cover blemishes or even out skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Just make certain you have the right brush for it.  </li>
            <li>MUCH later b/c the delivery was an issue with needing someone here to sign for it instead of being able to sign for it &amp; leave the signature taped to the door..</li>
            <li>First time every buying.  </li>
            <li>Had to get used to it at first</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how that is better than traditional foundation, or even tinted moisturizer for that matter.</li>
            <li>I have loved this makeup since I found it a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I have fair so medium skin tone and very little blemish or discoloration</li>
            <li>Not only did I receive my order very quickly after placing it, they also went the extra mile with their own personal packaging.</li>
            <li>Beige\\&quot; but when i received it, it was MUCH darker than i anticipated.</li>
            <li>However, my friend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly!</li>
            <li>I really don’t like this product.</li>
            <li>Also I found it for $10,  much cheaper than some  places charge for it.</li>
            <li>and it makes me really upset cause as soon as i got it home</li>
            <li>so I expected product to work better for me.  </li>
            <li>Liked item, need to select different shade next order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but the color is a bit too dark &amp; sometimes comes off on my close.</li>
            <li>and I am really tan naturally.</li>
            <li>YET IT WAS JUST NOT THE RIGHT COLOR AND SUCH</li>
            <li>WOW!    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s splotchy and makes a huge mess plus</li>
            <li>This type product should be clearly flagged and indicated with each item.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in \\&quot;Natural</li>
            <li>Natural beige is the tint I bought,  but  it&#x27;s darker than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>so I bought this In natural beige spice  </li>
            <li>I ordered it from Cassie Cosmetics, and I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Natural Beige Spice was darker than expe</li>
            <li>It is very difficult to get, but I was really happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.)This item is for a person of dark or darker complexion, this color instantly gives a person (beige complexion) instantly deep tan or more with a unnatural look, it gives instantly deep color and does not cover any flaws...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how other products work,  but this requires first spraying on your hand, then rubbing on your face.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t extra expensive, but just the little extra personal touch was awesome!</li>
            <li>the more you try to cover or use,the worse your skin looks.</li>
            <li>etc...rather enhances these, thereby giving a pasty apperance with dry looking finish that  gives the apperance of considerable age lines.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love the spray foundation, I just need to order a lighter color for a fair-skinned woman.  This is kinda too brown for me.  Just make certain you have the right brush for it.  That I had already from the Dior spray foundation I ran out of, it makes a BIG difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in \\&quot;Natural Beige\\&quot; but when i received it, it was MUCH darker than i anticipated. I had to give it to my friend who&#x27;s about 5 shades darker than i am... However, my friend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5 years. I love the way it goes on and how it evens my skin. I love the dewy look and how it softens age lines.  I am so happy it&#x27;s available at amazon because CVS no longer carries it.  I use this color and nude beige together to match my complexion. I would recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and it looks like you have on caked makeup.  I would not recommend it and actually got rid of what I purchased because I will never use it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product out, I was VERY disappointed. I wanted to use it for my moms graduation, but when I went to apply it, it was orange. I shuck the can afterward thinking that might fix it, but I was wrong. This is really awful and definitely not worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The make up doesn&#x27;t spray well it&#x27;s splotchy and makes a huge mess plus the color is dark like dirty dark. Maybe it would be better if it sprayed well.</li>
            <li> I really don’t like this product. The color was way too dark for me and it went on thick and not nice at all. I enjoy a lighter coverage and this is not it!</li>
            <li> The designation &amp;#34;airbrush&amp;#34; is misleading.  It&#x27;s just a brush with loose powder.  It does not provide very good coverage, and is messy to apply.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but color is way too dark. I will buy again in my color, once I figure out what that is. :D</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered the Air Brush….&amp; I did but some how this was sent instead of that however I also got the other (Air Brush) MUCH later b/c the delivery was an issue with needing someone here to sign for it instead of being able to sign for it &amp; leave the signature taped to the door..It&#x27;s ok but the color is a bit too dark &amp; sometimes comes off on my close.</li>
            <li> works great with my brush.  First time every buying.  Had to get used to it at first but now it is great</li>
            <li> The spray is dark and not usable for me. It is supposed to be for all colors. Not good for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and covers well.  Not quite as &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; as I thought it might be.  Will buy again though as it is inexpensive and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> This order was completed and the ad said beige spice, this is not decribing actual color. beige color would mean tan/off tan..... spice  color indicated maybe red tone/green tone....  slight hue difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)This item is for a person of dark or darker complexion, this color instantly gives a person (beige complexion) instantly deep tan or more with a unnatural look, it gives instantly deep color and does not cover any flaws... dark spots/ sunspots etc...rather enhances these, thereby giving a pasty apperance with dry looking finish that  gives the apperance of considerable age lines. the more you try to cover or use,the worse your skin looks. This happens with the first  use of cosmetic and gave me the apperance of a dirty face. The impacts were definately for a very dark complexion/ or can sold as black skin cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) The advertisement itsself,does not indicate that this is non refundable item due to flammable contents.or chemical used. This is stated in the overall advertisment of introduction but not in specific item being sold by cassieproducts. This type product should be clearly flagged and indicated with each item. This does state refund or return item made easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) I have purchased this probuct for several years in nude or beige colors. this product was available in most all stores than sold sally hansen products. My estimated use of this product was (8) yrears or more until it became scarce and I would not use any other product until the item was obsolete.  since then I have purchased several, several types and colors, I have a collossal collection of foundation, looking for same/similair type of finish.</li>
            <li> Its messy but grate cover up</li>
            <li> A little to dark for my skin although it still went on well and didn&#x27;t run.  I need it to be lighter.</li>
            <li> Liked item, need to select different shade next order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called Sally Hansen Fast  and Flawless airbrush make up.  Natural beige is the tint I bought,  but  it&#x27;s darker than I wanted.  It did good on my face,  just a little  too dark for my very fair skin.  But it looks  GOOD on my legs. WOW!    I&#x27;ll buy it again.  Also I found it for $10,  much cheaper than some  places charge for it.</li>
            <li> Well...I am an actor and I&#x27;m always buying foundation cause I have insecurities about blemishes...so I bought this In natural beige spice  (I have sorta a beige skin tone)....it is soooooo dark !!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not kidding....an African American could use this, I&#x27;m so disappointed and it makes me really upset cause as soon as i got it home I sprayed some on my hand and immediately I said nope !&lt;br /&gt;If I could find another skin tone id try but idk....</li>
            <li> I have loved this makeup since I found it a few years ago. It is very difficult to get, but I was really happy to find it on Amazon. I ordered it from Cassie Cosmetics, and I was very pleasantly surprised. Not only did I receive my order very quickly after placing it, they also went the extra mile with their own personal packaging. I will sport the wonderful makeup bag they sent my product in. It wasn&#x27;t extra expensive, but just the little extra personal touch was awesome! I will definitely be ordering from this company again!</li>
            <li> Real nice finish look</li>
            <li> Coverage is very light, definitely does not cover blemishes or even out skin tone.  Does feel light not like wearing thcted.ick makeup.  I received better coverage and even skin tone from Bare Minerals powder.  I have fair so medium skin tone and very little blemish or discoloration so I expected product to work better for me.  Natural Beige Spice was darker than expe</li>
            <li> This product was way too dark to put on your face and I am really tan naturally. It looked like my face was dirty.</li>
            <li> I was so unhappy with this product, it was very greasy on my face and the color was so off.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED - THE SERVICE WAS GREAT AND VERY PROFESSIONAL - YET IT WAS JUST NOT THE RIGHT COLOR AND SUCH</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other products work,  but this requires first spraying on your hand, then rubbing on your face. I don&#x27;t see how that is better than traditional foundation, or even tinted moisturizer for that matter. Plus, it stains whatever it touches. Don&#x27;t waste your money. There&#x27;s nothing airbrushed about it.</li>
            <li> This product was very dark on my skin.  I had to return it at my expense but the credit for my original purchase was given immediately.</li>
