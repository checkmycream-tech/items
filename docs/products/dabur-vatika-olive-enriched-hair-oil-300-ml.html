            <li>Delivery on time, I think price is good and have been very useful to help my hair grows.</li>
            <li>This oil is perfect for light application and keeps my hair very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love the coconut enriched oil and that was, and still is, a staple in my regimen.</li>
            <li>While some people may not like, or want anything to do with mineral oil, others love it, as do their hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has no problem accepting this product with mineral oil (although I do not use many) and it has helped to keep my hair and scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li>Love this and the coconut hair oil.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and healthy looking after this.  </li>

            <li>I did an extensive study of ayurvedic treatment for hair on the internet and came to the conclusion that jasmine oil was the best.</li>
            <li>Enriched Hair Oil 300 Ml , great oil, really oily</li>
            <li>and I like the coconut oil better</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil to your hair then cover with a plastic cap or plastic bag, the longer you leave the oil in the more moisture</li>
            <li>love the smell also..</li>
            <li>I use mostly all Dabur products except shampoo (I use sulfate free shampoo).</li>
            <li>This oil I bought because I wanted a light weight oil to apply to my scalp.</li>
            <li>Great such for the price.</li>
            <li>This oil has my natural hair smelling good and leaves my hair well moisturized.</li>
            <li>it is non-greasy , has a mild fragrance and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its light and makes my hair feels soft and gives it a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>Vatika&#x27;s unique formulation ensures deeper oil penetration to give your hair and scalp complete natural nourishment for problem free, beautiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Olive oil is very beneficial and you will love how your hair look and feel after every use of this product.</li>
            <li>I use it so much that I purchase 3 or more at once, I can&#x27;t see myself without it.</li>
            <li>I really loved this oil and the Vatika brand oils because they have multiple benefits in each type of oil, I plan on trying them all soon.</li>
            <li>Its good but slight more smell.</li>
            <li>That yields far better results.</li>
            <li>love using Olive Oil on my hair since I started going natural.</li>
            <li>Compared to coconut oil, this oil does not have harsh smell, rather it has a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>noticed another reviewer stating it has mineral oil as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>I first got to use this oil about 3 months ago.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for pre shampoo treatment overnight or at least an hour before washing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for one month and it does a great job keeping African American Hair moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not speaking of the reviewer, I don&#x27;t know them, but of the many on YouTube and natural sites such as Curly Nikki.  </li>
            <li>It has a noticeable smell that is not as overwhelming as that of some other hair oils I have tried, and it does not linger as much after application.</li>
            <li>I have noticed less breakage and most importantly my hair not only feels healthier, it looks it too.</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair and harsh climate</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I freaking live this hair oil</li>
            <li>I am still giving it a high rating, because after a couple of rinses my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient in this formulation is mineral oil - olive oil is the fourth.</li>
            <li>I feel better adding a little extra virgin olive oil to my hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>I gave the rest to my sister (who is natural) and she loves it as well.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE don&#x27;t let these self-proclaimed \\&quot;natural hair gurus\\&quot; steer you away from an age-old staple in the African-American community.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian, and this product left my hair very greasy after use.</li>
            <li>I order this oil to start my natural hair journey and so far it helps my hair texture a lot.</li>
            <li>My scalp is less itchy (which usually happens during the winter months) and it smells good.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair felt like it grew while I was using this, and looked so healthy!</li>
            <li> Magnificent smell and great for your hair, that is all I can say. Compared to coconut oil, this oil does not have harsh smell, rather it has a pleasant smell to it. Recommend it for people who would like to care for their hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome, delivery on point, Thanks.</li>
            <li> Its lighter and keep my hair look shinnier and best of all without any ordor.</li>
            <li> I use mostly all Dabur products except shampoo (I use sulfate free shampoo). I love the coconut enriched oil and that was, and still is, a staple in my regimen. This oil I bought because I wanted a light weight oil to apply to my scalp. The coconut oil I use for my ends. Well I must say I&#x27;m gald I decided to try something new. This oil is perfect for light application and keeps my hair very moisturized. My scalp is less itchy (which usually happens during the winter months) and it smells good. It comes in a very big bottle so after filling my applicator bottle with a nozzle,  I gave the rest to my sister (who is natural) and she loves it as well.  If it says Dabur Vatika you can&#x27;t go wrong as far as the maintenance and health of your hair. Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I had to come back and add this****&lt;br /&gt;I noticed another reviewer stating it has mineral oil as the first ingredient. PLEASE don&#x27;t let these self-proclaimed \\&quot;natural hair gurus\\&quot; steer you away from an age-old staple in the African-American community. Not speaking of the reviewer, I don&#x27;t know them, but of the many on YouTube and natural sites such as Curly Nikki.  While some people may not like, or want anything to do with mineral oil, others love it, as do their hair. Bottom line: What works for your hair works for YOUR hair. A key thing to remember with any oil is to use it in moderation. My hair has no problem accepting this product with mineral oil (although I do not use many) and it has helped to keep my hair and scalp moisturized. I have noticed less breakage and most importantly my hair not only feels healthier, it looks it too.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient in this formulation is mineral oil - olive oil is the fourth. I was underwhelmed by the results of using this oil; a little goes a long way but it basically coats your hair.     I don&#x27;t consider mineral oil a \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; property. This oil only gave my hair some sheen. I csn&#x27;t say it contributed to the overall health of my hair any and it definitely didn&#x27;t diminish the winter breakage. I feel better adding a little extra virgin olive oil to my hair conditioner. That yields far better results.</li>
            <li> I first got to use this oil about 3 months ago.  I love the smell of it and it is very healthy for my hair.  Great such for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair oil. Not too greasy, but enough to keep my hair well-tamed. And the ingredients look good, except for the mineral oil perhaps. It has a noticeable smell that is not as overwhelming as that of some other hair oils I have tried, and it does not linger as much after application. But I would have liked it to not have any smell at all.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Use it as an everyday oil and in my deep conditioner! I don&#x27;t like the price here so I will purchase elsewhere, but I do love the product!</li>
            <li> The product came with no seal on it!</li>
            <li> Love this and the coconut hair oil.  I use it as a deep treatment.  Warm the oil, massage into hair, wrap with a warm towel and let sit for 30min or longer.  Shampoo/condition out and style--your hair will look amazing.  My hair is so shiny and healthy looking after this.  I use this weekly or fortnightly now.  This is a must have for me.</li>
            <li> I freaking live this hair oil i mixed it with other ones like this and it made my hair healthy and grow longer I&#x27;m happy with this item.</li>
            <li> This is the best brand of hair oil I have ever used.My hair was very bad from chemically treating it ,due to highlights and permanent straightening. I did an extensive study of ayurvedic treatment for hair on the internet and came to the conclusion that jasmine oil was the best. I did not get jasmine oil ,but found this brand on in the Indian store I went to. It worked wonders for my hair, now my hair is long shiny and thick, I am 55 years too, and will no longer fool around with my hair.</li>
            <li> Great shippment, Love it.</li>
            <li> Dabur Vatika Olive Enriched Hair Oil 300 Ml , great oil, really oily but it feels good on the skin and in your hair.</li>
            <li> The best hair oil I have tried so far. it is non-greasy , has a mild fragrance and absorbs very quickly. I like the combination of olive and cactus and it gives a shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> works awesome!!! great for frizzy hair and brittle hair. the quantity is great for the price also. A little goes a LONG way so it should last a long time</li>
            <li> I purchased the product together with the Enriched Coconut Oil and I like the coconut oil better but i once in a while i use it and i am very satisfied with it. Keeps the ends of my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> Awesome product....smells great and keep hair shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, great for your hair....</li>
            <li> Plan to do a lot of rising to get the oiliness of the product out of your hair. I am Caucasian, and this product left my hair very greasy after use. I am still giving it a high rating, because after a couple of rinses my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Delivery on time, I think price is good and have been very useful to help my hair grows.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have only used it for one month and it does a great job keeping African American Hair moisturized. I use it to seal my ends. It does not appear to be overly oily, but then an again, I mix it with leave-in conditioners and add it to shampoo&#x27;s, and other conditioners. The delivery of this product from the vendor was delivered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> Dabur Vatika Olive Enriched Hair Oil contains Virgin Olive Oil and nourishing extracts of Almonds, Cactus &amp; Lemon. Vatika&#x27;s unique formulation ensures deeper oil penetration to give your hair and scalp complete natural nourishment for problem free, beautiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using Olive Oil on my hair since I started going natural. Olive Oil keep my hair and scalp moisturized. It&#x27;s great for pre shampoo treatment overnight or at least an hour before washing. Add the olive oil to your hair then cover with a plastic cap or plastic bag, the longer you leave the oil in the more moisture your hair with have especially if your washing with shampoo and not co-washing. It&#x27;s also great as an added ingredient for a protein treatment. A can of coconut milk and 3 cap fulls of olive oil, mix, distribute to hair, leave in for an hour, then wash out. Try not to deep condition with heat after the protein treatment, it will cause breakage... sitting out for an hour doing chores or under the sun will help the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive oil is very beneficial and you will love how your hair look and feel after every use of this product. I use it so much that I purchase 3 or more at once, I can&#x27;t see myself without it. While waiting when I&#x27;m out I also use GOYA cooking olive oil... it&#x27;s all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Its good but slight more smell.</li>
            <li> NICE OIL SMELL IS ALSO NICE</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair and harsh climate</li>
            <li> I really loved this oil and the Vatika brand oils because they have multiple benefits in each type of oil, I plan on trying them all soon.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and shiny/soft. I warm it up on the stove and put it in my hair and then wrap it in a towel for the evening or overnight every once in a while.</li>
            <li> This oil has my natural hair smelling good and leaves my hair well moisturized. When I&#x27;m in a hurry I use this oil rather than the other eight I have because there is about 3 different oils included.</li>
            <li> I order this oil to start my natural hair journey and so far it helps my hair texture a lot. Its light and makes my hair feels soft and gives it a nice sheen. It don&#x27;t leave my hair feeling too oily or thick/heavy. Its been really great help.</li>
            <li> I tried many kind of oil, so far this is the best..love the smell also..I am so happy that I found it on Amazon...</li>
