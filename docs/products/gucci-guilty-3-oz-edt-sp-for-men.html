            <li>Men&#x27; perfume used to be nice.</li>
            <li>Smelled so good on my fianc&amp;eacute; she loved it good amount for the right price .</li>
            <li>love love love this cologne!!</li>
            <li>This was a great transaction, great communication, fast shipping, would surely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this cologne, its very sexy.</li>
            <li>The product was as described, new in box and smells amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>great product and most importantly</li>
            <li>its okay not my top 10!</li>
            <li>:) Love it!</li>
            <li>While wearing this, i got many compliments saying i smelled nice.</li>
            <li>This cologne is one of the best on the market as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li>IT IS THE BEST SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but the scent doesn&#x27;t hold for more than 3 hours if that.  </li>
            <li>I have already used all of this and need to order some more, i liked the deal and it was cheaper then buying from Macys</li>
            <li>Perfect cologne for a 22 year old guy, and you can&#x27;t find it cheaper.</li>
            <li>I honestly have over 50 bottles of cologne and this is def top 10.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the man who likes to smell good, but doesn&#x27;t want the scent to arrive before him or stay long after he&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li>the outfit of this perfume looks exact as it shows on the image, and the smell is good though it is not as good as I thought before.</li>
            <li>This cologne is more on the sweet side rather than a spicy note but never-the-less a great scent.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time, it was good and smelled good.</li>
            <li>I love it and so did my Fiance, may be my most favorite scent ever!</li>
            <li>It was the real thing and he loved it!</li>
            <li>New fragrance is very interesting and special for all men.&lt;br /&gt;Gucci is still the best fragrance for me .</li>
            <li>Smells great, the price was good...and my girlfriend finally finds me attractive.  </li>
            <li>Armani is more of an elegant kind of cologne</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great masculine cologne; product pricing was good.</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne, great smell and lasting.</li>
            <li>Two sprays for a 16 hour day (one every eight hours if I had to try to be exact), which in my opinion is great quality.</li>
            <li>it is just the perfect combination gentle but powerful!</li>
            <li>I saw all the great reviews for this product and was extremely interested.</li>
            <li>First off, fragrance is authentic and was in authentic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, really great scent.</li>
            <li>Well, it does smell very good, sexy even, but I could not smell it 10 minutes after he put it on, even putting my nose directly against him</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite</li>
            <li>I have ordered this many times now.</li>
            <li>Authentic.</li>
            <li>Receive many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>ITS OK</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>and I love it also :-)</li>
            <li>scent lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the scent and just had to buy a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous ordering cologne from Amazon since there are so many reviews stating that they received knock off fragrances.</li>
            <li>It is clearly my favorite.</li>
            <li>its trying to be too many things at once.  </li>
            <li>He has been wearing it every day now and has received many comments about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I simply love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i bet a cheaper fragrance smells better than this One</li>
            <li>was way more than Amazon s price.</li>
            <li>It simply Smells wonderful on!</li>
            <li>My most favorite cologne to smell on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>After getting scammed on e-bay I came to the online store I trust (amazon) and this product appears to be authentic.</li>
            <li>Either way great fragrance, just make sure you get a real one.</li>
            <li>Cost more in the shopping mall.</li>
            <li>I would purchase more at that price</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It smells so fabulous!</li>
            <li>and i did and priced well &#x3D;)</li>

            <li>Fast delivery and smells great.</li>
            <li>He was quite pleased that I was able to purchase this for him.</li>
            <li>This is probably the longest lasting best smelling manly cologne I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I love the brand as it is, now that this smell matches</li>
            <li>This is for sure something you wear for evenings/meetings.  </li>
            <li>Some colognes have that &#x27;day time&#x27; smell, this is more of an evening smell.  </li>
            <li>The girls love it and know it by the aroma.</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>Most everyone likes it.</li>

            <li>I love this spray for men.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves this one and we haven&#x27;t been able to find something that smells better.  </li>
            <li>Drops more drawers than an Ikea warehouse.  </li>
            <li>I love this on my husband.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m GLAD</li>
            <li>I research to make sure I was paying what I wanted to pay for it.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne I reordered my husband</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more once I run out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, not my favorite scent my husband has</li>
            <li>But I like it anyway, smells sexy</li>
            <li>Still love it.</li>
            <li>Great perfume, it lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing exotic in my opinion</li>
            <li>He loves it, I love it.</li>
            <li>Item is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>Since I began wearing this cologne I have had many complements and the ladies love it.</li>
            <li>Women LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li>i give it 5stars because my husband love it</li>
            <li>but he was ok with it and kept it..</li>
            <li>And i thoroughly am enjoying it.</li>
            <li>more cowbell.</li>
            <li>its ok I wear this when I go to work or just hanging out with my buddies</li>
            <li>and I like that much better.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>The price was outstanding.</li>
            <li>WAS A GIFT , HE LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Was worried because I wasn&#x27;t really sure</li>
            <li>Smells lovely.. will buy from again.</li>
            <li>WASN&#x27;T SURE WHAT IT WOULD SMELL LIKE.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t give it more then 3 stars</li>
            <li>The scent and the packaging are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda like you put on an okay cologne and then huffed a bag of Lemon Pledge.</li>
            <li>But then again, Armani isn&#x27;t doing anything better nowadays.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WAY THAT IT SMELLS</li>
            <li>My husband lodes this perfume, but I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the one inside of the mall smells much better than this one.</li>
            <li>I love the scent on him too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I didn&#x27;t try it out, but my friend loves it. :)</li>
            <li>and we both love the smell.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this cologne.</li>
            <li>I must say that most people that do not like this fragrence must not comment.</li>
            <li>Never disappoints : )</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and this was the cheapest I could find it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I get too many compliments from both sexes</li>
            <li>I was totally pleased.</li>
            <li>He was thrilled... and he thinks I paid the Macy&#x27;s price ;) SCOREEE!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and the bottle is elegant and looks nice on my dresser.</li>
            <li>my husband absolutely loves it!!!!</li>
            <li>It smells pretty nice, and I see people asking me what kind of perfume I use.</li>
            <li>I like unique scents and this is unique in a good way.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that something like this cologne can smell so good.</li>
            <li>Has a very nice smell, I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for a Christmas gift, it was a success!!</li>
            <li>Was happy to  be able to buy a gift for my adult son who loves this product but didn&#x27;t want to buy for himself since he thought it was extravagant.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit warmer/sweeter, than many of the fresh colognes I own.</li>
            <li>fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li>Clean and manly!</li>
            <li>This smells amazing, that&#x27;s all I can really say…AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>I bought this to give it to my boyfriend as a gift, he really likes it, it smells really good.</li>
            <li>This is a good scent but didn&#x27;t really work that well for me.  </li>
            <li>Really like it, lots of cashiers always telling me I smell good.</li>
            <li>My son wanted this and he was impressed with the size, because when he buys it it is half the size and cost more.</li>
            <li>perfect for any guy, smells great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Like many others I got stinky cheap alcohol filled in a Gucci bottle.</li>
            <li>If I had to describe the scent I would use two words: strong and seductive!&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li>cause she will probably be put off by the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Too lingering and strong.  </li>
            <li>The product is not as strong as the samples in the department store.</li>
            <li>and it is not to strong and overbearing</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t stay strong all day</li>
            <li>Its manly but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you to buy it through a well known store.</li>
            <li>it was not that strong</li>
            <li>i strongly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re particular about smelling good and want your wife or significant others to notice how good you smell then this is certainly for you.</li>
            <li>His favorite, so I was glad to find at a more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I got the recommendation by watching a couple of videos on YouTube about the top 10 best cologne in 2011-2012 and this was recommended by at least three people in their top 5</li>
            <li>Thanks very much for the product it smells great and got it at a cheaper price ....</li>
            <li>Received the package in just a few days after ordering, great price for the product, very pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>Cologne got here quickly and my son loves it!</li>
            <li>Although it is a little costly, this was the best price.</li>
            <li>I like cologne that smells nice, unique, lasts long and smells good to others.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for daily use when dressing smart.</li>
            <li>This cologne gives a crisp clean just out of the shower smell that many women love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering either, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>If it IS a knock off, it&#x27;s accurate.</li>
            <li>Its a powerful smell, but isnt overwhelming,</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth and refined.</li>
            <li>People around me love it and there is rarely when people don&#x27;t notice or comment on it.</li>
            <li>I tested it and it is fantastic to be use either at day or night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had this aphrodisiac been available in my youth.</li>
            <li>I would say that it is worth the money, for sure.</li>
            <li>They confirmed that the samplers were stronger.  </li>
            <li>It smelled really cheap to me.</li>
            <li>If you love smelling fresh, this is the one.</li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon was fatastic with my refund.</li>
            <li>Makes the ladies come running like theres free cheesecake in your pockets.</li>
            <li>The price of 3 oz. was extremely cheap compared to getting it elsewhere like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Nice bottle though and very manly.</li>
            <li>It is a great Christmas present, too.</li>
            <li>This smells great and last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I used like 8 squirts it would last longer lol.</li>
            <li>ive had some of the hottest women ive ever met tell me just how fantastic i smell.  </li>
            <li>; Smell goes along great with my personal taste as well</li>
            <li>and that is important</li>
            <li>so you might say I would fit into that category.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>EXACT AS IN THE PICTURE!!</li>
            <li>Very clean and fresh smelling</li>
            <li>I read the reviews first and saw that many others experienced the same thing</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and amazing perfume!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stays long, great smell, geting lots of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;Recommed!&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li>While it did dry to a nice light smell that I actually liked, I don&#x27;t think this product is genuine and  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to some strong colognes and this one is super.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this very much and smells fantastic when he wears it!  </li>
            <li>This product overall had a very attracting smell, I actually love it, seeing as many women have noticed my good smell</li>
            <li>I recommend this scent to men who are trendy and classy!!</li>
            <li>so unique</li>
            <li>but this totally original</li>
            <li>Versace pour homme top every other bottle of colognes I own!</li>
            <li>The bottle is also unavailing replica of original.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>So excited for them to have it</li>
            <li>Original</li>
            <li>So fresh and so clean ladies love the smells no complaints at all thanks !!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would say sort of spicy, clean, lavender,</li>
            <li>more because of the longevity factor, but my overall fragrance is Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme because of it&#x27;s AMAZING smell.</li>
            <li>This is by far, the best smelling male cologne I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>The price was fantastic and I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it arrived.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and professional!.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what i&#x27;d recommend wearing on dates and special occasions.</li>
            <li>Smells great and has an upbeat masculine fragrance for the new millenium man!</li>
            <li>I find the best fragrances are hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved Armani Attitude but after using this I am never going back.</li>
            <li>I got a good ten hours out of this.</li>
            <li>Good enough for me -</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t find a better price for the real deal anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I personally felt misled by the good reviews for this cologne.</li>
            <li>It smells really good but slightly different from magazine.</li>
            <li>Earlier experience was good , don&#x27;t know whether this bottle has  some problem or not.</li>
            <li>It is very stable and more than him</li>
            <li>It was actually a gift to a friend, and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Bottle was leaking when I got it,and because of that leak,it wasn&#x27;t completely full...</li>
            <li>I kept commending on how good this guy at work smells and finally asked what it was.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and not over- powering.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price at all.</li>
            <li>Sought it out in a local department store and loved it, but didn&#x27;t wanna cough up the full retail price for it then.</li>
            <li>, just don&#x27;t use this around your pregnant wife</li>
            <li>It wears quickly ..</li>
            <li>, it wears off to quickly for me .. and in fact within an hour I cant smell it anymore ..</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and with out any damage.</li>
            <li>He says it seems to wear off quickly</li>
            <li>Bold without being over powering I like it for day or evening.</li>
            <li>Great cologne at a good price, still too expensive</li>
            <li>2-3 sprays seem to wear of quickly.  </li>
            <li>great buy much cheaper than the stores and is the same product</li>
            <li>But it is a very strong and lasting fragrance,too strong a fragrance for me to wear day or night.</li>
            <li>The aroma is very pleasant and quite hard after application.</li>
            <li>i bought it cause high reviews but its the name more than anything.</li>
            <li>Fragrance preference is highly subjective but I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>, overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>ITS FAST BECOMING ONE OF MY FAVORITES.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.. Smells spicy and lasts long..</li>
            <li>Smells good and the smell lasts long …</li>
            <li>The scent is really good - warm and subtle.</li>
            <li>My oldest daughter reached driving age not to long ago and one of the requirements for her license was for her to successfully change a flat tire on her own.</li>
            <li>I thought this might be his new favorite.</li>
            <li>My new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>This is with out a doubt, my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Not too musky, or sweet, but the right amount of manliness.</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet, yet masculine and is sure to attract girls of all looks, sizes, and ages.  </li>
            <li>You will fall in love with the small its so good.</li>
            <li>Not to strong and can smell it a whole room away.</li>
            <li>this perfume is great, this is the real thing, lasts all day long, dont hesitate to</li>
            <li>The smell is a spicy/sweet and somewhat strong scent, but not so much that it is overpowering by any means.  </li>
            <li>Its very Girly and strong.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this stuff, but I don&#x27;t think it lasts long enough on my skin for me to consider it a really great cologne.</li>
            <li>There is no way to guarantee that the one I got is Original and not a fake one.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gucci!!</li>
            <li>Great Perfume!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely go back and buy new items from Gucci.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very original (for being a new product).</li>
            <li>Gucci Guilty is easily the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, I just expected it to smell a little more amazing.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who is not looking for a very strong smell but a very decent and soft yet manly smell!</li>
            <li>My wife really loves the smell of it, which is, of course, important.</li>
            <li>It really does smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>Buy far my favorite summer fragrance.</li>
            <li>so I guess it was worth buying.</li>
            <li>only Nice here was the Bottle</li>
            <li>totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>It rare to find those combinations in a cologne</li>
            <li>This spray is definately worth your money and is a lot cheaper than at a department store.</li>
            <li>Took about 2 weeks to receive but was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite cologne that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try though.</li>
            <li>I would test cologne out in a store somewhere with someone to gauge how it blends with your own body chemistry since all scents react differently with each person.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy, masculine but not overpowering(doesn&#x27;t give me headache).</li>
            <li>But After 6hours it would wear out a bit and have that soft smell i love</li>
            <li>I guess some might say that it&#x27;s more of a young man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>LARGE SIZE BOTTLE IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING.</li>
            <li>Ranked better than most of the other products out there.  </li>
            <li>super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let all the you tube haters tell you other wise.</li>
            <li>My items arrived right on time  </li>

            <li>The price was just right</li>
            <li>My husbands favorite scent and the bottle is huge and has lasted a long time!</li>
            <li>I have 8 different colognes that I use and this is by far the best and longest lasting cologne.</li>
            <li>Received item a little earlier which was perfect because it was a gift.</li>
            <li>Although, I like the &amp;#34;Intense&amp;#34; more... this was exactly the same great scent I found at Dillards and for half the department store price!</li>
            <li>However, this is my least favorite fragrance that I own.</li>
            <li>Smells nice at first, but after a while it has a strange smell.  </li>
            <li>Great price for the same thing they sell in the big mall stores.</li>
            <li>It did the trick :)  Nice fragrance and long lasting, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>At first he thought that the smell goes away too quickly, but then he told me how much he loves it.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for this product.  </li>
            <li>It gives a fresh, clean, but masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>Received product on time, great price, the only negative remark I have about my order is that it is not as strong as I thought it would be, in fact, once I got my order, I sprayed several sprays ( neck, chest, wrists) and came downstairs to try and pass the gf test to see if she liked it</li>
            <li>one smells strong, but 5 sprays disappears quick and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>When it arrived today (exactly on time)</li>
            <li>Smelled this at Macy&#x27;s and fell in love with it, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the big box store price.  </li>
            <li>My female co-workers love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its&#x27; definitely a quality fragrance, probably more for an evening out.  Not a casual scent</li>
            <li>Smells great, smell last all dAy long.</li>
            <li>WILL DEFINITELY BUY MORE.</li>
            <li>Has a great scent with long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>The first day I throw it on to run to the grocery store</li>
            <li>Gucci guilty is in my top three best smelling, longest lasting, panty dropping sprays.</li>
            <li>In the future I will play it safe and get my cologne from a department store.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>a bottle for his birthday arrived exactly on time</li>
            <li>his first bottle costed me 100 dollars from a retail store.</li>
            <li>Gucci Guilty is a great value!</li>
            <li>ok have only had a couple of comments not what I was hoping for</li>
            <li>I bought this when it first came out at a Dillard&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I know exactly how it smells.</li>
            <li>I recently took my daughter to Ulta to have her hair done and like many fathers who go to that store and wait for their wives or daughters to finish</li>
            <li>;-]</li>
            <li>Shipped extremely fast too!</li>
            <li>Great fragrance with a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas present for a family member who fell in love with the scent and the beauty of the bottle</li>
            <li>the smell doesn&#x27;t last and for the price I paid for this I could have gotten something that I love him to wear.</li>
            <li>Not only did I love it</li>
            <li>Not a fake</li>
            <li>Read about this when it first came out,and now i see what the fuss is about......</li>
            <li>When I first smelled this cologne, I knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li>Not only do men love it</li>
            <li>First off, I am not one to write product reviews.</li>
            <li>The product smells EXACTLY like it did in the store.</li>
            <li>However, the cologne smell goes entirly away after the first hour.</li>
            <li>I have to say that it always get to me fast, its the right item</li>
            <li>Smells good, but not strong at all.</li>
            <li>I you like the clean smell but not heavy perfume, it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white male 6&#x27;0 tall 195 lbs fairly built</li>
            <li>I purchased previously and I always wanted more!  </li>
            <li>Long lasting pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Real not a fake.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very subjective, so I&#x27;d recommend you try it at a dept store first.</li>
            <li>yes ok what did he do it as long as I don&#x27;t suck everyone today</li>
            <li>The scent lasts a long time on me and doesn&#x27;t require more than a squirt or two.</li>
            <li>I received it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything from the box, to the way it&#x27;s packaged, and the usually amazing smell is so watered down and disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I have already contacted Amazon to take this item down as they are selling it under their own name.</li>
            <li>mine is authentic, lasts a very long time on my skin, buy from a trusted seller like FRAGRANCENET and avoid getting counterfeit products.</li>
            <li>The scent smells like a crisp fresh masculine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for all occassions and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Smell good, but scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but the scent does not seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>Very masculine and sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li>While I did not try the department store sample of this perfume, I&#x27;ve used enough fine fragrances to know when I&#x27;m getting a six for a nine.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;ve never smelled anything like it!  </li>
            <li>this is one of the best colognes our there, the bottle comes with a little bit missing but it is as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Intense was also a very very good scent but guilty topped it, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice sweet smell, but is not bitter or sugary (candy) smelling, and it still has that little something that tells you</li>
            <li>The item smells amazing for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Wear it everyday and the bottle looks amazing too</li>
            <li>It is a gentle but intense perfume, really recommend not regret.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, for me at least, women like it.  </li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I bought it for a friend of mine he really loves it</li>
            <li>he said he can&#x27;t keep the women off of him and he doesn&#x27;t have to use that much of it</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very disapointed.</li>
            <li>I bought Gucci for men as a gift for my son-in-law it was asked for by name, this he will not return thanks Gucci</li>
            <li>I think I lucked out and received the real deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Should have gone with the Intense.</li>
            <li>I bought this item through Amazon thinking that since it is from Amazon it will be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I got it for my fiance&#x27;s Christmas and he absolutely loves it................</li>
            <li>Online really helped.</li>
            <li>really all I care about,</li>
            <li>Gucci really did make this product stand out from the comp</li>
            <li>my wants it&#x27;s even better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>3 Ounces ought to keep you going for the whole year.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loves how this smells.</li>
            <li>and he really like it.</li>
            <li>Intense.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the whole point,</li>
            <li>I really recommend it</li>
            <li>The product was delivered promptly,the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I choose because the price was very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was the real deal.</li>
            <li>It was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>I really like it plenty of compliment&lt;</li>
            <li>Absolutely, I  recommended.</li>
            <li>THANKS..</li>
            <li>They really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was the real thing</li>
            <li>Its the real thing.</li>
            <li>After I received the cologne I noticed that it didn&#x27;t really smell like it did in the magazine</li>
            <li>Anyway, I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>Smells too much like medicine or something.</li>
            <li>Smell nice just for few hours then evaporate</li>
            <li>Cologne smells really good and not that expensive for such nice smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>its like being in a night club in New Jersey, but full of 40 year old sweaty men trying to attract women by showering in cologne.</li>
            <li>my husband loves this perfume and especially the price and fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>I get more compliments and questions when I wear this than with any other fragrance.</li>
            <li>but I love this product, the smell isn&#x27;t too strong, and it isn&#x27;t too weak, but it lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li>Smell nice but doesn&#x27;t last long......</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Guilty Black in my opinion but good.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of Cool Water a little, if you&#x27;re familiar with that.  </li>
            <li>The price online was a really good deal, half of what they charge at Belk and the size was bigger!</li>
            <li>but this one I bought on Amazon is nowhere near the first on I bought at the mall.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly as usually and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>I was in Macy&#x27;s the other day smelling colognes because I wanted to find that one new scent that I just love.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try out a new smell.</li>
            <li>It is such a clean and fresh scent that last all day.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would point out is that you have to do more than one spray if you want it to last all day.</li>
            <li>, now I&#x27;ve purchased it from here, it didn&#x27;t hold the scent as long as it did when I got it from the department store, maybe because it&#x27;s been sitting too long in a warm temperature or something.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I gave her a quick visual of where the equ⋯⋯</li>
            <li>Gucci, italian brand that represent better than anyone the creativity, the genius of the italian high fashion.  </li>
            <li>After the first 45 min or so, the fragrance settles down and smells so incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent will really kick back in at the right moment if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li>Received this for Christmas and I must say that I cannot understand why men or women rate this high.  </li>
            <li>Highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for a gift.</li>
            <li>I had been getting this cologne from Sephora, but the price was too high</li>
            <li>it was highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly Recommened.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,Leo.</li>
            <li>I came across this because of the high reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I was highly upset.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I absolutely highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I absoluty love it, spray just a little bit on before you go out.</li>
            <li>Its cool, comfortable to wear for someone like myself who&#x27;s so active at work and daily life.</li>
            <li>I would be more willing to believe this explanation since I believe the fragrance itself would be hard to duplicate in some \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li>Guilty by Gucci is one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve smeeled in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t get it because a few of the reviews weren&#x27;t so flattering, but I&#x27;m so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li>It makes him smell so sexy and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a long lasting scent that&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The only way  to smell it at all would be to put your nose right up to it.</li>
            <li>Guilty by Gucci is by far the best scent I&#x27;ve found in a long time....</li>
            <li>, I think I found my new signature scent and will keep to this</li>
            <li>But, I had just received a new Details magazine, and was browsing through the pages...  </li>
            <li>my friend told me about it, so I got it just to try something new.</li>
            <li>so I new</li>
            <li>I searched around the internet and found a brand new tester bottle for $48.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a new cologne, so I bought it on the amazon app.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and subtle but extremely masculine!</li>
            <li>- Goes on a bit strong at first, but that just means you can use less and make it last.</li>
            <li>not bad a little to sweet of a smell for men,also very generic smell reminds me of cologne from the 90&#x27;s like ck or tommy</li>
            <li>i usually never buy cologne over 20 bucks but one should treat themself sometimes if it means smelling like a million bucks.</li>
            <li>You know, considering the big GUCCI label ;)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not the same one when I smelled at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The bottle is exactly the same with a cap.</li>
            <li>On time as usual, nice if you want to smell different than everyone wearing Aqua Dijo.</li>
            <li>I thought that I had already left positive feedback.</li>
            <li>This is fairly new and it really smells terrific on him.  </li>
            <li>It has a long lasting smell and worth the price!</li>
            <li>I believe some other reviewers stated the scent wears off quickly, all you need to do is ...apply heat, if you will.</li>
            <li>3 stars because mine came in a clearly opened box, it looked like it was all there, but still, for what you pay I&#x27;d  like a sealed package.</li>
            <li>but I do because it helps the scent last much longer.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated, so you&#x27;ll want to spray once, and only once.</li>
            <li>The package was completely sealed, no problem there.</li>
            <li>He kept telling me how he loved the Guilty by Gucci smell</li>
            <li>The other cologne I use is Versace Pour Homme, which is much stronger and lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li>It was first offered to me by me kid sister during 2011 Xmas and since then, I have fallen in love with Gucci Guilty.</li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing and not too heavy, but it also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically not a fan of the &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; smelling colognes...</li>
            <li>and I know it very well after having used it for so long.  </li>
            <li>kinda little different which i bought from store, but doesnt matter cuz of this cheap price</li>
            <li>If your looking for that new signature scent, trust me, look no further!</li>
            <li>The scent does last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>am returning this back to Amazon and will make the proper investment and buy the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Guilty by Gucci for men is definitely a unique smell, it’s very soft and crisp.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance itself, but it&#x27;s so weak that I find myself re-applying throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This is a knockoff that is made of weak oils and probably mostly water.</li>
            <li>this guilty by gucci is amazing</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely divine and lasts a long time when it is rubbed onto clothes, when I put my leather jacket on the next day it still smelt like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected after smelling a fragrance sample in one of the magazines that we regularly get.</li>
            <li>only downside to this product was that it was a bit to strong for my taste, i like subtle, soft smells.</li>
            <li>Guilty is a nice cologne.</li>
            <li>I figured that this would be my favorite new scent, but it&#x27;s really faint.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon, way less expensive than your department store prices in Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s, etc.</li>
            <li>My overall impression would be &amp;#34;smells nice when you&#x27;re not the one wearing it.&amp;#34; This is a casual fragrance, however I would not recommend wearing it to work.</li>
            <li>Guilty by Gucci does smell good but unfortunately does not smell very strongly and does not last very long.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new cologne and was always curious about this.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s not Long Lasting</li>
            <li>My only gripe is this: The top of this bottle seals poorly and it leaks slightly, which was a concern during shipment and may be a concern if you plan on traveling with it - sitting upright on the shelf and for everyday use other than that it seems fine.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, but tread carefully when buying this stuff because if you spend $50+ on cologne that turns out to be fake</li>

            <li> Men&#x27; perfume used to be nice.</li>
            <li> Smelled so good on my fianc&amp;eacute; she loved it good amount for the right price .</li>
            <li> love love love this cologne!!</li>
            <li> This was a great transaction, great communication, fast shipping, would surely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this cologne, its very sexy.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, new in box and smells amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> great product and most importantly</li>
            <li> its okay not my top 10!</li>
            <li> :) Love it!</li>
            <li> While wearing this, i got many compliments saying i smelled nice.</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of the best on the market as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li> IT IS THE BEST SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but the scent doesn&#x27;t hold for more than 3 hours if that.  </li>
            <li> I have already used all of this and need to order some more, i liked the deal and it was cheaper then buying from Macys</li>
            <li> Perfect cologne for a 22 year old guy, and you can&#x27;t find it cheaper.</li>
            <li> I honestly have over 50 bottles of cologne and this is def top 10.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the man who likes to smell good, but doesn&#x27;t want the scent to arrive before him or stay long after he&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> the outfit of this perfume looks exact as it shows on the image, and the smell is good though it is not as good as I thought before.</li>
            <li> This cologne is more on the sweet side rather than a spicy note but never-the-less a great scent.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time, it was good and smelled good.</li>
            <li> I love it and so did my Fiance, may be my most favorite scent ever!</li>
            <li> It was the real thing and he loved it!</li>
            <li> New fragrance is very interesting and special for all men.&lt;br /&gt;Gucci is still the best fragrance for me .</li>
            <li> Smells great, the price was good...and my girlfriend finally finds me attractive.  </li>
            <li> Armani is more of an elegant kind of cologne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great masculine cologne; product pricing was good.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne, great smell and lasting.</li>
            <li> Two sprays for a 16 hour day (one every eight hours if I had to try to be exact), which in my opinion is great quality.</li>
            <li> it is just the perfect combination gentle but powerful!</li>
            <li> I saw all the great reviews for this product and was extremely interested.</li>
            <li> First off, fragrance is authentic and was in authentic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, really great scent.</li>
            <li> Well, it does smell very good, sexy even, but I could not smell it 10 minutes after he put it on, even putting my nose directly against him</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> It is not my favorite</li>
            <li> I have ordered this many times now.</li>
            <li> Authentic.</li>
            <li> Receive many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> ITS OK</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> and I love it also :-)</li>
            <li> scent lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent and just had to buy a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous ordering cologne from Amazon since there are so many reviews stating that they received knock off fragrances.</li>
            <li> It is clearly my favorite.</li>
            <li> its trying to be too many things at once.  </li>
            <li> He has been wearing it every day now and has received many comments about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I simply love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i bet a cheaper fragrance smells better than this One</li>
            <li> was way more than Amazon s price.</li>
            <li> It simply Smells wonderful on!</li>
            <li> My most favorite cologne to smell on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> After getting scammed on e-bay I came to the online store I trust (amazon) and this product appears to be authentic.</li>
            <li> Either way great fragrance, just make sure you get a real one.</li>
            <li> Cost more in the shopping mall.</li>
            <li> I would purchase more at that price</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It smells so fabulous!</li>
            <li> and i did and priced well &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> and i thinkyoull love it  when you buy bay bigest bottle because youll get lots compliments</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and smells great.</li>
            <li> He was quite pleased that I was able to purchase this for him.</li>
            <li> This is probably the longest lasting best smelling manly cologne I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I love the brand as it is, now that this smell matches</li>
            <li> This is for sure something you wear for evenings/meetings.  </li>
            <li> Some colognes have that &#x27;day time&#x27; smell, this is more of an evening smell.  </li>
            <li> The girls love it and know it by the aroma.</li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> Most everyone likes it.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne these days</li>
            <li> I love this spray for men.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this one and we haven&#x27;t been able to find something that smells better.  </li>
            <li> Drops more drawers than an Ikea warehouse.  </li>
            <li> I love this on my husband.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m GLAD</li>
            <li> I research to make sure I was paying what I wanted to pay for it.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne I reordered my husband</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting more once I run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not my favorite scent my husband has</li>
            <li> But I like it anyway, smells sexy</li>
            <li> Still love it.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, it lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing exotic in my opinion</li>
            <li> He loves it, I love it.</li>
            <li> Item is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> Since I began wearing this cologne I have had many complements and the ladies love it.</li>
            <li> Women LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li> i give it 5stars because my husband love it</li>
            <li> but he was ok with it and kept it..</li>
            <li> And i thoroughly am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> more cowbell.</li>
            <li> its ok I wear this when I go to work or just hanging out with my buddies</li>
            <li> and I like that much better.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> The price was outstanding.</li>
            <li> WAS A GIFT , HE LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Was worried because I wasn&#x27;t really sure</li>
            <li> Smells lovely.. will buy from again.</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T SURE WHAT IT WOULD SMELL LIKE.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t give it more then 3 stars</li>
            <li> The scent and the packaging are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda like you put on an okay cologne and then huffed a bag of Lemon Pledge.</li>
            <li> But then again, Armani isn&#x27;t doing anything better nowadays.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WAY THAT IT SMELLS</li>
            <li> My husband lodes this perfume, but I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the one inside of the mall smells much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I love the scent on him too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I didn&#x27;t try it out, but my friend loves it. :)</li>
            <li> and we both love the smell.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this cologne.</li>
            <li> I must say that most people that do not like this fragrence must not comment.</li>
            <li> Never disappoints : )</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and this was the cheapest I could find it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> I get too many compliments from both sexes</li>
            <li> I was totally pleased.</li>
            <li> He was thrilled... and he thinks I paid the Macy&#x27;s price ;) SCOREEE!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and the bottle is elegant and looks nice on my dresser.</li>
            <li> my husband absolutely loves it!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells pretty nice, and I see people asking me what kind of perfume I use.</li>
            <li> I like unique scents and this is unique in a good way.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that something like this cologne can smell so good.</li>
            <li> Has a very nice smell, I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a Christmas gift, it was a success!!</li>
            <li> Was happy to  be able to buy a gift for my adult son who loves this product but didn&#x27;t want to buy for himself since he thought it was extravagant.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit warmer/sweeter, than many of the fresh colognes I own.</li>
            <li> fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li> Clean and manly!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, that&#x27;s all I can really say…AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to give it to my boyfriend as a gift, he really likes it, it smells really good.</li>
            <li> This is a good scent but didn&#x27;t really work that well for me.  </li>
            <li> Really like it, lots of cashiers always telling me I smell good.</li>
            <li> My son wanted this and he was impressed with the size, because when he buys it it is half the size and cost more.</li>
            <li> perfect for any guy, smells great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Like many others I got stinky cheap alcohol filled in a Gucci bottle.</li>
            <li> If I had to describe the scent I would use two words: strong and seductive!&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li> cause she will probably be put off by the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Too lingering and strong.  </li>
            <li> The product is not as strong as the samples in the department store.</li>
            <li> and it is not to strong and overbearing</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t stay strong all day</li>
            <li> Its manly but not too strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you to buy it through a well known store.</li>
            <li> it was not that strong</li>
            <li> i strongly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re particular about smelling good and want your wife or significant others to notice how good you smell then this is certainly for you.</li>
            <li> His favorite, so I was glad to find at a more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I got the recommendation by watching a couple of videos on YouTube about the top 10 best cologne in 2011-2012 and this was recommended by at least three people in their top 5</li>
            <li> Thanks very much for the product it smells great and got it at a cheaper price ....</li>
            <li> Received the package in just a few days after ordering, great price for the product, very pleased with this.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> Cologne got here quickly and my son loves it!</li>
            <li> Although it is a little costly, this was the best price.</li>
            <li> I like cologne that smells nice, unique, lasts long and smells good to others.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s perfect for daily use when dressing smart.</li>
            <li> This cologne gives a crisp clean just out of the shower smell that many women love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering either, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> If it IS a knock off, it&#x27;s accurate.</li>
            <li> Its a powerful smell, but isnt overwhelming,</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth and refined.</li>
            <li> People around me love it and there is rarely when people don&#x27;t notice or comment on it.</li>
            <li> I tested it and it is fantastic to be use either at day or night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had this aphrodisiac been available in my youth.</li>
            <li> I would say that it is worth the money, for sure.</li>
            <li> They confirmed that the samplers were stronger.  </li>
            <li> It smelled really cheap to me.</li>
            <li> If you love smelling fresh, this is the one.</li>
            <li> Fortunately Amazon was fatastic with my refund.</li>
            <li> Makes the ladies come running like theres free cheesecake in your pockets.</li>
            <li> The price of 3 oz. was extremely cheap compared to getting it elsewhere like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle though and very manly.</li>
            <li> It is a great Christmas present, too.</li>
            <li> This smells great and last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I used like 8 squirts it would last longer lol.</li>
            <li> ive had some of the hottest women ive ever met tell me just how fantastic i smell.  </li>
            <li> ; Smell goes along great with my personal taste as well</li>
            <li> and that is important</li>
            <li> so you might say I would fit into that category.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> EXACT AS IN THE PICTURE!!</li>
            <li> Very clean and fresh smelling</li>
            <li> I read the reviews first and saw that many others experienced the same thing</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and amazing perfume!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stays long, great smell, geting lots of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;Recommed!&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li> While it did dry to a nice light smell that I actually liked, I don&#x27;t think this product is genuine and  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to some strong colognes and this one is super.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this very much and smells fantastic when he wears it!  </li>
            <li> This product overall had a very attracting smell, I actually love it, seeing as many women have noticed my good smell</li>
            <li> I recommend this scent to men who are trendy and classy!!</li>
            <li> so unique</li>
            <li> but this totally original</li>
            <li> Versace pour homme top every other bottle of colognes I own!</li>
            <li> The bottle is also unavailing replica of original.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> So excited for them to have it</li>
            <li> Original</li>
            <li> So fresh and so clean ladies love the smells no complaints at all thanks !!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would say sort of spicy, clean, lavender,</li>
            <li> more because of the longevity factor, but my overall fragrance is Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme because of it&#x27;s AMAZING smell.</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best smelling male cologne I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li> The price was fantastic and I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it arrived.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and professional!.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what i&#x27;d recommend wearing on dates and special occasions.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has an upbeat masculine fragrance for the new millenium man!</li>
            <li> I find the best fragrances are hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved Armani Attitude but after using this I am never going back.</li>
            <li> I got a good ten hours out of this.</li>
            <li> Good enough for me -</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t find a better price for the real deal anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I personally felt misled by the good reviews for this cologne.</li>
            <li> It smells really good but slightly different from magazine.</li>
            <li> Earlier experience was good , don&#x27;t know whether this bottle has  some problem or not.</li>
            <li> It is very stable and more than him</li>
            <li> It was actually a gift to a friend, and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Bottle was leaking when I got it,and because of that leak,it wasn&#x27;t completely full...</li>
            <li> I kept commending on how good this guy at work smells and finally asked what it was.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and not over- powering.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price at all.</li>
            <li> Sought it out in a local department store and loved it, but didn&#x27;t wanna cough up the full retail price for it then.</li>
            <li> , just don&#x27;t use this around your pregnant wife</li>
            <li> It wears quickly ..</li>
            <li> , it wears off to quickly for me .. and in fact within an hour I cant smell it anymore ..</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and with out any damage.</li>
            <li> He says it seems to wear off quickly</li>
            <li> Bold without being over powering I like it for day or evening.</li>
            <li> Great cologne at a good price, still too expensive</li>
            <li> 2-3 sprays seem to wear of quickly.  </li>
            <li> great buy much cheaper than the stores and is the same product</li>
            <li> But it is a very strong and lasting fragrance,too strong a fragrance for me to wear day or night.</li>
            <li> The aroma is very pleasant and quite hard after application.</li>
            <li> i bought it cause high reviews but its the name more than anything.</li>
            <li> Fragrance preference is highly subjective but I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> , overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> ITS FAST BECOMING ONE OF MY FAVORITES.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.. Smells spicy and lasts long..</li>
            <li> Smells good and the smell lasts long …</li>
            <li> The scent is really good - warm and subtle.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter reached driving age not to long ago and one of the requirements for her license was for her to successfully change a flat tire on her own.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be his new favorite.</li>
            <li> My new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> This is with out a doubt, my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Not too musky, or sweet, but the right amount of manliness.</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet, yet masculine and is sure to attract girls of all looks, sizes, and ages.  </li>
            <li> You will fall in love with the small its so good.</li>
            <li> Not to strong and can smell it a whole room away.</li>
            <li> this perfume is great, this is the real thing, lasts all day long, dont hesitate to</li>
            <li> The smell is a spicy/sweet and somewhat strong scent, but not so much that it is overpowering by any means.  </li>
            <li> Its very Girly and strong.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this stuff, but I don&#x27;t think it lasts long enough on my skin for me to consider it a really great cologne.</li>
            <li> There is no way to guarantee that the one I got is Original and not a fake one.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gucci!!</li>
            <li> Great Perfume!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely go back and buy new items from Gucci.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very original (for being a new product).</li>
            <li> Gucci Guilty is easily the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, I just expected it to smell a little more amazing.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who is not looking for a very strong smell but a very decent and soft yet manly smell!</li>
            <li> My wife really loves the smell of it, which is, of course, important.</li>
            <li> It really does smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> Buy far my favorite summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> so I guess it was worth buying.</li>
            <li> only Nice here was the Bottle</li>
            <li> totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> It rare to find those combinations in a cologne</li>
            <li> This spray is definately worth your money and is a lot cheaper than at a department store.</li>
            <li> Took about 2 weeks to receive but was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite cologne that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try though.</li>
            <li> I would test cologne out in a store somewhere with someone to gauge how it blends with your own body chemistry since all scents react differently with each person.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sexy, masculine but not overpowering(doesn&#x27;t give me headache).</li>
            <li> But After 6hours it would wear out a bit and have that soft smell i love</li>
            <li> I guess some might say that it&#x27;s more of a young man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> LARGE SIZE BOTTLE IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING.</li>
            <li> Ranked better than most of the other products out there.  </li>
            <li> super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let all the you tube haters tell you other wise.</li>
            <li> My items arrived right on time  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> The price was just right</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite scent and the bottle is huge and has lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> I have 8 different colognes that I use and this is by far the best and longest lasting cologne.</li>
            <li> Received item a little earlier which was perfect because it was a gift.</li>
            <li> Although, I like the &amp;#34;Intense&amp;#34; more... this was exactly the same great scent I found at Dillards and for half the department store price!</li>
            <li> However, this is my least favorite fragrance that I own.</li>
            <li> Smells nice at first, but after a while it has a strange smell.  </li>
            <li> Great price for the same thing they sell in the big mall stores.</li>
            <li> It did the trick :)  Nice fragrance and long lasting, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> At first he thought that the smell goes away too quickly, but then he told me how much he loves it.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for this product.  </li>
            <li> It gives a fresh, clean, but masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> Received product on time, great price, the only negative remark I have about my order is that it is not as strong as I thought it would be, in fact, once I got my order, I sprayed several sprays ( neck, chest, wrists) and came downstairs to try and pass the gf test to see if she liked it</li>
            <li> one smells strong, but 5 sprays disappears quick and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and it arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> When it arrived today (exactly on time)</li>
            <li> Smelled this at Macy&#x27;s and fell in love with it, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the big box store price.  </li>
            <li> My female co-workers love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its&#x27; definitely a quality fragrance, probably more for an evening out.  Not a casual scent</li>
            <li> Smells great, smell last all dAy long.</li>
            <li> WILL DEFINITELY BUY MORE.</li>
            <li> Has a great scent with long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> The first day I throw it on to run to the grocery store</li>
            <li> Gucci guilty is in my top three best smelling, longest lasting, panty dropping sprays.</li>
            <li> In the future I will play it safe and get my cologne from a department store.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> a bottle for his birthday arrived exactly on time</li>
            <li> his first bottle costed me 100 dollars from a retail store.</li>
            <li> Gucci Guilty is a great value!</li>
            <li> ok have only had a couple of comments not what I was hoping for</li>
            <li> I bought this when it first came out at a Dillard&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I know exactly how it smells.</li>
            <li> I recently took my daughter to Ulta to have her hair done and like many fathers who go to that store and wait for their wives or daughters to finish</li>
            <li> ;-]</li>
            <li> Shipped extremely fast too!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance with a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for a family member who fell in love with the scent and the beauty of the bottle</li>
            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last and for the price I paid for this I could have gotten something that I love him to wear.</li>
            <li> Not only did I love it</li>
            <li> Not a fake</li>
            <li> Read about this when it first came out,and now i see what the fuss is about......</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this cologne, I knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li> Not only do men love it</li>
            <li> First off, I am not one to write product reviews.</li>
            <li> The product smells EXACTLY like it did in the store.</li>
            <li> However, the cologne smell goes entirly away after the first hour.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it always get to me fast, its the right item</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I you like the clean smell but not heavy perfume, it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white male 6&#x27;0 tall 195 lbs fairly built</li>
            <li> I purchased previously and I always wanted more!  </li>
            <li> Long lasting pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Real not a fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very subjective, so I&#x27;d recommend you try it at a dept store first.</li>
            <li> yes ok what did he do it as long as I don&#x27;t suck everyone today</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time on me and doesn&#x27;t require more than a squirt or two.</li>
            <li> I received it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything from the box, to the way it&#x27;s packaged, and the usually amazing smell is so watered down and disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I have already contacted Amazon to take this item down as they are selling it under their own name.</li>
            <li> mine is authentic, lasts a very long time on my skin, buy from a trusted seller like FRAGRANCENET and avoid getting counterfeit products.</li>
            <li> The scent smells like a crisp fresh masculine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for all occassions and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Smell good, but scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> Smells good but the scent does not seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Very masculine and sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li> While I did not try the department store sample of this perfume, I&#x27;ve used enough fine fragrances to know when I&#x27;m getting a six for a nine.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve never smelled anything like it!  </li>
            <li> this is one of the best colognes our there, the bottle comes with a little bit missing but it is as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Intense was also a very very good scent but guilty topped it, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice sweet smell, but is not bitter or sugary (candy) smelling, and it still has that little something that tells you</li>
            <li> The item smells amazing for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Wear it everyday and the bottle looks amazing too</li>
            <li> It is a gentle but intense perfume, really recommend not regret.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, for me at least, women like it.  </li>
            <li> This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend of mine he really loves it</li>
            <li> he said he can&#x27;t keep the women off of him and he doesn&#x27;t have to use that much of it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I bought Gucci for men as a gift for my son-in-law it was asked for by name, this he will not return thanks Gucci</li>
            <li> I think I lucked out and received the real deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Should have gone with the Intense.</li>
            <li> I bought this item through Amazon thinking that since it is from Amazon it will be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I got it for my fiance&#x27;s Christmas and he absolutely loves it................</li>
            <li> Online really helped.</li>
            <li> really all I care about,</li>
            <li> Gucci really did make this product stand out from the comp</li>
            <li> my wants it&#x27;s even better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> 3 Ounces ought to keep you going for the whole year.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loves how this smells.</li>
            <li> and he really like it.</li>
            <li> Intense.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the whole point,</li>
            <li> I really recommend it</li>
            <li> The product was delivered promptly,the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I choose because the price was very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was the real deal.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> I really like it plenty of compliment&lt;</li>
            <li> Absolutely, I  recommended.</li>
            <li> THANKS..</li>
            <li> They really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was the real thing</li>
            <li> Its the real thing.</li>
            <li> After I received the cologne I noticed that it didn&#x27;t really smell like it did in the magazine</li>
            <li> Anyway, I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> Smells too much like medicine or something.</li>
            <li> Smell nice just for few hours then evaporate</li>
            <li> Cologne smells really good and not that expensive for such nice smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> its like being in a night club in New Jersey, but full of 40 year old sweaty men trying to attract women by showering in cologne.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this perfume and especially the price and fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I get more compliments and questions when I wear this than with any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> but I love this product, the smell isn&#x27;t too strong, and it isn&#x27;t too weak, but it lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li> Smell nice but doesn&#x27;t last long......</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Guilty Black in my opinion but good.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of Cool Water a little, if you&#x27;re familiar with that.  </li>
            <li> The price online was a really good deal, half of what they charge at Belk and the size was bigger!</li>
            <li> but this one I bought on Amazon is nowhere near the first on I bought at the mall.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly as usually and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I was in Macy&#x27;s the other day smelling colognes because I wanted to find that one new scent that I just love.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try out a new smell.</li>
            <li> It is such a clean and fresh scent that last all day.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would point out is that you have to do more than one spray if you want it to last all day.</li>
            <li> , now I&#x27;ve purchased it from here, it didn&#x27;t hold the scent as long as it did when I got it from the department store, maybe because it&#x27;s been sitting too long in a warm temperature or something.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I gave her a quick visual of where the equ⋯⋯</li>
            <li> Gucci, italian brand that represent better than anyone the creativity, the genius of the italian high fashion.  </li>
            <li> After the first 45 min or so, the fragrance settles down and smells so incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent will really kick back in at the right moment if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li> Received this for Christmas and I must say that I cannot understand why men or women rate this high.  </li>
            <li> Highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for a gift.</li>
            <li> I had been getting this cologne from Sephora, but the price was too high</li>
            <li> it was highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly Recommened.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,Leo.</li>
            <li> I came across this because of the high reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> I was highly upset.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I absolutely highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absoluty love it, spray just a little bit on before you go out.</li>
            <li> Its cool, comfortable to wear for someone like myself who&#x27;s so active at work and daily life.</li>
            <li> I would be more willing to believe this explanation since I believe the fragrance itself would be hard to duplicate in some \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li> Guilty by Gucci is one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve smeeled in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t get it because a few of the reviews weren&#x27;t so flattering, but I&#x27;m so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> It makes him smell so sexy and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long lasting scent that&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The only way  to smell it at all would be to put your nose right up to it.</li>
            <li> Guilty by Gucci is by far the best scent I&#x27;ve found in a long time....</li>
            <li> , I think I found my new signature scent and will keep to this</li>
            <li> But, I had just received a new Details magazine, and was browsing through the pages...  </li>
            <li> my friend told me about it, so I got it just to try something new.</li>
            <li> so I new</li>
            <li> I searched around the internet and found a brand new tester bottle for $48.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a new cologne, so I bought it on the amazon app.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and subtle but extremely masculine!</li>
            <li> - Goes on a bit strong at first, but that just means you can use less and make it last.</li>
            <li> not bad a little to sweet of a smell for men,also very generic smell reminds me of cologne from the 90&#x27;s like ck or tommy</li>
            <li> i usually never buy cologne over 20 bucks but one should treat themself sometimes if it means smelling like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> You know, considering the big GUCCI label ;)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not the same one when I smelled at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The bottle is exactly the same with a cap.</li>
            <li> On time as usual, nice if you want to smell different than everyone wearing Aqua Dijo.</li>
            <li> I thought that I had already left positive feedback.</li>
            <li> This is fairly new and it really smells terrific on him.  </li>
            <li> It has a long lasting smell and worth the price!</li>
            <li> I believe some other reviewers stated the scent wears off quickly, all you need to do is ...apply heat, if you will.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because mine came in a clearly opened box, it looked like it was all there, but still, for what you pay I&#x27;d  like a sealed package.</li>
            <li> but I do because it helps the scent last much longer.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated, so you&#x27;ll want to spray once, and only once.</li>
            <li> The package was completely sealed, no problem there.</li>
            <li> He kept telling me how he loved the Guilty by Gucci smell</li>
            <li> The other cologne I use is Versace Pour Homme, which is much stronger and lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li> It was first offered to me by me kid sister during 2011 Xmas and since then, I have fallen in love with Gucci Guilty.</li>
            <li> The smell is refreshing and not too heavy, but it also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically not a fan of the &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; smelling colognes...</li>
            <li> and I know it very well after having used it for so long.  </li>
            <li> kinda little different which i bought from store, but doesnt matter cuz of this cheap price</li>
            <li> If your looking for that new signature scent, trust me, look no further!</li>
            <li> The scent does last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> am returning this back to Amazon and will make the proper investment and buy the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Guilty by Gucci for men is definitely a unique smell, it’s very soft and crisp.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance itself, but it&#x27;s so weak that I find myself re-applying throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff that is made of weak oils and probably mostly water.</li>
            <li> this guilty by gucci is amazing</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely divine and lasts a long time when it is rubbed onto clothes, when I put my leather jacket on the next day it still smelt like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected after smelling a fragrance sample in one of the magazines that we regularly get.</li>
            <li> only downside to this product was that it was a bit to strong for my taste, i like subtle, soft smells.</li>
            <li> Guilty is a nice cologne.</li>
            <li> I figured that this would be my favorite new scent, but it&#x27;s really faint.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon, way less expensive than your department store prices in Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s, etc.</li>
            <li> My overall impression would be &amp;#34;smells nice when you&#x27;re not the one wearing it.&amp;#34; This is a casual fragrance, however I would not recommend wearing it to work.</li>
            <li> Guilty by Gucci does smell good but unfortunately does not smell very strongly and does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new cologne and was always curious about this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s not Long Lasting</li>
            <li> My only gripe is this: The top of this bottle seals poorly and it leaks slightly, which was a concern during shipment and may be a concern if you plan on traveling with it - sitting upright on the shelf and for everyday use other than that it seems fine.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, but tread carefully when buying this stuff because if you spend $50+ on cologne that turns out to be fake</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not good either.</li>
            <li> This cologne doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as others I&#x27;ve used; I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s right for my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, combining on your face and old spice spray under the pits, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This smells like bug spray right out of the box, it sprays on in a heavy squirt of water that literally runs down your skin.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long on my guy&#x27;s body</li>
            <li> The smell last ALL day long.  </li>
            <li> I have used colognes for YEARS, and this scent  last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of a long lasting manly fragrance.</li>
            <li> He says it doesn&#x27;t last as long as YSL one.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Lasts long but the price is little bit high.</li>
            <li> is my new go-to cologne for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last on skin very long.</li>
            <li> It smells just the way it should and the scent lasted about the same length of time as his previous (100% authentic) bottle of Gucci Guilty.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted to order the Guilty Black, which is my favorite, and ordered this.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;ve found your scent, you usually don&#x27;t stray, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying any cologne off online reviews, but I would highly recommend buying them there.</li>
            <li> Perfume smells weird and does not seem GENUINE.</li>
            <li> , I cant wait that long to smell it again.</li>
            <li> I put the cologne on in the morning and the scent stays with me for a long, long time throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> natoyaschiy smell lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Everyone loves the smell of this stuff, and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this than when I rock Tom Ford and is is quite a bit less expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hubby is getting lucky later, and he didn&#x27;t even have to wear it.</li>
            <li> Another explanation which is reasonable is that the samplers are stronger than the bottled product - I mean they are located at the point of sale.  </li>
            <li> Lasts just as long too!</li>
            <li> I love Guilty By Gucci EDT spray for Men, 3 Ounce!</li>
            <li> was back a Dillard&#x27;s on other business and discussed this matter with the sales person.  </li>
            <li> it even arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Actually I had never purchased this fragrance, I saw comments from other buyers</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time on my skin, I do not recommend spraying on clothing.</li>
            <li> It even made my throat dry.</li>
            <li> and it also smells like a cologne that I had back in the late 80&#x27;s or early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and it seems to last longer than my previous one from Nautica.</li>
            <li> I pulled out my phone and scanned the barcode on the package and found the same size bottle on Amazon for half of the price as Ulta and bought it immediately.</li>
            <li> but it only lasts like a half hour.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of some other cologne I smelled long before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I TRY AND NOT ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> The box shows wear and tear where it had been opened and closed repeatedly.</li>
            <li> ,, i just wasted my Money i would pay only 10 Dollars for this stuff</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays to keep the scent on you for almost the entire day.</li>
            <li> Received one day after estimated date of arrival but during Christmas season it was expected.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not much of a cologne fan.  </li>
            <li> If i wasn&#x27;t buying it as a gift I wouldn&#x27;t care, but the box was damaged or crushed or something.</li>
            <li> I have a wide variety of colognes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly NOT a rendition</li>
            <li> I would place it along the lines of John Varvatos Artisan and Unforgiveable Black Limited Edition by Sean Jean.</li>
            <li> I first came across Gucci Guilty for Men when I was flipping through a catalog and there was a scented insert of it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts longer during the day than any of my other colognes.</li>
            <li> I have never had this impression about any other cologne ever.</li>
            <li> He has other fragrance by Gucci?</li>
            <li> Been buying this on Amazon for years after trying it out at one of those expensive perfume/cologne boutiques (for a much higher price).</li>
            <li> Have gotten multiple complements from women while wearing it, usually followed by &amp;#34;What cologne is that?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> AND THE OTHER PEOPLE LOVES THE WAY THAT IT SMELLS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an upgrade of the same product he usually uses.  </li>
            <li> I like the Guilty Black alot better than the regular guilty though.</li>
            <li> I know this perfume to be good just that this one is fake!!!</li>
            <li> , I am not saying the Amazon product is a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;, but something is not right.  </li>
            <li> I am very into designer Everything, and this is undoubtably Gucci Guilty.</li>
            <li> I really like Guilty though</li>
            <li> I am less that 1 star dissatisfied and will seek some degree of reimbursement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not musky like an Armani Black Code.  </li>
            <li> The reason she bought it:  she sprayed me with it the previous day before purchase.</li>
            <li> Cologne is difficult to rate... or more difficult to assess from someone else&#x27;s rating.  </li>
            <li> and I paid half the price</li>
            <li> but I get less compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I am a Jcrew type dresser  if I&#x27;m not wearing suits, and I must say I&#x27;ve worn Polo Black before</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been disappointed with something purchased from them, especially because it was a gift for my boyfriend who has been asking for it for months.  </li>
            <li> Slightly cheaper to order here than to buy at dept. store.  </li>
            <li> not buy less than 3.3 aunces, just not worth the money!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very weak and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The box and bottle had fingerprints all over it and some of the product is missing, considerably less than shown in the picture even.</li>
            <li> This is a stronger version of &amp;#34;Gucci by Gucci&amp;#34; and in typical Gucci fashion it lasts for a few hours and the scent vanishes.</li>
            <li> IS NOT ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> was damaged a little.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a winner hands down!</li>
            <li> I have gotten quite a few compliments wearing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a year ago he still has it and uses it everyday</li>
            <li> As soon as I flipped to the page that featured Guilty by Gucci, I stopped and commented out loud with an audible &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;can&#x27;t say there was anything i disliked</li>
            <li> But sadly I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money to save 30 or 40 dollars.  </li>
            <li> i open it , the outer packing of the fragrance is broken.</li>
            <li> It is complex with lighter, fruitier top notes and woody base notes.</li>
            <li> Its has never let me down in the past and still has some kicking to do.</li>
            <li> Almost $20 less expensive than the department store for the same product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely a fragrance, but it&#x27;s weak and dull and doesn&#x27;t stay.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to be rather weak.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bottle looks a little rough around the edges like a poorly made replica.  </li>
            <li> Not OK.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I like changing it up and only wear expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> but when I smelled Gucci Guilty in a magazine, I couldn&#x27;t stop myself and bought it the same evening.</li>
            <li> The only downside to it is that it is expensive</li>
            <li> I was wrong and I waited enough</li>
            <li> I wear only Gucci Guilty or nothing at all</li>
            <li> i randomly smelled one of those strips with cologne on it in a magazine and instantly said i need to smell like that.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong would be the box</li>
            <li> No better recommendation.</li>
            <li> I tried to stuff their stockings with Guilty last year but every time I shopped in up-scale department stores, they were sold out.  </li>
            <li> My husband is NOT one to care what after-shave he uses; however, a year later he is still asking about Guilty.  </li>
            <li> This will be my 3rd purchase of Guilty.  </li>
            <li> I bought some off of Amazon and when I received the bottle and sprayed it, it was an obvious fake.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one complaint about this cologne.</li>
            <li> I like having cologne where I can at least subtly smell it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing subtle about this cologne.</li>
            <li> that are less expensive and maintain the fragrance longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fake product!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I bought Gucci Guilty a few weeks ago after a recommendation to try it.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this cologne based on the 100 5 star ratings it had and overlooking the few 1 and 2 star ratings claiming it to be fake.  </li>
            <li> I have been a user of Gucci Guilty for the past 3 years</li>
            <li> smells exactly like axe body spray was a horrible purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and that&#x27;s shocking because he&#x27;s very picky.</li>
            <li> awful  plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> This one is fake.</li>
            <li> I selfishly opened the box to smell it before stashing it away.</li>
            <li> Guilty by Gucci is a must have for your cologne collection.</li>
            <li> my husband loves Gucci Guilty for men</li>
            <li> now it could be that I have some fake stuff bought from here..</li>
            <li> I sprayed it a couple times on my skin and it smelled nothing like the Gucci Guilty that I purchased from Macy&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> This one is either defective or a fake fragrance</li>
            <li> I got the Gucci Guilty cologne for my husband for Christmas</li>
            <li> I got this cologne after purchasing the Gucci Guilty for women for my wife.</li>
            <li> After checking it they all said this is a fake cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy off line since I had never smelled it before</li>
            <li> I believe I will shy away from GUCCI products in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never in my life have I had a stranger randomly compliment how I smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so difficult to describe.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, although it doesn&#x27;t look like a fake it sort of smells like one.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have gotten Guilty</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is difficult to buy cologne online.</li>
            <li> , I doubled the amount of sprays and after you can smell it faintly.</li>
            <li> This product is fake on the basis that the UPC on the box has been cut out and a fake paper UPC has been placed</li>
            <li> I had tried Gucci Guilty at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Up Christmas, so I can sneak my husband&#x27;s Guilty and wear it myself...  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this price for this size bottle.</li>
            <li> or if we just don&#x27;t like Gucci guilty.</li>
            <li> Kush &amp; Guilty are my cologne of choice.</li>
            <li> Well, I found it in Gucci Guilty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just crazy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely disappointing.  </li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t get me wrong!</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> Guilty has just taken its place!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very faint on this</li>
            <li> Buy a bottle, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed.....</li>

            <li> it will drive you crazy!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> really disappointed with this buy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another point is that the gold/bronze base is misaligned with the oval on the base.</li>
            <li> There is sooooo much hate about this fragrance</li>
            <li> you wont be disappointed  believe me!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> sandalwood, pepper, musk, citrus, disgusting.  </li>
            <li> This is just horrible combo of moschus /musk/ and alcohol.</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING!</li>
            <li> Get it for your man, you will not be disappointed!!</li>

            <li> Smells great, the price was good...and my girlfriend finally finds me attractive.  So there.</li>
            <li> The Guilty by Gucci for men is definitely a unique smell, it’s very soft and crisp. I just love it. With that being said the smell does not last throughout the day, it keeps decreasing hour by hour. At the end of the day you can still smell it if you put your nose close enough to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this fragrance though, it truly is amazing. I have gotten quite a few compliments wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
            <li> This one is fake. I have used this perfume before and I loved the smell but this one I bought on Amazon is nowhere near the first on I bought at the mall. It smell a bit close to the one I had before for only 5 minute and then the smell evaporates. Don&#x27;t buy from this seller. I know this perfume to be good just that this one is fake!!!</li>
            <li> This scent is a good scent. It is not my favorite but it is still a good cologne. I like the Guilty Black alot better than the regular guilty though.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this many times now. I have to say that it always get to me fast, its the right item and I have no problems at all. Maybe that why I keep coming back.</li>
            <li> While wearing this, i got many compliments saying i smelled nice. It smells good. Its a powerful smell, but isnt overwhelming,</li>
            <li> LOVEE this smell.  it doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long on my guy&#x27;s body but it does smell really good.</li>
            <li> kinda little different which i bought from store, but doesnt matter cuz of this cheap price</li>
            <li> Great cologne, like the name to describe my thinking at times.</li>
            <li> Smells great on my husband, and he loves it, and that&#x27;s all that matters :)</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my fiance&#x27;s birthday and he absolutely loved it. Very nice smell. Not a bad price at all.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Authentic. Real not a fake. It lasts for days with just one spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention of giving it to my husband for christmas. When it arrived today (exactly on time) I selfishly opened the box to smell it before stashing it away. This product is the real deal. I am very into designer Everything, and this is undoubtably Gucci Guilty. Needless to say, my hubby is getting lucky later, and he didn&#x27;t even have to wear it. Also, this will not make it under the tree, I cant wait that long to smell it again. Fabulous product. Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend of mine he really loves it he said he can&#x27;t keep the women off of him and he doesn&#x27;t have to use that much of it and he said this time he will buy it</li>
            <li> I bought this to give it to my boyfriend as a gift, he really likes it, it smells really good.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite scent and the bottle is huge and has lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> Buy far my favorite summer fragrance. Women love the smell of this stuff! I get more compliments and questions when I wear this than with any other fragrance. I keep a bottle on reserve.</li>
            <li> Smelled this at Macy&#x27;s and fell in love with it, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the big box store price.  Amazon.. Welcome to the rescue. My husband loved it and I love it! It&#x27;s a win win.</li>
            <li> Purchased this cologne for my husband&#x27;s birthday. He loves it...so do I. He is always receiving compliments at work from the ladies.</li>
            <li> Guilty by Gucci is a must have for your cologne collection. Receive many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> IS NOT ORIGINAL THEY  GAVE ME REFUND ITS OK BUT DONT BUY IT THEM NOT RECOMMENDED  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I TRY AND NOT ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> This maybe is one the best perfume for men ever. Won&#x27;t regret it especially when you get it at fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> &amp;I got it as a gift for my brother for his birthday and he loved it would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. If I had to describe the scent I would use two words: strong and seductive!&lt;br /&gt;Guys, just don&#x27;t use this around your pregnant wife cause she will probably be put off by the strong smell. Otherwise, its wonderful! The scent does last a pretty long time. I know that it isn&#x27;t recommended to spray cologne on clothing but I do because it helps the scent last much longer.</li>
            <li> my husband loves Gucci Guilty for men and I love it also :-)</li>
            <li> It wears quickly .. now it could be that I have some fake stuff bought from here.. but I really liked the smell however, it wears off to quickly for me .. and in fact within an hour I cant smell it anymore .. despite covering myself twice</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very original (for being a new product). It reminds me of some other cologne I smelled long before.&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful fragance and everything works fine, i&#x27;m glad with my purchase. I&#x27;m thinking of buying others parfums from here.</li>
            <li> I received the cologne today. I sprayed it a couple times on my skin and it smelled nothing like the Gucci Guilty that I purchased from Macy&#x27;s... This one is either defective or a fake fragrance i&#x27;m very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I first came across Gucci Guilty for Men when I was flipping through a catalog and there was a scented insert of it.  I fell in love with the scent and just had to buy a bottle.  This cologne is one of the best on the market as far as I am concerned.  The smell is sweet, yet masculine and is sure to attract girls of all looks, sizes, and ages.  I put the cologne on in the morning and the scent stays with me for a long, long time throughout the day.  The price is very reasonable for this product.  Buy a bottle, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought Gucci for men as a gift for my son-in-law it was asked for by name, this he will not return thanks Gucci</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne. It will attract men or women to you.  When my boyfriend wears it he gets so many compliments! The smell last ALL day long.  Great buy</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Gucci Guilty for the past 3 years and I thoroughly know how it smells and its lasting value. I personally do not know WHAT was in this package pretending to be authentic Gucci Guilty. I am less that 1 star dissatisfied and will seek some degree of reimbursement.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best perfumes I have ever won. It was first offered to me by me kid sister during 2011 Xmas and since then, I have fallen in love with Gucci Guilty. It is so smooth and refined. Good for all occassions and long lasting. I recommend this scent to men who are trendy and classy!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and I wear it every day to work. My female co-workers love it so I guess it was worth buying.</li>
            <li> Guilty by Gucci is one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve smeeled in a long time.  It gives a fresh, clean, but masculine scent.  It&#x27;s perfect for the man who likes to smell good, but doesn&#x27;t want the scent to arrive before him or stay long after he&#x27;s gone.  The price on Amazon is just the icing on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go-to cologne for everyday use.  I would definately suggest it for any man who likes a sweeter cologne.  It&#x27;s not musky like an Armani Black Code.  I would place it along the lines of John Varvatos Artisan and Unforgiveable Black Limited Edition by Sean Jean.</li>
            <li> Came UNSEALED. The box was OPEN on the bottom and NOT SEALED. Not OK. Perfume smells weird and does not seem GENUINE. Bought from &amp;#34;GUCCI&amp;#34; fulfillment by AMAZON.COM LLC. Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and in good condition. The item smells amazing for everyday wear. I will be ordering this item again.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son. It smells great. Perfect for use anytime of the day. I like the Chrome/steel looking bottle as well! Nice job Gucci!</li>
            <li> Fake product!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous ordering cologne from Amazon since there are so many reviews stating that they received knock off fragrances. Once my boyfriend opened his gift yesterday we closely examined the bottle and packaging and everything seems to look legit. It smells just the way it should and the scent lasted about the same length of time as his previous (100% authentic) bottle of Gucci Guilty. I think I lucked out and received the real deal. Phew!</li>
            <li> Received this for Christmas and I must say that I cannot understand why men or women rate this high.  Too lingering and strong.  There is nothing subtle about this cologne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion on and off for some time now, and the aroma works for me, tis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem ordering perfume or cologne from amazon.  They have always smelled the same as what I would pay extra for in a department store.  Lasts just as long too!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is awesome.  I find the best fragrances are hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say sort of spicy, clean, lavender, so unique it&#x27;s hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its&#x27; definitely a quality fragrance, probably more for an evening out.  Not a casual scent I would say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product packaging was open. The box shows wear and tear where it had been opened and closed repeatedly. The box and bottle had fingerprints all over it and some of the product is missing, considerably less than shown in the picture even. Product was stuffed back in the box and the plastic wrapping simply thrown over it. Debating on sending it back. It smells great though.&lt;br /&gt;Deducting three stars for packaging and being used. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> Bought off here.. Read review about fake colognes, but i&#x27;ve bought 4 bottles now and all have been sealed and authentic.. Good stuff.. Smells spicy and lasts long.. It&#x27;s what i&#x27;d recommend wearing on dates and special occasions.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted for the best price! It was delivered quickly and with out any damage. I am one happy customer</li>
            <li> I have a collection of about 50 different colognes. I like changing it up and only wear expensive colognes. This one was a surprise. It is clearly my favorite. It lasts longer during the day than any of my other colognes. The scent is quite pleasing. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> awful  plain and simple.  its trying to be too many things at once.  sandalwood, pepper, musk, citrus, disgusting.  its like being in a night club in New Jersey, but full of 40 year old sweaty men trying to attract women by showering in cologne.</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING! I almost didn&#x27;t get it because a few of the reviews weren&#x27;t so flattering, but I&#x27;m so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> I got the Gucci Guilty cologne for my husband for Christmas and he loved it.  He has been wearing it every day now and has received many comments about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I like it too (lol.....  This was a great transaction, great communication, fast shipping, would surely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I always wear Gutti products,this is why i bought this just to wear at the office,it has all day lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of Guilty by Gucci. This was purchased as a gift and my fiance&#x27; absolutely loved it.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Armani Attitude for quite some time now but when I smelled Gucci Guilty in a magazine, I couldn&#x27;t stop myself and bought it the same evening. IT IS THE BEST SO FAR. I simply love it. I have never had this impression about any other cologne ever. I loved Armani Attitude but after using this I am never going back. Armani is more of an elegant kind of cologne but Gucci is in between, perfect for me. People around me love it and there is rarely when people don&#x27;t notice or comment on it. Highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells great and stays on you for awhile and I smoke so it was good to still kinda smell it on me, but I sprayed some more anyway lol.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing it. You will fall in love with the small its so good. Wear it everyday and the bottle looks amazing too</li>
            <li> This smells greats. The only thing I would point out is that you have to do more than one spray if you want it to last all day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s not Long Lasting as i thought&lt;br /&gt;i bet a cheaper fragrance smells better than this One,, i just wasted my Money i would pay only 10 Dollars for this stuff&lt;br /&gt;the only Nice here was the Bottle</li>
            <li> My sister works at a pharmacy .(big chain)and even with her discount was way more than Amazon s price. Great deal!</li>
            <li> I brought this for a gift! He absolutely loved it!! Great price! Smells great, smell last all dAy long. Perfect</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful on my husband!  It&#x27;s the only thing he uses, anymore, and we will stick with what works!</li>
            <li> I purchased as a birthday gift. He absolutely loved it. He has other fragrance by Gucci? Likes this best. It simply Smells wonderful on!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend. I was hesitant in the beginning, but after I read some great reviews from men about it, I decided to surprise my boyfriend with it. At first he thought that the smell goes away too quickly, but then he told me how much he loves it. The smell stays on his shirts for days and I love when he puts it on, because it smells so good. Highly recommended for a gift.</li>
            <li> love love love this cologne!! one of the best out there! I am very happy with it! BUY FROM FRAGRANCENET!!! mine is authentic, lasts a very long time on my skin, buy from a trusted seller like FRAGRANCENET and avoid getting counterfeit products. this is one of the best colognes our there, the bottle comes with a little bit missing but it is as shown in the picture. very happy with this, I think I found my new signature scent and will keep to this</li>
            <li> I got this cologne after purchasing the Gucci Guilty for women for my wife. The fragrance is nice and subtle but extremely masculine! My wife loved it!</li>
            <li> My most favorite cologne to smell on my boyfriend. Not to strong and can smell it a whole room away.</li>
            <li> This product at Macy&#x27;s is about $20 more per bottle! totally worth it.  I love the smell of this cologne on my husband! one of my favorites of all time.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance itself, but it&#x27;s so weak that I find myself re-applying throughout the day. Should have gone with the Intense.</li>
            <li> I got it for my man a year ago he still has it and uses it everyday it smells really good</li>
            <li> Amazing one ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended by my wife too. It is a kind of perfume that I had never used before until now. I tested it and it is fantastic to be use either at day or night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to any of my close relatives , friends or whoever .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> As an elderly fellow, I am pleasantly accosted by females seeking the source of this endorphin jump-start. I must say that I would have not reached this age had this aphrodisiac been available in my youth.</li>
            <li> LARGE SIZE BOTTLE IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING. SMELLS GREAT. PURCHASED IT AS A FATHER&#x27;S DAY GIFT AND MY HUSBAND LOVED IT!  WILL DEFINITELY BUY MORE.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes for men in the market! Gave it to my boyfriend for his birthday and he (and his family) loved it!</li>
            <li> It was an excellent choice. The aroma is very pleasant and quite hard after application. If you prefer the spray version, is also a great choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this item through Amazon thinking that since it is from Amazon it will be the real thing.  I bought this as a wedding anniversary gift for my husband.  Literally after 2 hours, the fragrance goes away.  I took it to Macy&#x27;s, Sephora, and perfume shops in the mall.  After checking it they all said this is a fake cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this back to Amazon and will make the proper investment and buy the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.....</li>
            <li> After getting scammed on e-bay I came to the online store I trust (amazon) and this product appears to be authentic. I still think the scent from the one at Macy&#x27;s lasted longer, but I might just be desensitized to it now. Either way great fragrance, just make sure you get a real one.</li>
            <li> This is a stronger version of &amp;#34;Gucci by Gucci&amp;#34; and in typical Gucci fashion it lasts for a few hours and the scent vanishes. It does smell great though</li>
            <li> It has a long lasting smell and worth the price! Cost more in the shopping mall. I would purchase more at that price</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this stuff, but I don&#x27;t think it lasts long enough on my skin for me to consider it a really great cologne. I like Acqua di Gio more because of the longevity factor, but my overall fragrance is Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme because of it&#x27;s AMAZING smell. I really like Guilty though, don&#x27;t get me wrong!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this cologne, its very sexy. Comes in a really good sized bottle too. I believe some other reviewers stated the scent wears off quickly, all you need to do is ...apply heat, if you will. The scent will really kick back in at the right moment if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li> I love Guilty By Gucci EDT spray for Men, 3 Ounce! I purchased previously and I always wanted more!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I got it for my fiance&#x27;s Christmas and he absolutely loves it................It lasts even after 24 hours.  A must have everyone.</li>
            <li> this perfume is great, this is the real thing, lasts all day long, dont hesitate to but this totally original</li>
            <li> It smells pretty nice, and I see people asking me what kind of perfume I use. I feel luxurious whenever I go out with this perfume. It smells nice and professional!. Will buy perfume from Gucci for future purchase.! Thank you for listing this item!.</li>
            <li> Smells really great, and he really enjoyed it, as well. I would say that it is worth the money, for sure.</li>
            <li> I got a good ten hours out of this. It lasts a very long time on my skin, I do not recommend spraying on clothing. Projects well, I do get compliments with this. However, this is my least favorite fragrance that I own. It gives me a headache, even with just one spray on the chest. My overall impression would be &amp;#34;smells nice when you&#x27;re not the one wearing it.&amp;#34; This is a casual fragrance, however I would not recommend wearing it to work.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy off line since I had never smelled it before but I am so glad I did. It smells so fabulous! Clean and manly! I love it and so did my Fiance, may be my most favorite scent ever!</li>
            <li> After getting this for myself I purchased it as a gift for my brother in law.  It has a nice sweet smell, but is not bitter or sugary (candy) smelling, and it still has that little something that tells you it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s cologne. It&#x27;s not overpowering either, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This is my preferred cologne out of all that I have tried out.  Smells great and has an upbeat masculine fragrance for the new millenium man!</li>
            <li> Yes I&#x27;m Gucci now baby.. So fresh and so clean ladies love the smells no complaints at all thanks !!</li>
            <li> It was a great gift for that special some one They loved it and i did and priced well &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Smelled so good on my fianc&amp;eacute; she loved it good amount for the right price . I would buy again  ❤️</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He gets so many compliments and its authentic!! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is perplexing.  I was drawn to the product from a sample at Dillard&#x27;s and ordered from Amazon.  Before I place my order, I noticed that some persons were complaining about the product from Amazon being some sort of \\&quot;knock-Off\\&quot;, but I forged ahead.  I received my product from Amazon and would note that while the fragrance seems to be the same, it lacks any sort of staying power.  The sample from Dillard&#x27;s was still present the next day and the aroma from product sold by Amazon was gone within 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am not saying the Amazon product is a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;, but something is not right.  Another explanation which is reasonable is that the samplers are stronger than the bottled product - I mean they are located at the point of sale.  I would be more willing to believe this explanation since I believe the fragrance itself would be hard to duplicate in some \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; product.  But, either way, the sample and the delivered product were definitely different.  I believe I will shy away from GUCCI products in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW-UP:&lt;br /&gt;I was back a Dillard&#x27;s on other business and discussed this matter with the sales person.  They confirmed that the samplers were stronger.  His reasoning was that they were sprayed into the air and onto cards - therefore they were stronger.  Good enough for me - me and Gucci are friends again.</li>
            <li> i love it i love it and i thinkyoull love it  when you buy bay bigest bottle because youll get lots compliments</li>
            <li> I absoluty love it, spray just a little bit on before you go out. I had girl tell me that it smelt so good it turned her on. A def buy it.</li>
            <li> Great scent. I get more compliments on this than when I rock Tom Ford and is is quite a bit less expensive.</li>
            <li> Wife bought this for me while we were on a cruise. The reason she bought it:  she sprayed me with it the previous day before purchase. After a good night rest, she woke up and remarked that she just loved that scent.  Now have one in the locker room at work plus one at home.</li>
            <li> I call it Batman. Fast delivery and smells great. Received a lot of compliments. I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, good quality product.</li>
            <li> Has a great scent with long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> My son wanted this for Christmas.  He was quite pleased that I was able to purchase this for him. Online really helped.</li>
            <li> Cologne is difficult to rate... or more difficult to assess from someone else&#x27;s rating.  This cologne doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as others I&#x27;ve used; I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s right for my body chemistry.  My wife likes it, so that really all I care about, but I&#x27;m thinking there are others she likes as well that are less expensive and maintain the fragrance longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very subjective, so I&#x27;d recommend you try it at a dept store first.</li>
            <li> This is probably the longest lasting best smelling manly cologne I have ever owned. It rare to find those combinations in a cologne but if you&#x27;re particular about smelling good and want your wife or significant others to notice how good you smell then this is certainly for you. The only downside to it is that it is expensive but you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s certainly NOT a rendition and you won&#x27;t find a better price for the real deal anywhere else. I have 8 different colognes that I use and this is by far the best and longest lasting cologne. Gucci really did make this product stand out from the comp no questions asked. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best smelling male cologne I have ever worn.  The first day I throw it on to run to the grocery store I get 2 compliments.  Never in my life have I had a stranger randomly compliment how I smell.  Very, very impressive.  I love the brand as it is, now that this smell matches my wants it&#x27;s even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so difficult to describe.  It reminds me of Cool Water a little, if you&#x27;re familiar with that.  This is for sure something you wear for evenings/meetings.  Some colognes have that &#x27;day time&#x27; smell, this is more of an evening smell.  Maybe I&#x27;m just crazy.</li>
            <li> The girls love it and know it by the aroma.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much for the product it smells great and got it at a cheaper price .... Look forward to buying from in future</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  We both love it.</li>
            <li> First off, fragrance is authentic and was in authentic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, really great scent. It is complex with lighter, fruitier top notes and woody base notes. Most everyone likes it. I like unique scents and this is unique in a good way. I almost hope it doesn&#x27;t become too &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I personally felt misled by the good reviews for this cologne. It smelled really cheap to me. Like something you would buy at a gas station.</li>
            <li> Gucci guilty is in my top three best smelling, longest lasting, panty dropping sprays. If you love smelling fresh, this is the one.</li>
            <li> Like many others I got stinky cheap alcohol filled in a Gucci bottle. I read the reviews first and saw that many others experienced the same thing but I took the chance. Fortunately Amazon was fatastic with my refund. In the future I will play it safe and get my cologne from a department store.</li>
            <li> I have used colognes for YEARS, and this scent  last a long time.  I would buy it again. And, my wife LIKES it!  What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Bought this at the mall for $76. It smells nice but it lasts a good 5 seconds. I like having cologne where I can at least subtly smell it. And I forget I&#x27;m wearing cologne when I wear this. Never received any compliments. Probably because the smell fades as soon as I walk out the house. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> my son really loved this scent</li>
            <li> Smell nice but doesn&#x27;t last long......Versace pour homme top every other bottle of colognes I own! Probably won&#x27;t buy this again</li>
            <li> I had been getting this cologne from Sephora, but the price was too high and I found this option on Amazon.  This is my favorite cologne these days and I know it very well after having used it for so long.  I have to say, although it doesn&#x27;t look like a fake it sort of smells like one.  The scent is not the same as the Sephora-sold ones I had and it&#x27;s extremely disappointing.  There&#x27;s definitely a fragrance, but it&#x27;s weak and dull and doesn&#x27;t stay.  I&#x27;ll be trusting Sephora, despite the prices, from now on.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband because he loved the way it smelled.  He tried it from a department store and it smelled really good on him.  I brought a bottle of it from Amazon and when he used it I couldn&#x27;t smell a thing.  I am constantly embarrassed to save a some money I brought this bottle from Amazon instead of just purchasing it from a local retailer.  Never again.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, new in box and smells amazing!!!! Shipped fast. This spray is definately worth your money and is a lot cheaper than at a department store.</li>
            <li> I love this spray for men. It&#x27;s clean and the bottle is elegant and looks nice on my dresser. I you like the clean smell but not heavy perfume, it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> Great smelling fragrance.  My girlfriend loves this one and we haven&#x27;t been able to find something that smells better.  Great price on Amazon, way less expensive than your department store prices in Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s, etc.</li>
            <li> It did the trick :)  Nice fragrance and long lasting, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells sooooooo good. My Husband loved it!. Has that manly, attractive, luring smell. Definitely won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase Gucci Guitly.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;ve found your scent, you usually don&#x27;t stray, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying any cologne off online reviews, but I would highly recommend buying them there. Saved around 30 bucks off what the brick and mortar chain store sells this at!</li>
            <li> its okay not my top 10! i bought it cause high reviews but its the name more than anything.</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT deal!</li>
            <li> Lingers al day. Nice cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the bees knees.  Drops more drawers than an Ikea warehouse.  Makes the ladies come running like theres free cheesecake in your pockets.</li>
            <li> This makes my man smell so good!  I love this on my husband.  Not too musky, or sweet, but the right amount of manliness.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, and excellent product!!! I am more than happy!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my husband as an anniversary gift. I chose it bc it was highly recommended and I&#x27;m GLAD I DID. It makes him smell so sexy and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It smells really good but slightly different from magazine. I would recommend it and for the price I couldn&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent awesome prize bought for my husband and I absolutely love it. Took about 2 weeks to receive but was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> cheapest price around</li>
            <li> Del and packaeing n product gr8! Buy it u won&#x27;t be dissapointed! ;) x0x0 to all get for ur husband boyfriend u will love it!!</li>
            <li> Performance guaranteed. Just a few sprays to keep the scent on you for almost the entire day. 3 Ounces ought to keep you going for the whole year.</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne for my grandson. I research to make sure I was paying what I wanted to pay for it. Although it is a little costly, this was the best price. My grandson was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this very much and smells fantastic when he wears it!  He says it seems to wear off quickly but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Was happy to  be able to buy a gift for my adult son who loves this product but didn&#x27;t want to buy for himself since he thought it was extravagant.  I especially liked the discounted price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne I reordered my husband a bottle for his birthday arrived exactly on time and I paid half the price his first bottle costed me 100 dollars from a retail store.</li>
            <li> Gucci Guilty is a great value! This is my second bottle and I still love it. The smell is refreshing and not too heavy, but it also lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve received any complements from women while wearing it. So, if women love it, I do too!</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling fragrances I have ever worn. I get nothing but compliments and people actually walking closer to sniff my neck!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Fragrance preference is highly subjective but I absolutely love this fragrance. Bold without being over powering I like it for day or evening.</li>
            <li> Great cologne at a great price. Almost $20 less expensive than the department store for the same product. Received one day after estimated date of arrival but during Christmas season it was expected.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a great fragrance</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son and he loves it.  It is such a clean and fresh scent that last all day.</li>
            <li> For my son. I think he will like it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites and the price is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Knock off!!! Don&#x27;t Buy</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> ok have only had a couple of comments not what I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Absolutely loves how this smells. I&#x27;ll be getting more once I run out.</li>
            <li> My son wanted this and he was impressed with the size, because when he buys it it is half the size and cost more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of a long lasting manly fragrance. Guilty by Gucci does smell good but unfortunately does not smell very strongly and does not last very long. The only way  to smell it at all would be to put your nose right up to it. I would recommend buying from a store like Macy&#x27;s rather than Amazon.</li>
            <li> My items arrived right on time  and the smell is out of this world! I get a ton of compliments when I wear this one!</li>
            <li> my dad loves it when I give him this on his birthday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not my favorite scent my husband has but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> He kept telling me how he loved the Guilty by Gucci smell so I finally gave in and bought it for him. It smells AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this when it first came out at a Dillard&#x27;s, now I&#x27;ve purchased it from here, it didn&#x27;t hold the scent as long as it did when I got it from the department store, maybe because it&#x27;s been sitting too long in a warm temperature or something.  Other than that, combining on your face and old spice spray under the pits, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve got this for my fiance who loves YSL L&#x27;HOMME, for a change. I thought this might be his new favorite. I was wrong and I waited enough but he&#x27;s still stuck to YSL and he even repurchased it since I&#x27;ve got this one. He says it doesn&#x27;t last as long as YSL one. But I like it anyway, smells sexy and it&#x27;s a 4 star for me.</li>
            <li> Good.  My girlfriend loves this!</li>
            <li> this spray smells great One spray and your set to smell great all day</li>
            <li> Very attractive and aggressive. But lasts up to 4-5 hours max. Earlier experience was good , don&#x27;t know whether this bottle has  some problem or not.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted to order the Guilty Black, which is my favorite, and ordered this. This smells really good too. Not as good as the Guilty Black in my opinion but good. I received it quickly as usually and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I wear only Gucci Guilty or nothing at all</li>
            <li> The cologne was at my expectations. This was a replacement bottle for the one that I bought at a department store, however this time I saved some money by buying from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Great cologne at a good price, still too expensive but I wanted one nice cologne. 3 stars because mine came in a clearly opened box, it looked like it was all there, but still, for what you pay I&#x27;d  like a sealed package. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for bargain seeking though, overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> As always Gucci is Gucci ... best fragrance a guy can wear</li>
            <li> Found a advertisement in Maxim, or some magazine like that, some time ago and loved the smell of this product then. Sought it out in a local department store and loved it, but didn&#x27;t wanna cough up the full retail price for it then. Found it on Amazon for a good deal and picked it up. Still love it. - Goes on a bit strong at first, but that just means you can use less and make it last. It wears truly nice and lasts for hours. The fragrance is a bit warmer/sweeter, than many of the fresh colognes I own. My wife really loves the smell of it, which is, of course, important. My only gripe is this: The top of this bottle seals poorly and it leaks slightly, which was a concern during shipment and may be a concern if you plan on traveling with it - sitting upright on the shelf and for everyday use other than that it seems fine. Smells so good, once I sprayed it on, I forgot about that gripe.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite cologne that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Everybody loves the way it smells, especially my girlfriend. The price of 3 oz. was extremely cheap compared to getting it elsewhere like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so nice. I get compliments all the time about it.  Its cool, comfortable to wear for someone like myself who&#x27;s so active at work and daily life.</li>
            <li> Love this! Although, I like the &amp;#34;Intense&amp;#34; more... this was exactly the same great scent I found at Dillards and for half the department store price!</li>
            <li> Smells nice but the scent doesn&#x27;t hold for more than 3 hours if that.  Nice bottle though and very manly.</li>
            <li> It is a good price for really good cologne.. I bought it for my dad and he really like it.</li>
            <li> I have already used all of this and need to order some more, i liked the deal and it was cheaper then buying from Macys</li>
            <li> Great perfume, it lasts the whole day.  The smell is very nice, sophisticated.  It&#x27;s nothing exotic in my opinion so it&#x27;s perfect for daily use when dressing smart.</li>
            <li> He loves it, I love it.</li>
            <li> The product is not as strong as the samples in the department store. I am wondering if it is a knock-off.</li>
            <li> His favorite, so I was glad to find at a more reasonable price.  It is a great Christmas present, too.</li>
            <li> I have to write this feedback because I received junk not perfume! I&#x27;m using this fragrance almost daily and I know exactly how it smells. This is just horrible combo of moschus /musk/ and alcohol. The bottle is also unavailing replica of original. I have tension to send that not back to seller, but by my lawyer to start process for controlling and verifying originality of this product. I can not washed this stink away!</li>
            <li> I love this scent,  and the service was impeccable- it even arrived earlier than expected! i would buy this again.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband for Christmas and it smells AWESOME!!!! i&#x27;d definitely buy this for him again whenever he runs out</li>
            <li> my husband absolutely loves it!!!! He loves the bottle and the smell of it too! It was a great price too!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd cologne I have purchased through Amazon that turned out to be a counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything from the box, to the way it&#x27;s packaged, and the usually amazing smell is so watered down and disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can Amazon get away with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the time and money and buy it at a department store.</li>
            <li> This cologne is GREAT! perfect for any guy, smells great and last a long time. I get ALOT of compliments on it. I would keep purchasing this cologne anytime i run out. GREAT COLOGNE!</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne and wife likes it a lot.  I am allergic to some strong colognes and this one is super.</li>
            <li> My hubby smells so yummy in this fragrance... Yes... I will order again ... Lol .. I love it.. Lol</li>
            <li> honestly best smell in the world. i randomly smelled one of those strips with cologne on it in a magazine and instantly said i need to smell like that. its perfect. i usually never buy cologne over 20 bucks but one should treat themself sometimes if it means smelling like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> I bought this after smelling a sample in a copy of Men&#x27;s Health. The scent is really good - warm and subtle. My only complaint is that it seems to be rather weak.  2-3 sprays seem to wear of quickly.  The other cologne I use is Versace Pour Homme, which is much stronger and lasts the whole day.  Maybe I should have gotten Guilty Intense.  It&#x27;s worth a try though.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband and he just loves it. It is very stable and more than him I love the way it smells when he wears it :-)!! This is exactly what I expected after smelling a fragrance sample in one of the magazines that we regularly get. After smelling that I just thought of trying it and well I am happy I did! I would recommend it to anyone who is not looking for a very strong smell but a very decent and soft yet manly smell!</li>
            <li> Could not have been more satisfied!!! Received item a little earlier which was perfect because it was a gift. Item is 100% authentic. Will definitely order from this seller again and again! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This smells great and last quite awhile. Two sprays for a 16 hour day (one every eight hours if I had to try to be exact), which in my opinion is great quality. I&#x27;ve only sprayed once in a day before and still received compliments that evening.</li>
            <li> the outfit of this perfume looks exact as it shows on the image, and the smell is good though it is not as good as I thought before.</li>
            <li> product was received quick &amp; was excellent . Just what I wanted for a gift &amp; would order again.Great product.</li>
            <li> I loved the quantity for the price, I loved the smell, and I love the responses I get when someone else smells it</li>
            <li> I bought Gucci Guilty a few weeks ago after a recommendation to try it. Since I began wearing this cologne I have had many complements and the ladies love it. Save over $35 dollars here on amazon too!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one complaint about this cologne. It really does smell fantastic. Women LOVE this scent. That&#x27;s the whole point, right? Highly recommended and I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> i give it 5stars because my husband love it and i would tell all my friends and family about it</li>
            <li> Excellent colonel, use it every day and have received positive comments from the ladies and my girl friend. Highly Recommened.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,Leo.</li>
            <li> Great smell and it seems to last longer than my previous one from Nautica.</li>
            <li> Been buying this on Amazon for years after trying it out at one of those expensive perfume/cologne boutiques (for a much higher price). I love it and have always been told I smell great. I would test cologne out in a store somewhere with someone to gauge how it blends with your own body chemistry since all scents react differently with each person.</li>
            <li> Smells good. If it IS a knock off, it&#x27;s accurate. But it&#x27;s very weak and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband without sampling it before hand.  It smells good, I just expected it to smell a little more amazing.  You know, considering the big GUCCI label ;)</li>
            <li> My new favorite cologne. I go through tons of cologne. Some of my favorites include David beckam instinct, aqua di gio, corduroy by zihr, Versace blue jeans, Armani code, givenchy pi, and azarro&#x27;s chrome. Long lasting pleasant smell. Will be buying this one for years to come.</li>
            <li> I recently took my daughter to Ulta to have her hair done and like many fathers who go to that store and wait for their wives or daughters to finish I went to the cologne section. While there I discovered this cologne and loved it. However, the 3.0 oz bottle was $100.00 and there is no way I would ever pay that for cologne for myself! I pulled out my phone and scanned the barcode on the package and found the same size bottle on Amazon for half of the price as Ulta and bought it immediately. I haven&#x27;t regretted the purchase yet, this stuff smells great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husbands birthday and he absolutely loved it!  It&#x27;s a great masculine cologne; product pricing was good.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband&#x27;s 40th birthday. He smells so good I want to chew him up!</li>
            <li> Smell nice just for few hours then evaporate</li>
            <li> Received the package in just a few days after ordering, great price for the product, very pleased with this.  It was actually a gift to a friend, and he loved it. A++</li>
            <li> smells great! downright sinful! perfect for you boyfriend or husband it will drive you crazy! great smell and it is not to strong and overbearing it is just the perfect combination gentle but powerful! please buy this! you wont be disappointed  believe me! ;-]</li>
            <li> Bought this for my nephew for a birthday gift. It was the real thing and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Bottle was leaking when I got it,and because of that leak,it wasn&#x27;t completely full...it was a gift so I didn&#x27;t notice it until the person who I gave it to opened it..it was kind of embarrassing for me but he was ok with it and kept it..I was very disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a Christmas gift, it was a success!! It smells sooooo gooood!! I really recommend it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend for Christmas.  The price was fantastic and I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it arrived.  It was just as advertised.  He was very happy!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Perfect cologne for a 22 year old guy, and you can&#x27;t find it cheaper. Shipped extremely fast too!</li>
            <li> Smells Great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to buy cologne online. How do you sample it? This was recommended to me by a female friend. And i thoroughly am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not much of a cologne fan.  But, I had just received a new Details magazine, and was browsing through the pages...  As soon as I flipped to the page that featured Guilty by Gucci, I stopped and commented out loud with an audible &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34;.  Yup, it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. If you like Gucci you will ike this. It smells great, and it was a better price then in store.</li>
            <li> Husband loved this scent.  This is fairly new and it really smells terrific on him.  We are both very pleased.</li>
            <li> Actually I had never purchased this fragrance, I saw comments from other buyers and I decided to buy it plus it had a good price, it is a very good perfume I apply it in the morning before leaving for work and when I get home at night still feels. It is a gentle but intense perfume, really recommend not regret.</li>
            <li> you want to be notice by ladies this is it this is the perfect manly but light smell I always get complement when I wear this</li>
            <li> I figured that this would be my favorite new scent, but it&#x27;s really faint. It is definitely a keeper especially when you&#x27;re going out on the town. The smell doesn&#x27;t stay strong all day but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> I went to 3 different stores trying to find this Cologne as a Christmas gift. The cheapest I could find was around $50-60 for a 1oz bottle. This was truly a great deal. It smells amazing and it arrived quicker than expected. My boyfriend is going to love it!</li>
            <li> Smells nice at first, but after a while it has a strange smell.  Not bad, but not good either.</li>
            <li> It smells like a unicorn took a dump on a rainbow that is made of only one color...more cowbell.</li>
            <li> Smells good and the smell lasts long …</li>
            <li> Great fragrance with a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that something like this cologne can smell so good. I was browsing on here because i was running low on my cologne. I came across this because of the high reviews. Now, i&#x27;ve never heared of this type of cologne or even smelled it. I brought it and wow. This is the best cologne i&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend this product to anyone. The scent smells like a crisp fresh masculine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously guys, buy this cologne!</li>
            <li> I order this cologne and I made a mistake but its ok I wear this when I go to work or just hanging out with my buddies</li>
            <li> This is a good scent but didn&#x27;t really work that well for me.  I like it, but I get less compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white male 6&#x27;0 tall 195 lbs fairly built and I must say, this stuff isn&#x27;t all that great.  I am a Jcrew type dresser  if I&#x27;m not wearing suits, and I must say I&#x27;ve worn Polo Black before and I like that much better.  This stuff smells kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites along with Allure by Chanel.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasted a long time. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered promptly,the price was reasonable.But it is a very strong and lasting fragrance,too strong a fragrance for me to wear day or night.</li>
            <li> I choose because the price was very good.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like there is no item on stock.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I got a good deal on this Cologne. It was the real deal. It was delivered just in time. The only thing wrong would be the box was damaged a little. If i wasn&#x27;t buying it as a gift I wouldn&#x27;t care, but the box was damaged or crushed or something.</li>
            <li> The price was outstanding. It was everything I expected and more. The fragrance is excellent and the value was worth it</li>
            <li> This scent was a wonderful surprise when I first used it!! It is now one of my favorites........and at a very good price!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Gucci Guilty.  One or two sprays will last you throughout the day.  For the price I paid, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Received product on time, great price, the only negative remark I have about my order is that it is not as strong as I thought it would be, in fact, once I got my order, I sprayed several sprays ( neck, chest, wrists) and came downstairs to try and pass the gf test to see if she liked it and she couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing cologne at all, I doubled the amount of sprays and after you can smell it faintly. Smells good, but not strong at all. Think I might just buy in-store next time so I can smell before I buy.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my fiance every year. It&#x27;s a staple now. Guilty is a nice cologne. Pricey, but very nice and sexy!</li>
            <li> Good good good good good yes thank unlike Ioke yes ok what did he do it as long as I don&#x27;t suck everyone today</li>
            <li> This product is fake on the basis that the UPC on the box has been cut out and a fake paper UPC has been placed atop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another point is that the gold/bronze base is misaligned with the oval on the base. The position of the oval is off centered and angled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional point is that the tubing includes a plastic ball when it should be metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this item, you will be wasting your money. I have already contacted Amazon to take this item down as they are selling it under their own name.</li>
            <li> I loved this product on my boyfriend. .. its has a very nice smell and the size and quality is very good ... It was a Birthday gift for him</li>
            <li> Great product for way cheaper than in the stars.  I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it, so do I.</li>
            <li> great product and most importantly natoyaschiy smell lasts a long time</li>
            <li> WAS A GIFT , HE LOVE IT WELL I THINK HE DOES!!! I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT AND IT WAS PACKAGED REALLY NICE CAME EXACT AS IN THE PICTURE!!</li>
            <li> my friend told me about it, so I got it just to try something new. I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this cologne based on the 100 5 star ratings it had and overlooking the few 1 and 2 star ratings claiming it to be fake.  I must say this cologne smells really good but it only lasts like a half hour. Maybe if I used like 8 squirts it would last longer lol. But that should not be required.</li>
            <li> I really like it plenty of compliment&lt;br /&gt;Arrived at adecent time</li>
            <li> I like it, but my wife prefers Terre D&#x27;Hermes.</li>
            <li> Love this item, am a repeat user..enjoy the compliments!!</li>
            <li> Great Perfume!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely go back and buy new items from Gucci.</li>
            <li> Cologne got here quickly and my son loves it!</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> My son loves the fragrance and so does his lady</li>
            <li> I love this smell! I got this as a gift for my husband and it smells really good and lasts all day! The price online was a really good deal, half of what they charge at Belk and the size was bigger! It&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, that&#x27;s all I can really say…AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Hubby loved the fragrance!</li>
            <li> I saw all the great reviews for this product and was extremely interested. However, being the doubter I am, I looked at the 1 star reviews and also saw many people weren&#x27;t happy with it. I still ordered it, and maybe I&#x27;m just \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; but I love this product, the smell isn&#x27;t too strong, and it isn&#x27;t too weak, but it lasts almost all day. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try out a new smell.</li>
            <li> I love this. Bought this for my fiance. Was worried because I wasn&#x27;t really sure what kind of cologne he likes and I had no idea what this smelt like but its wonderful. Its manly but not too strong. Very clean and fresh smelling</li>
            <li> great price and love how it smells!</li>
            <li> smells exactly like axe body spray was a horrible purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely.. will buy from again.</li>
            <li> Good perfume and prices excelent</li>
            <li> Gucci, italian brand that represent better than anyone the creativity, the genius of the italian high fashion.  This parfume is the expression of this spirit. Absolutely, I  recommended. Fair price. High quality. Very happy.</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T SURE WHAT IT WOULD SMELL LIKE. ITS FAST BECOMING ONE OF MY FAVORITES. I WOULD BUT ANOTHER ONE. THANKS..</li>
            <li> Everyone loves the smell of this stuff, and it goes a long way. It&#x27;s very concentrated, so you&#x27;ll want to spray once, and only once.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. May be I got a lemon.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the fragrance when I tested it Macys. Decided to order it from Amazon as the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;Waited for 8 days before it showed up. The fragrance would last only for about 2-3 minutes. It was all gone after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going forward I would think twice before ordering Perfumes from Amazon. There is no way to guarantee that the one I got is Original and not a fake one.</li>
            <li> ladies will be drooling over you.  ive had some of the hottest women ive ever met tell me just how fantastic i smell.  appeal to supermodels with this cologne.</li>
            <li> not bad a little to sweet of a smell for men,also very generic smell reminds me of cologne from the 90&#x27;s like ck or tommy</li>
            <li> Wife says santa picked this one out for me. Really like it, lots of cashiers always telling me I smell good.</li>
            <li> Smell good, but scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  :( really disappointed with this buy.  So I can&#x27;t give it more then 3 stars</li>
            <li> i considered this rating because i couldn&#x27;t give it anything less&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t say there was anything i disliked&lt;br /&gt;the scent is just incredible</li>
            <li> The scent and the packaging are outstanding.  This was a Christmas present for a family member who fell in love with the scent and the beauty of the bottle</li>
            <li> It is really good for the price you pay. No better recommendation. I would buy it again for a present without hesitating</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful. It&#x27;s kinda like you put on an okay cologne and then huffed a bag of Lemon Pledge. But then again, Armani isn&#x27;t doing anything better nowadays.</li>
            <li> Even with my OCD and a collection of over 60 different colognes and fragrances, this is one of my favorites. The scent lasts a long time on me and doesn&#x27;t require more than a squirt or two.</li>
            <li> I have a cologne fetish, even though my husband doesn&#x27;t care to wear them. I bought this b/c I have been hearing how great it is. Well, it does smell very good, sexy even, but I could not smell it 10 minutes after he put it on, even putting my nose directly against him I only got a whiff. The package was completely sealed, no problem there. So it gets three stars b/c the smell doesn&#x27;t last and for the price I paid for this I could have gotten something that I love him to wear.</li>
            <li> This cologne gives a crisp clean just out of the shower smell that many women love. Have gotten multiple complements from women while wearing it, usually followed by &amp;#34;What cologne is that?&amp;#34; Smell goes along great with my personal taste as well</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WAY THAT IT SMELLS AND THE OTHER PEOPLE LOVES THE WAY THAT IT SMELLS TO I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO SOME ONE .</li>
            <li> My husband lodes this perfume, but I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the one inside of the mall smells much better than this one. I&#x27;m just saying....</li>
            <li> New fragrance is very interesting and special for all men.&lt;br /&gt;Gucci is still the best fragrance for me . Thank you</li>
            <li> I had tried Gucci Guilty at Macy&#x27;s and I loved it as soon as I smell it. After a while I decided to get it through this site. Unfortunately it is not the same one when I smelled at Macy&#x27;s. I strongly recommend you to buy it through a well known store.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Guilty by Gucci is by far the best scent I&#x27;ve found in a long time.... I bought the cologne for my SIL and the after-shave for my husband this Christmas season...  I tried to stuff their stockings with Guilty last year but every time I shopped in up-scale department stores, they were sold out.  So excited for them to have it this year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guilty has a fruity scent with manly undertones....  Seriously, I&#x27;ve never smelled anything like it!  My husband is NOT one to care what after-shave he uses; however, a year later he is still asking about Guilty.  It smells that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hurry Up Christmas, so I can sneak my husband&#x27;s Guilty and wear it myself...  or maybe Santa will bring me some too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5*****&#x27;s and 2 Thumbs Up!!</li>
            <li> This cologne is more on the sweet side rather than a spicy note but never-the-less a great scent. Lasts me through out the day without fading away and I get very many compliments on it&#x27;s great scent.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new cologne and was always curious about this.  I was with a couple friends (female) and we were at the a store and I asked them to smell a bunch of different ones. This was the winner. If you want a smell that the opposite sex likes...just ask them. They really like it. I&#x27;m typically not a fan of the &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; smelling colognes...it reminds me of the Brute my father used to wear...but it&#x27;s very faint on this and like it.  Most importantly, for me at least, women like it.  So I ordered it through Amazon because it&#x27;s $25-$30 cheaper than in the stores!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband during fathers day. He absolutely loves this cologne and wears it everyday. I love the scent on him too. It&#x27;s sexy, masculine but not overpowering(doesn&#x27;t give me headache). A must have.</li>
            <li> Cologne smells really good and not that expensive for such nice smelling cologne. Got nothing but compliments from this cologne, about to order another bottle</li>
            <li> Friend asks for the specific item and I didn&#x27;t find it anywhere else..&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I didn&#x27;t try it out, but my friend loves it. :)</li>
            <li> 1) Spray on. All over. Like, junior-high-boy-just-discovered-cologne all over.&lt;br /&gt;2) Smell sexier than anyone else in the room, from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;3)?????&lt;br /&gt;4) Profit!</li>
            <li> i will definetly recomended and buy it again and again.... i got it for my boifriend for Christmass and he cant stop using it</li>
            <li> Bought this because my fiance said it smells good plus I wanted to try a different cologne so I bought this and I must say I do like the smell., definitely will look into buying another one.</li>
            <li> Awesome ..... bought this for my husband he loved it. He has others names brands cologne but rather use this one .</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance that does not overwhelm.  Compact bottle, functional spray.  I will buy this again as I like it alot.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my brother. He says he absolutely loves it and thinks its the best perfume he has.</li>
            <li> I love the great deal &amp; price of this cologne. I bought it for my boyfriend. This is a FANSTATIC fragrance for men. Makes me want to kiss him every time he has it on.</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING! Smells like something that has been sitting in the refrigerator for weeks! I was highly upset. I purchased it for my sons birthday. I bought one from Macy&#x27;s for my husband on Christmas last year, &amp; this was not the scent! I thought I was getting a great deal. But sadly I wasted my money. FAKE! FAKE! FAKE! I wanted to rate it NO stars but it won&#x27;t allow me to.</li>
            <li> great buy much cheaper than the stores and is the same product</li>
            <li> Great deal. Bought it for my husband and we both love the smell.</li>
            <li> This product overall had a very attracting smell, I actually love it, seeing as many women have noticed my good smell&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product was that it was a bit to strong for my taste, i like subtle, soft smells. But After 6hours it would wear out a bit and have that soft smell i love</li>
            <li> got this for my dad. it smells so good.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping! can&#x27;t go wrong with this price for this size bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend based on the good reviews and I&#x27;m happy with it.  It smells sooo soo good. It&#x27;s not overpowering and has a really nice smell.  Whenever he wears it I can&#x27;t stop sniffing  him.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne, great smell and lasting. I got the recommendation by watching a couple of videos on YouTube about the top 10 best cologne in 2011-2012 and this was recommended by at least three people in their top 5 so I new I had to get one. Shop around and compare prizes cause I got the best deal here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells good but the scent does not seem to last very long. I cant smell it after 10 mins. It has a good smell though.</li>
            <li> smells really good. got this a a gift and figured it smelled so good i went and got my own.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this cologne. It smells great on my man and lasts all day. It is also cheaper than in stores!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift so no harm no foul (I suppose).  Anyway this smells like a woman&#x27;s dollar store perfume (though it&#x27;s supposed to be for guys).  Not only that but it stays on you like a cloud of the perfume of a chick you pick up at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful stuff.  As I said, zero cost.  If I paid actual human fiat money for it I might have a lower opinion of this \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I must say that most people that do not like this fragrence must not comment. The closest spell to it is RAID, or is it Eau De Off. It even made my throat dry.</li>
            <li> I tried the one at Macy&#x27;s and one spray on my wrist I could smell the next day, even after showering.&lt;br /&gt;This one smells strong, but 5 sprays disappears quick and doesn&#x27;t last. This must be watered down.&lt;br /&gt;Time to go buy from Macy&#x27;s, can&#x27;t trust anyone online.</li>
            <li> He smells so good when he wears this, I am concerned when he wears this and goes out with &amp;#34;the buddies&amp;#34;. Anyway, love it! Thanks Gucci!!</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift to my Fiance and he loved it.</li>
            <li> this guilty by gucci is amazing it came in a nice box and it smell great</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I love this scent for men, it smells so great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last on skin very long. This is not the legitimate product. This is a knockoff that is made of weak oils and probably mostly water.</li>
            <li> I kept commending on how good this guy at work smells and finally asked what it was.  Got this for my man and ohhhh man yes!  It is an attention getter for sure!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after receiving a sample in the mail. Not only did I love it but he did also!  It smells so good on that I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I looked at this in the big chain store for almost double the $$. Came home ordered it here. Great price for the same thing they sell in the big mall stores.</li>
            <li> I bought at Sephora and, this stuff is amazing. There is sooooo much hate about this fragrance and I don&#x27;t understand why. On my skin it lasted 8 hours. Very good longevity. I honestly have over 50 bottles of cologne and this is def top 10. Don&#x27;t let all the you tube haters tell you other wise. They like niche fragrances that no one likes and don&#x27;t get compliments. This is good juice.</li>
            <li> excellent, long-lasting men&#x27;s fragrance.  This will be my 3rd purchase of Guilty.  Hooked on this one.  Never disappoints : )</li>
            <li> While I did not try the department store sample of this perfume, I&#x27;ve used enough fine fragrances to know when I&#x27;m getting a six for a nine.  This smells like bug spray right out of the box, it sprays on in a heavy squirt of water that literally runs down your skin. Also, the bottle looks a little rough around the edges like a poorly made replica.  The bottle also seemed to be leaking from the cap or cover and it was an oily substance....huh??  While it did dry to a nice light smell that I actually liked, I don&#x27;t think this product is genuine and  it does not last at all.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money to save 30 or 40 dollars.  Purchase the fragrance from Macy&#x27;s or Sephora because I think it really is a great fragrance.  I will be asking Amazon for my money back. This seller should be delisted because purchasing a knock-off from Amazon is unacceptable.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been disappointed with something purchased from them, especially because it was a gift for my boyfriend who has been asking for it for months.  I cannot gift this product, now I have to wait to order from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and amazing perfume!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stays long, great smell, geting lots of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;Recommed!&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy less than 3.3 aunces, just not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was in Macy&#x27;s and saw this cologne and loved it...I purchased this cologne for my husband....I LOVE IT...I definitely would recommend this cologne to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Son specificially requested this item.  It&#x27;s an upgrade of the same product he usually uses.  It was a good value with prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Xmas and he loves the smell. It&#x27;s sweet and not over- powering. I love this scent on him to the point of ripping his clothes off :) What can I say, I&#x27;m a happy wife!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! I will definitely be buying more in the future. It&#x27;s a long lasting scent that&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter reached driving age not to long ago and one of the requirements for her license was for her to successfully change a flat tire on her own. I gave her a quick visual of where the equ⋯⋯</li>
            <li> Slightly cheaper to order here than to buy at dept. store.  On time as usual, nice if you want to smell different than everyone wearing Aqua Dijo.</li>
            <li> Gucci Guilty is easily the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It smells absolutely divine and lasts a long time when it is rubbed onto clothes, when I put my leather jacket on the next day it still smelt like this stuff.  The smell is a spicy/sweet and somewhat strong scent, but not so much that it is overpowering by any means.  BE WEARY OF BUYING IT ONLINE THOUGH.  I bought some off of Amazon and when I received the bottle and sprayed it, it was an obvious fake.  I just returned it and bought it from a department store, which I recommend you do with just about any cologne.  The scent is amazing, but tread carefully when buying this stuff because if you spend $50+ on cologne that turns out to be fake you&#x27;re left with nothing more than an expensive paperweight.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and that&#x27;s shocking because he&#x27;s very picky.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he LOVES it!! It smells so good it&#x27;s ridiculous!! The price was just right and I will be buying from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> I thought that I had already left positive feedback. No problem with the product at all. No problem with the shipper. I will by the same product again. I will attempt to use the same seller!!</li>
            <li> Not a fake, the price is ok , and my friend likes it ! But I do not know what his feeling is !</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and this was the cheapest I could find it.</li>
            <li> Very masculine and sexy at the same time.My wife loves it!!!!!</li>
            <li> my husband loves this perfume and especially the price and fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> it was not that strong</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its has never let me down in the past and still has some kicking to do.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my friend and he likes it</li>
            <li> Bought  it for Christmas. Got a great price .way more  expensive  in the department stores&lt;br /&gt;Very happy  and it smells great.</li>
            <li> fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll agree with everyone and say this is a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like cologne that smells nice, unique, lasts long and smells good to others. This fits all the bills. I don&#x27;t think I have ever had a cologne like it.</li>
            <li> It did not smell very good. I bought it for my husband he didn&#x27;t like it. I didn&#x27;t either. I don&#x27;t know if this was the real thing or if we just don&#x27;t like Gucci guilty. The way everyone had been talking I thought this was the newest best cologne out, NOT!</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> Read about this when it first came out,and now i see what the fuss is about......Great smell!!</li>
            <li> Original and that is important</li>
            <li> Definitely not fake and an awesome price!</li>
            <li> This scent is what the ladies come running to. I can&#x27;t keep them off!</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this cologne, I knew I had to have it. After the first 45 min or so, the fragrance settles down and smells so incredibly smooth. Almost like a vanilla or lavender. Or even leather. This is one of my favorite scents. I just love it. I got it at Macy&#x27;s for a good price. 5 stars. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend after hearing him hint that he liked the scent after sampling it at the mall. I, personally, liked the scent as well... so I bought it! He was thrilled... and he thinks I paid the Macy&#x27;s price ;) SCOREEE!!</li>
            <li> i bought it for his birthday gift. he loves it and smell so good. i strongly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a winner hands down! I get too many compliments from both sexes asking what scent I&#x27;m wearing and about how great it smells. Kush &amp; Guilty are my cologne of choice.</li>
            <li> when i got the package i do not believe that they just use bubble package without box.when i open it , the outer packing of the fragrance is broken. They will be my friends&#x27; birthday gifts. who wanna get a gift like this?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas because he said he wanted some. I had never smelled it before but I have to say he busted open the box and started using it as soon as he got it. It smells really good. The extra plus was getting it through here I didnt have to deal with the pushy fragrance sales people at the stores!</li>
            <li> This smells so great!!! Not only do men love it but women do too. Ranked better than most of the other products out there.  It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li> First off, I am not one to write product reviews. With this product I just had to share my opinion. This is with out a doubt, my new favorite cologne. I was in Macy&#x27;s the other day smelling colognes because I wanted to find that one new scent that I just love. Well, I found it in Gucci Guilty. Intense was also a very very good scent but guilty topped it, no doubt about it. I have a wide variety of colognes. I would say about 18-20 different kinds. Jean Paul Gaultier has been my signature scent for years. I don&#x27;t wear it every day, I wear it as my going out cologne. Ya know, when your trying to make a statement and be noticed. Guilty has just taken its place! I guess some might say that it&#x27;s more of a young man&#x27;s cologne. I am only 28 so you might say I would fit into that category. If your looking for that new signature scent, trust me, look no further! I absolutely highly recommend this product. In the stores the 3.0 oz bottle is about $90. Don&#x27;t spend that kind of money. I searched around the internet and found a brand new tester bottle for $48. Its the real thing. The product smells EXACTLY like it did in the store. The bottle is exactly the same with a cap. I was totally pleased.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Valentines Day! Get it for your man, you will not be disappointed!! :) Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a sample in a magazine that I smelled while waiting for a haircut. I thought it smelled nice and I was looking for a new cologne, so I bought it on the amazon app. After I received the cologne I noticed that it didn&#x27;t really smell like it did in the magazine and it also smells like a cologne that I had back in the late 80&#x27;s or early 90&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t remember which one it was but I know it smells very similar. Anyway, I don&#x27;t really like it. Smells too much like medicine or something.</li>
            <li> SE LOS RECOMIENDO TODO LLEGO EN EXCELENTES CONDICIONES, SON RESPONSABLES Y ENVIAN CON PRONTITUD Y MUY BUEN PROTEGIDOS LOS PRODUCTOS</li>
            <li> Its very Girly and strong. I won&#x27;t buy it ever again. Men&#x27; perfume used to be nice. What happened Gucci?</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Amazon. I received it pretty fast. When I used it for the first time, it was good and smelled good. However, the cologne smell goes entirly away after the first hour. Then you cant smell the cologne. As if I wasnt wearing anything.</li>
            <li> Has a very nice smell, I would highly recommend this one. Lasts long but the price is little bit high.</li>
