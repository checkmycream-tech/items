            <li>floral rose</li>
            <li>Always keep one handy for myself and always buy to send to my families.  </li>
            <li>I gave this 2 stars because the bottle is refillable, nice glass bottle and sturdy sprayer.</li>
            <li>It definitely is the 4711 from happy days gone by!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!  </li>
            <li>We are both enjoying it.</li>
            <li>i, like many others, have been on the search for the perfume holy grail for over a decade.</li>
            <li>something exotic, but not too exotic.</li>
            <li>this sells them more cologne?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A favorite scent and glad to find it.  </li>
            <li>More of a room spray or carpet freshener.</li>
            <li>Maybe the perfume would have more staying power than the eau de cologne.</li>
            <li>LIke this more than my L&#x27;occitane Vetyver</li>
            <li>I love the 4711 men&#x27;s cologne fragrance and have used it over many years.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and it has kept it&#x27;s true scent.(Rumored to be a favorite of JFK too!)</li>
            <li>This fragrance is clean and sporty and just generally makes you feel great!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i wish there was a more potent formula available, as i would snap that up in a moment.</li>
            <li>Fabulous unisex refreshing fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>good price and fast shipping...</li>
            <li>Just right for a warm evening, sharing a glass of wine in the courtyard.</li>
            <li>i have also purchased the colognettes and quite enjoy having this scent available in a refreshing way while out and about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased with the seller, as my bottle of 4711 came in the mail just a few days after I ordered it, in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>I carry it with me wherever I go for a quick spritz to pick me up!  </li>
            <li>The colonge is great an old time classic!</li>
            <li>Also I wrote a special note to each person and it was not included on it.</li>
            <li>My husband has worn this cologne for over 30 years; I love the clean, fresh, citrus scent so much that I wear it myself now.  </li>
            <li>something fresh.</li>
            <li>Really like this cologne, smells fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>I remember my Dad had this when I was in high school (1980&#x27;s) and I would sneak some because it seemed cool that it was so unisex.</li>
            <li>something crisp, but not too crisp.</li>
            <li>hot summer days.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrances</li>
            <li>Maybe the fact that the bottle came to my home so hot</li>
            <li>It has a wonderfully fresh and unique fragrance so different from modern colognes and perfumes.</li>
            <li>still a classic!</li>
            <li>I am very upset about those two issues.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it was an old favorite when I was younger, and I wanted my daughter to try it...</li>
            <li>The scent is light and doesn&#x27;t last long so you will need to reapply after about an hour, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive that it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of 4711, it brings back memories of when my high school German exchange student brought my mom a bottle direct from Cologne, Germany.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Old reliable...</li>
            <li>in the mean time, i am incredibly pleased to have found this scent at all.</li>
            <li>somewhere amazing (sounds ridiculous, but is actually true).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bottle is small enough for easy travel...</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to get some 4711 for a long time; it&#x27;s got history (the oldest cologne still made in Germany by the original manufacturer), has been worn in England and other countries for the last 2 centuries, was worn by JFK who was introduced to it in England when he lived there in the 1930s.</li>
            <li>Reminds them of the old days back in Holland (except my cousin).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i have read several articles stating what makes up this scent (which has apparently has been a closely guarded secret for a couple centuries), but the most common elements present are the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;citrus</li>

            <li> Wow!  What a great fragrance!  We used to be crazy for it in High School and I had forgotten all about it until I saw it on Amazon.  Had to get it!  It definitely is the 4711 from happy days gone by!  This fragrance is clean and sporty and just generally makes you feel great!  I carry it with me wherever I go for a quick spritz to pick me up!  It will definitely be on my Christmas list!</li>
            <li> This is in my opinion the most refreshing and the best cologne ever.  Enjoy!  Especially great in summer and good for both men and women!  Buy this, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I remember my Dad had this when I was in high school (1980&#x27;s) and I would sneak some because it seemed cool that it was so unisex. My husband wanted something casual yet not too he-man like and I recalled 4711. We are both enjoying it. Just right for a warm evening, sharing a glass of wine in the courtyard.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for providing a pleasant smell for many hours. It is not sweet and flowery and comes in a spray bottle which is well designed for a steady, even application on the skin. Plus, it is not overly expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this cologne for over 30 years; I love the clean, fresh, citrus scent so much that I wear it myself now.  My 12-year-old son wears it, too; a big improvement over the TAG spray he&#x27;s been wearing!</li>
            <li> i, like many others, have been on the search for the perfume holy grail for over a decade. something fresh. something crisp, but not too crisp. something exotic, but not too exotic. something that can be worn during the day and evening. something that will always work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4711 is that scent! this reminds me of various travels i have taken, and spritzing this on feels like i have been transported somewhere amazing (sounds ridiculous, but is actually true).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have read several articles stating what makes up this scent (which has apparently has been a closely guarded secret for a couple centuries), but the most common elements present are the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;citrus&lt;br /&gt;rosemary&lt;br /&gt;sandalwood&lt;br /&gt;light floral rose&lt;br /&gt;lavender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only gripe is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all. i can spray it on now, and in a couple of hours no scent remains. i thought perhaps i received a \\&quot;faulty\\&quot; bottle, so i ordered this smaller size (for travel), and the same issue persists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe this sells them more cologne?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish there was a more potent formula available, as i would snap that up in a moment. in the mean time, i am incredibly pleased to have found this scent at all. i have also purchased the colognettes and quite enjoy having this scent available in a refreshing way while out and about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Old reliable... I have used this for years and it has kept it&#x27;s true scent.(Rumored to be a favorite of JFK too!)</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get some 4711 for a long time; it&#x27;s got history (the oldest cologne still made in Germany by the original manufacturer), has been worn in England and other countries for the last 2 centuries, was worn by JFK who was introduced to it in England when he lived there in the 1930s. It has a wonderfully fresh and unique fragrance so different from modern colognes and perfumes. The scent is light and doesn&#x27;t last long so you will need to reapply after about an hour, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive that it&#x27;s well worth the price. I was extremely pleased with the seller, as my bottle of 4711 came in the mail just a few days after I ordered it, in excellent condition. It comes in a beautiful bottle with a turquoise and gold label. I definitely recommend the 4711 and the seller.</li>
            <li> Fabulous unisex refreshing fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;In the fifties, whilst I visited Cologne, Germany, the Apothecary shop &amp;#34;christened &amp;#34; shoppers with 4711 enroute through their doors!!!!  I&#x27;ve  loved it ever since! Men and women carried a 4711 scented white handkerchief on hot summer days.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrances trigger memories!&lt;br /&gt;This 2 oz. spray bottle travels well!</li>
            <li> Always keep one handy for myself and always buy to send to my families.  My Mum&#x27;s been always using this product since we were kids.</li>
            <li> A favorite scent and glad to find it.  Not available readily....</li>
            <li> Not a fragrance I will use. More of a room spray or carpet freshener. I&#x27;m a little amazed that it&#x27;s still in production.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband, he has wanted it for so long but tends to be a little expensive. The price was great and my husband is happy.</li>
            <li> I recently received this 4711 cologne spray and it has no real definitive scent to it. Almost like a bottle of faint alcohol. It looks like water. I gave this 2 stars because the bottle is refillable, nice glass bottle and sturdy sprayer. Maybe the fact that the bottle came to my home so hot I couldnt hold it for 10 minutes from the heat on the UPS truck. I may try it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of 4711, it brings back memories of when my high school German exchange student brought my mom a bottle direct from Cologne, Germany. However, as soon as it dries on your skin, the scent is gone. So disappointing! It would get five stars if it lasted at all. Maybe the perfume would have more staying power than the eau de cologne.</li>
            <li> The colonge is great an old time classic! Shipped one to my mom, cousin, aunt and grandma. They all love it!  Reminds them of the old days back in Holland (except my cousin).  My mom, aunt and grandma are from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was the price being printed on the receipt when I specifically mark the box  NOT to include it. Also I wrote a special note to each person and it was not included on it. I am very upset about those two issues. If I knew that was going to happen then I would have personally gave it to each relative.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand since the 80&#x27;s...love it.  good price and fast shipping...the bottle is small enough for easy travel...</li>
            <li> Really like this cologne, smells fresh, and clean. Best part it is dirt cheap. LIke this more than my L&#x27;occitane Vetyver</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was an old favorite when I was younger, and I wanted my daughter to try it...still a classic!</li>
            <li> I love the 4711 men&#x27;s cologne fragrance and have used it over many years. This product is designed for use by both men and women  and as a spray. I find  that it seems to have a slightly different fragrance than the men&#x27;s cologne.  I find I don&#x27;t like it quite as well.  It&#x27;s O.K., but I prefer the other product.</li>
