            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this mascara.  </li>
            <li>(Yes, everything makes me cry!)  :D</li>
            <li>Great mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a brand that doesn&#x27;t clump or irritate my eyes and the Great Eye Mascara doesn&#x27;t do either.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the good news.</li>
            <li>The good news?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve gotten better results from the cheaper drugstore brands!</li>
            <li>you will LOVE this!</li>
            <li>This is wonderful, gentle mascara.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice.</li>
            <li>The color is nice.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST mascara by far!</li>
            <li>i could keep putting more on with out clups.</li>
            <li>; But I will not be able to give you the 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to apply more than one coat, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I even loved the product so much that I made a review for it! https://youtu.be/rWUOz8U-_mI</li>
            <li>But if you want a mascara that looks natural, is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t flake or gunk up your lashes, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, the product design was great and the overall quality was outstanding!</li>
            <li>It comes off easily</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my eyes either, which is a huge issue I have with a lot of mascaras.</li>
            <li>Not only is the price reasonable, the product is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I. Loved this product is so natural  and ligh.</li>
            <li>, I apply a primer first then this as a top coat which covers fine and no clumping.  </li>
            <li>The rest of what they say is true.</li>
            <li>But since it barely looks like I have any mascara on after using, the brush isn&#x27;t doing a whole lot of good.</li>
            <li>actually looks like it could be effective.</li>
            <li>they look thick and full, great product.</li>
            <li>My lashes are too light to be seen at all without mascara, but I don&#x27;t like the clumps and excess mascara that makes my lashes look anything but natural.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had hypoallergenic mascaras that were just as good if not better</li>
            <li>(I use Estee Lauder Gentle Eye Makeup Remover).  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I truly wanted to love this mascara, but the truth is, the tube seems to be almost empty.</li>
            <li>I thought the applicator would be straight</li>
            <li>I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>Good brush, applied well, no smearing or clumping but was not thick enough for me - will try a thicker version by the same vendor next time</li>
            <li>it has that soft velvet look , and for the price!!</li>
            <li>I waited to write this review until after I used it nearly 10 times, mainly because when I first open a new mascara, it sometimes takes a few applications before the brush gets enough product on it to really be effective.</li>
            <li>I used a well-known mascara for years and always had burning eyes - especially when I teared-up while reading or watching something happy or sad.  </li>
            <li>It barely shows up on my lashes at all.</li>

            <li> I have to add at least 3 coats before I can even see my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Sorry &amp;#34;Beauty</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since it&#x27;s mascara, it&#x27;s not like I can return it for a refund</li>
            <li> so the bad news is, I&#x27;m giving you a 3.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i could keep putting more on with out clups. My lashes also stick together with mascara and they dont with this they look thick and full, great product.</li>
            <li> Great product! It arrived quickly, the product design was great and the overall quality was outstanding! 10/10 would recommend! I even loved the product so much that I made a review for it! https://youtu.be/rWUOz8U-_mI</li>
            <li> I gave this mascara 4 stars because it does not add the volume that it claims. I have to add at least 3 coats before I can even see my eyelashes. The rest of what they say is true. Not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great mascara.  Does not clump and keeps lashes separated on application.  It does not irritate my eyes either, which is a huge issue I have with a lot of mascaras.</li>
            <li> I will say it made my lashes darker, but it did not thicken or make look darker. Very disappointed. You don&#x27;t know until you try it. I hope this helps someone else.</li>
            <li> It was all dried out. I just haven&#x27;t felt like returning. I should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of mascara and have been disappointed.  Not this time!  Not only is the price reasonable, the product is excellent.  My lashes are too light to be seen at all without mascara, but I don&#x27;t like the clumps and excess mascara that makes my lashes look anything but natural.  This product does exactly what I wanted.  My lashes are defined, remained separated (unlike with other brands) and are visible!  When it&#x27;s time to remove makeup, there&#x27;s no problem.  It comes off easily (I use Estee Lauder Gentle Eye Makeup Remover).  I&#x27;m very pleased and  think you will be too.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a brand that doesn&#x27;t clump or irritate my eyes and the Great Eye Mascara doesn&#x27;t do either. If you&#x27;re looking for a mascara that builds and lengthens lashes, this isn&#x27;t for you. But if you want a mascara that looks natural, is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t flake or gunk up your lashes, this is a great choice. I&#x27;ll buy it again.I</li>
            <li> Good brush, applied well, no smearing or clumping but was not thick enough for me - will try a thicker version by the same vendor next time</li>
            <li> You have to apply it 3-4 times to see a difference</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, gentle mascara.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice. The color is nice. I truly wanted to love this mascara, but the truth is, the tube seems to be almost empty. I ran the wand/brush around the tube to collect enough product to actually make it show up on my lashes. It took a few attempts to layer some color on my lashes, but they definitely did NOT get thinker or longer. I bought two, as they were allegedly on sale for only $10 each, so I stocked up. Sad to say, I am thinking about sending at least one of these back. Sorry &amp;#34;Beauty it is,&amp;#34; But I will not be able to give you the 5 stars. You get 2 for the brush and 1 for the color and the fact that since there&#x27;s not much there, there is no way it will clump so that adds 1. That&#x27;s the good news. Being mostly empty means I subtract 1 so the bad news is, I&#x27;m giving you a 3.</li>
            <li> Bought this a 2nd time.  I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I thought the applicator would be straight but it came curved.  I do like the product however, I apply a primer first then this as a top coat which covers fine and no clumping.  Also my eyes are sensitive and tear up with other products, this didn&#x27;t make them do that.  I can wear it all day with no smudging or flaking.  I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> I. Loved this product is so natural  and ligh. It feels as if im not wearing  any mascara,it does not irritates my eyes. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mascara.  I don&#x27;t need to apply more than one coat, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  I used a well-known mascara for years and always had burning eyes - especially when I teared-up while reading or watching something happy or sad.  (Yes, everything makes me cry!)  :D</li>
            <li> This mascara is a huge disappointment. I expected it to be better than some drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past; this product is slightly pricier than Maybelline or L&#x27;Oreal mascaras I&#x27;ve used. However, I&#x27;ve gotten better results from the cheaper drugstore brands! I wanted a lengthening and volumizing mascara because my lashes are short and sparse. This product didn&#x27;t lengthen OR volumize. It barely shows up on my lashes at all. I waited to write this review until after I used it nearly 10 times, mainly because when I first open a new mascara, it sometimes takes a few applications before the brush gets enough product on it to really be effective. Unfortunately, since it&#x27;s mascara, it&#x27;s not like I can return it for a refund so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  The good news? It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and the brush actually looks like it could be effective. But since it barely looks like I have any mascara on after using, the brush isn&#x27;t doing a whole lot of good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hypoallergenic mascaras that were just as good if not better</li>
            <li> No coming mascara eye  please</li>
            <li> This is the BEST mascara by far! makes your lashes look long and luscious! you will LOVE this! My eyes always teared up the minute I applied mascara , but not with this one. . it has that soft velvet look , and for the price!!</li>
