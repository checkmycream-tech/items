            <li>Amazing case!!</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s so beautiful</li>
            <li>My friend really loved her gift.</li>
            <li>First, let me say the packaging, in which this was shipped to me in, was AWESOME!</li>
            <li>PRODUCT, AMAZING SHIPPING PACKING and of course. .AWESOME</li>
            <li>nice item for the money</li>
            <li>The box could&#x27;ve fallen out of a moving UPS truck, at 45mph, and would&#x27;ve made it, scratch/dent free!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so far so good!  </li>
            <li>Rolls nice even when it is full.</li>
            <li>She says it is easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>She goes to peoples home and has the case filled with jewelry styles that people requested.  </li>
            <li>actual makeup case is Amazing too!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping it would be and more</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, locks don&#x27;t work, and one of the pegs to keep it standing straight...</li>
            <li>All my products fit in it very well.</li>
            <li>right out of this case.  </li>
            <li>Its Nice dont get me wrong, for the price you get a nice tote, however its just not big enough for myself, Its not the best quality inside and the clasp are not the strongest, However it was the cheapest i found in this design so for the money its not that bad of a tote, and I do LOVE The design how it looks in person is great!</li>
            <li>Very spacious!</li>
            <li>whatever those are called, fell off the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Sooo much room and very well made.</li>
            <li>The locking mechanism are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This actually feels like a full blown piece of luggage, versus a makeup case.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on taking it many places outside my home, or else the following would be an issue: the &amp;#34;pulley&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Beautiful, but for the price of over $118.00 dollars, it was very poorly made....</li>
            <li>The makeup case was not part of the order when it clearly shows it in the picture</li>

            <li> My friend really loved her gift.</li>
            <li> First, let me say the packaging, in which this was shipped to me in, was AWESOME! The box could&#x27;ve fallen out of a moving UPS truck, at 45mph, and would&#x27;ve made it, scratch/dent free! Not exagerating people. . very serious..&lt;br /&gt;The actual makeup case is Amazing too!  Sooo much room and very well made. The locking mechanism are very sturdy. This actually feels like a full blown piece of luggage, versus a makeup case. I would totally trust this in an airplane cargo hold and not worry about ir breaking. B0TTOM LINE. .&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING PRODUCT, AMAZING SHIPPING PACKING and of course. .AWESOME priceðŸ˜ƒ SOOO HAPPY WITH THIS!</li>
            <li> Very spacious! Keeps all my make-up in one place within reach. I don&#x27;t plan on taking it many places outside my home, or else the following would be an issue: the &amp;#34;pulley&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that stable. So, handle with care if you&#x27;re going to travel with it!</li>
            <li> Not very durable took it to one dance competition and clasps were falling off.</li>
            <li> My daughter sells jewelry...right out of this case.  She goes to peoples home and has the case filled with jewelry styles that people requested.  She says it is easy to pack.  Rolls nice even when it is full.</li>

            <li> My girlfriend travels to houses to do hair and this is perfect. The only downfall is that it is a bit heavy. You can divide it in two and do whatever it is you need to do! Great buy!</li>
