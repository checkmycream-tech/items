            <li>Easy to use, and makes my makeup go on smoohly</li>
            <li>This is just an ok brush, nothing special.</li>
            <li>By far the best brush I&#x27;ve owned so far but do not pay more than $3 for this brush as that&#x27;s what it goes for at elf website or in store</li>
            <li>Nice brush and very affordable arrived at a reasonable time elf products are good quality.</li>
            <li>And is easy to clean ....</li>
            <li>They are also available at Target.</li>
            <li>brushes are a fabulous bargain, and my Studio Complexion Brushes have lasted for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really fantastic</li>
            <li>I think I will smoothly put powders and cheeks on my face by using this.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I love this brush bristles are super soft, it feels wonderful on your face and gives you even application i would totally recommend.</li>
            <li>It does the job well and for an economical price!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good overall complexion brush for applying a light amount of powder evenly.</li>
            <li>Good quality for a low price!!</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, and depending on what you need it for, that could be a plus for many.</li>
            <li>But for $3, it&#x27;s a steal and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It Apply&#x27;s evenly and softly. :)</li>
            <li>i know whatever it was, it was worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely soft and great for loose powders and compact powders.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve washed three times already (do not use it everyday) but is a great brush and the price is very affordable</li>
            <li>I use several Elf brushes and I love them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got to say i really like it!</li>
            <li>I love that it is taklon, so does not harbor bacteria (if cleaned properly).</li>
            <li>so glad I got this one totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>The elf brush is the only brush I have been able to find that does not shed all over the place when you use it.  </li>
            <li>brushes, this complexion brush is soft and the bristles are securely attached.  </li>
            <li>like to apply my SPF moisturizer first then mix my foundation and moisturizer together</li>
            <li>Now about the actual brush it is SUPER soft like petting an animal soft, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It blends very well and leaves my face smooth and natural looking.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm for great contouring but soft</li>
            <li>It is a nice soft brush and seems to last quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Super soft on the skin, distributes setting powders evenly.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a little more for a better and longer lasting brush.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well</li>
            <li>Thought it would be better--Wore out fast.</li>
            <li>And this brush&#x60;s tip is very volumy otherwise brush itself is very fitful size to use.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>Thats how much it costs at the ELF website or at the drugstore (target) for US customers.</li>
            <li>I know that this brush probably isn&#x27;t for bronzer, but like I said, it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash and dry.</li>
            <li>Love the softness, but I would buy a different brush next time.</li>
            <li>it is soooo soft, it&#x27;s never lost a bristle (and i clean it regularly) and it applies my powder evenly without leaving excess.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>The brush handle was long enough for ease of use, so overall, I was very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and I have yet to see any shedding.</li>
            <li>also is very very soft applies powder</li>
            <li>blush brushes and I have found them to be of high quality -- they&#x27;re soft and none of the bristles fall out.  </li>
            <li>This brush is so soft!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>its soft, it doesnt shed at all!</li>
            <li>It picks up loose powder (the only thing I&#x27;ve used it for, so far) quite well, and it spreads the powder smoothly and evenly over all areas of my face (nose, cheeks, chin, and forehead).  </li>
            <li>and I hand wash them frequently.</li>
            <li>The brush is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that it&#x27;s soft?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it for liquid foundation as it is too soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased a couple of these brushes directly from e.l.f.</li>
            <li>bristle tip of this brush is so soft and never prickle my face.</li>
            <li>BUT it was too soft in a way that it barely picks up any product.</li>
            <li>The feel is amazingly soft, and it definitely keeps its shape.</li>
            <li>I did make up on three different people using this brush and they all told me how soft it felt,</li>
            <li>Soft, fluffy, and do not shed, I still have and use the first one I ever bought over three years ago.</li>
            <li>I had gotten a small kabuki brush from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but the bristles were really stiff, so the powder felt kind of smudgy on my face.</li>
            <li>Well actually you CAN beat the price if you buy directly from the ELF website or at Walmart, but this brand is not only affordable, but also CRUELTY-FREE!!!</li>
            <li>I clean them with baby shampoo every other week and hang upside down to dry.</li>

            <li> Soft, fluffy, and do not shed, I still have and use the first one I ever bought over three years ago.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a small kabuki brush from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but the bristles were really stiff, so the powder felt kind of smudgy on my face.</li>
            <li> Well actually you CAN beat the price if you buy directly from the ELF website or at Walmart, but this brand is not only affordable, but also CRUELTY-FREE!!!</li>
            <li> I clean them with baby shampoo every other week and hang upside down to dry.</li>
            <li> but I feel certain that no bristles will come loose even after a year of everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes that are must have from the STUDIO line are: the kabuki, the complexion, the blush brush, and the &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; brush (for blending eyeshadow) and the eyeliner flat brush (use for applying eyebrow makeup).</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, but I&#x27;ve had a few already fallen out (not a lot, just a couple).</li>
            <li> It actually holds a LOT of loose powder, so you may want to tap the brush against the side of your powder container to knock some off before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only complaint is, it&#x27;s not very dense compared to other brushes i have (real techniques, two faced, sigma f80).</li>
            <li> That is also depending on if you use it for dry powder or if you wet it to apply make-</li>
            <li> So when I was looking for something a little bigger to apply powder, I considered this one.  </li>
            <li> have only used this brush for a few weeks</li>
            <li> my other e.l.f.</li>
            <li> At less than $5 each, you can afford to have multiples...</li>
            <li> bought this about 3 or 4 months ago, not sure what i paid for it, but i think it was less than $5.</li>
            <li> The base is thick and easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> but I hate how ELF charges double on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I find that it applies it in a very subtle amount.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for $3.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended, but don&#x27;t go paying outrageous prices from a third party seller!</li>

            <li> I use several Elf brushes and I love them. They hold up well and I hand wash them frequently.</li>
            <li> By far the best brush I&#x27;ve owned so far but do not pay more than $3 for this brush as that&#x27;s what it goes for at elf website or in store - I got mine at Walmart.  It&#x27;s great for applying foundation and blending.  I&#x27;ve even used it to apply blush and contour so it&#x27;s great brush used for all purposes.  You can&#x27;t go wrong for $3.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this at Target and I&#x27;ve got to say i really like it! Super soft on the skin, distributes setting powders evenly.  My only complaint is, it&#x27;s not very dense compared to other brushes i have (real techniques, two faced, sigma f80). But for $3, it&#x27;s a steal and worth every penny. 😊</li>
            <li> When I received the package I loved that it came rather quickly. It was packaged very well and I love that. Now about the actual brush it is SUPER soft like petting an animal soft, which is a good thing. BUT it was too soft in a way that it barely picks up any product. I feel as if I&#x27;m  not getting the proper application when using this brush. Love the softness, but I would buy a different brush next time.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage i get when i use this complexion brush . I used to use my fingers and i can tell the difference .  This brush is perfect for blending eye makeup as well ...And is easy to clean ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one .</li>
            <li> The brush is extremely soft. I had gotten a small kabuki brush from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but the bristles were really stiff, so the powder felt kind of smudgy on my face. The brush handle was long enough for ease of use, so overall, I was very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and very affordable arrived at a reasonable time elf products are good quality. Definitely would recommend this item</li>
            <li> This is just an ok brush, nothing special. The bristles are very soft, and depending on what you need it for, that could be a plus for many. A kabookie brush it is not. Kinda what I was looking for, so more my fault on that one. I will say that the  customer service was absolutely wonderful. Got here in record time, and I received the nicest email letting me know it was on its way.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, one of the best brushes in the market. It has great value, big saving, superb quality! e.l.f. brushes more power!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush at target for only $1&lt;br /&gt;and i can say I LOVE IT. It&#x27;s extremely soft and great for loose powders and compact powders. It Apply&#x27;s evenly and softly. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good overall complexion brush for applying a light amount of powder evenly. The bristles are very soft, but I&#x27;ve had a few already fallen out (not a lot, just a couple). The base is thick and easy to hold and maneuver. It does the job well and for an economical price! Recommended.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! My wife told me that this is the best one she has owned and she is a cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> The STUDIO line brushes by e.l.f. are the best! Soft, fluffy, and do not shed, I still have and use the first one I ever bought over three years ago. I love that it is taklon, so does not harbor bacteria (if cleaned properly). Plus it is a lot softer feel than most animal hair brushes. At less than $5 each, you can afford to have multiples... I keep one at home, one at work, and one in my travel bag. I have also bought the sets and given as gifts, and they went over quite well. The brushes that are must have from the STUDIO line are: the kabuki, the complexion, the blush brush, and the &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; brush (for blending eyeshadow) and the eyeliner flat brush (use for applying eyebrow makeup).</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it all of the the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive brush, this is really great. The bristles are very soft and I have yet to see any shedding. I clean them with baby shampoo every other week and hang upside down to dry. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, so soft and works great to put my powder on</li>
            <li> I love this brush bristles are super soft, it feels wonderful on your face and gives you even application i would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! Well actually you CAN beat the price if you buy directly from the ELF website or at Walmart, but this brand is not only affordable, but also CRUELTY-FREE!!! ELF has a bunch of great makeup products. I love them!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, it does &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; like some brushes tend to.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft! I love the way it feels on my skin. It&#x27;s easy to wash and dry. It doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s shape or bounce. Did I mention that it&#x27;s soft? Goodness it feels heavenly on my skin. Helps that it&#x27;s antibacterial too. I keep it in my bags  so it is supposed to suffer but I see no damage on it. Doesn&#x27;t show wear either. I love love love this brush. IT&#x27;S SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush to apply powder or maybe even blush. I don&#x27;t recommend it for liquid foundation as it is too soft. But all in all a good brush. Very soft, feels nice!</li>
            <li> its soft, it doesnt shed at all! so i love it. It blends very well and leaves my face smooth and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I purchased a couple of these brushes directly from e.l.f. They are also available at Target. The feel is amazingly soft, and it definitely keeps its shape. It&#x27;s great for applying powder and blush -- much better than using a puff. E.l.f. brushes are a fabulous bargain, and my Studio Complexion Brushes have lasted for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, but don&#x27;t go paying outrageous prices from a third party seller!</li>
            <li> Thought it would be better--Wore out fast. I would recommend spending a little more for a better and longer lasting brush.</li>
            <li> Love the softness of the brush! Great product for great price!</li>
            <li> I love this powder brush the quality is awesome no one hair has come out of it and I&#x27;ve washed three times already (do not use it everyday) but is a great brush and the price is very affordable also is very very soft applies powder so well (I use it mostly for translucent powder) I did make up on three different people using this brush and they all told me how soft it felt, so glad I got this one totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> The elf brush is the only brush I have been able to find that does not shed all over the place when you use it.  It is a nice soft brush and seems to last quite a while.  I use it for pressed mineral powder and it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Great product and price.</li>
            <li> Very good and on time</li>
            <li> Once this item did&#x60;t reach to my house. But again I ordered this and I could get this. It is really fantastic brush!!&lt;br /&gt;The bristle tip of this brush is so soft and never prickle my face. And this brush&#x60;s tip is very volumy otherwise brush itself is very fitful size to use.&lt;br /&gt;In every aspect, it is very nice product!!  I think I will smoothly put powders and cheeks on my face by using this.&lt;br /&gt;Very thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush but I hate how ELF charges double on Amazon. Do not pay over $3 for this brush. Thats how much it costs at the ELF website or at the drugstore (target) for US customers. 5 stars for the brush itself but 3 for it being overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a couple of e.l.f. blush brushes and I have found them to be of high quality -- they&#x27;re soft and none of the bristles fall out.  So when I was looking for something a little bigger to apply powder, I considered this one.  After having used it, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like my other e.l.f. brushes, this complexion brush is soft and the bristles are securely attached.  (Love that it&#x27;s inexpensive, as well, since I&#x27;m on a budget.)  It picks up loose powder (the only thing I&#x27;ve used it for, so far) quite well, and it spreads the powder smoothly and evenly over all areas of my face (nose, cheeks, chin, and forehead).  It actually holds a LOT of loose powder, so you may want to tap the brush against the side of your powder container to knock some off before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found blending the powder easier to do with my fingers, personally.  But this brush was a great way to get the powder out of the container and onto my face.  I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This item shipped quickly &amp; nicely packaged.&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is perfect for applying make-up. The bristles are firm for great contouring but soft so it glides on your skin perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this brush for a few weeks but I feel certain that no bristles will come loose even after a year of everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;Do follow the directions on cleaning it, especially after using it every day for a month. That is also depending on if you use it for dry powder or if you wet it to apply make-up.&lt;br /&gt;I like to apply my SPF moisturizer first then mix my foundation and moisturizer together then I use the brush to apply it to my skin. It creates an airbrushed look that I love.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you love the brush too!!</li>
            <li> i LOVE this brush! it is soooo soft, it&#x27;s never lost a bristle (and i clean it regularly) and it applies my powder evenly without leaving excess.&lt;br /&gt;i bought this about 3 or 4 months ago, not sure what i paid for it, but i think it was less than $5. i know whatever it was, it was worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will definitely be buying this brand of brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, and for the price! I use it to apply my bronzer. It works me and I find that it applies it in a very subtle amount. I know that this brush probably isn&#x27;t for bronzer, but like I said, it works very well for me. This brush is also easy to clean, and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for bronzed or veil, but not the best quality</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!!!! Good quality for a low price!! Easy to use, and makes my makeup go on smoohly</li>
