            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick !!!</li>
            <li>Gorgeous on brown skin.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I had to apply it about four times in order to get a good layer of color, but the color was off.</li>
            <li>The shade is amazing just like in the picture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it four stars because although I wound up loving the color, it&#x27;s not the color that I ordered.</li>
            <li>So far its my best lip color.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; aspect of it makes it very smooth and it doesn&#x27;t cake on your lips.</li>
            <li>Love this color on my brown skin&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>Also, there was so much hype about the Nyx Butter Lipsticks that I thought it would be great.</li>
            <li>Still cute, just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting, beautiful color, and it arrived a week early.</li>
            <li>part is it feels creamy and light.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Rich and pretty colors</li>
            <li>Color is a little lighter &amp; more purple than I expected, but I&#x27;m still very happy.</li>
            <li>it almost everyday lol</li>
            <li>I purchased this in the color &amp;#34;hunk.&amp;#34; Although it goes on completely smooth, lasts long, and it beautiful, it is definitely not the color pictured here.</li>
            <li>After building it up a couple times, it was really pretty.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love the way it goes on, don&#x27;t love that the color is much lighter and more pink than expected.</li>
            <li>I love purple and this lipstick is a fun purple that fades into a a purple pink.</li>
            <li>I am interested in trying other colors, hopefully more of a purple color next time! :)</li>
            <li>but it turns out more of a hot pink color.</li>
            <li>lipstick is pretty creamy and easy to reply, though it did accentuate dry spots/cracks in my lips.</li>
            <li>I liked this color, it was warmer toned than I expected and was a little more fuchsia than violet in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much more wearable than I expected a purple lipstick to be.</li>
            <li>It goes on so soft !!!</li>
            <li>I thought they were a little bit more matte</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a tinted lip balm in that you can layer it so that you only have a little color or a lot of color.</li>
            <li>This was not what I expected: the color did not show up on my pink lips however the texture was nice.</li>

            <li> Arrived quickly. Color is a little lighter &amp; more purple than I expected, but I&#x27;m still very happy.</li>
            <li> Wears off and color was not up to my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;Good part is it feels creamy and light. But not my type of lipstick.</li>
            <li> So far its my best lip color. The shade is amazing just like in the picture and I got a lot of compliments wearing this color. oh and no more dry lips and it kinda stained your lips so i like that.lips moisturize all day and colored all day,</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the color &amp;#34;hunk.&amp;#34; Although it goes on completely smooth, lasts long, and it beautiful, it is definitely not the color pictured here. It&#x27;s basically red. It doesn&#x27;t look dark purple at all. I still like it though. Just not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Love this color on my brown skin&lt;br /&gt;Used it almost everyday lol</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick a lot. The &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; aspect of it makes it very smooth and it doesn&#x27;t cake on your lips. It&#x27;s kind of like a tinted lip balm in that you can layer it so that you only have a little color or a lot of color. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because although I wound up loving the color, it&#x27;s not the color that I ordered. I ordered the &amp;#34;Hunk&amp;#34; color which is described as &amp;#34;Blue Violet.&amp;#34; I expected a purple color. What I got was a red with purplish tones. It works well with my skin tone, but it&#x27;s not the purple I wanted.</li>
            <li> Awesome. This Purple lipstick glides on truly like butter and has a shine to it. I love purple and this lipstick is a fun purple that fades into a a purple pink. Gorgeous on brown skin.</li>
            <li> I liked this color, it was warmer toned than I expected and was a little more fuchsia than violet in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick is pretty creamy and easy to reply, though it did accentuate dry spots/cracks in my lips. After building it up a couple times, it was really pretty. Much more wearable than I expected a purple lipstick to be.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick !!! It goes on so soft !!! Lasts all day long !!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Good price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too creamy!!! I thought they were a little bit more matte</li>
            <li> Rich and pretty colors</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected: the color did not show up on my pink lips however the texture was nice.</li>
            <li> The color was too &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; for my taste.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting, beautiful color, and it arrived a week early.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a darker purple but it turns out more of a hot pink color. Also, there was so much hype about the Nyx Butter Lipsticks that I thought it would be great. I was a bit disappointed to be honest. I had to apply it about four times in order to get a good layer of color, but the color was off. I can say that this will last almost all day because it stains your lips. I am interested in trying other colors, hopefully more of a purple color next time! :)</li>
            <li> Love the way it goes on, don&#x27;t love that the color is much lighter and more pink than expected. Still cute, just not what I wanted.</li>
