    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s of excellent quality</li>
            <li>Excellent</li>
            <li>i use this brush every time I do a smokey eye and its a perfect size for my crease and blending</li>
            <li>(the #&#x27;s have all rubbed off, lol!)</li>
            <li>Best brush you can get</li>
            <li>The price is great</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you&#x27;re going to buy a good brush, save your money and get this one.  </li>
            <li>A good addition to my brush collection.</li>
            <li>Love this brush!</li>
            <li>I was beyond pleased with the shipping, it took around 4 days!</li>
            <li>Nice brush, seems to be constructed nice, works/blends as should.  </li>
            <li>, please choose this one, you know the key for perfect looking eyeshadow is blend blend blend!!</li>
            <li>It works much better for this purpose, allowing me to blend drier concealer creams underneath my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I find the ELF brushes (the $1 or $3 ones) to be much better for shadow application.  </li>
            <li>favorite blending brush I have ever owned</li>
            <li>I love MAC</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the product when i received it &amp; after doing some research</li>
            <li>I choose five star because that said my wife and i love her.</li>
            <li>I will by more and more cheaper if U can.</li>
            <li>So yes I do love this brush....</li>
            <li>But it does blend and do all its says.... :)</li>
            <li>The writing is rubbed off and the top of the brush feels(and looks) like a cheap dollar tree paint brush.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to see if it needs cleaning</li>
            <li>Really applies makeup nicely and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Then when I suggested that they should refund my postage, they refunded the entire purchase price, which is why I am giving them 2 starts - very nice of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found another use for it, thankfully, because nothing ticks me off more than spending a tidy sum on something only to stash it in the drawer because it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t ruin whatever.. such a good investment for years!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Superior brush, a little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I ordered another one after I used the first.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself was mac-quality, it picks up colors in just a little tap and builds amazingly in the crease.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for application, picking up just the right amount of shadow, but it&#x27;s not fluffy enough, in my opinion, to diffuse and blend shadow.  </li>
            <li>üòç really luv it</li>
            <li>Thr brush does not seem like the real thing.</li>
            <li>But it is overpriced for real......</li>
            <li>Overall, great product for everyday and a must have for your makeup collection!</li>
            <li>I used the mac brush cleaning and used all the given directions and it still came out soft and smooth, but just with a couple loose fibers.</li>
            <li>and I found it when I pick my clean wet clothes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating this MAC brush as OK because I have other brushes that do the same job that were a fraction of the MAC price.  </li>
            <li>I have several MAC brushes that I can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li>I use it for other puposes  than what i originally bought it for, but it&#x27;s not what i expected or thought I would be paying for.</li>
            <li>This just goes to show that good makeup tools can come in all price ranges and that high end tools can often be replaced by less expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost positive that what I received was not true to the actual product I thought I would be getting&lt;br</li>

            <li> A must for any woman!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it.  Ladies, if you&#x27;re going to buy a good brush, save your money and get this one.  It&#x27;s of excellent quality and you can never go wrong with it. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent üòç really luv it</li>
            <li> Bought this almost two weeks ago and it arrived today. It&#x27;s quite obviously fake. The writing is rubbed off and the top of the brush feels(and looks) like a cheap dollar tree paint brush. Definitely sending this back,</li>
            <li> I thought it was a mistake buying $22 make up brush but I have no doubt with the quality, and today without i realize this brush went inside my washing machine and I found it when I pick my clean wet clothes. was panic for a second and guess what?? quality says it all! it doesn&#x27;t ruin whatever.. such a good investment for years!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have budget to buy somewhat expensive make up brush, please choose this one, you know the key for perfect looking eyeshadow is blend blend blend!!</li>
            <li> This is a must have.  I use it everyday.for blending and application.  The price is great I may be getting another one.  The white bristles are white so it&#x27;s easy to see if it needs cleaning</li>
            <li> I waited for weeks for my Mac brush.  The promised arrival date had passed and I contacted the company for status. They replied relatively quickly and blamed it on bad weather. Then when I suggested that they should refund my postage, they refunded the entire purchase price, which is why I am giving them 2 starts - very nice of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then when my item finally arrived, it was the wrong item.  It was Mac BLUSH, not the brush I ordered.  When I contacted them to tell them, they did not reply.  Maybe their laptop is frozen under snow.</li>
            <li> i use this brush every time I do a smokey eye and its a perfect size for my crease and blending</li>
            <li> This is a flat brush that I used to apply shadow, but not to blend it.  It&#x27;s fine for application, picking up just the right amount of shadow, but it&#x27;s not fluffy enough, in my opinion, to diffuse and blend shadow.  In fact, I now use mine for applying concealer.  It works much better for this purpose, allowing me to blend drier concealer creams underneath my eyes.  I find the ELF brushes (the $1 or $3 ones) to be much better for shadow application.  I still rely heavily on my MAC crease brush, which works wonders, but the application of pan or loose shadow I leave to the ELF brushes.  They are fluffy enough for me get a diffuse blending of colors (no harsh lines) and there&#x27;s little fallout.  I have several MAC brushes that I can&#x27;t live without (the #&#x27;s have all rubbed off, lol!) but this one isn&#x27;t one of them.  I found another use for it, thankfully, because nothing ticks me off more than spending a tidy sum on something only to stash it in the drawer because it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  I&#x27;m rating this MAC brush as OK because I have other brushes that do the same job that were a fraction of the MAC price.  This just goes to show that good makeup tools can come in all price ranges and that high end tools can often be replaced by less expensive ones.</li>
            <li> favorite blending brush I have ever owned, I always get complements on where I learned to blend my shadows I love MAC</li>
            <li> Best brush you can get</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the product when i received it &amp; after doing some research I&#x27;m almost positive that what I received was not true to the actual product I thought I would be getting&lt;br /&gt; Thr brush does not seem like the real thing.

            <li> I choose five star because that said my wife and i love her. I will by more and more cheaper if U can.</li>
            <li> It was bent and I had to send it back. I was disapointed</li>
            <li> Superior brush, a little pricey but well worth it. Really applies makeup nicely and easy to clean. A good addition to my brush collection.</li>
            <li> So yes I do love this brush.... But it is overpriced for real...... But it does blend and do all its says.... :)</li>
            <li> Positively necessary for the smokey eye look.  I ordered another one after I used the first.  It has become s staple at my makeup table.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It works so well, blending without fading the pigment.</li>
            <li> I was beyond pleased with the shipping, it took around 4 days! The brush itself was mac-quality, it picks up colors in just a little tap and builds amazingly in the crease. It&#x27;s an all purpose brush-you can use the sides to place a lid color and the tip to blend out a crease or \\&quot;outer v.\\&quot; The only problem I have with it is the scraggly fibers. I had to pick a couple out after I washed the brush. I used the mac brush cleaning and used all the given directions and it still came out soft and smooth, but just with a couple loose fibers. Maybe it&#x27;s me that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars. Overall, great product for everyday and a must have for your makeup collection!</li>
            <li> Nice brush, seems to be constructed nice, works/blends as should.  I have used it for a couple of weeks and it is what it says it is.</li>
