            <li> Waste of money... it is definitely not worth going cheap and generic on the spin heads.  They were hard, hardly spun, and broke within a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with quality and price.</li>
            <li> They fit our Oral B toothbrush and they&#x27;re much cheaper than buying the name brand from the store.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> After about four days, the bristles started falling off in my mouth. Not pleasant. These replacement brushes are completely worthless.</li>
            <li> As a more affordable alternate to the manufacturers replacement brushes I thought I would try these generic brushes.  OPPS what a mistake.  The first one I tried broke the first time I used it.  They last about an average of three days.  Not that affordable now.</li>
            <li> These are definitely the lowest priced oral-b knock-offs available on Amazon. Over-all they seem to work pretty well but they are just a little harder to insert onto the brush handle and as a result I broke the first one and it no longer would spin. I changed it and have been using it for a couple of weeks now with no problems. the name-brand brush heads  are just ridiculously expensive even at Costco so I will keep buying these. At the super cheap cost I can change it every month!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell much difference in the generic brand and the original set that I originally purchased.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are very good. I ordered a second set</li>
            <li> Same as the real oral B brand just much much cheaper. Have been buying these for years and will continue to do so as long as they are available to buy.</li>
            <li> Fast ship. The product arrived as described.Now I don&#x27;t have to take the time to brush my teeth manually, I let the robot do it!</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price. These usually go for $12 dollars for a pack of two.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied wiith them.</li>
            <li> These will survive a few brushes, but the gum version knock offs are awful. They may last one brush or maybe 5 seconds before the gears give.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money ! These stop working  after two days ! I have gone through the whole pack and all stop spinning. They fit fine and feel fine they just don&#x27;t last. Complete junk in my book. The seller wasn&#x27;t much help either. I just purchased the name brand, it&#x27;s more expensive but at least it will work and last !!!</li>
            <li> These are awful. They don&#x27;t even last 1 brush without snapping. I broke down and spent the $ for real oral B ones</li>
            <li> There really cheap price and product.</li>
            <li> Not the best!  Had to return them.  They would not stay on the handle securely -- kept falling off.  Pay a little more and get a better quality product.</li>
            <li> having problems with these they are not like oral b ones out of 2 packs so far only 2 of the brushes work just tossed away 4 the heads don&#x27;t turn Junk in my book</li>
            <li> Too small didn&#x27;t like the quality, and they just stop spinning on the brush head</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;compatibles&amp;#34; are not compatible. My Oral B brand last months, these last a few days until they stop oscillating. Never again.</li>
            <li> These brushes work very well on my electric brush and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is about the closest you could probably get to the original heads without paying much. These are firm but slightly less than the OEM brushes.</li>
            <li> soft and not very reliable</li>
