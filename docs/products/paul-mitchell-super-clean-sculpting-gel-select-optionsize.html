    <ol>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>This is great styling gel.  </li>
            <li>great value for the money.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>She was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Your hair stays in place, you look amazing, and the women come a-runnin&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This goes on light, holds great</li>
            <li>This method works really well for me, although I have to wash my brush often, lol!  </li>
            <li>Acts like super glue for the hair, especially good for cow-licks, but washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but it sure beats anything else I gave tried.</li>
            <li>I love this gel by Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite brand .</li>
            <li>have been using it for over 8 years and love this product.</li>
            <li>What more could a guy ask for?</li>
            <li>The gel does an excellent job of keeping my hair in place all day long.  </li>
            <li>My wife told me that you has been using this item for a long time and that it is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t flake at all.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something with a strong hold</li>
            <li>I have some baby hairs around my hairline and at the nape of my neck and this gel holds them securely in place once it dries.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean feel and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel.</li>
            <li>I thought buying through Amazon might be as good as buying through my local salon.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the older product which came in a package with a red top.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, when you hit 50 and you&#x27;re newly single, you gotta do what it takes to look good.</li>
            <li>I have tried it on damp hair after shampooing when I used a diffuser to encourage the wave and it definitely has some strong hold to it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give as much shine to my hair that I had hoped it would</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>50% of that is getting your fat butt in shape so that your ex eats her heart out, 50% is losing the crappy, women-hating attitude, and 50% is having decent hair.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I only need the smallest amount of this product to do the job and it does hold all day, even in hot, humid weather.  </li>
            <li>This gel is watery and about half the consistent of the real product.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural, lasts several hours and seems to agree with my hair in all respects.</li>
            <li>If you have really fine hair, this gel would be way too heavy and would weigh the hair down considerably.  </li>
            <li>It takes a very small amount of this gel to smooth the friizzies and flyaways.  </li>

            <li> Pretty weak hold.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the end result is controlled hair without all of the crunchy stiffness.</li>
            <li> The problem was that was not able to use it because all the gel sipped through the ripped open seam of tube!</li>
            <li> I usually put the get on a hairbrush and then brush back the hair from my face and put it in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is meant to be the same, but this one literally runs out of the tube anytime you hold it upside down.</li>
            <li> and you can re-work the product in your hair with a little water.</li>
            <li> I find it too sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> I do use some hairspray over it when I tame my flyaways and the two products together</li>
            <li> Very little is required to do so.</li>
            <li> The gel is very thick and has some minimal shine to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put a small dab in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> Chicks don&#x27;t give a second glance at a dude with bad hair and messy, goopy, shiny, greasy-looking product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> My hairdresser used this but was out of this product when I wanted to buy it. I find it too sticky and heavy. Had I purchased it from her, I&#x27;d have returned it..</li>
            <li> The gel does an excellent job of keeping my hair in place all day long.  Very little is required to do so.</li>
            <li> My wife told me that you has been using this item for a long time and that it is an excellent product.  She was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is great styling gel.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have heard about counterfeit Paul Mitchell products before.  I thought buying through Amazon might be as good as buying through my local salon.  I can&#x27;t say that the product is counterfeit but it isn&#x27;t the same product  that I have been buying for years through multiple salons.  This gel is watery and about half the consistent of the real product.  I don&#x27;t like it at all.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well and I would not purchase it again.  Beware!</li>
            <li> rocking this crud since the eighties.</li>
            <li> great value for the money.  Acts like super glue for the hair, especially good for cow-licks, but washes out easily.  I can&#x27;t go out in public without it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It doesn&#x27;t give as much shine to my hair that I had hoped it would but it sure beats anything else I gave tried.</li>
            <li> I love this gel by Paul Mitchell. The problem was that was not able to use it because all the gel sipped through the ripped open seam of tube! Had to send it back! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Pretty weak hold.  If you&#x27;re looking for something with a strong hold this isn&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. I always use it just after I get my haircut. It makes my hair so manageable. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brand . have been using it for over 8 years and love this product. A must buy</li>
            <li> Not as good as the older product which came in a package with a red top. Not sure if it is meant to be the same, but this one literally runs out of the tube anytime you hold it upside down. It&#x27;s hard to put a small dab in the palm of your hand.</li>

            <li> Works very well and you don&#x27;t need much.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have used it for years and would recommend it to anyone. It has a clean feel and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel.</li>
            <li> This goes on light, holds great and you can re-work the product in your hair with a little water. I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Great product.</li>
