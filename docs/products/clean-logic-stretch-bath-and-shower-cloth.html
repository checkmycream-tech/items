            <li>I consider this one of the best presents I&#x27;ve been given in a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought two more.</li>
            <li>really like the abrasive nature because it feels good against my skin.</li>
            <li>Myself and kids enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>I realy feel clean after I use this product.</li>
            <li>I step out of the tub feeling extremely clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to get my back easily.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it stretches and then dries back to its original shape.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates your entire body and most certainly increases your blood flow!</li>
            <li>and I doubted I&#x27;d be able to scrub my back.  </li>
            <li>does exactly what is said ..</li>
            <li>I rubbed after the first use..</li>
            <li>It really exfolliates your skin!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that you have to use a certain amount of words.</li>
            <li>They rinse very clean and dry rapidly and do not take on an oder like loofah.  </li>
            <li>so when I am getting ready to exfoliate</li>
            <li>The cloth works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to receive a color (peach) which complimented my bathroom! ;-)</li>
            <li>I tend to get dry skin patches and this cloth smooths them right off</li>
            <li>It stretches nicely to wash hard to reach areas, like your back.  </li>
            <li>They are more coarse or rough than the Japanese variety.  </li>
            <li>It does soften up after use, but my old one is still quite serviceable after the two years.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re somewhat physically limited this cloth gives you much extended ability!</li>
            <li>Does a great job at removing the dirt from my body, and is stretchable that I can wash my back without having my arms in awkward positions.</li>
            <li>I originally got the bath &amp; shower cloth for my husband, but once I used it there was no going back to an ordinary sponge again.</li>
            <li>I rubbed a little to hard and found out that it doesn&#x27;t need much pressure to clean well at all.</li>

            <li> Love this cloth!  I tend to get dry skin patches and this cloth smooths them right off so when I am getting ready to exfoliate it is no longer a two step process!  I can wash and exfoliate with the same cloth!</li>
            <li> Durable and flexible as a bath/shower cloth. I has found it in a store sometime ago but it has been discontinued. I am glad I found it online-</li>
            <li> I recently purchased two of these at a local store for $1.99 each.  For 20 years I&#x27;ve used a similar Japanese made product that I only ever found at Asian focused stores.  They sell for about $5 each.  So I couldn&#x27;t pass these up.at $1.99.  These appear small when you open them and I doubted I&#x27;d be able to scrub my back.  But they have enormous stretch and I was able to get my back easily.  They are more coarse or rough than the Japanese variety.  They rinse very clean and dry rapidly and do not take on an oder like loofah.  I eliminated 1 star because a person with limited range of motion would have difficulty getting their arms in position behind the back to stretch the cloth out to scrub their back.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at removing the dirt from my body, and is stretchable that I can wash my back without having my arms in awkward positions. Will buy again once the current one ages from use.</li>
            <li> The cloth works very well. I really like it and would recommend it. I wasn&#x27;t aware that you have to use a certain amount of words.</li>
            <li> loved it ! does exactly what is said .. Will order again soon !</li>
            <li> It was as described, delivered before time frame.  yes I will buy from you again thanks</li>
            <li> I got one as a gift two years ago. I loved it so much I bought two more. One as a gift and one to stay at my other home so I always have it handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the abrasive nature because it feels good against my skin. It does soften up after use, but my old one is still quite serviceable after the two years. The stretch hasn&#x27;t given way either. I consider this one of the best presents I&#x27;ve been given in a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may find the scratchy-ness unpleasant. I have tender skin but still love this. I may have to buy more to stockpile them.</li>
            <li> Myself and kids enjoy using this product. I hope at some time I will be able to find this it in a store close to me.</li>
            <li> I love my Stretch Bath Shower Cloth and I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves these to scrub his back. Good product</li>
            <li> A wonderful product for your bathing enjoyment. If you&#x27;re somewhat physically limited this cloth gives you much extended ability! It exfoliates your entire body and most certainly increases your blood flow! I was pleasantly surprised to receive a color (peach) which complimented my bathroom! ;-)</li>
            <li> This exfoliating cloth is awesome.  It stretches nicely to wash hard to reach areas, like your back.  It lathers well, too.  I step out of the tub feeling extremely clean and fresh.  In fact, I&#x27;m about to purchase one for my mom.</li>
            <li> I originally got the bath &amp; shower cloth for my husband, but once I used it there was no going back to an ordinary sponge again. I love the cleanlogic stretch bath &amp; shower cloth.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST !!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at HomeGoods today for 3.99. I have not used it yet but, when I do I will write a review.</li>
            <li> I love the way it stretches and then dries back to its original shape. I did not expect it to be so course. I rubbed a little to hard and found out that it doesn&#x27;t need much pressure to clean well at all. I was red everywhere I rubbed after the first use..lol</li>
            <li> A great product. It works very well. I realy feel clean after I use this product. And it stretches.....Wow. Try one.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the cloth!  It really exfolliates your skin!  It is the best bath cloth I have found to date!  I really enjoy it!</li>
