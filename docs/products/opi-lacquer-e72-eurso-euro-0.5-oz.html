            <li>Color is amazing.</li>
            <li>Also, BeautyLand4U is an amazing vendor.</li>
            <li>Wear with a shiny topcoat, it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I have a plethora of colors, but thought that this one would be a nice addition to my collection.</li>
            <li>Only takes one or two coats to look perfect, and the polish is a good texture/doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>so it ended up denting and chipping very easily.</li>
            <li>Love love this color!</li>
            <li>I prefer this on my toe nails but would look great on my finger nails very vibrant color!</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I love OPI polish.  </li>
            <li>I used two coats and a top coat</li>
            <li>and I was so happy how the color really popped out</li>
            <li>i just got this color and am already in love with it.</li>
            <li>it is the perfect color blue!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color from the collection.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely color.</li>
            <li>Either way, I love it.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped fast and packaging was great.</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>Excellent price and such a pretty color.</li>
            <li>i am excited to wear this for spring</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing blue ever!</li>
            <li>Overall a great nail polish, completely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Much faster than most OPI colors I have.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good royal blue and this color was it.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>My new favorite color to wear.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite nail polish by far!</li>
            <li>Beautiful Blue color almost like a denim blue</li>
            <li>Plus, the color wears off more easily than my other OPI colors.</li>
            <li>I love having it on both my nails and toes as much as possible.</li>
            <li>but when you have limited colors in town, this is a great second choice.</li>
            <li>still a good color, just beware that the picture might be a little lighter!</li>
            <li>The day it arrived (which was pretty fast)</li>
            <li>Usually OPI is a good polish, but this time was not, it peels off almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Much richer than Dating A Royal.</li>
            <li>In addition, coming from someone who is not all that great at applying nail polish to themselves, it was among the simpler nail polishes to apply, the consistency not too thin as to have transparent layers, or too thick to make it impossible to get it on, but just right, where two easy-application coats left me with a excellent, impeccable manicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true blue.</li>
            <li>so it is very dark (I expected more of a royal blue) but still very lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a deep purple then blue, as it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li>I love this color when I&#x27;m in the mood for blue (I&#x27;m typically a red gal) which happens now and then.</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant and fun, but understated enough that it can be professional-looking in the workplace.</li>
            <li>Vibrant dark blue, opaque in one coat, and a really nice formula, though it did bubble a little more than I would like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deep, deep blue, but has enough sheen to make it bright.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely not a cheesy blue color that would look tacky if you dressed it up.</li>
            <li>The woman next to me immediately asked what I was wearing and said how pretty it was.</li>
            <li>The color is a dark rich indigo.</li>
            <li>Overall I really do like OPI products.</li>
            <li>They tend to last very well</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to the blue color shown in pictures.</li>
            <li>I was too lazy to use top/base coat one day and this actually stuck on for a few days with great color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s darker than it&#x27;s pictured but it&#x27;s such a pretty blue.</li>
            <li>The down side is it chips really fast!  </li>

            <li> After a day or two it starts loosing its brightness and becomes dull.</li>
            <li> Just not a good color for me.</li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed with the way it went on and the way it dried.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, however I can&#x27;t say for sure if the nail color is the problem, or the seller I purchased from had a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> I like to use it as a base for the polka-dot glitter polish that is in the same collection.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with the quality.  </li>
            <li> I am however disappointed in the quality of this nail color.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this color for a long time so I went ahead and purchased it.  I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase.  It&#x27;s not too dark that it looks black but it&#x27;s definitely not a cheesy blue color that would look tacky if you dressed it up.</li>
            <li> Love this color and love OPI!!!</li>
            <li> I love OPI polish.  I have never been disappointed with the quality.  I would prefer to actually see the product but when you have limited colors in town, this is a great second choice.</li>
            <li> Darker than i thought it would be. Overall I really do like OPI products. They tend to last very well</li>
            <li> Beautiful Blue color almost like a denim blue I used two coats and a top coat and I was so happy how the color really popped out I prefer this on my toe nails but would look great on my finger nails very vibrant color!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color! I am however disappointed in the quality of this nail color. Usually OPI is a good polish, but this time was not, it peels off almost immediately. I never get polish to last very long, but this peels off in sheets, not just chips, within just a day or two. I am very careful when applying nail polish, cleaning my nail and applying a basecoat (OPI as well) but this just doesn&#x27;t stick. I am very disappointed, however I can&#x27;t say for sure if the nail color is the problem, or the seller I purchased from had a bad batch or something. Again the color was wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great color. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> i just got this color and am already in love with it. it is the perfect color blue! i am excited to wear this for spring</li>
            <li> Eurso Euro is a great shade! Vibrant dark blue, opaque in one coat, and a really nice formula, though it did bubble a little more than I would like. Great winter polish! Got compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love love this color!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color from the collection. It&#x27;s darker than it&#x27;s pictured but it&#x27;s such a pretty blue. I compared it to Dating A Royal, upon reviewing it online. However, it&#x27;s a different shade of blue. Much richer than Dating A Royal. I love it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for my polish to arrive to try it on. I have a plethora of colors, but thought that this one would be a nice addition to my collection. The day it arrived (which was pretty fast) I got a pedi/mani with this color. The woman next to me immediately asked what I was wearing and said how pretty it was. It is a lovely color. It&#x27;s more of a deep purple then blue, as it appears in the picture. Either way, I love it. I would recommend both the seller and the product!</li>
            <li> Love the color! It&#x27;s a true blue. The only downside is that you need to put on about 3 coats. This item arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Color is amazing. Only takes one or two coats to look perfect, and the polish is a good texture/doesn&#x27;t clump.  Also, BeautyLand4U is an amazing vendor. I ordered on Thursday morning, and it was at my door Saturday morning! I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> The color looks darker than I had expected. Plus, the color wears off more easily than my other OPI colors. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing blue ever! I love it! It&#x27;s a deep, deep blue, but has enough sheen to make it bright.</li>
            <li> Color is beautiful! After a day or two it starts loosing its brightness and becomes dull.</li>
            <li> Looks good on and this is a very good brand of nail polish. The color looks good on al skin types</li>
            <li> Love it! I like to use it as a base for the polka-dot glitter polish that is in the same collection. Would wear it by itself too though. Nice coverage!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite nail polish by far! It is not gooey or clumpy, even after multiple use, and it stays on for a considerably long time. In addition, coming from someone who is not all that great at applying nail polish to themselves, it was among the simpler nail polishes to apply, the consistency not too thin as to have transparent layers, or too thick to make it impossible to get it on, but just right, where two easy-application coats left me with a excellent, impeccable manicure. The color is vibrant and fun, but understated enough that it can be professional-looking in the workplace. I love having it on both my nails and toes as much as possible. Overall a great nail polish, completely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I was too lazy to use top/base coat one day and this actually stuck on for a few days with great color. My boyfriend thought it was black when the room was dim so it is very dark (I expected more of a royal blue) but still very lovely.</li>
            <li> I am an OPI nail polish lover. The color is brighter online but it works. I have gotten compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> The color of this polish is really  great but I was a little disappointed with the way it went on and the way it dried.  It was very thick and it didn&#x27;t dry very hard so it ended up denting and chipping very easily.</li>
            <li> The color is a dark rich indigo. My new favorite color to wear. Wear with a shiny topcoat, it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this color when I&#x27;m in the mood for blue (I&#x27;m typically a red gal) which happens now and then.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to the blue color shown in pictures. Like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s not really blue but a deep purple. OPI is great polish. The seller shipped fast and packaging was great. Just not a good color for me. Too dark and not blue.</li>
            <li> great nail polish but it&#x27;s a bit darker than i thought it would be. still a good color, just beware that the picture might be a little lighter!</li>
