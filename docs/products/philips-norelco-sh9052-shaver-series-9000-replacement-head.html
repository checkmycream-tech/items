            <li>The best shaver/shaver head Norelco has come up with yet!</li>
            <li>I think it is the best shaver I have seen in a while.</li>
            <li>Best razor</li>
            <li>This product is very good</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>great price also</li>
            <li>This is a great electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Norelco has lost a good customer.</li>
            <li>The RQ12 fit just perfect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know it this is a good product because i have never used it, reason not needed for review.</li>
            <li>The price was good</li>
            <li>This is an inferior product quality wise compared to the original head.</li>
            <li>How ever this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>fit ok and worked ok.</li>
            <li>It is better then my other shaver (Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D), but I had a old Philips years ago that I liked best.</li>
            <li>well knowing that I have genuine Norelco replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>I just replaced the original blades today.  </li>
            <li>I would have gladly paid a few dollars more if necessary for good heads like the original rq12.</li>
            <li>The old rq12 heads gave a fantastic shave, these are cheap junk.</li>
            <li>RQ12 is very easy to clean and this SH90/52 is hard to clean after about six weeks a shaving.  </li>
            <li>Norelco should have tried these out first.</li>
            <li>This is my first time replacing these on this shaver and they did &#x27;groan&#x27;</li>
            <li>(it is sort of a screeching sound) when shaving, but this will generally go away or just add some oil until the rotary cutters get worked a bit.</li>
            <li>close shave and fast shipping-</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast action.</li>
            <li>These replacement blades are decent.</li>
            <li>I noticed quite a change with the new blades.  </li>
            <li>, now i regret it should have waited because now it is here and waiting for new unit to get old.</li>
            <li>Compared to my other shaver, the Norelco is much quieter and shaves better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I still have the old ones and will use them until I purchase a Braun or Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>It is close to what my old one was like in the way it works.</li>

            <li> The best shaver/shaver head Norelco has come up with yet!</li>
            <li> only the three rotary cutting blades here nothing else</li>
            <li> These blades only last about three months and they turn dull I clean them every other day i the cleaning system they are just as bad as the 8000  series shavers other than the replacement blades are cheaper!</li>
            <li> This is the second set of these I have bought in the last 6 months (and the last). Terrible shave. The old rq12 heads gave a fantastic shave, these are cheap junk. I have used Norelco shavers for the past 20 years but now looking for another brand to replace it with. Norelco should have tried these out first. I would have gladly paid a few dollars more if necessary for good heads like the original rq12. I still have the old ones and will use them until I purchase a Braun or Panasonic shaver. Norelco has lost a good customer.</li>
            <li> My razor sleeps well knowing that I have genuine Norelco replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This does not fit my razor. There are three separate heads with no tool to change them out. It was returned to the seller!</li>
            <li> These heads wear out in less than two months.  The originals only lasted 6 months, which is much less than the yearly interval recommended by the manufacturer.  I am changing to a Braun razor.</li>
            <li> It is better then my other shaver (Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D), but I had a old Philips years ago that I liked best. How ever this one is pretty good. It is close to what my old one was like in the way it works. I think it is the best shaver I have seen in a while.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast action.</li>
            <li> no problems. fit ok and worked ok.</li>
            <li> This shaving head can not match the RQ12 shaving head.  RQ12 gives closer shave.  RQ12 is very easy to clean and this SH90/52 is hard to clean after about six weeks a shaving.  The problem with the RQ12 shaving head was it could fit on other Philips Norelco less expensive shavers.  Men were  buying the cheaper level Philips Norelco shavers and replacing those heads with the RQ12.  The RQ12 fit just perfect.</li>
            <li> After using any electric razor like this, you will notice it just doesn&#x27;t cut as well. That&#x27;s when it&#x27;s time to replace the heads. This is my first time replacing these on this shaver and they did &#x27;groan&#x27; a while (it is sort of a screeching sound) when shaving, but this will generally go away or just add some oil until the rotary cutters get worked a bit. Compared to my other shaver, the Norelco is much quieter and shaves better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it! Best razor my dad has every had!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it this is a good product because i have never used it, reason not needed for review. The price was good so i purchased it before i needed it, now i regret it should have waited because now it is here and waiting for new unit to get old. this is my second post because Amazon sent it back to me to do a review after i did a review.</li>
            <li> Great product. close shave and fast shipping- great price also</li>
            <li> Found it very hard to replace the blades. The blades would fallout off and on. Working with Norelco on the problem now.</li>
            <li> This product is very good</li>
            <li> I just replaced the original blades today.  About 4 months after I purchased the Shaver.  The instructions with the Norelco 9000 series states the blades need to be changes once a year.  I noticed quite a change with the new blades.  This is a great electric shaver. RDF</li>
            <li> These replacement blades are decent. Still not able to get a close enough shave in certain areas of the face.</li>
            <li> Actually nothing wrong with the heads. Just the ludicrous price. I bought 2 sets in America also for the same price as 1 set in the UK. So I have about 5 years supply now. BUY IN AMERICA not UK</li>
            <li> Initially this head worked well but it didn&#x27;t last. After 5 months this replacement head was worn out; useless. This is an inferior product quality wise compared to the original head.</li>
