            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>For the better!</li>
            <li>In fact, the Shea Moisture is excellent at moisturizing and shine and only enhancing your hair, and absorbs beautifully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It is light &amp; it works great as a leave in.</li>
            <li>product does smell amazing though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the Conditioning Milk is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are amazing too.  </li>
            <li>I shampoo with it, use an organic conditioner and then follow with Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle and have amazing curls.  </li>
            <li>thank you kindly.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Even if I forgot to wrap up my hair at night and woke up with the Kid&amp;Play, with this product I was able to coax my hair into a more attractive style with no tangling or breakage.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and is nice and light</li>
            <li>and I liked that because that means I will get lots of uses out of it.</li>
            <li>This curl moisture milk is excellent at providing moisture for kinky or very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I liked what the company was doing for women who needed help in Sierra Leone.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know why anyone would buy a product with \\&quot;Coconut\\&quot; in the description if they don&#x27;t like the smell of coconut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot and it does nicely moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li>And it smelled nice too.  </li>
            <li>This product does a nice job of defining curls however it is greasy greasy greasy.  </li>
            <li>My hair turns into new hair whenever I apply this wonderfully creamy, moisturizing and penetrating milk.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice -- and everytime I use it, most wonder what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing.     </li>
            <li>And, best of all, it left my daughter&#x27;s hair looking really good.</li>
            <li>The best part was waking up this morning and my hair was still moisturized and very soft.</li>
            <li>It is the best fragrance I have ever smelled in a conditioner and shampoo, which is a surprise considering it&#x27;s all natural!  </li>
            <li>If you have natural hair and use it to do 2 or 3 strand twists, it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li>Someone mentioned that they liked the \\&quot;smoothie\\&quot; version of this better</li>
            <li>The next morning, I took the twists out and my hair was feeling and looking great, soft, volume, no frizz, beautifully formed curls, shiny,  to the ends, and I had a very good hair day!.</li>
            <li>However, I deducted one star because it is more effective as a moisturizer than a \\&quot;style\\&quot; product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good but it works good too!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for easy detangling and abundant moisture.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems to respond better when the Curl and Style Milk  is layered over a more moisturizing leave-in, instead of being used as a stand-alone leave-in.  </li>
            <li>When used as a stand-alone leave-in, my hair becomes progressively more crispy throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I find the CD Hair Milk to be more moisturizing, and better able to retain the moisture in my hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wells amazingly well to smooth my hair and to detangle it.</li>
            <li>For me, it worked out for my hair much better.  </li>
            <li>I love the shea moisture coconut and hibiscus line.</li>
            <li>Many reviews raved about this product, but it appeared to work just okay for me.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>But I used it for twist outs, and for moisturizing and refreshing all kinds of hairstyles</li>
            <li>(by the way i always get mine from walgreens or target for $10 i dont know why its so much more online)</li>
            <li>Which worked well, but I wanted something better.</li>
            <li>GREAT product, HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are organic and that it contains coconut oil.</li>
            <li>And if youre using it onyour kids, I think they will love the smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells more like pineapple than any of the stated ingredients, and it&#x27;s quite fragranced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already head over hills in love with the styling</li>
            <li>and I was in awww!</li>
            <li>I really do love this stuff and will buy it again</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with Shea moisture as of today</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I purchase it at walgreens for $6 I was baffled at why it cost $33 on here.</li>
            <li>It has nice, light, coconuty smell that doesn&#x27;t fade, which I love.</li>
            <li>I love this product it does wonders for my hair</li>
            <li>This one is perfect for my hair - it definitely moisturizes and holds all day and its fragrance is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>And just a glance at the label will tell you how much better these products are for your hair health.</li>
            <li>It smells like suntan oil, which I love.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is awesome and will be repurchased.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite item.</li>
            <li>I also love using the [[ASIN:</li>

            <li>I plan to try one of Shea Moisture&#x27;s products that adds a bit more moisture to my hair, as well.</li>
            <li>This entire line is awesome for my hair.</li>
            <li>I just got the &amp;#34;smoothie&amp;#34; from this line, and it has given better styling results than this style milk.</li>
            <li>Even the coconut fragrance couldn&#x27;t make me love this.</li>
            <li>I have bought several from this line of product and I would say that I like this item the best.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>My ends have improved 100% using this line--no more dryness, and I&#x27;m beginning to see a reduction in splits and damage as well.  </li>
            <li>I must say that my hair has never felt and looked so healthy since using this.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know such a perfect hair product could exist.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love the way it moisturized my hair</li>
            <li>:).</li>
            <li>I love the smell, which is not too overbearing.</li>
            <li>I love this product and all of the Curl products of this company.</li>
            <li>better deals at walgreens</li>
            <li>Please watch the video review for specifics of the product and more of my experience with it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>In addition to moisture, my braid outs are more defined.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never quite sure which it&#x27;s going to be from day to day.  </li>
            <li>and I love the tropical smell.  </li>
            <li>I also use Shea Moisture&#x27;s Souffle and a TINY amount of gel to get my best curls.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love this line of products and think that there&#x27;s something in it that will work for just about everyone.  </li>
            <li>You just have to keep searching. :)</li>
            <li>Love the smell too.  </li>
            <li>My goal of BSL may have to wait until make more $$$$.</li>
            <li>This styling milk has such a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get a great lift.</li>
            <li>When comparing this to the Shea Moisture Souffle, this was a lot more moisturizing as well.</li>
            <li>in fact, my hair looked really healthy (not greasy)</li>
            <li>I used this in  a variety of ways and love it with each use.</li>
            <li>I had defined lovely twists.</li>
            <li>Still love it.</li>
            <li>Love coconut smell and works for my hair.</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mostly oil</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this product every day, and my hair is SO healthy.</li>
            <li>I bought mine at Rite-Aid for seven bucks, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s so reasonable!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and smells great, and has protein in it, which is good for strengthening the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use it daily as I think it would lead to product build up.</li>
            <li>She had pretty good results,</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair manageable, soft and silky, and beautifully curly with lots of shine.  </li>
            <li>so I poured it out, but I have since then have repurchased it from Target, and I like it very much, Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>This is practically the perfect balance of ingredients to moisturize even extremely dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have heard many good things about She Moisture products but the price really has kept me from purchasing any of them.  </li>
            <li>Unlike all versions of Argan oil/Moroccan oil (fine hair) products I&#x27;ve tried, this is more moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t cause any greasy feeling or weight.</li>
            <li>This product is very good but do your homework is only $9.99 at Target.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to know that all the ingredients are completely natural.</li>
            <li>great products for natural hair</li>
            <li>I have type 3A curls and this cream makes my curls soft and springy and it smells great.</li>
            <li>The style and conditioning milk melts the tangles in my hair and provides excellent slip so I can easy run my fingers or wide tooth comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a styling routine and products I use that I&#x27;m loving right now, so</li>
            <li>I love that there are no silicones or non-animal/earth friendly ingredients as well.</li>
            <li>I started using the smoothie originally which I also fell in love with</li>
            <li>The conditioners have a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so detangling is easy.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say more than it&#x27;s amazing and its what I was looking for ,,,, thanks a lot for item ,</li>
            <li>I like everything about this product; it smells great and the texture leaves my hair feelings soft, smooth, and silky.  </li>
            <li>Of all the Shea Moisture products I have tried, this one is by far my favorite and the most effective.</li>
            <li>and it gave me beautifully washed &amp; conditioned hair the following day.</li>
            <li>The best product hands down.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time last night and I absolutely love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Hair diameter: fine      </li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing!</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo111XN4ZR7JMM7]]Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk is great for refreshing dry hair.</li>
            <li>This feels great as a deep conditioning product and I would buy it again for that purpose, but not as a styling cream.</li>
            <li>I would describe the product overall as soothing and not too product-y, which is great.  </li>
            <li>smooth</li>
            <li>This product is now available at any walgreens, and beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use products that provide moisture</li>
            <li>This product does provide great moisture for my granddaughter after her bath, but only for that night.</li>
            <li>and I end up re-applying more and more each time before her next bath to keep her hair nice and moisturized with curls in tact.</li>
            <li>There were great reviews on several sites.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for curly or wavy hair of all races--I&#x27;m white</li>
            <li>, it was light , penetrated well, wasn&#x27;t feeling to oily.</li>
            <li>I ve use several Shea moisture leave in conditioners and in the beginning the products seems great but after a while.</li>
            <li>After it has dried I find myself thinking, \\&quot;What is that wonderful fragrance, oh,</li>
            <li>This is one of my staple product as a natural and it is good for all hair types and textures.  </li>
            <li>I am one of those bewho really want the best from a product especially when there is a lot of hype around a brand.</li>
            <li>and I loved it because it made my hair soft and moisturized immediately.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never disappointed by the ingredient lists from this company, so I gave it a shot even though it is for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this a month ago</li>
            <li>Since the Curl Enhancing Smoothie is my #1 favorite, and does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased two and returned the unopened one to  Target.</li>
            <li>The price is more than you&#x27;d pay with most other moisturizers, but it&#x27;s not outrageous and I expect to pay a bit more for quality.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair and this is very refreshing for my curls.</li>
            <li>It is affordable and easily accessible.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I was so pleased because, for me, it seemed to amplify my curls.</li>
            <li>It was love at first coil.</li>
            <li>This is also great to use on dry hair or when you skip a day to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk because of the wholesome natural ingredients, awesome results and ease of accessibility (sold at Target, Walgreen&#x27;s, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells so nice, and I feel safe using it every day because I can actually pronounce all the ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for over a year and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 and have been looking for a good product forever and finally found it!</li>
            <li>Maybe I was thinking it would be a better conditioner, but because it&#x27;s a &#x27;milk&#x27; and much lighter, I don&#x27;t feel my hair is receiving what it needs.</li>
            <li>The smoothie is good for deep conditioning though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than the curl enhancing smoothie (which I love as well for my twist outs); but for my wash and gos, this is my product of choice.  </li>
            <li>Seems nice so far.</li>
            <li>I went through most of my life thinking I just had really poofy hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>My favorite application is to use straight as a moisturizer before twisting or braiding at night.  </li>
            <li>It has a sweet, tropical scent.</li>
            <li>My twists looked good for an entire week.</li>
            <li>Love it and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The consistency is like lotion and the fragrance is sweet</li>
            <li>I love the Manuka Honey formula the best (available only at Target), but also the Raw Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>It removes all traces of gooey styling products and hairspray and it smells really clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>A really dedicated natural diva could buy glycerin, and still come out ahead (price wise) when buying Shea Moisture compared to KBB&#x27;s Ambrosia.     </li>
            <li>I have caved in and just reordered Mixed Chicks leave in (love the product just don&#x27;t love the price)</li>
            <li>Well after three days of using it, I have noticed  with more and more alarm that my hair has a white waxy build-up.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend since it is cheap, and works pretty well.</li>
            <li>so finding the happy medium for encouraging curls, discouraging fuzz, giving body, and not weighing it down is quite a challenge...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Left my daughters hair moist, easy to comb and smelling fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have been trying alot of products in the past few weeks and this one is definitely the best one (with the best price).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to get a guy to use styling products, but this one is the perfect formula for him.  </li>
            <li>but my goodness so limp and greasy that even with great curl definition it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>This was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>moisturize , I apply leave-in conditioner and then Shea Moisture Curl an Style Milk on freshly washed and conditioned hair.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE how soft AND defined my curls are.</li>
            <li>It smells like a freshly baked cookie and</li>
            <li>I found out about this on youtube natural hair community, and I love the smell and texture of this products.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a great bargain, especially for a natural product.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>No crazy chemicals.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny because I use it in all of our hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to comb my fingers through it too, which I am not normally able to do do to static &amp; easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>is more especially with organic products because they are so rich</li>
            <li>We love how it smells (like coconuts) and it keeps her long curly hair in nice soft condition....</li>
            <li>wish their other products smelled as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it would be a good idea to branch out and try other things in this line up.</li>
            <li>so it lays right.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after a wash when the hair is damp.</li>
            <li>He has some gray on top and it&#x27;s really wiry and has a mind of its own and this styling product helps tame his wayward strands.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve ever found, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products to tame my curly, frizztastic hair.</li>
            <li>but Shea Moisture has made my journey towards having fully natural hair a pretty dang easy one.</li>
            <li>It came very fast and it didn&#x27;t leak or anything.</li>
            <li>I had used a very popular, high end, black hair product to wash/condish my hair</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve never had people compliment me so much on my curls!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my son hair moisturize, it only help me to plat his hair and nothing more.</li>
            <li>I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY SHEA MOISTURE products are posted with such INFLATED PRICES!</li>
            <li>which ties for first place with this hair milk.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say that yes, this is cheaper at Target or Walgreen&#x27;s than on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Please look carefully at the ingredients and make sure you are not spending more money for this product which doesn&#x27;t contain all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 2b with some 2c sections with bra-strap length hair, and can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use about the size of a nickel and first pull through my ends like in a pony tail and concentrate on lathering it on the ends.</li>
            <li>My review of this product is below, but first I&#x27;ll include the correct ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Water is the first ingredient, and the oils and butters seal the moisture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working pretty well.  </li>
            <li>conditions…restoring body and shine&amp;#34;) made sense to my immediate situation.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this product, I was unsure of it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li>Will definitely get more</li>
            <li>but wow -- this is really worth trying!  </li>
            <li>My Caucasian hair is color treated and SM&#x27;s sulfate free shampoos leave my hair soft, supple and really shiny.  </li>
            <li>At first, i was very hesitant to buy this product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the style milk I applied too much</li>
            <li>Less is pretty much more with this product, but I love that when I applied a bit too much the first time, I simply left it on overnight</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>To be certain, one gets a lot of product for money, packed with high-quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>While I do not use the product  she is very loyal to any product that helps her manage her very curly hair, knowing she has asked me to reorder this product multiple times is a show of the loyalty.  </li>
            <li>(the bottom part curls just fine without the extra hold).</li>
            <li>I moved to a very dry state and have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it is hard to find good product that does not leave your hair oily or flaky.</li>
            <li>and I was ready to return it.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment ...</li>
            <li>gentle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I assumed I would enjoy the entire line.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>(an issue with relaxed hair), or required me to use too much to achieve the desired results.</li>
            <li>Conditioning Milk has absolutely none of these problems.</li>
            <li>After doing tons of reading online, I discovered that what kinky hair really needs, in abundance, is moisture.</li>
            <li>and it really does help eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li>Really my hair seems indifferent to the stuff.</li>
            <li>This product did nothing to give my hair definition or much hold.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and defining.</li>
            <li>i have type 3c curls, very porous.</li>
            <li>He hates styling products, but after much prodding (and a look in the mirror)</li>
            <li>The Manuka Honey formula smells like wildflower honey and really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>Based on his now smooth and shiny hair, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this product works well to separate the curls and keep the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li>It smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li>I really like the Shea Moisture brand</li>
            <li>Much cheaper, and often on sale (online)</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have to use a lot to begin with.</li>
            <li>I want a more wet defined look</li>
            <li>I use this even before I blow my hair out straight.</li>
            <li>I do really like this brand.  </li>
            <li>Thank you SO MUCH Shea Moisture.  </li>
            <li>I am really picky when it comes to hair products</li>
            <li>the whole line does what it says.</li>
            <li>if you follow the natural hair type system) and a pea size amount is more than enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many natural products and this is the only one that works for me texture-wise.  </li>
            <li>Product left my hair feeling soft and my curls show alot more since i started using this product.</li>
            <li>After I bought it, I was surprised my local Walgreens carried so many of their products.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper at Target, but sometimes my target is slow in restocking and it good to know I can overnight with my Amazon prime in a pinch.</li>
            <li>The Conditioning Curl Milk does the trick (in terms of supporting my natural curl while it dries)!</li>
            <li>It is more like a really watered down lotion for your hair.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing,  but small bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have been let down so many times with organic gels</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was as chemical free as possible that would tame my friz &amp; static &amp; keep my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really in love with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo with apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>I added more water to the mixture and the results is less sticky.    </li>
            <li>I typically use it on top of the Curling Gel souffle.</li>
            <li>I used it on my twists and they were super shiny and curly in and even when I took them out a week later.</li>
            <li>I recommend purchasing both this hair milk and the curl smoothie from target or Walgreens $ 7.99-11.00 because though very similar in ingrediants the textures are different and the smoothie has more hold.</li>
            <li>This product is one I tried on a whim, mainly b/c</li>
            <li>I have tried many many products for my frizzy hair, expensive and inexpensive...</li>
            <li>When I did I had to go back and buy 3 more bottles for myself and 2 extra to try for my daughter who has 3c hair type.</li>
            <li>Can someone have samples so that if it does not work for a particular hair pattern we dont feel like a loser for throwing it away???</li>
            <li>I use Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk to moisturize my hair in high humidity weather (no glycerin) and to re-moisturize my hair during the week.</li>
            <li>Believe me it is very easy to go overboard with this hair milk.  </li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with very think, very long (two feet),  mildly curly hair/ spirally and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with my hair type so a bottle lasts me for almost 3 months- and good ingredients.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Curl Milk for any natural ladies or for any ladies with very curly hair.</li>
            <li>It drives me crazy, because at first my curls look great and they&#x27;re bouncing all over the place.  </li>
            <li>Iastly, I don&#x27;t have a lot of money but really wanted a mostly natural product</li>
            <li>KBB&#x27;s decreased the amount of Hair Ambrosia for their customers, albeit they hide it by putting it in a more sophisticated \\&quot;branded\\&quot; bottle, and use 400ml instead of the 6.something oz, you&#x27;re actually getting.</li>
            <li>Also my hair will feel moisturized for a good 3-4 days after applying so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>The only time I switch to another moisturizer is when I heat style (rarely).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use hair product, but wanted to try something to give my curls some oomph.  </li>
            <li>Still has a few more additives than I would prefer.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently to products, so this product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I love how it hydrates &amp; weighs my hair down just enough that the frizz can&#x27;t get a good foothold--my hair is still thick &amp; wavy, but it behaves well too!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>And if we apply to wet hair, my childrens curls dry so beautifully, without the crunch of some other curl products.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of using more next time since her hair is very, very dry.</li>
            <li>I just rub a little on my hair and it instantly tames the frizz and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for something that would soften and moisturize my new growth as well as the relaxed portion.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes so well that it even softens my new growth with</li>
            <li>It does not set off my allergies or sensitivities though, so I can live with it.</li>
            <li>Very natural,</li>
            <li>Plus he has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>but my very busy lifestyle I prefer to do it once</li>
            <li>The reason why is because it left my hair kind of greasy and stiff.  </li>
            <li>However, after I rub it in and dry my hair, it feels a bit crisp and very brittle.</li>
            <li>Before Shea Moisture, I&#x27;ve used Kinky Curly (great product as well, but hard to find in stores) and Carol&#x27;s Daughter (more expensive).</li>
            <li>I rinsed my hair with water only, towel dried, applied 4 dime sized amount to semi damp hair, and  let dry in a very loose bun; my hair smells, looks, and feels great!</li>
            <li>Just enough to tame the frizzies and leave nice looking, natural, not hard or crispy curls.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I set my hair in those spiral curlers overnight the next morning when I was separating my curls</li>
            <li>Yes, Shea Moisture doesn&#x27;t have KBB&#x27;s variety of scents (like white tea, honey and oatmeal, etc;).</li>
            <li>The Original - prior to purchasing and using the Curl and Style Milk, and have used it since purchasing the latter.  </li>
            <li>Sad because their Smoothie product has been the best for my 3b hair, with my \\&quot;other\\&quot; #1 Shea Moisture product being the Deep Masque Treatment (which provides the same results as the Smoothie, for me anyway).</li>
            <li>This is a complete pass for me!</li>
            <li>BUT their shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft like a conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Not only does it make your hair look better in the short term, it actually moisturizes it too (instead of drying it out).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an asian female with straight fine hair who gets the old-fashioned type perm (not the digital perms) to get 2B curls.</li>
            <li>As much as I loved this product, my hair started getting really stiff and greasy especially in the back.  </li>
            <li>Product stayed on top of my hair, weighed it down, and left it looking nappy.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly white girl hair and love this stuff!</li>
            <li>With such a quality product at a reasonable price, AND I&#x27;m getting more for my money -- it&#x27;s hard (for me) to justify buying KBB&#x27;s Hair Ambrosia anymore...</li>
            <li>it hydrated my hair, left my hair very moist not greasy and so soft</li>
            <li>Why does the Product Review say to \\&quot;AVOID APPLYING DIRECTLY TO ROOTS?\\</li>
            <li>(I have natural hair that is 4a\b\c</li>
            <li>In the summertime I wear my hair in an afro or twists, so I need something to keep my kinks soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>These products smell like heaven and soften my natural type 4 hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels really soft and its not greasy.</li>
            <li>Feels really moisturized especially on my ends</li>
            <li>My hair was instantly moisturized, my curls came to life and my hair was very shiny.</li>
            <li>and I am protein sensitive</li>
            <li>its also adds natural shine, and curl definition.</li>
            <li>Note: I&#x27;ve been both natural (type 4a) and relaxed and have used Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl &amp; Style Milk on both hair types.</li>
            <li>This is my staple moisturizer, regardless of whether I&#x27;ve been relaxed or natural, and my comments apply to my experiences using this product on both hair types.  </li>
            <li>If you use to curl your hair with a curling iron, your curls will be soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Works wonders for curly hair and feels really soft on hair.</li>
            <li>This leave in made my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>Makes my curls bouncy and soft and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>my curls soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>I have natural type 4 hair</li>
            <li>All of which are far inferior in one way or another to SM&#x27;s conditioning milk.  </li>
            <li>So I came here and nearly fell over from sticker shock.  </li>
            <li>it helps form my curls with soft touch.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really want to say is that you can also buy it at Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have 4 A natural hair.  </li>
            <li>This product does contain glycols which, they try to hide in the ingredient list by listing it with natural components.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li>This is a natural product, so it smells like the ingredients--especially coconut.  </li>
            <li>Surprised?</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this product, but I just started using this recently</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised that I still have not run out.</li>
            <li>Hair type: 4c (natural)    </li>
            <li>Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl &amp; Style Milk is my go-to product for a soft, wavy, shiny twist or braid out.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up, instead of having greasy hair, I have soft, manageable, and even BRUSHABLE hair.</li>
            <li>Most of the moisturizers I tried prior to this one either didn&#x27;t completely absorb into my hair, didn&#x27;t keep my hair moisturized, were too heavy and caused stiffness</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s not the cheapest product (about 3-4 times more expensive than the Organics Kids), but I do think it&#x27;s worth the cost</li>
            <li>The hair milk has a nice smell and is not too thick, however it provides zero hydration and actually made my hair feel even drier.</li>
            <li>Target is selling the same for $7.99 right now and the regular price is $9.99, you could get 2 for the price of one.</li>
            <li>I apply this to wet hair right after my acv hair rinse.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times, after conditioning with Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner, and, after applying the Restorative Conditioner as a leave-in, with the Curl and Style Milk on top.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve usually had to sacrifice moisture for aesthetic (silicone-laden moisturizers that make the hair look nice temporarily, but do nothing to improve moisture in the hair) or vice versa (moisturizers that have quality ingredients, but are too heavy and leave your hair looking like you&#x27;ve put too much product in).  </li>
            <li>I am also loving the antibreakage masque by Shea Moisture - I can already tell a dramatic difference in my hair texture with these products.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a different line of products, one that specifically had coconut oil as the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this hair lotion.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it&#x27;s not a little tiny bottle for $10 that you will only be able to use a few times</li>
            <li>My hair is not very heavy and greasy after I use it</li>
            <li>I used this product exactly as it said on the bottle; apply to hair when wet.</li>
            <li>Moisturizers with silicones cause too much build-up when used daily and don&#x27;t allow moisture to penetrate once they&#x27;ve coated the hair strand, causing dryness in the long-run unless you remove them with sulfates on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t use the milk as a leave-in, but apply it after shampoo or CO, leave for a few minutes, and then rinse lightly.  </li>
            <li>If you are into types, I have a 4B/4C type hair, porous, thick and snags easily.</li>
            <li>It absorbs right into my hair without leaving a residue on the surface or making it stiff and stringy, keeps it moisturized, and makes it EXTREMELY soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and creamy - definitely lighter than some of Shea Moisture&#x27;s other moisturizers - yet I only need to use a relatively moderate amount to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding products that work well consistently, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a really moisturizing line for some time.  </li>
            <li>I have tried it numerous times because I am pleased with this product line, however this is not good for me.</li>
            <li>Not only tit leave my hair soft-</li>
            <li>I have used it only once so far</li>
            <li>(otherwise her curls are frizzy and you can barely see them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it to retwist my hair into two strand twists and the next day it was SOOOOO soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy &amp; lower back length.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this product while I was transitioning into natural hair, and didn&#x27;t know what I had</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural - total bonus.  </li>
            <li>Wash and condition your hair, squeeze out the extra water, and put about a half-palmful of this in--scrunch it all over, comb it in, scrunch again, and I bet you&#x27;ll see a major difference in your curls!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly frizzy but is very much like the smoothie from Shea moisture</li>
            <li>(shampoo &amp; conditioner was Shea Moisture for damaged hair), towel dried &amp; then put a little more than dime-sized amount through out my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the cheapest product (about 3-4 times more expensive than the Organics Kids), but I do think it&#x27;s worth the costeighed down.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find a good moisturizer for tight curls, especially one that&#x27;s just the right consistency, not too thick, not too lightweight.  </li>
            <li>My only advice would be just be careful not to use too much at first or it might get a little too greasy, start with a small amount then add more to achieve the look you want.</li>
            <li>I have been using several Shea Moisture products since I began letting my natural hair grow out last summer.</li>
            <li>If I want the \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; bouncy look I just rub a little in between my palms and finger through my hair and dry on low then a blast of cool to seal the cuticle(less frizz).If</li>
            <li>I have 4a/4b curls and my hair is very thick and dries out easily.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so its worth every penny ($9.99).</li>
            <li>I think these women are using wayy too much product I&#x27;ve learned in my journey less</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft but it will dry out over the course of the day because it&#x27;s water based.</li>
            <li>My natural 4a/b hair suffer from dryness and nothing I used gave me long lasting moisture that is until I found this heaven in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I just bought this product at Target (same price) for my 3 year old daughter who has dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>(the price is NOT right on AMAZON; however, the price IS right at Target... as the other reviewers will tell you).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 4c natural, my hair was very dry (like a brillo pad ) on my sides and back of head.</li>
            <li>And the price is just right, since when my hair is curly (as opposed to blown out and flat ironed), I use it everyday!</li>

            <li> works beautifully on wavy hair, eases tangles and smells great - works on anyone - love it</li>

            <li> , it is now her favorite!</li>
            <li> just talking about it makes me want to go buy more!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> For the better!</li>
            <li> In fact, the Shea Moisture is excellent at moisturizing and shine and only enhancing your hair, and absorbs beautifully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It is light &amp; it works great as a leave in.</li>
            <li> product does smell amazing though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the Conditioning Milk is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are amazing too.  </li>
            <li> I shampoo with it, use an organic conditioner and then follow with Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle and have amazing curls.  </li>
            <li> thank you kindly.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Even if I forgot to wrap up my hair at night and woke up with the Kid&amp;Play, with this product I was able to coax my hair into a more attractive style with no tangling or breakage.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and is nice and light</li>
            <li> and I liked that because that means I will get lots of uses out of it.</li>
            <li> This curl moisture milk is excellent at providing moisture for kinky or very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I liked what the company was doing for women who needed help in Sierra Leone.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why anyone would buy a product with \\&quot;Coconut\\&quot; in the description if they don&#x27;t like the smell of coconut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot and it does nicely moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li> And it smelled nice too.  </li>
            <li> This product does a nice job of defining curls however it is greasy greasy greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hair turns into new hair whenever I apply this wonderfully creamy, moisturizing and penetrating milk.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice -- and everytime I use it, most wonder what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing.     </li>
            <li> And, best of all, it left my daughter&#x27;s hair looking really good.</li>
            <li> The best part was waking up this morning and my hair was still moisturized and very soft.</li>
            <li> It is the best fragrance I have ever smelled in a conditioner and shampoo, which is a surprise considering it&#x27;s all natural!  </li>
            <li> If you have natural hair and use it to do 2 or 3 strand twists, it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li> Someone mentioned that they liked the \\&quot;smoothie\\&quot; version of this better</li>
            <li> The next morning, I took the twists out and my hair was feeling and looking great, soft, volume, no frizz, beautifully formed curls, shiny,  to the ends, and I had a very good hair day!.</li>
            <li> However, I deducted one star because it is more effective as a moisturizer than a \\&quot;style\\&quot; product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good but it works good too!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for easy detangling and abundant moisture.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to respond better when the Curl and Style Milk  is layered over a more moisturizing leave-in, instead of being used as a stand-alone leave-in.  </li>
            <li> When used as a stand-alone leave-in, my hair becomes progressively more crispy throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I find the CD Hair Milk to be more moisturizing, and better able to retain the moisture in my hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wells amazingly well to smooth my hair and to detangle it.</li>
            <li> For me, it worked out for my hair much better.  </li>
            <li> I love the shea moisture coconut and hibiscus line.</li>
            <li> Many reviews raved about this product, but it appeared to work just okay for me.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> But I used it for twist outs, and for moisturizing and refreshing all kinds of hairstyles</li>
            <li> (by the way i always get mine from walgreens or target for $10 i dont know why its so much more online)</li>
            <li> Which worked well, but I wanted something better.</li>
            <li> GREAT product, HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are organic and that it contains coconut oil.</li>
            <li> And if youre using it onyour kids, I think they will love the smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells more like pineapple than any of the stated ingredients, and it&#x27;s quite fragranced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already head over hills in love with the styling</li>
            <li> and I was in awww!</li>
            <li> I really do love this stuff and will buy it again</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with Shea moisture as of today</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I purchase it at walgreens for $6 I was baffled at why it cost $33 on here.</li>
            <li> It has nice, light, coconuty smell that doesn&#x27;t fade, which I love.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> This one is perfect for my hair - it definitely moisturizes and holds all day and its fragrance is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> And just a glance at the label will tell you how much better these products are for your hair health.</li>
            <li> It smells like suntan oil, which I love.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is awesome and will be repurchased.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>

            <li> I plan to try one of Shea Moisture&#x27;s products that adds a bit more moisture to my hair, as well.</li>
            <li> This entire line is awesome for my hair.</li>
            <li> I just got the &amp;#34;smoothie&amp;#34; from this line, and it has given better styling results than this style milk.</li>
            <li> Even the coconut fragrance couldn&#x27;t make me love this.</li>
            <li> I have bought several from this line of product and I would say that I like this item the best.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> My ends have improved 100% using this line--no more dryness, and I&#x27;m beginning to see a reduction in splits and damage as well.  </li>
            <li> I must say that my hair has never felt and looked so healthy since using this.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know such a perfect hair product could exist.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love the way it moisturized my hair</li>
            <li> :).</li>
            <li> I love the smell, which is not too overbearing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and all of the Curl products of this company.</li>
            <li> better deals at walgreens</li>
            <li> Please watch the video review for specifics of the product and more of my experience with it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> In addition to moisture, my braid outs are more defined.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never quite sure which it&#x27;s going to be from day to day.  </li>
            <li> and I love the tropical smell.  </li>
            <li> I also use Shea Moisture&#x27;s Souffle and a TINY amount of gel to get my best curls.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love this line of products and think that there&#x27;s something in it that will work for just about everyone.  </li>
            <li> You just have to keep searching. :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell too.  </li>
            <li> My goal of BSL may have to wait until make more $$$$.</li>
            <li> This styling milk has such a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to get a great lift.</li>
            <li> When comparing this to the Shea Moisture Souffle, this was a lot more moisturizing as well.</li>
            <li> in fact, my hair looked really healthy (not greasy)</li>
            <li> I used this in  a variety of ways and love it with each use.</li>
            <li> I had defined lovely twists.</li>
            <li> Still love it.</li>
            <li> Love coconut smell and works for my hair.</li>
            <li> but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mostly oil</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day, and my hair is SO healthy.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Rite-Aid for seven bucks, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s so reasonable!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and smells great, and has protein in it, which is good for strengthening the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use it daily as I think it would lead to product build up.</li>
            <li> She had pretty good results,</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair manageable, soft and silky, and beautifully curly with lots of shine.  </li>
            <li> so I poured it out, but I have since then have repurchased it from Target, and I like it very much, Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This is practically the perfect balance of ingredients to moisturize even extremely dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have heard many good things about She Moisture products but the price really has kept me from purchasing any of them.  </li>
            <li> Unlike all versions of Argan oil/Moroccan oil (fine hair) products I&#x27;ve tried, this is more moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t cause any greasy feeling or weight.</li>
            <li> This product is very good but do your homework is only $9.99 at Target.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to know that all the ingredients are completely natural.</li>
            <li> great products for natural hair</li>
            <li> I have type 3A curls and this cream makes my curls soft and springy and it smells great.</li>
            <li> The style and conditioning milk melts the tangles in my hair and provides excellent slip so I can easy run my fingers or wide tooth comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a styling routine and products I use that I&#x27;m loving right now, so</li>
            <li> I love that there are no silicones or non-animal/earth friendly ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> I started using the smoothie originally which I also fell in love with</li>
            <li> The conditioners have a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so detangling is easy.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say more than it&#x27;s amazing and its what I was looking for ,,,, thanks a lot for item ,</li>
            <li> I like everything about this product; it smells great and the texture leaves my hair feelings soft, smooth, and silky.  </li>
            <li> Of all the Shea Moisture products I have tried, this one is by far my favorite and the most effective.</li>
            <li> and it gave me beautifully washed &amp; conditioned hair the following day.</li>
            <li> The best product hands down.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time last night and I absolutely love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hair diameter: fine      </li>
            <li> It is super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo111XN4ZR7JMM7]]Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk is great for refreshing dry hair.</li>
            <li> This feels great as a deep conditioning product and I would buy it again for that purpose, but not as a styling cream.</li>
            <li> I would describe the product overall as soothing and not too product-y, which is great.  </li>
            <li> smooth</li>
            <li> This product is now available at any walgreens, and beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use products that provide moisture</li>
            <li> This product does provide great moisture for my granddaughter after her bath, but only for that night.</li>
            <li> and I end up re-applying more and more each time before her next bath to keep her hair nice and moisturized with curls in tact.</li>
            <li> There were great reviews on several sites.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great for curly or wavy hair of all races--I&#x27;m white</li>
            <li> , it was light , penetrated well, wasn&#x27;t feeling to oily.</li>
            <li> I ve use several Shea moisture leave in conditioners and in the beginning the products seems great but after a while.</li>
            <li> After it has dried I find myself thinking, \\&quot;What is that wonderful fragrance, oh,</li>
            <li> This is one of my staple product as a natural and it is good for all hair types and textures.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those bewho really want the best from a product especially when there is a lot of hype around a brand.</li>
            <li> and I loved it because it made my hair soft and moisturized immediately.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never disappointed by the ingredient lists from this company, so I gave it a shot even though it is for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this a month ago</li>
            <li> Since the Curl Enhancing Smoothie is my #1 favorite, and does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased two and returned the unopened one to  Target.</li>
            <li> The price is more than you&#x27;d pay with most other moisturizers, but it&#x27;s not outrageous and I expect to pay a bit more for quality.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this is very refreshing for my curls.</li>
            <li> It is affordable and easily accessible.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I was so pleased because, for me, it seemed to amplify my curls.</li>
            <li> It was love at first coil.</li>
            <li> This is also great to use on dry hair or when you skip a day to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk because of the wholesome natural ingredients, awesome results and ease of accessibility (sold at Target, Walgreen&#x27;s, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells so nice, and I feel safe using it every day because I can actually pronounce all the ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for over a year and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and have been looking for a good product forever and finally found it!</li>
            <li> Maybe I was thinking it would be a better conditioner, but because it&#x27;s a &#x27;milk&#x27; and much lighter, I don&#x27;t feel my hair is receiving what it needs.</li>
            <li> The smoothie is good for deep conditioning though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than the curl enhancing smoothie (which I love as well for my twist outs); but for my wash and gos, this is my product of choice.  </li>
            <li> Seems nice so far.</li>
            <li> I went through most of my life thinking I just had really poofy hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> My favorite application is to use straight as a moisturizer before twisting or braiding at night.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet, tropical scent.</li>
            <li> My twists looked good for an entire week.</li>
            <li> Love it and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The consistency is like lotion and the fragrance is sweet</li>
            <li> I love the Manuka Honey formula the best (available only at Target), but also the Raw Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> It removes all traces of gooey styling products and hairspray and it smells really clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> A really dedicated natural diva could buy glycerin, and still come out ahead (price wise) when buying Shea Moisture compared to KBB&#x27;s Ambrosia.     </li>
            <li> I have caved in and just reordered Mixed Chicks leave in (love the product just don&#x27;t love the price)</li>
            <li> Well after three days of using it, I have noticed  with more and more alarm that my hair has a white waxy build-up.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend since it is cheap, and works pretty well.</li>
            <li> so finding the happy medium for encouraging curls, discouraging fuzz, giving body, and not weighing it down is quite a challenge...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Left my daughters hair moist, easy to comb and smelling fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been trying alot of products in the past few weeks and this one is definitely the best one (with the best price).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to get a guy to use styling products, but this one is the perfect formula for him.  </li>
            <li> but my goodness so limp and greasy that even with great curl definition it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> This was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> moisturize , I apply leave-in conditioner and then Shea Moisture Curl an Style Milk on freshly washed and conditioned hair.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE how soft AND defined my curls are.</li>
            <li> It smells like a freshly baked cookie and</li>
            <li> I found out about this on youtube natural hair community, and I love the smell and texture of this products.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a great bargain, especially for a natural product.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> No crazy chemicals.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny because I use it in all of our hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to comb my fingers through it too, which I am not normally able to do do to static &amp; easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> is more especially with organic products because they are so rich</li>
            <li> We love how it smells (like coconuts) and it keeps her long curly hair in nice soft condition....</li>
            <li> wish their other products smelled as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it would be a good idea to branch out and try other things in this line up.</li>
            <li> so it lays right.  </li>
            <li> I use it right after a wash when the hair is damp.</li>
            <li> He has some gray on top and it&#x27;s really wiry and has a mind of its own and this styling product helps tame his wayward strands.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve ever found, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products to tame my curly, frizztastic hair.</li>
            <li> but Shea Moisture has made my journey towards having fully natural hair a pretty dang easy one.</li>
            <li> It came very fast and it didn&#x27;t leak or anything.</li>
            <li> I had used a very popular, high end, black hair product to wash/condish my hair</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve never had people compliment me so much on my curls!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my son hair moisturize, it only help me to plat his hair and nothing more.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY SHEA MOISTURE products are posted with such INFLATED PRICES!</li>
            <li> which ties for first place with this hair milk.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that yes, this is cheaper at Target or Walgreen&#x27;s than on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Please look carefully at the ingredients and make sure you are not spending more money for this product which doesn&#x27;t contain all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 2b with some 2c sections with bra-strap length hair, and can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use about the size of a nickel and first pull through my ends like in a pony tail and concentrate on lathering it on the ends.</li>
            <li> My review of this product is below, but first I&#x27;ll include the correct ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Water is the first ingredient, and the oils and butters seal the moisture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working pretty well.  </li>
            <li> conditions…restoring body and shine&amp;#34;) made sense to my immediate situation.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product, I was unsure of it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> Will definitely get more</li>
            <li> but wow -- this is really worth trying!  </li>
            <li> My Caucasian hair is color treated and SM&#x27;s sulfate free shampoos leave my hair soft, supple and really shiny.  </li>
            <li> At first, i was very hesitant to buy this product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the style milk I applied too much</li>
            <li> Less is pretty much more with this product, but I love that when I applied a bit too much the first time, I simply left it on overnight</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> To be certain, one gets a lot of product for money, packed with high-quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li> While I do not use the product  she is very loyal to any product that helps her manage her very curly hair, knowing she has asked me to reorder this product multiple times is a show of the loyalty.  </li>
            <li> (the bottom part curls just fine without the extra hold).</li>
            <li> I moved to a very dry state and have tried so many products.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it is hard to find good product that does not leave your hair oily or flaky.</li>
            <li> and I was ready to return it.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipment ...</li>
            <li> gentle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I assumed I would enjoy the entire line.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> (an issue with relaxed hair), or required me to use too much to achieve the desired results.</li>
            <li> Conditioning Milk has absolutely none of these problems.</li>
            <li> After doing tons of reading online, I discovered that what kinky hair really needs, in abundance, is moisture.</li>
            <li> and it really does help eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> Really my hair seems indifferent to the stuff.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to give my hair definition or much hold.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and defining.</li>
            <li> i have type 3c curls, very porous.</li>
            <li> He hates styling products, but after much prodding (and a look in the mirror)</li>
            <li> The Manuka Honey formula smells like wildflower honey and really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> Based on his now smooth and shiny hair, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this product works well to separate the curls and keep the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> It smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li> I really like the Shea Moisture brand</li>
            <li> Much cheaper, and often on sale (online)</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t have to use a lot to begin with.</li>
            <li> I want a more wet defined look</li>
            <li> I use this even before I blow my hair out straight.</li>
            <li> I do really like this brand.  </li>
            <li> Thank you SO MUCH Shea Moisture.  </li>
            <li> I am really picky when it comes to hair products</li>
            <li> the whole line does what it says.</li>
            <li> if you follow the natural hair type system) and a pea size amount is more than enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many natural products and this is the only one that works for me texture-wise.  </li>
            <li> Product left my hair feeling soft and my curls show alot more since i started using this product.</li>
            <li> After I bought it, I was surprised my local Walgreens carried so many of their products.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper at Target, but sometimes my target is slow in restocking and it good to know I can overnight with my Amazon prime in a pinch.</li>
            <li> The Conditioning Curl Milk does the trick (in terms of supporting my natural curl while it dries)!</li>
            <li> It is more like a really watered down lotion for your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing,  but small bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have been let down so many times with organic gels</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was as chemical free as possible that would tame my friz &amp; static &amp; keep my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really in love with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo with apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> I added more water to the mixture and the results is less sticky.    </li>
            <li> I typically use it on top of the Curling Gel souffle.</li>
            <li> I used it on my twists and they were super shiny and curly in and even when I took them out a week later.</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing both this hair milk and the curl smoothie from target or Walgreens $ 7.99-11.00 because though very similar in ingrediants the textures are different and the smoothie has more hold.</li>
            <li> This product is one I tried on a whim, mainly b/c</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products for my frizzy hair, expensive and inexpensive...</li>
            <li> When I did I had to go back and buy 3 more bottles for myself and 2 extra to try for my daughter who has 3c hair type.</li>
            <li> Can someone have samples so that if it does not work for a particular hair pattern we dont feel like a loser for throwing it away???</li>
            <li> I use Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk to moisturize my hair in high humidity weather (no glycerin) and to re-moisturize my hair during the week.</li>
            <li> Believe me it is very easy to go overboard with this hair milk.  </li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with very think, very long (two feet),  mildly curly hair/ spirally and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with my hair type so a bottle lasts me for almost 3 months- and good ingredients.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Curl Milk for any natural ladies or for any ladies with very curly hair.</li>
            <li> It drives me crazy, because at first my curls look great and they&#x27;re bouncing all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Iastly, I don&#x27;t have a lot of money but really wanted a mostly natural product</li>
            <li> KBB&#x27;s decreased the amount of Hair Ambrosia for their customers, albeit they hide it by putting it in a more sophisticated \\&quot;branded\\&quot; bottle, and use 400ml instead of the 6.something oz, you&#x27;re actually getting.</li>
            <li> Also my hair will feel moisturized for a good 3-4 days after applying so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The only time I switch to another moisturizer is when I heat style (rarely).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use hair product, but wanted to try something to give my curls some oomph.  </li>
            <li> Still has a few more additives than I would prefer.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently to products, so this product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I love how it hydrates &amp; weighs my hair down just enough that the frizz can&#x27;t get a good foothold--my hair is still thick &amp; wavy, but it behaves well too!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> And if we apply to wet hair, my childrens curls dry so beautifully, without the crunch of some other curl products.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of using more next time since her hair is very, very dry.</li>
            <li> I just rub a little on my hair and it instantly tames the frizz and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for something that would soften and moisturize my new growth as well as the relaxed portion.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes so well that it even softens my new growth with</li>
            <li> It does not set off my allergies or sensitivities though, so I can live with it.</li>
            <li> Very natural,</li>
            <li> Plus he has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> but my very busy lifestyle I prefer to do it once</li>
            <li> The reason why is because it left my hair kind of greasy and stiff.  </li>
            <li> However, after I rub it in and dry my hair, it feels a bit crisp and very brittle.</li>
            <li> Before Shea Moisture, I&#x27;ve used Kinky Curly (great product as well, but hard to find in stores) and Carol&#x27;s Daughter (more expensive).</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair with water only, towel dried, applied 4 dime sized amount to semi damp hair, and  let dry in a very loose bun; my hair smells, looks, and feels great!</li>
            <li> Just enough to tame the frizzies and leave nice looking, natural, not hard or crispy curls.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I set my hair in those spiral curlers overnight the next morning when I was separating my curls</li>
            <li> Yes, Shea Moisture doesn&#x27;t have KBB&#x27;s variety of scents (like white tea, honey and oatmeal, etc;).</li>
            <li> The Original - prior to purchasing and using the Curl and Style Milk, and have used it since purchasing the latter.  </li>
            <li> Sad because their Smoothie product has been the best for my 3b hair, with my \\&quot;other\\&quot; #1 Shea Moisture product being the Deep Masque Treatment (which provides the same results as the Smoothie, for me anyway).</li>
            <li> This is a complete pass for me!</li>
            <li> BUT their shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft like a conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Not only does it make your hair look better in the short term, it actually moisturizes it too (instead of drying it out).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an asian female with straight fine hair who gets the old-fashioned type perm (not the digital perms) to get 2B curls.</li>
            <li> As much as I loved this product, my hair started getting really stiff and greasy especially in the back.  </li>
            <li> Product stayed on top of my hair, weighed it down, and left it looking nappy.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly white girl hair and love this stuff!</li>
            <li> With such a quality product at a reasonable price, AND I&#x27;m getting more for my money -- it&#x27;s hard (for me) to justify buying KBB&#x27;s Hair Ambrosia anymore...</li>
            <li> it hydrated my hair, left my hair very moist not greasy and so soft</li>
            <li> Why does the Product Review say to \\&quot;AVOID APPLYING DIRECTLY TO ROOTS?\\</li>
            <li> (I have natural hair that is 4a\b\c</li>
            <li> In the summertime I wear my hair in an afro or twists, so I need something to keep my kinks soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> These products smell like heaven and soften my natural type 4 hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels really soft and its not greasy.</li>
            <li> Feels really moisturized especially on my ends</li>
            <li> My hair was instantly moisturized, my curls came to life and my hair was very shiny.</li>
            <li> and I am protein sensitive</li>
            <li> its also adds natural shine, and curl definition.</li>
            <li> Note: I&#x27;ve been both natural (type 4a) and relaxed and have used Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl &amp; Style Milk on both hair types.</li>
            <li> This is my staple moisturizer, regardless of whether I&#x27;ve been relaxed or natural, and my comments apply to my experiences using this product on both hair types.  </li>
            <li> If you use to curl your hair with a curling iron, your curls will be soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders for curly hair and feels really soft on hair.</li>
            <li> This leave in made my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Makes my curls bouncy and soft and not heavy.  </li>
            <li> my curls soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I have natural type 4 hair</li>
            <li> All of which are far inferior in one way or another to SM&#x27;s conditioning milk.  </li>
            <li> So I came here and nearly fell over from sticker shock.  </li>
            <li> it helps form my curls with soft touch.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really want to say is that you can also buy it at Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have 4 A natural hair.  </li>
            <li> This product does contain glycols which, they try to hide in the ingredient list by listing it with natural components.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li> This is a natural product, so it smells like the ingredients--especially coconut.  </li>
            <li> Surprised?</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this product, but I just started using this recently</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised that I still have not run out.</li>
            <li> Hair type: 4c (natural)    </li>
            <li> Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl &amp; Style Milk is my go-to product for a soft, wavy, shiny twist or braid out.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up, instead of having greasy hair, I have soft, manageable, and even BRUSHABLE hair.</li>
            <li> Most of the moisturizers I tried prior to this one either didn&#x27;t completely absorb into my hair, didn&#x27;t keep my hair moisturized, were too heavy and caused stiffness</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s not the cheapest product (about 3-4 times more expensive than the Organics Kids), but I do think it&#x27;s worth the cost</li>
            <li> The hair milk has a nice smell and is not too thick, however it provides zero hydration and actually made my hair feel even drier.</li>
            <li> Target is selling the same for $7.99 right now and the regular price is $9.99, you could get 2 for the price of one.</li>
            <li> I apply this to wet hair right after my acv hair rinse.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times, after conditioning with Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner, and, after applying the Restorative Conditioner as a leave-in, with the Curl and Style Milk on top.  </li>
            <li> It is very light and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usually had to sacrifice moisture for aesthetic (silicone-laden moisturizers that make the hair look nice temporarily, but do nothing to improve moisture in the hair) or vice versa (moisturizers that have quality ingredients, but are too heavy and leave your hair looking like you&#x27;ve put too much product in).  </li>
            <li> I am also loving the antibreakage masque by Shea Moisture - I can already tell a dramatic difference in my hair texture with these products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a different line of products, one that specifically had coconut oil as the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this hair lotion.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it&#x27;s not a little tiny bottle for $10 that you will only be able to use a few times</li>
            <li> My hair is not very heavy and greasy after I use it</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as it said on the bottle; apply to hair when wet.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers with silicones cause too much build-up when used daily and don&#x27;t allow moisture to penetrate once they&#x27;ve coated the hair strand, causing dryness in the long-run unless you remove them with sulfates on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t use the milk as a leave-in, but apply it after shampoo or CO, leave for a few minutes, and then rinse lightly.  </li>
            <li> If you are into types, I have a 4B/4C type hair, porous, thick and snags easily.</li>
            <li> It absorbs right into my hair without leaving a residue on the surface or making it stiff and stringy, keeps it moisturized, and makes it EXTREMELY soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and creamy - definitely lighter than some of Shea Moisture&#x27;s other moisturizers - yet I only need to use a relatively moderate amount to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding products that work well consistently, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a really moisturizing line for some time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it numerous times because I am pleased with this product line, however this is not good for me.</li>
            <li> Not only tit leave my hair soft-</li>
            <li> I have used it only once so far</li>
            <li> (otherwise her curls are frizzy and you can barely see them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it to retwist my hair into two strand twists and the next day it was SOOOOO soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy &amp; lower back length.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product while I was transitioning into natural hair, and didn&#x27;t know what I had</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural - total bonus.  </li>
            <li> Wash and condition your hair, squeeze out the extra water, and put about a half-palmful of this in--scrunch it all over, comb it in, scrunch again, and I bet you&#x27;ll see a major difference in your curls!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly frizzy but is very much like the smoothie from Shea moisture</li>
            <li> (shampoo &amp; conditioner was Shea Moisture for damaged hair), towel dried &amp; then put a little more than dime-sized amount through out my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the cheapest product (about 3-4 times more expensive than the Organics Kids), but I do think it&#x27;s worth the costeighed down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a good moisturizer for tight curls, especially one that&#x27;s just the right consistency, not too thick, not too lightweight.  </li>
            <li> My only advice would be just be careful not to use too much at first or it might get a little too greasy, start with a small amount then add more to achieve the look you want.</li>
            <li> I have been using several Shea Moisture products since I began letting my natural hair grow out last summer.</li>
            <li> If I want the \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; bouncy look I just rub a little in between my palms and finger through my hair and dry on low then a blast of cool to seal the cuticle(less frizz).If</li>
            <li> I have 4a/4b curls and my hair is very thick and dries out easily.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so its worth every penny ($9.99).</li>
            <li> I think these women are using wayy too much product I&#x27;ve learned in my journey less</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft but it will dry out over the course of the day because it&#x27;s water based.</li>
            <li> My natural 4a/b hair suffer from dryness and nothing I used gave me long lasting moisture that is until I found this heaven in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product at Target (same price) for my 3 year old daughter who has dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> (the price is NOT right on AMAZON; however, the price IS right at Target... as the other reviewers will tell you).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 4c natural, my hair was very dry (like a brillo pad ) on my sides and back of head.</li>
            <li> And the price is just right, since when my hair is curly (as opposed to blown out and flat ironed), I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I hair red coarse curly hair, medium brown wavy,  light brown (not sure) and thin straight blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Even when I let my hair dry naturally or use low heat, it still feels dry.  </li>
            <li> Upon application it was very moisturizing and it instantly started to detangle my 4B hair which was a curly, dry mess at the time.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried putting a small amount and a large amount in my hair</li>
            <li> Often times, after I wash and condition, I simply apply this, allow to air dry, while scrunching to ensure big hair.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast its unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I have long (currently hip length) 2c/3b hair.</li>
            <li> The style did not last long</li>
            <li> I recently went natural and got the big chop a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> then I rub IC hair polisher styling gel then dry on low.</li>
            <li> My results on dry hair are only so so.</li>
            <li> , I am disappointed because I ve been searching for similar all natural products but they are more money.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very dry, did not moisturize a thing.</li>
            <li> My hair went almost 100% flat from the dry weather.</li>
            <li> Makes it so soft and manageable, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I chose this product to begin with, except that it was clearly a leave-in, but my expectations for the Shea Moisture were relatively low --</li>
            <li> I am trying to stretch my relaxer for as long as I can</li>
            <li> To me it smells quite different when it is wet.</li>
            <li> they do not weigh down my curl, but give them enough moisture and have brought back the shape of my curl.</li>
            <li> To re-moisturize, I apply Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk to lightly dampened (water or aloe vera juice) or dry hair and re-set (braids, two-strand twisted Bantu knots, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was left with wet, matted, tangled, squeaky clean hair (a 4C nightmare).  </li>
            <li> This is a rich product, so a little goes a long way--even on my very thick and fairly long hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you have short hair and are using handfuls of this or any other product</li>
            <li> But I would definitely recommend this curl and style cream along with other Shea Moisture shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair smelling like the product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> let it air dry.</li>
            <li> they are really dry</li>
            <li> My hair was desert dry and shrinkage was 50%-60%.</li>
            <li> but my hair doesnt look dry or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> I like misting my dry hair with water before applying it or adding it after my wash.</li>
            <li> Twist it and air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy and curly and DRY.</li>
            <li> My hair was slightly dry, but that&#x27;s because I did not refresh my hair each night.  </li>
            <li> It looked dry but then felt greasy.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much tried product after product after product only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> creams are generally too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I like to use a styling cream on my loose curls to keep them from looking like a frizzy 70&#x27;s &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but I do wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> but 3a/b when wet 4a/4b when dry)</li>
            <li> I am bi racial (1/2 white 1/2 black).</li>
            <li> have African American (4a) hair that I usually wear in a braid out, meaning that I braid it into 10 braids at night and unbraid them in the morning.  </li>
            <li> For second and third day hair I put a small amount of this in my hands, rub together and then add a bit of water and scrunch through my hair.  </li>
            <li> And her hair which is very dry looked moisturized.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, her hair is very dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> After a few hours of putting this in my hair is back dry.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have bad ingredients in it (that had SEVERELY limited the products I had tried)</li>
            <li> I loves the bundle package as I feel it will last me about a year to finish them both or a little over that.  </li>
            <li> I have 2c/3a curls, and it definitely helps keep my frizz in check and smooth over a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> This is too heavy for my straight, thin blonde hair</li>
            <li> Too heavy, left hair feeling sticky</li>
            <li> I initially began using this moisturizer a few years ago because I needed an all-natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not much to say  yet.</li>
            <li> It is lighter than the smoothie but is heavy enough to keep the hair moisturized .</li>
            <li> I co-wash with Suave Naturals, use a heavier rinse-out conditioner, and then use the SM Curl Milk as a leave-in while my hair is soaking wet after I&#x27;ve turned off the shower.</li>
            <li> I put this on after finger combing my wet hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have 3c4a thick and curly natural hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with Shea Moisture too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Like others have said a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little long (around MBL), but I haven&#x27;t had this problem before.  </li>
            <li> I have never had with any other product that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Also, Shea Moisture&#x27;s hair milk isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as KBB&#x27;s  Hair Ambrosia, but I think that&#x27;s mainly due to the lack of vegetable glycerin.</li>
            <li> I have used other products from Shea Moisture with so-so results, but I was not expecting my curls to frizz after applying this hair lotion.</li>
            <li> During those times, I will usually use a moisturize with a ton of silicones in them, such as Lacio Lacio, for increased heat protection.</li>
            <li> So ya, with hair that is even difficult for a cosmetologist I would say I am pretty picky when comes to hair</li>
            <li> When my hair is no longer dripping, I add a small amount of a curl styling gel to my roots and the upper part of my hair</li>
            <li> And a little does go a long way!  </li>
            <li> and I had to put oil and other hair lotions to soften it up.</li>
            <li> The down fall to this item for me personally is that i have dry thick hair.</li>
            <li> I then tied it up in a loose messy bun &amp; slept on it all night.</li>
            <li> (but maybe because I didn&#x27;t use my leave in oyin handmade hair dew) which is to be expected with my texture and how little product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I tried Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie and it left my hair dull and shunken.</li>
            <li> and I get the same dull results.  </li>
            <li> i also have hair that is totally fuzzy (not quite frizzy, just dull fuzzy) without any product.  </li>
            <li> Just an average product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and then the style would last for at least 2-3 days  2.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s thick, curly, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want anything to weigh my hair down as a leave-in conditioner as some can be</li>
            <li> and my hair was weighed down.  </li>
            <li> when I took it down &amp; it was loaded with curls.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps out other wavy-to-curlies!</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture&#x27;s product is almost half the price of KBB&#x27;s Hair Ambrosia ($9.99).</li>
            <li> less greasy less hold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Black woman with 4a hair (using Andre Walker hair typing system)</li>
            <li> I was happy with that product, but hated the ingredient list and grew tired of the smell.  </li>
            <li> My hair was always a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I have probably spent upwards of $1000 in the past two years trying to find a product that 1)</li>
            <li> I like to wear big, curly styles, so this was not good.  </li>
            <li> I like to wear big, curly styles, so this was not good.  </li>
            <li> I have 3b hair and this product made a mess of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy and long.</li>
            <li> As a 3b, shrinkage is my other challenge (next to dryness), but the Hair Milk made it shrink worse than anything I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I like this line of products, yet I was a little dissapointed in this for what it was purchased for.  </li>
            <li> The curl and style conditioning milk did little to nothing for the ends of my hair that behaved as if I hadn&#x27;t applied any of the product to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then I tried this because it seemed a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I have fragile, thin, and damaged hair with a tight coil pattern.  </li>
            <li> This product works well, and is much less &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; than other brands, but it is still a bit hard to the touch.  </li>
            <li> What I failed to do was shake the bottle before applying because since it is natural, some of the ingredients tends to separate.  </li>
            <li> You can use it everyday and not have build up.</li>
            <li> I used this product because I do&#x27;t like to put harsh chemicals into my body.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not parabens, mineral oil and harsh thingd in it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I saw quite a few items from this product line there today.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also want to add that this dried out my hair making it feel almost like a brillo pad.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m having a problem with my curls \\&quot;drooping\\&quot; after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> This totally dried out my hair</li>
            <li> When the product dried on my daughter&#x27;s hair, it did not leave her hair brittle or stiff.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dry, and frizzy curly hair -- and this product makes my curls shinier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> No more greasy stiff hair.  </li>
            <li> I am not really sure how I feel about Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Style Conditioning Milk.  </li>
            <li> sorry I can&#x27;t say the same.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I usually get it on sale at Walgreens or Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Usually shampoos leave my hair feeling like rubber</li>
            <li> THis product is usually under $10-</li>
            <li> Since going \\&quot;green\\&quot;,I have been looking for an organic gel or hair lotion that does not contain harsh chemicals or parabens that would do my curls justice!</li>
            <li> In the past I used Kids Organics Shea Butter lotion while braiding for moisture and hold.  </li>
            <li> so I usually moisturize twice anyway.</li>
            <li> but I will probably throw this out and waste my 9 dollars!</li>
            <li> When I rebraid my hair each night, I rub a small amount of the product into each section.  </li>
            <li> I cover each section thoroughly, roll them up and in the morning my hair has so much bounce to it that it&#x27;s crazy!</li>
            <li> , I have applied it at night  on dry hair and twisted it before wrapping my head.</li>
            <li> I am biracial and my children unfortunately inherited my dry hair as well.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel manageable at least for the moment but not long-lasting effects.</li>
            <li> I think it will work, at least on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this doesn&#x27;t give my hair that silky feeling as a leave-in should.</li>
            <li> I have thick kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my thick, wavy, humidity-loving hair as a  leave-in for about a month now.  </li>
            <li> i have a lot of strands of semi-curley hair but the strands themselves are thin, so creams can be too heavy and gels can take the body out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, I mean if you look at the ingredients</li>
            <li> I had no static, no fly away hairs...</li>
            <li> Beyond that, I will use no other moisturizer and would be extremely disappointed if they ever stopped making the Curl &amp; Style Milk.</li>
            <li> The smell is not good</li>
            <li> I was running late for work and to look at my hair and realize it had a white film all over was really annoying.</li>
            <li> The smell does not linger like some products to the point where it gets annoying, and it doesn&#x27;t get stiff or look wet.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Hope no one else falls in this horrible trap paying $32 for this product when you can get it a whole lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and curly</li>
            <li> I find it impossible to believe that this product dried someone&#x27;s hair out.  </li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s face it: KBB&#x27;s too expensive now.</li>
            <li> because you are\\&quot; suffocating \\&quot;your hair and wasting product.  </li>
            <li> As one reviewer mentioned, its not a perfect hair  moisturizer.</li>
            <li> They are fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> is so sad how people will rip you of if you dont do your resurge.</li>
            <li> product gets 5 stars from me because it exceeded my expectations AND especially because it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of mainstream nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> Sad</li>
            <li> , you can buy it at Target, cvs, rite aid or Sally for 10.00 or less, the price here is outrageous!!</li>
            <li> I was distraught and scared to death.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunatly it has been discontinued (I am very sad about that).</li>
            <li> also in with the girls who buy this at Target--heck, now that I know it&#x27;s crazy expensive online, I&#x27;m stocking up from Target!!)</li>
            <li> So the price is not that bad</li>
            <li> I have used this  once on a bad hair day</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t terrible either.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> I have terribly frizzy hair and have suffered with it all my life.</li>
            <li> And its the worst thing to use for a wash n go.</li>
            <li> This morning was especially bad.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have thick curly white girl hair and love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am trying to stretch my relaxer for as long as I can and I was looking for something that would soften and moisturize my new growth as well as the relaxed portion.  I have never comment on a product before and the reviews were somewhat helpful in my decision to purchase a product.  I have fragile, thin, and damaged hair with a tight coil pattern.  The first time I used it I set my hair in those spiral curlers overnight the next morning when I was separating my curls I notice an immediate difference.  My hair is bouncy, shiny, and my curls hold.  It moisturizes so well that it even softens my new growth with I have never had with any other product that I have ever used.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to stretch their relaxer but you can get it for 9.98 at Walmart.  I hope this helps someone</li>
            <li> I sometimes use Shea Moisture&#x27;s \\&quot;Organic Coconut and Hibiscus Conditioning Curl and Style Milk\\&quot; as my morning hair moisturizer. It smells nice -- and everytime I use it, most wonder what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing.     My all-time favorite hair milk is still Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful Hair Ambrosia --- which provides all-day moisture for my hair, and comes in a number of wonderful scents. But let&#x27;s face it: KBB&#x27;s too expensive now. KBB&#x27;s decreased the amount of Hair Ambrosia for their customers, albeit they hide it by putting it in a more sophisticated \\&quot;branded\\&quot; bottle, and use 400ml instead of the 6.something oz, you&#x27;re actually getting. $16, plus shipping for 6 oz does not equal a bargain in my book.    Shea Moisture&#x27;s product is almost half the price of KBB&#x27;s Hair Ambrosia ($9.99). If you can buy it in a Target store, you&#x27;ll save shipping worries. Their product contains top-quality, organic ingredients. It&#x27;s thicker than KBB\\&quot;s Ambrosia (because it has organic shea butter, KBB\\&quot;s contains none). Yes, Shea Moisture doesn&#x27;t have KBB&#x27;s variety of scents (like white tea, honey and oatmeal, etc;). But, it still smells great. Also, Shea Moisture&#x27;s hair milk isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as KBB&#x27;s  Hair Ambrosia, but I think that&#x27;s mainly due to the lack of vegetable glycerin. A really dedicated natural diva could buy glycerin, and still come out ahead (price wise) when buying Shea Moisture compared to KBB&#x27;s Ambrosia.     A little goes a long way with Shea Moisture too. With such a quality product at a reasonable price, AND I&#x27;m getting more for my money -- it&#x27;s hard (for me) to justify buying KBB&#x27;s Hair Ambrosia anymore... I&#x27;ve only given it four stars, however, because it&#x27;s not as moisturizing (for me anyway) compared to KBB&#x27;s.    SHEA MOISTURE ORGANIC COCONUT and HIBISCUS Conditioning Curl and Style Milk\\&quot;,     Ingredients:  Deionized water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil)*, Isopropyl Myristate, Sugar Starch, Silk Protein, Essential Oil Blend, Melila Azadirachta (Neem) Seed Oil Caprylyl glycol, Sorbitol Esters, Algae Extract, Hyssopus Officinalis Extract, Salvia Officinalis, (Sage) Leaf and Equisetum Arvenese Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Price $9.99.    *Certified Organic</li>
            <li> I am not really sure how I feel about Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Style Conditioning Milk.  To be certain, one gets a lot of product for money, packed with high-quality ingredients.  That said, I think that it may be the coconut in this product which doesn&#x27;t agree with my hair.  I have used it several times, after conditioning with Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner, and, after applying the Restorative Conditioner as a leave-in, with the Curl and Style Milk on top.  My hair seems to respond better when the Curl and Style Milk  is layered over a more moisturizing leave-in, instead of being used as a stand-alone leave-in.  When used as a stand-alone leave-in, my hair becomes progressively more crispy throughout the day.  I was using Carol&#x27;s Daughter Hair Milk - The Original - prior to purchasing and using the Curl and Style Milk, and have used it since purchasing the latter.  I find the CD Hair Milk to be more moisturizing, and better able to retain the moisture in my hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am on the proverbial fence with respect to this product.  I will strive to use it up, but, I cannot say at this point in time if I will re-purchase it.</li>
            <li> Why does the Product Review say to \\&quot;AVOID APPLYING DIRECTLY TO ROOTS?\\&quot; I don&#x27;t understand why this would be a condition to follow. Would someone please explain this to me. thank you kindly. Please know that I&#x27;ve not used this product but my best friend has &amp; she loves it.</li>
            <li> Wells amazingly well to smooth my hair and to detangle it. The moisture lasts for days. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair stylist told me to get some sort of hair repair product (to counteract all the dye jobs) and I read that coconut oil is the best thing you can put in your hair. I&#x27;m never disappointed by the ingredient lists from this company, so I gave it a shot even though it is for curly hair. This is too heavy for my straight, thin blonde hair but I started using it as a rinse out conditioner. This feels great as a deep conditioning product and I would buy it again for that purpose, but not as a styling cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve ever found, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products to tame my curly, frizztastic hair. Makes it so soft and manageable, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Wife with curly hair loves this!  While I do not use the product  she is very loyal to any product that helps her manage her very curly hair, knowing she has asked me to reorder this product multiple times is a show of the loyalty.  If you have curly hair and looking for a leave-in to help the fly away&#x27;s this is a winner.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this a month ago and I was ready to return it.  The reason why is because it left my hair kind of greasy and stiff.  What I failed to do was shake the bottle before applying because since it is natural, some of the ingredients tends to separate.  For me, it worked out for my hair much better.  I apply it on hair when it is damp (I have natural hair that is 4a\b\c if you follow the natural hair type system) and a pea size amount is more than enough.  Believe me it is very easy to go overboard with this hair milk.  So the price is not that bad so don&#x27;t let it scare you.</li>
            <li> This is one of my staple products. The Shea Moisture line has been hit and miss for me, but this is a hit. In the summertime I wear my hair in an afro or twists, so I need something to keep my kinks soft and moisturized. This was worth every penny. Even if I forgot to wrap up my hair at night and woke up with the Kid&amp;Play, with this product I was able to coax my hair into a more attractive style with no tangling or breakage.</li>
            <li> I love the shea moisture coconut and hibiscus line. These products smell like heaven and soften my natural type 4 hair. The style and conditioning milk melts the tangles in my hair and provides excellent slip so I can easy run my fingers or wide tooth comb through my hair. If I were gonna be stranded on a desert island, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without my shea moisture products.</li>
            <li> Many reviews raved about this product, but it appeared to work just okay for me. I didn&#x27;t see anything overly wonderful about it. However, it wasn&#x27;t terrible either. Just an average product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I started using this about a month ago and I have to say that I&#x27;ll be using this again. Before Shea Moisture, I&#x27;ve used Kinky Curly (great product as well, but hard to find in stores) and Carol&#x27;s Daughter (more expensive). I have very thick, dry, and frizzy curly hair -- and this product makes my curls shinier and less frizzy. I also love the smell. This is also great to use on dry hair or when you skip a day to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> At first, i was very hesitant to buy this product. But I used it for twist outs, and for moisturizing and refreshing all kinds of hairstyles and it&#x27;s AMAZING! My hair feels really soft and its not greasy. Also my hair will feel moisturized for a good 3-4 days after applying so a little goes a long way! definitely worth every penny. (by the way i always get mine from walgreens or target for $10 i dont know why its so much more online)</li>
            <li> Awesome product well worth the money defines my hair pattern with shine and smells awesome too</li>
            <li> Too heavy, left hair feeling sticky</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I used this product along with the curl smoothie to create two strand twists. Not only tit leave my hair soft- it smelled wonderful! I have also used it as a detangler. A little goes a long way, but I do wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I use Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk to moisturize my hair in high humidity weather (no glycerin) and to re-moisturize my hair during the week. Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk is very moisturizing, give my hair great sheen and has an awesome coconut/pina colada smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To moisturize , I apply leave-in conditioner and then Shea Moisture Curl an Style Milk on freshly washed and conditioned hair. To re-moisturize, I apply Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk to lightly dampened (water or aloe vera juice) or dry hair and re-set (braids, two-strand twisted Bantu knots, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk because of the wholesome natural ingredients, awesome results and ease of accessibility (sold at Target, Walgreen&#x27;s, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Sugar Starch, Silk Protein, Essential Oil Blend, Neem Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitol Esters, Algae Extract, Hyssop Extract, Sage Extract, Horsetail Extract, Carrot Seed Oil, Honeysuckle Flower Extract, Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract, Vitamin E</li>
            <li> Fast shipment ... Smell great</li>
            <li> I have lots of very fine hair with a gentle curl and this product is perfect for it and smells wonderful.  I&#x27;ve tried so many natural products and this is the only one that works for me texture-wise.  The smell does not linger like some products to the point where it gets annoying, and it doesn&#x27;t get stiff or look wet.  Very natural, gentle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish their other products smelled as good as this one.  If they did, I&#x27;d buy them all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I&#x27;m an asian female with straight fine hair who gets the old-fashioned type perm (not the digital perms) to get 2B curls. I used to use John Frieda&#x27;s Dream Curls Curl Perfecting Spray for years. Which worked well, but I wanted something better. I tried Curls Creme Brûlée whipped curl cream but didn&#x27;t like the result or the smell. I purchased this and I LOVE how soft AND defined my curls are. And I&#x27;ve never had people compliment me so much on my curls! GREAT product, HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I have pretty much tried product after product after product only to be disappointed. My hair is thick and wavy and long. So I like to put my products in and run my fingers through it let it air dry. If that&#x27;s what you want to do get this! It&#x27;s amazing. My hair is super soft and silky. Feels really moisturized especially on my ends they are really dry no matter what I do. I&#x27;m so happy I tried this!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time last night and I absolutely love it!!!!!!! I used it with the hello hydration conditioner from herbal essence an my hair is super shiny and not frizzy at all!!!! I have been trying alot of products in the past few weeks and this one is definitely the best one (with the best price). I&#x27;m 26 and have been looking for a good product forever and finally found it! I also like the fact that it&#x27;s not a little tiny bottle for $10 that you will only be able to use a few times and it&#x27;s gone, you get a good amount! I definitely reccomend this product! I love Shea!!</li>
            <li> The hair milk has a nice smell and is not too thick, however it provides zero hydration and actually made my hair feel even drier. As a 3b my hair is prone to dryness so I have to give extra attention to maintain moisture. Since the Curl Enhancing Smoothie is my #1 favorite, and does exactly what it claims to do. End of the day my curls still look fresh and my hair is still wonderfully hydrated, making it manageable and beautiful (imagine that; still having &#x27;perfect&#x27; hair at 5PM! lol). I assumed I would enjoy the entire line. I originally purchased two and returned the unopened one to  Target. I decided to give the opened bottle a chance; perhaps my hair just needed to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Milk update: I used the entire bottle (to the tune of about a dozen uses) with the last of it being used today. My hair was desert dry and shrinkage was 50%-60%. As a 3b, shrinkage is my other challenge (next to dryness), but the Hair Milk made it shrink worse than anything I have ever tried. I will never use the Hair Milk again. Sad because their Smoothie product has been the best for my 3b hair, with my \\&quot;other\\&quot; #1 Shea Moisture product being the Deep Masque Treatment (which provides the same results as the Smoothie, for me anyway).</li>
            <li> I just bought this product at Target (same price) for my 3 year old daughter who has dry, curly hair. I have used it only once so far but I really like it. I love that the ingredients are organic and that it contains coconut oil. The smell is wonderful and not overpowering.  And, best of all, it left my daughter&#x27;s hair looking really good. When the product dried on my daughter&#x27;s hair, it did not leave her hair brittle or stiff. And her hair which is very dry looked moisturized.  I am thinking of using more next time since her hair is very, very dry. I would definitely recommend trying this product. And if youre using it onyour kids, I think they will love the smell.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this hair lotion. I used this product exactly as it said on the bottle; apply to hair when wet. Horrible! It made my curls frizzy which was what I was trying to prevent from happening! I have used other products from Shea Moisture with so-so results, but I was not expecting my curls to frizz after applying this hair lotion. I will stick to my regimen of using organic coconut oil on my hair from now on. This is a complete pass for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I chose this product to begin with, except that it was clearly a leave-in, but my expectations for the Shea Moisture were relatively low -- but wow -- this is really worth trying!  Unlike all versions of Argan oil/Moroccan oil (fine hair) products I&#x27;ve tried, this is more moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t cause any greasy feeling or weight. In fact, the Shea Moisture is excellent at moisturizing and shine and only enhancing your hair, and absorbs beautifully. I love that there are no silicones or non-animal/earth friendly ingredients as well. Less is pretty much more with this product, but I love that when I applied a bit too much the first time, I simply left it on overnight and it gave me beautifully washed &amp; conditioned hair the following day. It just seems to seal the cuticle beautifully and gives my hair bounce and wave. I would describe the product overall as soothing and not too product-y, which is great.  The fragrance smells more like pineapple than any of the stated ingredients, and it&#x27;s quite fragranced. It does not set off my allergies or sensitivities though, so I can live with it. Appears to be a great line/company.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! smaller than I thought though</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells great, and is nice and light so your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. You can use it everyday and not have build up. I used it on my twists and they were super shiny and curly in and even when I took them out a week later. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders in my son&#x27;s hair. He has a mix of textures throughout his hair and it worked on everyone and didn&#x27;t leave it looking greasy. Plus he has very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t make his head itch...... Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail yesterday. I&#x27;m already head over hills in love with the styling smooth so I thought it would be a good idea to branch out and try other things in this line up. I have 4a/4b curls and my hair is very thick and dries out easily. I applied the milk to damp hair like it said to and I was in awww! My hair was instantly moisturized, my curls came to life and my hair was very shiny. A little really does go a long way and I liked that because that means I will get lots of uses out of it. The best part was waking up this morning and my hair was still moisturized and very soft. The milk is a light weight  cream making it perfect for my summer styling. During the winter I use thicker heaver butters. I really do love this stuff and will buy it again</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with Shea moisture as of today I wish I could post a pic of my curls.  My waistlength curls shrinks to my shoulders ( i dont like to hairtype but 3a/b when wet 4a/4b when dry) and I am protein sensitive so I won&#x27;t use it every day but my hair doesnt look dry or feel crunchy. I think these women are using wayy too much product I&#x27;ve learned in my journey less is more especially with organic products because they are so rich so if you have short hair and are using handfuls of this or any other product I think you should continue to find something else because you are\\&quot; suffocating \\&quot;your hair and wasting product.  I rinsed my hair with water only, towel dried, applied 4 dime sized amount to semi damp hair, and  let dry in a very loose bun; my hair smells, looks, and feels great! It&#x27;s slightly frizzy but is very much like the smoothie from Shea moisture less greasy less hold (but maybe because I didn&#x27;t use my leave in oyin handmade hair dew) which is to be expected with my texture and how little product I&#x27;ve used. I recommend purchasing both this hair milk and the curl smoothie from target or Walgreens $ 7.99-11.00 because though very similar in ingrediants the textures are different and the smoothie has more hold. I can&#x27;t wait to use both together but as of now I don&#x27;t need to because my hair looks great with this alone.</li>
            <li> I like this line of products, yet I was a little dissapointed in this for what it was purchased for.  Maybe I was thinking it would be a better conditioner, but because it&#x27;s a &#x27;milk&#x27; and much lighter, I don&#x27;t feel my hair is receiving what it needs. I didn&#x27;t want anything to weigh my hair down as a leave-in conditioner as some can be which is why I chose this product. I have thick curly hair and this doesn&#x27;t give my hair that silky feeling as a leave-in should.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my son hair moisturize, it only help me to plat his hair and nothing more. I will not repurchase, my son hair is curly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. My natural 4a/b hair suffer from dryness and nothing I used gave me long lasting moisture that is until I found this heaven in a bottle. A little goes a long way so its worth every penny ($9.99). I apply this to wet hair right after my acv hair rinse. It leaves my hair moisturized for the entire week its also adds natural shine, and curl definition. The best product hands down. I have a staple leave in for life.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I purchase it at walgreens for $6 I was baffled at why it cost $33 on here. it is a rip off!!!! This product is now available at any walgreens, and beauty supply stores. I love the product but save yourself $28 and go to wal greens!</li>
            <li> Note: I&#x27;ve been both natural (type 4a) and relaxed and have used Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl &amp; Style Milk on both hair types. This is my staple moisturizer, regardless of whether I&#x27;ve been relaxed or natural, and my comments apply to my experiences using this product on both hair types.  I initially began using this moisturizer a few years ago because I needed an all-natural moisturizer. Moisturizers with silicones cause too much build-up when used daily and don&#x27;t allow moisture to penetrate once they&#x27;ve coated the hair strand, causing dryness in the long-run unless you remove them with sulfates on a regular basis. Most of the moisturizers I tried prior to this one either didn&#x27;t completely absorb into my hair, didn&#x27;t keep my hair moisturized, were too heavy and caused stiffness (an issue with relaxed hair), or required me to use too much to achieve the desired results. Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Conditioning Milk has absolutely none of these problems. It absorbs right into my hair without leaving a residue on the surface or making it stiff and stringy, keeps it moisturized, and makes it EXTREMELY soft. I&#x27;ve never used a moisturizer that has given me all of these things in one. I&#x27;ve usually had to sacrifice moisture for aesthetic (silicone-laden moisturizers that make the hair look nice temporarily, but do nothing to improve moisture in the hair) or vice versa (moisturizers that have quality ingredients, but are too heavy and leave your hair looking like you&#x27;ve put too much product in).  The smell is also incredible. It has nice, light, coconuty smell that doesn&#x27;t fade, which I love. It&#x27;s light and creamy - definitely lighter than some of Shea Moisture&#x27;s other moisturizers - yet I only need to use a relatively moderate amount to moisturize my hair. It&#x27;s also great to know that all the ingredients are completely natural. The price is more than you&#x27;d pay with most other moisturizers, but it&#x27;s not outrageous and I expect to pay a bit more for quality.  The only time I switch to another moisturizer is when I heat style (rarely). During those times, I will usually use a moisturize with a ton of silicones in them, such as Lacio Lacio, for increased heat protection. Beyond that, I will use no other moisturizer and would be extremely disappointed if they ever stopped making the Curl &amp; Style Milk. There have often been BOGO sales on Shea Moisture products. I never miss an opportunity to snap up several Curl &amp; Style Milk moisturizers anytime that happens!  Ingredients: Deionized Water , Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) , Cocos Nucifera Oil (Coconut) , Sugar Starch , Silk Protein , Essential Oil Blend , Melia Azadirachta Seed Oil (Neem) , Caprylyl Glycol , Sorbitol Esters , Algae Extract , Hlyssopus Officinalis Extract , Salvia Officinalis Leaf and Equisetum Arvense Extract (Sage) , Daucus Carota Sativa Seed Oil (Carrot) , Lonicera Caprifolium Flower Lonicera Japonica Flower Extract (Honeysuckle and Japanese Honeysuckle) , Tocopherol (Vitamin E)</li>
            <li> I have been using several Shea Moisture products since I began letting my natural hair grow out last summer. I&#x27;m a Black woman with 4a hair (using Andre Walker hair typing system) and since 2005 I&#x27;ve kept my hair very short. Last year I decided to let my hair grow out and I began searching for products that would help me keep my hair in good shape. After doing tons of reading online, I discovered that what kinky hair really needs, in abundance, is moisture. It&#x27;s important to use products that provide moisture and/or help retain moisture. This curl moisture milk is excellent at providing moisture for kinky or very curly hair. I use it daily after wetting my hair thoroughly with water and then I follow up with argan oil to seal the moisture in. My curls are so defined! Even before I did the big chop I never had defined curls. My hair was always a frizzy mess. Now I can see my corkscrew curlies in all their glory and it&#x27;s wonderful! I highly recommend Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Curl Milk for any natural ladies or for any ladies with very curly hair. It&#x27;s inexpensive, smells good and it really does help eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does wonders for my hair but I gave it one star on here because you can get the same product for $9.99 from Target.com or some actual Target stores. Hope no one else falls in this horrible trap paying $32 for this product when you can get it a whole lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a good moisturizer for tight curls, especially one that&#x27;s just the right consistency, not too thick, not too lightweight.  This one is perfect for my hair - it definitely moisturizes and holds all day and its fragrance is not too overpowering. And the price is just right, since when my hair is curly (as opposed to blown out and flat ironed), I use it everyday! -- (the price is NOT right on AMAZON; however, the price IS right at Target... as the other reviewers will tell you).  I am also loving the antibreakage masque by Shea Moisture - I can already tell a dramatic difference in my hair texture with these products. And just a glance at the label will tell you how much better these products are for your hair health. It&#x27;s a no brainer!!</li>
            <li> I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY SHEA MOISTURE products are posted with such INFLATED PRICES! THE RETAIL PRICE FOR ALL PRODUCTS OF THE SHEA MOISTURE LINE IS $9.99. YOU CAN PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS FOR 9.99 AT TARGET OR WALGREENS! IF YOU PURCHASE FROM THIS VENDOR YOU ARE BEING RIPPED OFF! THEIR PRICES ARE INFLATED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZERO STARS FOR BEAUTYONLINE&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS FOR SHEA MOISTURE - EXCELLENT CONDITIONER!</li>
            <li> For making buns and ponytails, this stuff smooths and silkens your hair so it lays right.  If you use to curl your hair with a curling iron, your curls will be soft and bouncy.  If you have natural hair and use it to do 2 or 3 strand twists, it&#x27;s awesome.  It smells like suntan oil, which I love.  Get some.</li>
            <li> Really my hair seems indifferent to the stuff. I brought a bottle after seeing a YT video where a lady with 4a hair used this product to do a twist out. She had pretty good results, sorry I can&#x27;t say the same. This product did nothing to give my hair definition or much hold. The curl and style conditioning milk did little to nothing for the ends of my hair that behaved as if I hadn&#x27;t applied any of the product to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The smell is not good</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products. Very moisturizing and defining. The only reason I give it 4 starts is because I have found cheaper products that provide similar results. Overall, this product is awesome and will be repurchased.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly.....my daughter is on her third bottle!  We love how it smells (like coconuts) and it keeps her long curly hair in nice soft condition....</li>
            <li> I moved to a very dry state and have tried so many products. I love this one. i have type 3c curls, very porous. they do not weigh down my curl, but give them enough moisture and have brought back the shape of my curl. My hair went almost 100% flat from the dry weather. i love the smell too!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair milk for a couple years now, along with the entire Shea Moisture line. This is my favorite item. I use it to refresh my curls. I have natural hair and this is very refreshing for my curls. I like misting my dry hair with water before applying it or adding it after my wash. It works as a styler, moisturizer or leave-in. I also love using the [[ASIN:B0038TVH3Y Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie-12 oz]] which ties for first place with this hair milk. I would recommend this product for anyone seeking to add moisture and shine to their curly tresses.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing,  but small bottle.  Won&#x27;t last you a month. Works wonders for curly hair and feels really soft on hair.</li>
            <li> Product left my hair feeling soft and my curls show alot more since i started using this product.</li>
            <li> I now take this with me everywhere. I just rub a little on my hair and it instantly tames the frizz and smells amazing. Someone mentioned that they liked the \\&quot;smoothie\\&quot; version of this better so I went out &amp; bought that too. I have to say....I like THIS one better. It is light &amp; it works great as a leave in. The smoothie is good for deep conditioning though. I can&#x27;t live without this, I absolutely love it. I bought mine at Rite-Aid for seven bucks, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s so reasonable!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does provide great moisture for my granddaughter after her bath, but only for that night. In the morning, her hair is very dry and frizzy and I end up re-applying more and more each time before her next bath to keep her hair nice and moisturized with curls in tact. (otherwise her curls are frizzy and you can barely see them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does smell amazing though. It smells like a freshly baked cookie and its just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be reordering this product.</li>
            <li> I have terribly frizzy hair and have suffered with it all my life. This product is one I tried on a whim, mainly b/c I liked what the company was doing for women who needed help in Sierra Leone. Wash and condition your hair, squeeze out the extra water, and put about a half-palmful of this in--scrunch it all over, comb it in, scrunch again, and I bet you&#x27;ll see a major difference in your curls!! Please trust me on this one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past the smell of this product. Pungent like overripe fruit. Regardless of how well this product may work, I simply can not and will not give it a second chance.</li>
            <li> Loved this product for my curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products for my frizzy hair, expensive and inexpensive...none worked like this one I love it!!! highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> No longer do I have to leave the regular, rinse-out conditioner in my hair. The Conditioning Curl Milk does the trick (in terms of supporting my natural curl while it dries)! I plan to try one of Shea Moisture&#x27;s products that adds a bit more moisture to my hair, as well.</li>
            <li> Product stayed on top of my hair, weighed it down, and left it looking nappy. Won&#x27;t be buying ever again!</li>
            <li> This leave in made my hair soft and shiny, you can buy it at Target, cvs, rite aid or Sally for 10.00 or less, the price here is outrageous!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for curly hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s thick, curly, coarse hair.  He hates styling products, but after much prodding (and a look in the mirror) I finally got him to try it.  He uses about a nickel size dollop (his hair is below his shoulders) after using a primer (Smooth Criminal) which also helps a lot with frizz.  He has some gray on top and it&#x27;s really wiry and has a mind of its own and this styling product helps tame his wayward strands.  It&#x27;s tough to get a guy to use styling products, but this one is the perfect formula for him.  I discovered Shea Moisture products while looking for hair tips on the web.  There were great reviews on several sites.  I love the Manuka Honey formula the best (available only at Target), but also the Raw Shea Butter.  The masks are great and I&#x27;m really in love with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo with apple cider vinegar.  It removes all traces of gooey styling products and hairspray and it smells really clean and fresh.  My Caucasian hair is color treated and SM&#x27;s sulfate free shampoos leave my hair soft, supple and really shiny.  The conditioners have a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so detangling is easy.  The Manuka Honey formula smells like wildflower honey and really moisturizes.  I have a styling routine and products I use that I&#x27;m loving right now, so I personally haven&#x27;t tried SM&#x27;s styling line, but if my husbands results (no frizz or flyaways) are an indicator of their effectiveness, I may just try them out.  Based on his now smooth and shiny hair, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hair red coarse curly hair, medium brown wavy,  light brown (not sure) and thin straight blonde hair.  Constantly thirsty hair.  I can soak my hair with this and it smells great..  Makes my curls bouncy and soft and not heavy.  Brings all my hairs together.  Coming from the human cotton ball, that&#x27;s a plus.  Although you can get this in a local pharmacy, compare pricing.</li>
            <li> I found out about this on youtube natural hair community, and I love the smell and texture of this products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use hair product, but wanted to try something to give my curls some oomph.  This product works well, and is much less &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; than other brands, but it is still a bit hard to the touch.  I would recommend since it is cheap, and works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this product works well to separate the curls and keep the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> My hair turns into new hair whenever I apply this wonderfully creamy, moisturizing and penetrating milk.  It leaves my hair manageable, soft and silky, and beautifully curly with lots of shine.  If I pull my hair back, I use this, along with the Shea Moisture flax seed gel, creating big waves in my hair.  Often times, after I wash and condition, I simply apply this, allow to air dry, while scrunching to ensure big hair.  That&#x27;s it.  It&#x27;s much lighter than the curl enhancing smoothie (which I love as well for my twist outs); but for my wash and gos, this is my product of choice.  Ooh, and it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I was wondering what all the hype was about for this brand so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt; It smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Left my curls soft and moisturized but if you are looking for something to hold your curls this is not gel. It is more like a really watered down lotion for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used/are using alot of Shea Moisture products because they seem to work on my hair. If you are into types, I have a 4B/4C type hair, porous, thick and snags easily. I use this curl and style cream as a moisturizer during the day as well as at night before wrapping my hair up. As one reviewer mentioned, its not a perfect hair  moisturizer. I find myself also using vegetable glycerine and aloe vera gel for added moisture especially during the winter. But I would definitely recommend this curl and style cream along with other Shea Moisture shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisture for my hair when it needs one.  It is very light and a little goes a very long way.  I loves the bundle package as I feel it will last me about a year to finish them both or a little over that.  Wish that this came in a larger container.  This is one of my staple product as a natural and it is good for all hair types and textures.  Will definitely purchase again.  My hair loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> This entire line is awesome for my hair. I have been natural for over a year and it works amazingly. I usually get it on sale at Walgreens or Sally&#x27;s. If the prices were lower on this site I would buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> I really like the Shea Moisture brand, I use the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus shampoo regularly, and was hoping to find a matching conditioner/moisturizer that worked as well. Not yet. I just got the &amp;#34;smoothie&amp;#34; from this line, and it has given better styling results than this style milk.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product at Walgreen&#x27;s for 9.99.  A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s a great bargain, especially for a natural product.  In the store, they had the Shea Moisture hair products in with the African-American haircare items, which I think was a mistake.  It may be intended for women of color but it&#x27;s great for curly or wavy hair of all races--I&#x27;m white and I like to use a styling cream on my loose curls to keep them from looking like a frizzy 70&#x27;s &#x27;do.  I have skin sensitivities and this is the only styling cream I can use without suffering a break out.  Plus it smells delicious.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Works Awesome on my 4c Hair</li>
            <li> My lady loves this product, feels great on her hair</li>
            <li> Only used once. Seems nice so far. Not much to say  yet. My hair feels great.</li>
            <li> I have thick kinky hair. I used this product because I do&#x27;t like to put harsh chemicals into my body. There&#x27;s not parabens, mineral oil and harsh thingd in it. The down fall to this item for me personally is that i have dry thick hair. After a few hours of putting this in my hair is back dry.</li>
            <li> The coconut smell is unbearable!!</li>
            <li> great products for natural hair</li>
            <li> Left my hair very dry, did not moisturize a thing. And its the worst thing to use for a wash n go. I have 3c4a thick and curly natural hair. Even the coconut fragrance couldn&#x27;t make me love this.</li>
            <li> works beautifully on wavy hair, eases tangles and smells great - works on anyone - love it - I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products this is the best!</li>
            <li> I have natural type 4 hair and I like to use this curl and style milk as a leave in after I wash and condition my hair once a week. It&#x27;s light and smells great, and has protein in it, which is good for strengthening the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use it daily as I think it would lead to product build up. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it as a leave in though.</li>
            <li> smells great. feels great. it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. no petroleum. but I don&#x27;t know how much it actually helps my hair. I have bought several from this line of product and I would say that I like this item the best. it makes my hair feel manageable at least for the moment but not long-lasting effects.</li>
            <li> Why in the world is this product $20? Target is selling the same for $7.99 right now and the regular price is $9.99, you could get 2 for the price of one.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  My daughter is 1/4 CC, 1/4 Hispanic, &amp; 1/2 Moroccan.  I have probably spent upwards of $1000 in the past two years trying to find a product that 1) lets me work the knots out of her awesomely curly hair; 2) smells good without being over-powering; 3) doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on her clothes or carseat; 4) doesn&#x27;t leave her hair feeling crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Target ran out of it last week, and I have been using Mixed Chicks, Kinky Kurly, and some Moroccan oil.  All of which are far inferior in one way or another to SM&#x27;s conditioning milk.  So I came here and nearly fell over from sticker shock.  Amazon is out of their mind charging what they do!  I will have to wait out Target&#x27;s next shipment, because Amazon is charging highway robbery.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that yes, this is cheaper at Target or Walgreen&#x27;s than on Amazon.  Much cheaper, and often on sale (online) as well.  That doesn&#x27;t, however, warrant giving the product a one-star review here, so the overall rating for this product is somewhat deceptive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the Conditioning Milk is amazing.  I have long (currently hip length) 2c/3b hair. I have a hard time finding products that work well consistently, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a really moisturizing line for some time.  SheaMoisture is IT.  I actually don&#x27;t use the milk as a leave-in, but apply it after shampoo or CO, leave for a few minutes, and then rinse lightly.  I use the Deep Treatment Masque as a leave-in afterward.  My ends have improved 100% using this line--no more dryness, and I&#x27;m beginning to see a reduction in splits and damage as well.  I can&#x27;t recommend SheaMoisture products highly enough!</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with very think, very long (two feet),  mildly curly hair/ spirally and wavy hair.  So ya, with hair that is even difficult for a cosmetologist I would say I am pretty picky when comes to hair products.&lt;br /&gt; I must say that my hair has never felt and looked so healthy since using this.  I am most impressed with there shampoo!  You MUST get it along with the conditioner!!  Usually shampoos leave my hair feeling like rubber so I use a conditioner afterwards to detangle BUT their shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft like a conditioner!  I didn&#x27;t know such a perfect hair product could exist.  I&#x27;m in love!!  The smell is AMAZINGGG!  It is the best fragrance I have ever smelled in a conditioner and shampoo, which is a surprise considering it&#x27;s all natural!  The ingredients are amazing too.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I like how its smell. it helps form my curls with soft touch.</li>
            <li> THis product is usually under $10- it is a great product at that price but it just went up to $17?!  I hope this is a glitch.. either way, I&#x27;m removing it from my wish list.  I do not \\&quot;wish\\&quot; to be ripped off.</li>
            <li> Everyone  has said almost every good thing I could say about this product. The only thing I really want to say is that you can also buy it at Walgreen&#x27;s.  I saw quite a few items from this product line there today. Also try the skin soaps.  They are awesome.</li>
            <li> Since going \\&quot;green\\&quot;,I have been looking for an organic gel or hair lotion that does not contain harsh chemicals or parabens that would do my curls justice! I have been let down so many times with organic gels so I was hesitant when I bought this. I can honestly say that I think I&#x27;m done searching! Not only does it smell good but it works good too! Actually I love this stuff! Makes my hair soft and shiny and healthy. Like others have said a little goes a long way. My hair is thin and curly so I really don&#x27;t have to use a lot to begin with. If I want the \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; bouncy look I just rub a little in between my palms and finger through my hair and dry on low then a blast of cool to seal the cuticle(less frizz).If I want a more wet defined look I use this then I rub IC hair polisher styling gel then dry on low. My only advice would be just be careful not to use too much at first or it might get a little too greasy, start with a small amount then add more to achieve the look you want. Overall I definitely think it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> keeps my hair controlled and i literally have like no frizz what so ever when i use this one my hair. Love it</li>
            <li> This product did not work on my hair. I am bi racial (1/2 white 1/2 black). It made my hair frizzier than it already is. I was using Samy&#x27;s leave in conditioning serum before (worked wonders on my hair) but unfortunatly it has been discontinued (I am very sad about that). I did not buy this product from Amazon but from Target (as it was on sale). Needless to say I was very disappointed. I have caved in and just reordered Mixed Chicks leave in (love the product just don&#x27;t love the price) Smells great though...might just use it as a body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also want to add that this dried out my hair making it feel almost like a brillo pad.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I started using the smoothie originally which I also fell in love with but then I tried this because it seemed a little lighter. When I did I had to go back and buy 3 more bottles for myself and 2 extra to try for my daughter who has 3c hair type. (I&#x27;m 3c 4a by the way)When I tried it for her, it worked so well , it is now her favorite! I use it right after a wash when the hair is damp. Twist it and air dry.It is lighter than the smoothie but is heavy enough to keep the hair moisturized . It also smells delicious like berries! You know what..... just talking about it makes me want to go buy more! LOL</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a grocery store.  I have heard many good things about She Moisture products but the price really has kept me from purchasing any of them.  They are fairly expensive. Still I decided to give one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells good.  You&#x27;re supposed to use it on damp hair.  Well after three days of using it, I have noticed  with more and more alarm that my hair has a white waxy build-up.  This morning was especially bad.  I was running late for work and to look at my hair and realize it had a white film all over was really annoying. I will not use this product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just out of curiosity - how is it this company has been around since 1912 and I don&#x27;t know anyone who has heard of them before, say 2005?  I have to wash my hair tonight and get the rest of this stuff out.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I will submit a picture later.</li>
            <li> I have 4 A natural hair.  I have used this  once on a bad hair day, I have applied it at night  on dry hair and twisted it before wrapping my head. I love the way it moisturized my hair, it was light , penetrated well, wasn&#x27;t feeling to oily. The next morning, I took the twists out and my hair was feeling and looking great, soft, volume, no frizz, beautifully formed curls, shiny,  to the ends, and I had a very good hair day!. :). I love the smell, which is not too overbearing. Two days after, my hair still feels softer with no frizz, my protective bun looks really good and shiny. I think think is a keeper for me!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it is hard to find good product that does not leave your hair oily or flaky. I love this product and all of the Curl products of this company.</li>
            <li> This product is very good but do your homework is only $9.99 at Target. is so sad how people will rip you of if you dont do your resurge.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say more than it&#x27;s amazing and its what I was looking for ,,,, thanks a lot for item ,</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair. Leaves the hair soft but it will dry out over the course of the day because it&#x27;s water based. I spritz my hair with aloe juice and water mix to seal in moisture, then mix this product with a lil shea butter and homemade essential oil mix.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair moist without making it oily. I love this!</li>
            <li> Be careful with this brand, even though they state they are natural and contains no glycols. This product does contain glycols which, they try to hide in the ingredient list by listing it with natural components. Please look carefully at the ingredients and make sure you are not spending more money for this product which doesn&#x27;t contain all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my thick, wavy, humidity-loving hair as a  leave-in for about a month now.  I love how it hydrates &amp; weighs my hair down just enough that the frizz can&#x27;t get a good foothold--my hair is still thick &amp; wavy, but it behaves well too!&lt;br /&gt;The Texas summer is about to begin, so we&#x27;ll see how Shea Moisture does against wicked Gulf moisture...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And also in with the girls who buy this at Target--heck, now that I know it&#x27;s crazy expensive online, I&#x27;m stocking up from Target!!)</li>
            <li> I like everything about this product; it smells great and the texture leaves my hair feelings soft, smooth, and silky.  Of all the Shea Moisture products I have tried, this one is by far my favorite and the most effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 2b with some 2c sections with bra-strap length hair, and can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this product. I co-wash with Suave Naturals, use a heavier rinse-out conditioner, and then use the SM Curl Milk as a leave-in while my hair is soaking wet after I&#x27;ve turned off the shower. I use about a half-palmful everywhere but my roots and then scrunch the water out of my hair with my hands. When my hair is no longer dripping, I add a small amount of a curl styling gel to my roots and the upper part of my hair (the bottom part curls just fine without the extra hold). Once I&#x27;ve done that, I scrunch my hair further with a microfiber towel and then either plop it and air-dry or use my diffuser.  My hair has been in excellent condition since I started this routine, looks great and smells even better. Hope this helps out other wavy-to-curlies!</li>
            <li> better deals at walgreens</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo111XN4ZR7JMM7]]Shea Moisture Curl and Style Milk is great for refreshing dry hair. It is affordable and easily accessible. Please watch the video review for specifics of the product and more of my experience with it.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy and curly and DRY. I use this stuff after every shower. I use about the size of a nickel and first pull through my ends like in a pony tail and concentrate on lathering it on the ends. I take what&#x27;s left over and run through my scalp to my ends then brush with my wood hair brush. My hair never grows!! Ever since I started using this I have noticed a substantial difference in the health of my hair.. For the better! I&#x27;m surprised. I like this more than the expensive Moroccan oil I used to use. I use this even before I blow my hair out straight. BUY AT WALGREENS!! They have BOGO sales all the time on their products!  I also use the shampoo, conditioner and the shine spray. I will continue to buy their products!</li>
            <li> My review of this product is below, but first I&#x27;ll include the correct ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deionized Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Sugar Starch, Silk Protein, Essential Oil Blend, Melia Azadirachta (Neem) Seed Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitol Esters, Algae Extract, Hyssopus Officinalis Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf and Equisetum Arvense Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Hibiscus Flower Extract&lt;br /&gt;*Certified Organic Ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Product Review***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have African American (4a) hair that I usually wear in a braid out, meaning that I braid it into 10 braids at night and unbraid them in the morning.  In the past I used Kids Organics Shea Butter lotion while braiding for moisture and hold.  I was happy with that product, but hated the ingredient list and grew tired of the smell.  This was the perfect upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- I am amazed at the ingredient list.  No crazy chemicals.  You can actually identify every product.  It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;- I love the smell.  This is a natural product, so it smells like the ingredients--especially coconut.  I honestly don&#x27;t know why anyone would buy a product with \\&quot;Coconut\\&quot; in the description if they don&#x27;t like the smell of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;- This is a rich product, so a little goes a long way--even on my very thick and fairly long hair.&lt;br /&gt;- I find it impossible to believe that this product dried someone&#x27;s hair out.  This is practically the perfect balance of ingredients to moisturize even extremely dry hair.  Water is the first ingredient, and the oils and butters seal the moisture in.&lt;br /&gt;- In addition to moisture, my braid outs are more defined.  However, I deducted one star because it is more effective as a moisturizer than a \\&quot;style\\&quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- The first time I used the style milk I applied too much and my hair was weighed down.  I like to wear big, curly styles, so this was not good.  My boyfriend commented that my hair looked \\&quot;stringy\\&quot;.  I skipped a day of moisturizing and my hair came back to life.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not the cheapest product (about 3-4 times more expensive than the Organics Kids), but I do think it&#x27;s worth the costeighed down.

            <li> I have type 2b/2c hair (I think).  I&#x27;m never quite sure which it&#x27;s going to be from day to day.  I had been using the Curly Girl method of washing my hair for several years but couldn&#x27;t get just a ton of curl.  I saw this brand and decided to try it even though it&#x27;s not necessarily marketed for a white girl.  I do really like this brand.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have bad ingredients in it (that had SEVERELY limited the products I had tried) and I love the tropical smell.  I put this on after finger combing my wet hair in the shower.  I don&#x27;t use a lot and it does nicely moisturize my hair.  I also use Shea Moisture&#x27;s Souffle and a TINY amount of gel to get my best curls.  My aunt thought I had a perm. :)  My curls tend to go limp if I use much hair gel.  For second and third day hair I put a small amount of this in my hands, rub together and then add a bit of water and scrunch through my hair.  It&#x27;s been working pretty well.  I don&#x27;t know that these are my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; products, but I&#x27;ve got the best curls I&#x27;ve ever had.  For me, that says a lot considering I went through most of my life thinking I just had really poofy hair.  UPDATE 8/4/2016:  As much as I loved this product, my hair started getting really stiff and greasy especially in the back.  It seemed like nothing I did could get it to go away.  I finally quit using this and switched to Shea Moisture&#x27;s apple cider vinegar shampoo and it worked wonders!  No more greasy stiff hair.  I shampoo with it, use an organic conditioner and then follow with Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle and have amazing curls.  I believe my hair doesn&#x27;t do well with the protein.  I love this line of products and think that there&#x27;s something in it that will work for just about everyone.  You just have to keep searching. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the rest of Shea Moisture product line.. It keeps my hair very soft. Love the smell too.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I tend to use the style milk when I am doing my bantu knots after a good wash. I cover each section thoroughly, roll them up and in the morning my hair has so much bounce to it that it&#x27;s crazy! Just a head&#x27;s up, you can buy all of the Shea Moisture products at your local Target for 10 dollars each. Surprised? So was I! but Shea Moisture has made my journey towards having fully natural hair a pretty dang easy one.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one having this problem with this product?  I see that others have said that it dries their hair out.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that, but I also use another product along with it.  I really, really wanted to like this product, but I just started using this recently and I&#x27;m having a problem with my curls \\&quot;drooping\\&quot; after a few hours.  My hair is a little long (around MBL), but I haven&#x27;t had this problem before.  It drives me crazy, because at first my curls look great and they&#x27;re bouncing all over the place.  Problem is, it just doesn&#x27;t last.  Does anyone know of a product that will moisturize and hold curl?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am type 3b and 3c.</li>
            <li> I am one of those bewho really want the best from a product especially when there is a lot of hype around a brand. There is a lot of hype around the benefits of SM but for me I am not getting it to my standards. I know a lot of naturals like to moisturize their hair 2x daily but my very busy lifestyle I prefer to do it once however I can&#x27;t ignore my hair dryness around 7 hrs later so I usually moisturize twice anyway. I ve use several Shea moisture leave in conditioners and in the beginning the products seems great but after a while. My hair must be coping because the results start to fade or are unnoticeable. Iastly, I don&#x27;t have a lot of money but really wanted a mostly natural product, I am disappointed because I ve been searching for similar all natural products but they are more money. My goal of BSL may have to wait until make more $$$$. I didn&#x27;t buy from amazon.</li>
            <li> This styling milk has such a wonderful smell. You don&#x27;t need much to get a great lift.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at CVS during their BOGO sale and was instantly impressed.  Upon application it was very moisturizing and it instantly started to detangle my 4B hair which was a curly, dry mess at the time. I used it to retwist my hair into two strand twists and the next day it was SOOOOO soft to the touch.  And it smelled nice too.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for easy detangling and abundant moisture.  And a little does go a long way!  When comparing this to the Shea Moisture Souffle, this was a lot more moisturizing as well.</li>
            <li> Ever since I saw this at target I wanted to get it so when I saw it at CVS I purchased it for $10. I wanted something that was as chemical free as possible that would tame my friz &amp; static &amp; keep my hair moisturized. The first time I used this product I was so pleased because, for me, it seemed to amplify my curls. My hair is naturally wavy &amp; lower back length. I washed &amp; conditioned my hair before I went to bed (shampoo &amp; conditioner was Shea Moisture for damaged hair), towel dried &amp; then put a little more than dime-sized amount through out my hair. I then tied it up in a loose messy bun &amp; slept on it all night. I had no static, no fly away hairs... in fact, my hair looked really healthy (not greasy) when I took it down &amp; it was loaded with curls. I was able to comb my fingers through it too, which I am not normally able to do do to static &amp; easily tangled hair. I&#x27;m going to try using this for pin curls to help hold and define the curl. I think it will work, at least on my hair. We&#x27;ll see. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars from me because it exceeded my expectations AND especially because it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of mainstream nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast its unbelievable. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This product is my absolute favorite. I am biracial and my children unfortunately inherited my dry hair as well. This product is worth every penny because I use it in all of our hair. It is much cheaper at Target, but sometimes my target is slow in restocking and it good to know I can overnight with my Amazon prime in a pinch. This product has organic ingredients, a lovely,light smell, and the curl and style milk lasts for quite awhile even with all three of us using it. And if we apply to wet hair, my childrens curls dry so beautifully, without the crunch of some other curl products. We also use the conditioning wash from this line and together with the milk, our hair is in great shape!</li>
            <li> Always love this product work great for my hair being natual.</li>
            <li> i use it with john freida dream curls line for curly hair and it create the perfect curls with a difuser</li>
            <li> This totally dried out my hair and I have no idea as to why. I have tried it numerous times because I am pleased with this product line, however this is not good for me. The milk product seemed to suck out the moisture in my hair and I had to put oil and other hair lotions to soften it up. Sad but I will probably throw this out and waste my 9 dollars! Can someone have samples so that if it does not work for a particular hair pattern we dont feel like a loser for throwing it away???</li>
            <li> Excellent condition! It came very fast and it didn&#x27;t leak or anything. It leaves your hair smelling like the product for a very long time. I have very thick hair and I&#x27;m surprised that I still have not run out.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product during the time I was transitioning, it is God-send.  I had used a very popular, high end, black hair product to wash/condish my hair and it stripped away ALL my hair and scalp oils.  Needless to say I was left with wet, matted, tangled, squeaky clean hair (a 4C nightmare).  I was distraught and scared to death.  About to give up (big chop eminent), I saw this product at my local store.  I had never heard of it before.  The claims (&amp;#34;detangles…conditions…restoring body and shine&amp;#34;) made sense to my immediate situation.  Now, I use this as my go-to for detangling (mix some in water spray bottle) and as a leave-in conditioner.  My favorite application is to use straight as a moisturizer before twisting or braiding at night.  It has a sweet, tropical scent. Just wish it came in a LARGER bottle. Thank you SO MUCH Shea Moisture.  From a scientist/engineer, your laboratory team is spot on with the chemistry of this product!</li>
            <li> I used this in  a variety of ways and love it with each use. I think the trick with all products especially SheaMoisture is knowing and understanding your hair and hair needs. This is a lightweight product, which is recommended for 4a hair types. There is low levels of protein, not enough to cause issues with your hair. So I have    1. used this in the summer time without gel for twist outs. I had defined lovely twists. The style did not last long so I started using gel and then the style would last for at least 2-3 days  2. chunky twists with gel. My twists looked good for an entire week. My hair was slightly dry, but that&#x27;s because I did not refresh my hair each night.  3. LCO, this was the Cream in my LCO method and I loved it because it made my hair soft and moisturized immediately.  4. in wash and gos. My wash and goes were popping with this product.  5. spray bottle with the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Mist. I added more water to the mixture and the results is less sticky.    It was love at first coil. When I first purchased this product, I was unsure of it&#x27;s claims. So I plopped a dab on my pinkie and applied it to one of the naps on the nape of my neck. The nap coiled instantly. I knew then that this product would be awesome. The only reason I decided to cut back is because I needed to use a lot for my dense hair and I would go through a bottle in 10 days to use it the way I wanted to. Therefore, I cut back and bought the Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Now I use this product sparingly, to refresh styles, etc. Still love it.</li>
            <li> Works well with the milk conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not for European curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love coconut smell and works for my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells good feels good and love how ir makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> I am really picky when it comes to hair products but I love this stuff. My hair is not very heavy and greasy after I use it and it&#x27;s great for twists.</li>
            <li> Love it and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Just enough to tame the frizzies and leave nice looking, natural, not hard or crispy curls.  It is super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I have type 3A curls and this cream makes my curls soft and springy and it smells great. A little goes a long way with my hair type so a bottle lasts me for almost 3 months- and good ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 4c natural, my hair was very dry (like a brillo pad ) on my sides and back of head. Shea Moisture to the rescue it hydrated my hair, left my hair very moist not greasy and so soft,I will cotinue with the Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus  line,i&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product while I was transitioning into natural hair, and didn&#x27;t know what I had so I poured it out, but I have since then have repurchased it from Target, and I like it very much, Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will definitely get more</li>
            <li> I have 3b hair and this product made a mess of my hair. It looked dry but then felt greasy. I&#x27;d never use this product again ! Don&#x27;t listen to the hype !!!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. After I bought it, I was surprised my local Walgreens carried so many of their products. At one point these products made up a good portion of their ethnic hair section at Walgreens. Still has a few more additives than I would prefer.</li>
            <li> This product does a nice job of defining curls however it is greasy greasy greasy.  I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, I mean if you look at the ingredients it&#x27;s mostly oil but my goodness so limp and greasy that even with great curl definition it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT STYLING PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Hair type: 4c (natural)    Hair density: thin-med.    Hair diameter: fine      I love this stuff. I typically use it on top of the Curling Gel souffle. It leaves my hair soft when applied on wet hair. My results on dry hair are only so so. The consistency is like lotion and the fragrance is sweet (coconut of course). The wonderful thing that happens is when it dries the fragrance changes to me. It seems to become this vanilla/coconut potpourri fragrance that is truly beautiful. To me it smells quite different when it is wet. After it has dried I find myself thinking, \\&quot;What is that wonderful fragrance, oh, but of course, IT&#x27;S MY FRO!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walgreens for 11 bucks,please save your money and time and by it from Walgreens. The product itself.. the whole line does what it says. Left my daughters hair moist, easy to comb and smelling fantastic! We used this with the Shea shampoo. I am a beleiver.. This stuff is the truth</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl &amp; Style Milk is my go-to product for a soft, wavy, shiny twist or braid out.  When I rebraid my hair each night, I rub a small amount of the product into each section.  I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  Everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently to products, so this product is worth a try.  I tried Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie and it left my hair dull and shunken.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day, and my hair is SO healthy. Not only does it make your hair look better in the short term, it actually moisturizes it too (instead of drying it out). It smells so nice, and I feel safe using it every day because I can actually pronounce all the ingredients in it. I have 2c/3a curls, and it definitely helps keep my frizz in check and smooth over a bad hair day. I also put my hair in a braid at night, and cover my hair in it, focusing on the ends. When I wake up, instead of having greasy hair, I have soft, manageable, and even BRUSHABLE hair. Definitely my best find since I gave up the straightener.</li>
            <li> I recently went natural and got the big chop a few months ago.  I wanted to try a different line of products, one that specifically had coconut oil as the main ingredient.  I have to say that this hair milk smells wonderful and it&#x27;s very light.  However, after I rub it in and dry my hair, it feels a bit crisp and very brittle. I&#x27;ve tried putting a small amount and a large amount in my hair and I get the same dull results.  Even when I let my hair dry naturally or use low heat, it still feels dry.  Maybe it&#x27;s my hair type, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
            <li> creams are generally too heavy for my hair.  i have a lot of strands of semi-curley hair but the strands themselves are thin, so creams can be too heavy and gels can take the body out.  i also have hair that is totally fuzzy (not quite frizzy, just dull fuzzy) without any product.  so finding the happy medium for encouraging curls, discouraging fuzz, giving body, and not weighing it down is quite a challenge... this product does it.  and it&#x27;s all natural - total bonus.  if i&#x27;ve described your hair - this product is definitely for you.</li>
