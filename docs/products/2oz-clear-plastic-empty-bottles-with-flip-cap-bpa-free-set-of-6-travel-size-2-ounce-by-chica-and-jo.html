            <li>I keep mine in my purse or bathroom cabinet (away from bright light).  </li>
            <li>bought them for hot sauce, as I can never find my favored brand when travelling, and they are rated by the FDA for food product</li>
            <li>They came quickly and are of good quality</li>
            <li>Ok, I don&#x27;t know about BPAs or whatnot with these, but they don&#x27;t leak.</li>

            <li>Quality is OK.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work OK for non-oil type liquids.</li>
            <li>Flip top bottle for traveling, as pictured.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a bit more sturdy; this product is comparable to something you might buy in Target or a dollar store.</li>
            <li>Love these for my needs.</li>
            <li>I have been sealing the top with duct-tape just in case</li>
            <li>A tip, don&#x27;t fill your liquids to the top and line them with plastic wrap to prevent airplane pressure spillage.</li>
            <li>Just as described and when tested with water they did not leak :)</li>
            <li>and the flip top, was a greeeeeat idea</li>
            <li>Perfect for taking smaller amounts with you camping!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and a good buy</li>
            <li>These are okay, but I&#x27;m not convinced that they would be leak-proof.  </li>
            <li>I expect I will be able to travel with it.</li>
            <li>Leak proof with screw+flip top dispensing combo</li>
            <li>They allow you to travel with all your liquids and be able to carry on....</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for storing essential oils.</li>
            <li>&amp; I would buy more.</li>
            <li>Would recommend these for many uses.</li>
            <li>perfect size to carry enough stuff for a weeks trip if needed.</li>
            <li>Perfect... Just what I wanted/needed for transporting my toiletries on a recent 7-day cruise trip.</li>
            <li>exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.</li>
            <li>I use dry wipes and water to change my sons diaper and this is perfect for carrying around the water I need.</li>
            <li>Added labeling to easily grab mine vs. my boyfriends :-)</li>
            <li>Great size and no leaks so far.</li>
            <li>OK for the price, nice size, and will be very pleased if they hold up for multiple trips.</li>
            <li>They are easy to fill and the lids stay close and</li>
            <li>easy to dispense</li>
            <li>They may be fine for home DIY projects or whatever, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust them in an airplane.</li>
            <li>The others seem fine -</li>
            <li>Bought these for travel and for everyday home use and they are the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leak and fit in my travel kits.</li>
            <li>They feel a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>They fit in with TSA regulations and don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>Held when filled with liquid and put inside our suitcase.</li>
            <li>The lids go on securely so there is no leaks,</li>
            <li>- Bring these great bottles back.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and fill</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>These have been good for everything I&#x27;ve put in them so far.</li>
            <li>They might not be eye catching, but they are the Costco of travel friendly bottles - not fancy, but I dare you to not like them (to quote Cam from Modern Family).</li>
            <li>the tubes were very useful for travel because they are allowed on airplanes.</li>
            <li>I wish the caps closed a bit tighter - but overall a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Best small bottles ever used - WHY?</li>
            <li>I do oil cleansing and these small containers are perfect for mixing your oils.</li>
            <li>Great little bottles for most bathroom liquids needed for air travel.</li>
            <li>yet my daughter is able to open and close these on her own.</li>
            <li>They do not keep clean at the opening</li>
            <li>Nice clear bottles let you see what you put inside.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>In this day and age of airport security and liquid restrictions, this is incredibly useful and very worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them for sleepovers and car trips, but make sure they&#x27;re packed in a plastic bag if you&#x27;re taking them on an airplane.</li>
            <li>The bottles have just the right flexibility for dispensing whatever you put in them and are the perfect size, at least for me.</li>
            <li>Purchased these for my essential oil blends and love them!</li>
            <li>These are great little containers.</li>
            <li>These are useful to make travel size for any of our toiletry items.</li>
            <li>Convenient wide opening for loading your products and good squeeze function.</li>
            <li>sturdy, durable, practical, useful</li>
            <li>Very nice little bottles for shampoo, conditioner, or whatever.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>just right for use in the State Esthetician Boards exam kit</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>The perfect amount of squeeze without being too stiff and very durable so far!</li>
            <li>I do wish the tops were made a bit more solid and of higher quality.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what I needed .  </li>
            <li>I simply use a Sharpy to write on the cap top what the container contains.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described and just what I needed for my vacation.</li>
            <li>These are good for keeping extra paint for me when I mix colors and don&#x27;t use the entire amount.  </li>
            <li>These little bottles are exactly what I needed to mix up my own soap and lotion.</li>
            <li>These worked well for me on a recent trip, and made contending with liquids easy during the TSA&#x27;s screening process.</li>
            <li>Not even oils or really liquid stuff.</li>
            <li>I am a flight attendant</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect these bottles to be very durable.</li>
            <li>I filled each one with different liquids:  </li>
            <li>(I took the advice of another reviewer and filled it only part-way, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>No leaks, no breakage.  Very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent way more time and money than I should looking for bottles that are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fit easily into a small Ziploc bag</li>
            <li>Works great for my paints - small sizes and tight lids provide very useful item in the shop</li>
            <li>What more can I say other than they are bottles with lids that close.</li>
            <li>The bottles would work well if the liquid is very viscous, but if it&#x27;s lotiony and has the consistency of hair conditioners, good luck at getting the 2nd half of the content out of the bottle...</li>
            <li>As others have said, these are great because they are not too hard to squeeze, although you can&#x27;t really can&#x27;t get the last bits out.  </li>
            <li>Large enough to hold a week+ worth of face wash, lotion etc.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I am able to squeeze the bottle just slightly to sprinkle out the spices or pour the oil.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s last too many trips, but definitely a couple.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love these little bottles!</li>
            <li>These are much like empty craft paint bottles with the right amount of give in the sides so that the bottles can be squeezed.</li>
            <li>frequent traveler - use these all the time!</li>
            <li>Because I like to put my lunches together at work rather than at home both to preserve freshness and because I&#x27;m lazy in the morning, I bought these little travel bottles for condiments/sauces/dressings and they work GREAT.</li>
            <li>These are perfect size for all her paints, not too big for little hands, and not too small and hold enough paint.</li>
            <li>These have wide mouths and are easy to refill before I take my next trip.  </li>
            <li>I do use pure essential oils in them.  </li>
            <li>On a recent trip they were fine until I flew back from Denver the last three leaked, I&#x27;ll try what one of the reviews did and tape the caps and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clear</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had no problems so far.</li>
            <li>The caps are on the flimsy side but so far the hinges have remained intact.</li>
            <li>l filled a few as soon as I received them.</li>
            <li>All bottles seem very sturdy and yet flexible enough to be squeezed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and hate checking in luggage when you travel, these bottles are perfect for portioning your toiletries to meet TSA requirements.  </li>
            <li>4 of the 6 bottles were great, the other 2 were broken.</li>
            <li>The tops seem like they seal tight and the bottles are squishy enough to make it easy to get that shampoo out when you&#x27;re in a hotel shower on a business trip.</li>
            <li>Useful little bottles for traveling with carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that some things that are more viscous are tough to get completely out (like facewash).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much about this product other than they look and work as they should.</li>
            <li>First trip, dropped a bottle in the shower and the little piece inside the cap broke off so the bottle will no longer seal.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the bottles leaking, though due to some previous reviewers&#x27; issues with the lids&#x27; hinges being too brittle and cracking easily, I did tape mine closed for added security.</li>

            <li> Works perfectly for storing essential oils.</li>
            <li> &amp; I would buy more.</li>
            <li> Would recommend these for many uses.</li>
            <li> perfect size to carry enough stuff for a weeks trip if needed.</li>
            <li> Perfect... Just what I wanted/needed for transporting my toiletries on a recent 7-day cruise trip.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I use dry wipes and water to change my sons diaper and this is perfect for carrying around the water I need.</li>
            <li> Added labeling to easily grab mine vs. my boyfriends :-)</li>
            <li> Great size and no leaks so far.</li>
            <li> OK for the price, nice size, and will be very pleased if they hold up for multiple trips.</li>
            <li> They are easy to fill and the lids stay close and</li>
            <li> easy to dispense</li>
            <li> They may be fine for home DIY projects or whatever, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust them in an airplane.</li>
            <li> The others seem fine -</li>
            <li> Bought these for travel and for everyday home use and they are the perfect size.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leak and fit in my travel kits.</li>
            <li> They feel a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> They fit in with TSA regulations and don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> Held when filled with liquid and put inside our suitcase.</li>
            <li> The lids go on securely so there is no leaks,</li>
            <li> - Bring these great bottles back.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and fill</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> These have been good for everything I&#x27;ve put in them so far.</li>
            <li> They might not be eye catching, but they are the Costco of travel friendly bottles - not fancy, but I dare you to not like them (to quote Cam from Modern Family).</li>
            <li> the tubes were very useful for travel because they are allowed on airplanes.</li>
            <li> I wish the caps closed a bit tighter - but overall a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Best small bottles ever used - WHY?</li>
            <li> I do oil cleansing and these small containers are perfect for mixing your oils.</li>
            <li> Great little bottles for most bathroom liquids needed for air travel.</li>
            <li> yet my daughter is able to open and close these on her own.</li>
            <li> They do not keep clean at the opening</li>
            <li> Nice clear bottles let you see what you put inside.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> In this day and age of airport security and liquid restrictions, this is incredibly useful and very worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them for sleepovers and car trips, but make sure they&#x27;re packed in a plastic bag if you&#x27;re taking them on an airplane.</li>
            <li> The bottles have just the right flexibility for dispensing whatever you put in them and are the perfect size, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my essential oil blends and love them!</li>
            <li> These are great little containers.</li>
            <li> These are useful to make travel size for any of our toiletry items.</li>
            <li> Convenient wide opening for loading your products and good squeeze function.</li>
            <li> sturdy, durable, practical, useful</li>
            <li> Very nice little bottles for shampoo, conditioner, or whatever.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> just right for use in the State Esthetician Boards exam kit</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> The perfect amount of squeeze without being too stiff and very durable so far!</li>
            <li> I do wish the tops were made a bit more solid and of higher quality.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what I needed .  </li>
            <li> I simply use a Sharpy to write on the cap top what the container contains.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described and just what I needed for my vacation.</li>
            <li> These are good for keeping extra paint for me when I mix colors and don&#x27;t use the entire amount.  </li>
            <li> These little bottles are exactly what I needed to mix up my own soap and lotion.</li>
            <li> These worked well for me on a recent trip, and made contending with liquids easy during the TSA&#x27;s screening process.</li>
            <li> Not even oils or really liquid stuff.</li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect these bottles to be very durable.</li>
            <li> I filled each one with different liquids:  </li>
            <li> (I took the advice of another reviewer and filled it only part-way, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> No leaks, no breakage.  Very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent way more time and money than I should looking for bottles that are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit easily into a small Ziploc bag</li>
            <li> Works great for my paints - small sizes and tight lids provide very useful item in the shop</li>
            <li> What more can I say other than they are bottles with lids that close.</li>
            <li> The bottles would work well if the liquid is very viscous, but if it&#x27;s lotiony and has the consistency of hair conditioners, good luck at getting the 2nd half of the content out of the bottle...</li>
            <li> As others have said, these are great because they are not too hard to squeeze, although you can&#x27;t really can&#x27;t get the last bits out.  </li>
            <li> Large enough to hold a week+ worth of face wash, lotion etc.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I am able to squeeze the bottle just slightly to sprinkle out the spices or pour the oil.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s last too many trips, but definitely a couple.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles!</li>
            <li> These are much like empty craft paint bottles with the right amount of give in the sides so that the bottles can be squeezed.</li>
            <li> frequent traveler - use these all the time!</li>
            <li> Because I like to put my lunches together at work rather than at home both to preserve freshness and because I&#x27;m lazy in the morning, I bought these little travel bottles for condiments/sauces/dressings and they work GREAT.</li>
            <li> These are perfect size for all her paints, not too big for little hands, and not too small and hold enough paint.</li>
            <li> These have wide mouths and are easy to refill before I take my next trip.  </li>
            <li> I do use pure essential oils in them.  </li>
            <li> On a recent trip they were fine until I flew back from Denver the last three leaked, I&#x27;ll try what one of the reviews did and tape the caps and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clear</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> The caps are on the flimsy side but so far the hinges have remained intact.</li>
            <li> l filled a few as soon as I received them.</li>
            <li> All bottles seem very sturdy and yet flexible enough to be squeezed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and hate checking in luggage when you travel, these bottles are perfect for portioning your toiletries to meet TSA requirements.  </li>
            <li> 4 of the 6 bottles were great, the other 2 were broken.</li>
            <li> The tops seem like they seal tight and the bottles are squishy enough to make it easy to get that shampoo out when you&#x27;re in a hotel shower on a business trip.</li>
            <li> Useful little bottles for traveling with carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that some things that are more viscous are tough to get completely out (like facewash).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about this product other than they look and work as they should.</li>
            <li> First trip, dropped a bottle in the shower and the little piece inside the cap broke off so the bottle will no longer seal.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the bottles leaking, though due to some previous reviewers&#x27; issues with the lids&#x27; hinges being too brittle and cracking easily, I did tape mine closed for added security.</li>
            <li> I filled one with water, held it upside down, and squeezed hard for a while, and nothing leaked out.</li>
            <li> Kind of a bad product.</li>
            <li> So far they&#x27;ve flown with me three round trips and no leakage.</li>
            <li> Wished I&#x27;d purchase them a long time ago for travelling purposes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW the bottles are not marked &amp;#34;2 OZ&amp;#34; anywhere.  </li>
            <li> A long time ago I ran into a cranky TSA agent who demanded bottles had a 2 OZ mark on them.  </li>
            <li> Works really well for hand lotion &amp; soap &amp; thick fluids.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent traveler and have had the need for small containers like this for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> Aftter finding the same product at a craft store for 50% less than they were on here</li>
            <li> So either wet or dry works well in them.</li>
            <li> (relatively) inexpensive water tight plastic vials.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I only want a little, I&#x27;ll even turn to the bottles when I&#x27;m cooking at home.</li>
            <li> The bottles hold enough of my shower gel, shampoo etc to last at least a week (if not longer).</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> works as expected.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t hold up in the dishwasher; every time I come home from a trip I empty my travel bottles and put them in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> The plastic is rigid, so you can&#x27;t squeeze them to get out the last little bit, even when you store them upside down.</li>
            <li> And small enough to take a plane.</li>
            <li> There was no problem with the product other than the size</li>
            <li> Used these for shampoo and other liquids while traveling.</li>
            <li> These are tiny - I don&#x27;t think I realized how small 2 ounces is when I bought them.</li>
            <li> I put my mouthwash and my expensive Kiehl&#x27;s face wash in here, and both worked very well.  </li>
            <li> The plastic seems flimsy and there is a seam down the side which might be prone to splitting.</li>
            <li> but I would still tape them down while in transit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They did not leak when other containers did!</li>
            <li> I still ended up with a soapy mess all over the rest of the bottles--</li>
            <li> The lids snap tight.</li>
            <li> The caps are air tight</li>
            <li> The tops screw on tightly, and the little flip caps hold tight as well.</li>
            <li> These little bottles have gone through lots of pressurization changes.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of leaking containers or bottles with impossibly tiny spouts that I could not refill.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a few times with no spills.</li>
            <li> Do not leak, even with water, yet not too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these bottles if you are looking for something small to separate liquids.</li>
            <li> They were convenient when I needed to give 2 youth a small amount of shower gel to take to camp.  </li>
            <li> Not all failed, but several did.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s contents like from hard plastic ones.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with the low price (I&#x27;ve had travel bottles break on me before, which is really unpleasant)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nearly impossible to squeeze anything out after the 1st half.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing out my expensive silicone tube while on my trip, when it leaked shampoo all over.</li>
            <li> I have not used these yet, so my rating may be unfair.</li>
            <li> These warped badly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These started leaking within a month of buying them, despite using them only a handful of times.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Bought these for travel and for everyday home use and they are the perfect size.  I make up my own face toner and these are working great.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t know about BPAs or whatnot with these, but they don&#x27;t leak. Not even oils or really liquid stuff. I ended up throwing out my expensive silicone tube while on my trip, when it leaked shampoo all over.</li>
            <li> Everything I put into these leaked. I had to use sections of plastic wrap between the lid and the bottle to make them leakproof.</li>
            <li> These bottles work great! I was skeptical with the low price (I&#x27;ve had travel bottles break on me before, which is really unpleasant) but I&#x27;ve had no problems so far. The tops seem like they seal tight and the bottles are squishy enough to make it easy to get that shampoo out when you&#x27;re in a hotel shower on a business trip. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leak and fit in my travel kits. Good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> I used these for a craft. They came quickly and are of good quality</li>
            <li> These work perfectly for traveling in my toiletry bag. Aftter finding the same product at a craft store for 50% less than they were on here I would propably opt for the craft store product.</li>
            <li> (relatively) inexpensive water tight plastic vials. If that is what you need, that is what these are.</li>
            <li> Great! I will plan to get these again in the future. The perfect amount of squeeze without being too stiff and very durable so far!</li>
            <li> These will do the trick. Dont leak but flexible enough to squeeze out lotion or hair product</li>
            <li> Great size and no leaks so far. Very handy bottles to have around. Nice clear bottles let you see what you put inside.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for travel, and the plastic is flexible enough to make these worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them for hot sauce, as I can never find my favored brand when travelling, and they are rated by the FDA for food product, so they&#x27;re pretty much perfect for me. :)</li>
            <li> These are useful to make travel size for any of our toiletry items.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of leaking containers or bottles with impossibly tiny spouts that I could not refill.  These have wide mouths and are easy to refill before I take my next trip.  So far they&#x27;ve flown with me three round trips and no leakage.</li>
            <li> I keep my oil face wash in these and it has never leaked out, even when travelling. I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Nice size, do not leak, work well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I am a flight attendant so I travel every week. These little bottles have gone through lots of pressurization changes. I fill them with cooking oils and spices because I cook my meals in my travel skillet I purchased on Amazon.  They have not leaked yet.  I am able to squeeze the bottle just slightly to sprinkle out the spices or pour the oil. So either wet or dry works well in them. They are sturdy and good quality. The lids snap tight. If anything changes I will edit this review, but for now they get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Size is prefect. Quality is OK. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s last too many trips, but definitely a couple.</li>
            <li> Used for liquids in checked luggage.  Flew to and from Europe (4 flight segments) and they never leaked.</li>
            <li> I used these bottles when I made hand sanitizer.  They&#x27;re the perfect travel size.  The material is surprisingly durable and I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> As expected. Got for traveling and now use the extras around the house. Works great, no complaints</li>
            <li> I used these on a recent trip to pack fish oil and some coconut oil.  Both leaked.  Seemed to work OK for non-oil type liquids.</li>
            <li> Great for my homemade massage lotions. And small enough to take a plane.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Perfect for craft and travel.</li>
            <li> great bottles. I was worried the cap would not seal well, but it does. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about this product other than they look and work as they should. Shampoos and lotions, for travel-size.</li>
            <li> Great size, just perfect for what I want them for.</li>
            <li> In this day and age of airport security and liquid restrictions, this is incredibly useful and very worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Flip top bottle for traveling, as pictured.</li>
            <li> Good value, too nice to give away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make custom flavorings for candy and pastries and coffees. I was going to use these to give away samples but they are too nice. So I&#x27;ll use them in my kitchen, but I&#x27;ll need something else to pass out my samples.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Until now none of them is leaking.</li>
            <li> I have not used these yet, so my rating may be unfair. I don&#x27;t expect these bottles to be very durable. The plastic seems flimsy and there is a seam down the side which might be prone to splitting. I was hoping for something a bit more sturdy; this product is comparable to something you might buy in Target or a dollar store. OK for the price, nice size, and will be very pleased if they hold up for multiple trips.</li>
            <li> Use to make my homemade hand sanitizers and lotions.  I do use pure essential oils in them.  This amount can last up to 2-3 months.  I&#x27;ve not had any problems with the essential oils in them.  I keep mine in my purse or bathroom cabinet (away from bright light).  Love these for my needs.</li>
            <li> These bottles are perfectly sized for overnight stays or airplane trips.  I filled each one with different liquids:  Woolite, shampoos, etc.  The 2 oz. size is great for carrying on board the plane.  Most of them stayed sealed; unfortunately, one of them continued to leak.  (I took the advice of another reviewer and filled it only part-way, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  I still ended up with a soapy mess all over the rest of the bottles--thank goodness they were packed inside the quart-sized Ziplock.)  I would highly recommend them for sleepovers and car trips, but make sure they&#x27;re packed in a plastic bag if you&#x27;re taking them on an airplane.</li>
            <li> I use these containers to store honey in.  They are great to pack in a lunch box for work to use with my tea.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> Because I like to put my lunches together at work rather than at home both to preserve freshness and because I&#x27;m lazy in the morning, I bought these little travel bottles for condiments/sauces/dressings and they work GREAT. I use all six for things like sriracha, olive oil, even salt and pepper. I like the size of the hole in the cap because it controls the flow of whatever is inside. Sometimes if I only want a little, I&#x27;ll even turn to the bottles when I&#x27;m cooking at home.</li>
            <li> Great price and sturdy construction. I wish the caps closed a bit tighter - but overall a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great to put your oils to travel with!</li>
            <li> Received as described, these bottles have been life savers during my occasional travels. I have been sealing the top with duct-tape just in case so I can&#x27;t speak to the lid mechanics. The bottles hold enough of my shower gel, shampoo etc to last at least a week (if not longer).</li>
            <li> Work well for travel. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with leaking like the last set of bottles that I had.  I do wish the tops were made a bit more solid and of higher quality.  They feel a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> These worked well for me on a recent trip, and made contending with liquids easy during the TSA&#x27;s screening process. I had no problems with the bottles leaking, though due to some previous reviewers&#x27; issues with the lids&#x27; hinges being too brittle and cracking easily, I did tape mine closed for added security. They fit easily into a small Ziploc bag and I had no problems.</li>
            <li> Have been using these bottles for various liquids for over a year. Even throw them in my purse. Have never had even a tiny leak. They are great.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> These little bottles are exactly what I needed to mix up my own soap and lotion. Plus, they can be put in my carry-on when I fly</li>
            <li> Great little bottles for most bathroom liquids needed for air travel.</li>
            <li> Work well for what they&#x27;re made to do. They fit in with TSA regulations and don&#x27;t leak. A tip, don&#x27;t fill your liquids to the top and line them with plastic wrap to prevent airplane pressure spillage.</li>
            <li> These are convenient and durable bottles.  Great travel size too.</li>
            <li> Just as described and when tested with water they did not leak :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for bringing liquids onto the plane!</li>
            <li> Will likely buy another set. No leaking, convenient size.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel.  Do not leak, even with water, yet not too stiff.  a good answer for travel.</li>
            <li> They serve a simple purpose and none of the bottles were defective. Good deal.</li>
            <li> Did the job. No leaks. Convenient wide opening for loading your products and good squeeze function.</li>
            <li> These are great little containers. I bought them to put baby stuff in like sunscreen and lotion to make smaller to-go sizes for the diaper bag. I also use them to make travel sizes of my toiletries. They don&#x27;t leak and are good quality.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I needed .  I would recommend these bottles if you are looking for something small to separate liquids.</li>
            <li> What more can I say other than they are bottles with lids that close. They hold stuff and don&#x27;t spill. They are perfect for size for carry on luggage which was my intended purpose.</li>
            <li> everyone in my immediate family wanted to have them! the advantage for us is that bottles could be squeezed and it was faster to get out it&#x27;s contents like from hard plastic ones. and the flip top, was a greeeeeat idea</li>
            <li> These bottles are a nice quality and seal very nicely.  Held when filled with liquid and put inside our suitcase.</li>
            <li> We took these camping and went through several altitude changes (Death Valley to Yosemite). They did not leak when other containers did! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use these every day to hold my shampoo and conditioner in my bag to the gym. I&#x27;ve never had them leak, open inside my gym bag, or break. I tend to throw my gym bag around, so these get a 5 star. Reliable product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for taking smaller amounts with you camping!</li>
            <li> I got these to put my daughter&#x27;s water based paint in. The lids go on securely so there is no leaks, yet my daughter is able to open and close these on her own. These are perfect size for all her paints, not too big for little hands, and not too small and hold enough paint. Definitely worth the money and a good buy</li>
            <li> Nice for mixing oils inside for your hair.</li>
            <li> the tubes were very useful for travel because they are allowed on airplanes. Only drawback is that some things that are more viscous are tough to get completely out (like facewash).</li>
            <li> I am a frequent traveler and have had the need for small containers like this for quite awhile.  I put my mouthwash and my expensive Kiehl&#x27;s face wash in here, and both worked very well.  No leaks, no breakage.  Very sturdy.  2 fl oz was sufficient for my needs. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are okay, but I&#x27;m not convinced that they would be leak-proof.  They were convenient when I needed to give 2 youth a small amount of shower gel to take to camp.  However, I put them in a zip lock bag because they don&#x27;t seem to be leak-proof.</li>
            <li> Works great for my paints - small sizes and tight lids provide very useful item in the shop</li>
            <li> This is a simple product. works as expected. I expect I will be able to travel with it.</li>
            <li> I bought these to store liquid watercolor paint when I&#x27;m transporting them, and they appear to be leakproof. I filled one with water, held it upside down, and squeezed hard for a while, and nothing leaked out. So I&#x27; m happy. Haven&#x27;t taken them on an airplane yet...will try to remember to update when I do.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my essential oil blends and love them! Clients bring them back to refill or recycle.  I&#x27;ve washed them and they do really nice. Purchased several times. Great product!</li>
            <li> Wished I&#x27;d purchase them a long time ago for travelling purposes.  I simply use a Sharpy to write on the cap top what the container contains.</li>
            <li> Best small bottles ever used - WHY? Because they have no odor! No washing, no airing out.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to buy again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE - Bring these great bottles back.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and hate checking in luggage when you travel, these bottles are perfect for portioning your toiletries to meet TSA requirements.  I&#x27;ve spent way more time and money than I should looking for bottles that are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to clean and fill&lt;br /&gt;2. Large enough to hold a week+ worth of face wash, lotion etc.&lt;br /&gt;3. Leak proof with screw+flip top dispensing combo&lt;br /&gt;4. Clear so I can see what&#x27;s actually inside&lt;br /&gt;5. Rigid but with enough flexibility for squeezing&lt;br /&gt;6. No plastic-y odor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bottles meet all my requirements and come in a nice set of 6. They might not be eye catching, but they are the Costco of travel friendly bottles - not fancy, but I dare you to not like them (to quote Cam from Modern Family).</li>
            <li> Meet the need and never had an issue with the TSA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these bottles for all kinds of stuff.  I did a similar review for a similar product from another vendor.  These have been good for everything I&#x27;ve put in them so far.</li>
            <li> As others have said, these are great because they are not too hard to squeeze, although you can&#x27;t really can&#x27;t get the last bits out.  The caps are air tight but I would still tape them down while in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW the bottles are not marked &amp;#34;2 OZ&amp;#34; anywhere.  A long time ago I ran into a cranky TSA agent who demanded bottles had a 2 OZ mark on them.  But I haven&#x27;t had that happen again.</li>
            <li> just right for use in the State Esthetician Boards exam kit</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described and just what I needed for my vacation. I ad no problems with any of the bottles. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I do oil cleansing and these small containers are perfect for mixing your oils.</li>
            <li> I ordered these by capacity and when received found they were too tall.  It would have been helpful for the height (length) of the bottle to be included in the description. UPDATE:  I appreciate the seller including the height of the item so that others might avoid the frustration I experienced.  There was no problem with the product other than the size was not what I needed.</li>
            <li> The bottles would work well if the liquid is very viscous, but if it&#x27;s lotiony and has the consistency of hair conditioners, good luck at getting the 2nd half of the content out of the bottle... it&#x27;s nearly impossible to squeeze anything out after the 1st half.</li>
            <li> Used these for shampoo and other liquids while traveling. Not all failed, but several did. Ended up with makeup remover inside my cosmetic bag after several flights. They may be fine for home DIY projects or whatever, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust them in an airplane.</li>
            <li> They allow you to travel with all your liquids and be able to carry on....rather than lose all your luggage in transit.</li>
            <li> Plastic bottle, holds liquid, doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> These are good for keeping extra paint for me when I mix colors and don&#x27;t use the entire amount.  They do not keep clean at the opening so prefer the squeeze bottles with a spout.</li>
            <li> Good value, multi use item.</li>
            <li> sturdy, durable, practical, useful</li>
            <li> Useful little bottles for traveling with carry-on luggage. No leaking as yet.</li>
            <li> frequent traveler - use these all the time! leak-free and perfect size. great product!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and shipped quickly.  These are much like empty craft paint bottles with the right amount of give in the sides so that the bottles can be squeezed.</li>
            <li> Worked great in the Amazon for 10 days.  No issues.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for using as sample for my home cleaning business.  No leaks and affordable!</li>
            <li> They do the job and a good price. Wish the had 1oz ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stored a variety of health/beauty products in these for travel, and the only thing that has leaked is my shampoo.  Not face toner, lotions, conditioner, or anything else.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for storing essential oils.</li>
            <li> Bought the set of 6 for a camping trip. I used them to store soap, shampoo, cooking oil, salt, and sugar. I kept them in separate sandwich bags since I was concerned they would leak, but even with all of the bouncing around in our bags, none of them did. The tops screw on tightly, and the little flip caps hold tight as well.</li>
            <li> These are tiny - I don&#x27;t think I realized how small 2 ounces is when I bought them. They also don&#x27;t hold up in the dishwasher; every time I come home from a trip I empty my travel bottles and put them in the dishwasher. These warped badly.The plastic is rigid, so you can&#x27;t squeeze them to get out the last little bit, even when you store them upside down.</li>
            <li> Very nice little bottles for shampoo, conditioner, or whatever. Haven&#x27;t had the occasion to travel with them yet, so can&#x27;t comment on whether they leak in the suitcase during surface or air travel. Will update my post after I travel with them. The bottles have just the right flexibility for dispensing whatever you put in them and are the perfect size, at least for me. The price is right too.</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles! They are perfect for flying with. I use dry wipes and water to change my sons diaper and this is perfect for carrying around the water I need. Fits perfectly in my diaper bag and I can keep one in every room of my house if I need to.</li>
            <li> Works really well for hand lotion &amp; soap &amp; thick fluids. The caps are on the flimsy side but so far the hinges have remained intact. Great for the price &amp; I would buy more.</li>
            <li> 4 of the 6 bottles were great, the other 2 were broken. The lids were snapped-off. Kind of a bad product.</li>
            <li> Promt delivery, bottles as described, no leaks after 3 weeks of travel.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order these, they work great!!</li>
            <li> Was going on a plane and wanted some bottles that could get through airport TSA for shampoo, body wash etc, and these worked great.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size bottles, just the right size for carrying lotions, oils, etc. They are easy to fill and the lids stay close and&lt;br /&gt;do not open. l filled a few as soon as I received them. Would recommend these for many uses.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good. I&#x27;ve used them a few times with no spills.</li>
            <li> All bottles seem very sturdy and yet flexible enough to be squeezed. perfect size to carry enough stuff for a weeks trip if needed.</li>
            <li> used these for on-the-go lotion.  easy to dispense</li>
            <li> Worked great for my purposes. I mix up gun oil 1 gallon at a time, these are the perfect size to pour it into and use to dispense it.</li>
            <li> Perfect... Just what I wanted/needed for transporting my toiletries on a recent 7-day cruise trip. Added labeling to easily grab mine vs. my boyfriends :-)</li>
            <li> Put hand lotion in them - one for the purse - the kitchen - the bath - everywhere -&lt;br /&gt;even to give to friends.&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
            <li> On a recent trip they were fine until I flew back from Denver the last three leaked, I&#x27;ll try what one of the reviews did and tape the caps and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry H</li>
            <li> no leakage whatsoever, hold up well to my home made water and oil based cosmetics</li>
            <li> First trip, dropped a bottle in the shower and the little piece inside the cap broke off so the bottle will no longer seal. The others seem fine - so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
