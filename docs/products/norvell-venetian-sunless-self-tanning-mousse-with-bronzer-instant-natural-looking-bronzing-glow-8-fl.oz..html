            <li>amazing, and so affordable!</li>
            <li>Hoping with additional applications it gets darker but still nice product!</li>
            <li>The tan look is good if you don&#x27;t mind wearing the odor.</li>

            <li>LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>They really know what there doing &amp; they are the best!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using loving tan, but after it being sold out for months, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>Good color but more involved application.  </li>
            <li>Looks like I have been on vacation, have a nice brown color.</li>
            <li>and then I went and bought my own.</li>
            <li>This foam is a nice change from what I&#x27;m used to using.</li>
            <li>This gives you a great, rich color.  </li>
            <li>It is NOT a subtle color, and what I like best is the color it leaves</li>
            <li>Best color I&#x27;ve experienced and will most definitely reorder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Venetian is by far the best sunless product on the market!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>Great product, isn&#x27;t as consistent as the spray tan but still does a great job and males for a pretty even tan.</li>
            <li>With saying that, it&#x27;s not a bad tanner, it has a coconut type smell, and lasts fairly well, some places stay darker longer but not horribly noticeable.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The bottle does not say to shake it, but if I don&#x27;t it comes out more liquidity than mousse-like, which is how I caused stains in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Be sure to rub, rub, rub.</li>
            <li>Better than St. Moriz which I had been using.</li>
            <li>I like the norvell lotion better</li>
            <li>Apply sparingly for a nice light tan or use more for a deeper tan.  </li>
            <li>but I do love the color &amp; quality.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s Vegan as well.</li>
            <li>Great product...dries fast...</li>
            <li>doesnt smell like many i have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been self tanning for 8 years now and tried many products along the way.</li>
            <li>This is much better than the store brands that you&#x27;ll find in the drugstore.</li>
            <li>This cost about $6 more than the store brands that I bought for $8.</li>
            <li>Make sure to buy a mitt for application because it doesn&#x27;t come off your fingertips.</li>
            <li>The beautiful natural sun kissed color.</li>
            <li>The product sticks to your hands pretty good.</li>
            <li>This has a pleasant scent and works very well.</li>
            <li>The color is great, very natural and not orange.</li>
            <li>boom great natural look.</li>
            <li>Nice golden brown color on my olive skin.</li>
            <li>And the fact that it&#x27;s paraben free, gluten free &amp; 100% vegan.</li>
            <li>I watched a video on tips for applying, and they recommended using a washcloth, but that just absorbed most of the product.</li>
            <li>Smells lightly of cherries and leaves you brown, not orange.</li>
            <li>Light film.</li>
            <li>but it is light.  </li>
            <li>So I purchased another product, Tanwise which received good reviews however it didn&#x27;t provide any lasting color and the bronzer rubbed off easily on my clothes and bedsheets.  </li>
            <li>Last about a week and smells better than most of the stuff out there!</li>
            <li>The product I originally purchased got confiscated at the airport</li>
            <li>On a medication that says no sun longer than 20 minutes, I have tried numerous sunless products, this product is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Aside from the typical self tanner smell, this is just as good!</li>
            <li>If you have ever done airbrush tanning with Norvell products, the quality of the color is the same and looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I love the color, and it is not too drastic of a change if you haven&#x27;t ventured out in the sun much.</li>
            <li>Only advice I might have for you when using this product is to rub it in good and  to wash your hands immediately after use, but that is with any self-tanner.</li>
            <li>it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great, more affordable alternative to constantly doing spray tans at the salon and definitely safer than tanning in the beds.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone - have applied to my legs several times and have gotten compliments on how great my tan looks -</li>
            <li>Hands down best sunless product although would be nice if it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve re-ordered Norvell because, compared to others I&#x27;ve tried, it provides fantastic color that really lasts.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Still am not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>This has almost a purple tone to t to give you a fresh look.</li>
            <li>It soaks in and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I read a BUNCH of reviews on self-tanners before I bought this - they were right.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and looks natural!</li>
            <li>I have used a ton of lotions, but this is my first mousse.</li>
            <li>I first tried it from a friend</li>
            <li>I left on for 8 hours then showered, most of the color seemed to come off.</li>
            <li>I am an avid spray tanner and</li>
            <li>The best fake tan in a can I have found.</li>
            <li>It is easily controlled and with the mitt and back applicator, if you take your time and be precise with one area at a time, it applies evenly and the color is better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>And that it is totally cruelty free.</li>
            <li>so I apply this at night and gently wipe it off in the morning.</li>
            <li>Looks like the real tan, not orange.</li>
            <li>And the next day before my shower it smells good still nice subtle tropical scent the next morning &amp; it moisturizes your skin so well.</li>
            <li>Pretty natural summer tan!</li>
            <li>It is more of a brown tan, not a golden bronze type.</li>
            <li>Love the instant color it gives me but does not last.</li>
            <li>Those tanners are the only ones that make me look more natural, super dark and not sickly orange yellow looking.</li>
            <li>It is high quality with the bronzer in the product.</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite now for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>Hands down Norvell gives the most beatiful, natural bronze color.</li>
            <li>I usually use St Tropez but was looking for a more &#x27;natural ingredients&#x27; tanner - this isn&#x27;t it!!</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the closest thing to a natural tan, I highly recommend this product or any Norvell sunless product ðŸ’•</li>
            <li>Use the spray Norvell in the red can first, use a mitt to ensure even color application.....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re fair-skinned and just want a light tan, this might be too dark.</li>
            <li>The color was even and natural.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t turn orange, didn&#x27;t blotch, didn&#x27;t wash off , looks as natural as you can get from any product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;ve naturally been spending hours in the sun.</li>
            <li>this makes all the difference in achieving a natural brown tan instead of an orange tan.  </li>
            <li>Gives you a natural bronze tan.</li>
            <li>natural looking tan color...</li>
            <li>Go very lightly on your face/neck, barely a pump - trust me, the color will develop over the next few hours.</li>
            <li>Also, can&#x27;t get past the strong &amp;#34;chemical coconut&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and heavier than the other cheap tanning mousse, it lasts longer, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I use latex gloves to apply because after the first try I realized that this self tanner does not come off of hands with soap and water like the other self tanners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It wasnt nearly as dark upon the first application and it really stains your hands/towels so recommend gloves when applying but does produce a very natural &amp; non-orange color which isn&#x27;t streaky like a lot of other sunless tanners.</li>
            <li>Gloves are a must which makes it a little more difficult to smooth on evenly.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that was confusing at first was the &amp;#34;expiration date&amp;#34; was actually a &amp;#34;born on&amp;#34; date, so I thought I had received an expired one at first.</li>
            <li>It was worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who wants a dark tan.</li>

            <li> I use latex gloves to apply because after the first try I realized that this self tanner does not come off of hands with soap and water like the other self tanners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It wasnt nearly as dark upon the first application and it really stains your hands/towels so recommend gloves when applying but does produce a very natural &amp; non-orange color which isn&#x27;t streaky like a lot of other sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> Gloves are a must which makes it a little more difficult to smooth on evenly.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that was confusing at first was the &amp;#34;expiration date&amp;#34; was actually a &amp;#34;born on&amp;#34; date, so I thought I had received an expired one at first.</li>
            <li> It was worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone who wants a dark tan.</li>
            <li> While disappointing, it is still a good deal and I will be trying out their other products.</li>
            <li> As far as re-applying - I do so every other day.</li>
            <li> The foam makes it much easier to handle than the usual lotion types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying different bands.  </li>
            <li> My skin is baby soft right now in the middle of this crazy snow storm.</li>
            <li> All sunless products tend to dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Too bad because it did have a better smell.</li>
            <li> (It is just enough color to make me less self-conscious about my lack of a tan!)</li>
            <li> I recommend working in small areas using only 2-3 pumps of product at a time otherwise it may dry before you get a chance to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I apply to all of my upper body (including face) using small circles until I feel it settling in.</li>
            <li> is tan, NOT ORANGE, with a slight pink hue.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s price hands down.</li>
            <li> This tanning mousse has a dark almost purple under tone instead of the typical white/orange color when applying -</li>
            <li> I wish it was a tad darker and that the odor was less self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Application can be a little tricky bc</li>
            <li> It is a very dark brown out of the bottle</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to apply and I have only used it a couple of times</li>
            <li> Streaky and fades off very very uneven.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> What a mess!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed they suddenly raised the price from $10.50 to $16.50. :(</li>
            <li> I like that the product doesn&#x27;t look fake.  </li>
            <li> (my poor sink and wall!).</li>
            <li> people can&#x27;t believe it is a fake tan.</li>
            <li> It works alright but had a smell I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Need a sponge and gloves for sure, but great product</li>
            <li> I loveeeee this product. I always look for a self tanner that has that redish purple brown color to it. Those tanners are the only ones that make me look more natural, super dark and not sickly orange yellow looking. This product is my favorite now for a few reasons. The beautiful natural sun kissed color. And the fact that it&#x27;s paraben free, gluten free &amp; 100% vegan. And that it is totally cruelty free. Oh yeah it smells tropical to witch i love! And the next day before my shower it smells good still nice subtle tropical scent the next morning &amp; it moisturizes your skin so well. My skin is baby soft right now in the middle of this crazy snow storm. I loveeeee this product cant say enough about it. I plan on purchasing a sunless tanning spray tanning machine for my house, and i will be purchasing Norvell products to put in it. They really know what there doing &amp; they are the best!!</li>
            <li> Great product, isn&#x27;t as consistent as the spray tan but still does a great job and males for a pretty even tan.</li>
            <li> I usually use St Tropez but was looking for a more &#x27;natural ingredients&#x27; tanner - this isn&#x27;t it!! With saying that, it&#x27;s not a bad tanner, it has a coconut type smell, and lasts fairly well, some places stay darker longer but not horribly noticeable. It is more of a brown tan, not a golden bronze type.</li>
            <li> I like that the product doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I wish it was a tad darker and that the odor was less self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> If you have ever done airbrush tanning with Norvell products, the quality of the color is the same and looks gorgeous. I watched a video on tips for applying, and they recommended using a washcloth, but that just absorbed most of the product. I used my hands to apply, washed my hands afterwards and blended a thing layer over my hands and wrists. The color was even and natural. You could also try using an application glove. This is a great, more affordable alternative to constantly doing spray tans at the salon and definitely safer than tanning in the beds.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on smooth and looks natural!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Last about a week and smells better than most of the stuff out there! Pretty natural summer tan!</li>
            <li> Wrong item came! I ordered the Venician (purple bottle) as shown in picture and the Orange/pink bottle came instead. Totally different color of tan!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of self-tanners, and this beats out the ones twice it&#x27;s price hands down. Smells lightly of cherries and leaves you brown, not orange. Definitely use a mitt for application as it gives the smoothest appearance. Go very lightly on your face/neck, barely a pump - trust me, the color will develop over the next few hours. I noticed they suddenly raised the price from $10.50 to $16.50. :( While disappointing, it is still a good deal and I will be trying out their other products.</li>
            <li> I read a BUNCH of reviews on self-tanners before I bought this - they were right. It is a great product, even for someone who is fair skinned! I love the color, and it is not too drastic of a change if you haven&#x27;t ventured out in the sun much. (It is just enough color to make me less self-conscious about my lack of a tan!) Only advice I might have for you when using this product is to rub it in good and  to wash your hands immediately after use, but that is with any self-tanner. The foam makes it much easier to handle than the usual lotion types. As far as re-applying - I do so every other day.</li>
            <li> Streaky and fades off very very uneven. Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using loving tan, but after it being sold out for months, I decided to try this. Aside from the typical self tanner smell, this is just as good! No orange tint. The only thing that was confusing at first was the &amp;#34;expiration date&amp;#34; was actually a &amp;#34;born on&amp;#34; date, so I thought I had received an expired one at first.</li>
            <li> Updated Review - I DID repurchase!  The product I originally purchased got confiscated at the airport (I forgot to enclose it in a plastic bag).  So I purchased another product, Tanwise which received good reviews however it didn&#x27;t provide any lasting color and the bronzer rubbed off easily on my clothes and bedsheets.  Too bad because it did have a better smell. So I&#x27;ve re-ordered Norvell because, compared to others I&#x27;ve tried, it provides fantastic color that really lasts.  Doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes or bedsheets.  Still am not crazy about the smell but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.  Earlier review: Good color but more involved application.  Gloves are a must which makes it a little more difficult to smooth on evenly.  Also, can&#x27;t get past the strong &amp;#34;chemical coconut&amp;#34; smell.  For these two reasons, I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Nice golden brown color on my olive skin. No smell. Seldom streaks. I use my hands to apply and rinse them well. I will buy again. Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> On a medication that says no sun longer than 20 minutes, I have tried numerous sunless products, this product is by far the best I have ever used. Didn&#x27;t turn orange, didn&#x27;t blotch, didn&#x27;t wash off , looks as natural as you can get from any product I have ever used. Love it.</li>
            <li> Looks like I have been on vacation, have a nice brown color. No gold. No orange. Just tan.</li>
            <li> I have used a ton of lotions, but this is my first mousse. It took a few applications to really get a feel for an application that works for me. I use latex gloves to apply because after the first try I realized that this self tanner does not come off of hands with soap and water like the other self tanners I&#x27;ve used. Do not let this drip or splash on anything because it will leave it&#x27;s mark forever (my poor sink and wall!). The bottle does not say to shake it, but if I don&#x27;t it comes out more liquidity than mousse-like, which is how I caused stains in my bathroom. So SHAKE before each pump. I apply to all of my upper body (including face) using small circles until I feel it settling in. It soaks in and dries pretty quickly. It is a very dark brown out of the bottle so I apply this at night and gently wipe it off in the morning. I LOVE the color! It is NOT a subtle color, and what I like best is the color it leaves is tan, NOT ORANGE, with a slight pink hue. Looks like I&#x27;ve naturally been spending hours in the sun. I have had zero problems with streaking. I apply to my face and neck (which never holds color well) every two days to keep the color up and chest and arms maybe every 4-5 days. Best color I&#x27;ve experienced and will most definitely reorder.&lt;br /&gt;Happy (fake) tanning :-)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I first tried it from a friend and then I went and bought my own. It is high quality with the bronzer in the product. You can SEE the color so you can ensure that you are applying it evenly. NOT AN ORANGE TAN. Very natural looking. Be sure to rub, rub, rub.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norvell products for over 3years, wouldn&#x27;t change for anything! Venetian is by far the best sunless product on the market! If you are looking for the closest thing to a natural tan, I highly recommend this product or any Norvell sunless product ðŸ’•</li>
            <li> This tanning mousse has a dark almost purple under tone instead of the typical white/orange color when applying - this makes all the difference in achieving a natural brown tan instead of an orange tan.  Highly recommend to anyone - have applied to my legs several times and have gotten compliments on how great my tan looks - people can&#x27;t believe it is a fake tan.</li>
            <li> I tried the product. It works alright but had a smell I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about. I thought it would not have any odor since they bother me and I was under the impression it would not. The tan look is good if you don&#x27;t mind wearing the odor.</li>
            <li> Love this! Better than St. Moriz which I had been using. exfoliate prior to application with rubber gloves and mitt. Don&#x27;t forget to tan them hands!</li>
            <li> Love the instant color it gives me but does not last. I left on for 8 hours then showered, most of the color seemed to come off. I like the norvell lotion better, it last longer</li>
            <li> Looks like the real tan, not orange. Light film. Washes well.</li>
            <li> Apply sparingly for a nice light tan or use more for a deeper tan.  Follow instructions and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not turn your orange. This gives you a great, rich color.  Use the spray Norvell in the red can first, use a mitt to ensure even color application..... then use your mitt and apply this over it. Brown as a biskit....no doubt you will be.  I am an avid spray tanner and this stuff rocks it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Gives you a natural bronze tan. Not ORANGE by any means! Finally a product that does what it says!</li>
            <li> I really love norvell tanning products! This foam is a nice change from what I&#x27;m used to using. It is a little difficult to apply and I have only used it a couple of times but I do love the color &amp; quality.</li>
            <li> Best product I ever tried. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great sunless product. I love that it&#x27;s Vegan as well. I would wear latex gloves when applying. The product sticks to your hands pretty good. The color is great, very natural and not orange.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant scent and works very well. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is how I received it in the mail! What a mess!!!</li>
            <li> Great product...dries fast...natural looking tan color...doesnt smell like many i have used.</li>
            <li> It does not stay foam need spray</li>
            <li> The best fake tan in a can I have found. I add it to my lotion ...boom great natural look.</li>
            <li> It wasnt nearly as dark upon the first application and it really stains your hands/towels so recommend gloves when applying but does produce a very natural &amp; non-orange color which isn&#x27;t streaky like a lot of other sunless tanners. Hoping with additional applications it gets darker but still nice product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been self tanning for 8 years now and tried many products along the way. Hands down Norvell gives the most beatiful, natural bronze color. Application can be a little tricky bc it dries quickly. I recommend working in small areas using only 2-3 pumps of product at a time otherwise it may dry before you get a chance to rub it in. It does rub off on clothes/furniture so keep that in mind when planning your activities post application.</li>
            <li> Color is perfect! Does well around ankles and knees. Also blends well!</li>
            <li> Hands down best sunless product although would be nice if it lasted a little longer. All sunless products tend to dry out my skin so I moisturize at night. This has almost a purple tone to t to give you a fresh look. Not yellow or orange at all. The mousse runs in great. To my surprise NO STREAKING. Best color and blend ability of anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the store brands that you&#x27;ll find in the drugstore. This stuff is amazing. It has a purple hue, so it turns into TAN not ORANGE. It&#x27;s thicker and heavier than the other cheap tanning mousse, it lasts longer, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. This cost about $6 more than the store brands that I bought for $8. It was worth the extra few bucks. Seriously. I recommend it for anyone who wants a dark tan. If you&#x27;re fair-skinned and just want a light tan, this might be too dark. Make sure to buy a mitt for application because it doesn&#x27;t come off your fingertips.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying different bands.  My search is over.  LOVE this stuff!  I might buy the spray like another user recommended. amazing, and so affordable!</li>
            <li> I have used the mousse 3 times now and am very pleased with the bronze color.  No orange for my skin and I do not have real fair skin but it is light.  It is easily controlled and with the mitt and back applicator, if you take your time and be precise with one area at a time, it applies evenly and the color is better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
