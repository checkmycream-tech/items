            <li>So much better than the liquid soap!</li>

            <li>My skin feel moist and smooth after using this cleansing bar!</li>

            <li>so was glad to find a bar that won&#x27;t aggravate his skin.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Same great product.</li>

            <li>Very gentle</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve started carrying it in my purse because I&#x27;ve found most hand soap irritates my eczema (which is on my hands and wrists) and if I use only Cetaphil, it helps keep my skin in check.</li>
            <li>I am 80 years old and using the soaps and creams have kept my skin smooth and unwrinkled.</li>

            <li>I love the smell, very subtle but clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I normally use dove sensitive bar soap</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t cleared up my eczema completely, but it has helped reduce the intensity of the rash.</li>
            <li>but it works well for me and my sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> This has been a great product for me since I have psoriasis and rosacea and I like to wash my face am and pm.  It fits the bill.  No need to purchase a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; cleanser, it&#x27;s basic (ingredient wise) and gentle on my skin.  These can seem expensive but on Amazon they cost less in a pack.  I would recommend these to anyone and if your not sure, just try it and see how it does with your skin.  Use this on my main body and also my face.</li>
            <li> This is the Only soap I use! It heals and soothes dry skin!!</li>
            <li> Works great. I love the smell, very subtle but clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s great for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> The liquid version of this cleanser is very popular but it&#x27;s nice to have the bar version. I love the texture and it works very well. Very gentle</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil for years.  This is the same quality product I originally bought from a retail store.</li>
            <li> Helped get rid of eczema caused by body washes. Now I just use generic hypoallergenic soap, which works fine too.</li>
            <li> So much better than the liquid soap! Great deal!</li>
            <li> Very efective, helped a lot to hidrate. I really recommend the use of this type of product as often as posible</li>
            <li> i got this because I love Cetaphil gentle cleanser and love bar soap so I was hoping this would be nirvana. I normally use dove sensitive bar soap and I felt like this was more drying that that. I&#x27;ll go back to using that. My bf likes to use this to wash his beard though so it&#x27;s not a total aaste</li>
            <li> I use the liquid to wash my face at night and use the bar in the shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> GREAT SOAP -- GOOD SUDS -- SKIN FEELS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> The best facial soap I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> My skin feel moist and smooth after using this cleansing bar! I will recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Great price. Same great product.</li>
            <li> Very good and cheaper</li>
            <li> Love the Cetaphil Cleansing bar. I use it with the Cetaphil moisturizing cream and it has helped my eczema a great deal.</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s skin had been messed up by a prescribed hydrocortisone cream &amp; this helped in making her skin smooth again &amp; helped to ease her eczema</li>
            <li> This is a little $$$ but it works well for me and my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a very good product to use especailly if you have a skin problem. I have been using all of Cetaphil products for years that is why I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I order this for my husband. He has sensitive skin and stuggles with psoriasis. He doesn&#x27;t like body wash so was glad to find a bar that won&#x27;t aggravate his skin.</li>
            <li> I have a delicate skin and this is all I use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil products for 8 years. I am 80 years old and using the soaps and creams have kept my skin smooth and unwrinkled.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I use it on my face and body and even on my cats and dog. Super gentle and smells clean.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my delicate skin</li>
