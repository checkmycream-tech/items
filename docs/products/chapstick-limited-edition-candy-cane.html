            <li>Love this Chapstick and it&#x27;s minty tingle.</li>
            <li>sort of costly, but cute...</li>
            <li>Recipient enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>The peppermint is a bit stronger than the spearmint but still like it so much better than the kiddie versions of strawberry,</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>nice cool feel to my lips.</li>
            <li>Always keep full stock!</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful peppermint (but not sweet) scent that cools and tingles my lips while keeping them moisturized.</li>
            <li>but I love them so much.</li>
            <li>I pop some gum in my mouth and apply this minty lip balm and feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing to the lips and preferable to the original &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love this flavor - I can only find it in the stores during the holidays but now that I have found it online, I can enjoy it all year long :)</li>
            <li>The Fresh Effect Green Tea and Mint variety is good too.</li>
            <li>I will buy as many as I possibly can as stock will allow.</li>
            <li>The peppermint tingly feeling when first applied is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint flavor is exactly like</li>
            <li>Its good to know I can buy it here all year especially since its a limited edition.</li>
            <li>Paid way too much for these</li>
            <li>My sister absolutely LOVES this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and is very candy-like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll clear out the display in the stores!</li>
            <li>I am addicted to chapstick and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Unlike other traditional peppermint chap-stick this one isn&#x27;t to strong.</li>
            <li>Should be available in stores year round.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different ones, some have made my lips feel dry, or they disappear quickly.  </li>

            <li> Exactly as pictured, smell great, all sealed still and in perfect condition. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> best chapstick ever!!!! It&#x27;s tingly, very refreshing.  I will buy as many as I possibly can as stock will allow.</li>
            <li> Choice of granddaughter who has a long history with this product.  Obviously she loves it.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> Love this Chapstick and it&#x27;s minty tingle.</li>
            <li> sort of costly, but cute...</li>
            <li> A Christmas stocking stuffer.  Recipient enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Paid way too much for these but I love them so much. I don&#x27;t like the other types of Chapstick but these are really nice. This coming Christmas I&#x27;ll clear out the display in the stores!</li>
            <li> These things are great!  The only downside is that they are only offered for a limited time.  My wife loves them, so I tried to purchase enough to last her through the year.  The ChapStick itself is the same consistency and quality as all the others, but this one has a Candy Cane (Peppermint) scent.  A great product.</li>
            <li> The peppermint is a bit stronger than the spearmint but still like it so much better than the kiddie versions of strawberry, etc that the stores seem to carry.  Very nice and soothing. Too bad its only around at holidays</li>
            <li> This has become the only chap-stick flavor I use regardless of the season. It taste just like candy canes and as soon as it hits your lips it has a wonderful cooling sensation. Unlike other traditional peppermint chap-stick this one isn&#x27;t to strong. It cools and taste like faint candy canes without being overwhelming. As long as they make this I&#x27;ll buy it; the only other one to ever rival this one for me would be the pumpkin pie flavor that has just come out as well.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.  I am always looking for a lip balm to carry with my everywhere.  I&#x27;ve tried different ones, some have made my lips feel dry, or they disappear quickly.  This one stays on my lips for a long time and leaves them feeling moisturized.  The peppermint tingly feeling when first applied is an added bonus.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying this balm.</li>
            <li> Best Chapstick there is!</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  After lunch at work I pop some gum in my mouth and apply this minty lip balm and feel fresh and clean.  The Fresh Effect Green Tea and Mint variety is good too.</li>
            <li> The best Chapstick ever!</li>
            <li> Love this flavor great product</li>
            <li> The peppermint flavor is exactly like a candy cane!&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find out in retail.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchased this again!</li>
            <li> My sister absolutely LOVES this stuff. She refuses to use anything else because she loves the cooling peppermint. Very moisturizing and is very candy-like.</li>
            <li> my fave chapstick i cant find in stores. nice cool feel to my lips. the chapstick part is white/clear in color. no tints.</li>
            <li> Love this item1!! Feels great, awesome scent!!!</li>
            <li> Hard to find.  Hope they make these every year.  LOVE them!  Taste and smell....and tingle to the lips, is awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this flavor - I can only find it in the stores during the holidays but now that I have found it online, I can enjoy it all year long :)</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this</li>
            <li> Great refreshing flavor! Should be available in stores year round.</li>
