            <li>I received this product almost to weeks ago and wanted to get a good amount of use in before I reviewed it.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s sexy anyway, but the serum has been a welcome addition to smoothing and grooming of his beard.&lt;br /&gt;3.)  </li>
            <li>I will be getting more!</li>
            <li>I was able to use this in a pinch!</li>

            <li>Kaeng Raeng Afterglow serum is amazing.</li>
            <li>Afterglow is amazing.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and, like all of KR&#x27;s products, is cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>But man, when I wake up in the morning it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it every night and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice, silky texture and leaves your skin feeling nourished.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on nicely with it.  </li>
            <li>I put this on for 30 minutes after taking off all makeup, etc, and then wipe it off with a warm facecloth before sleep.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice, lavender scent (not perfumey, but a natural lavender) that is perfect right before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, but my boyfriend really liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I bought the after glow along with the mask and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>The after glow is the perfect match to go with the facial mask.</li>
            <li>This makes skin feel so lovely.</li>
            <li>My skin feels a lot smoother, more plump and moisturized after two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Korres for years and it was perfect for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizing, My skin feels very soft after using.</li>
            <li>Love this serum, love the smell of it too with all the essential oils, leaves skin very smooth and silky!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what additional uses I can find for this serum, and I love how Kaeng Raeng makes it easy to have a &amp;#34;one</li>
            <li>This comes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction of fine lines, but I do feel good about having a natural way to moisturize my face and neck.</li>
            <li>free</li>
            <li>I was provided a FREE sample of this product for testing and evaluation purposes in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so gentle but effective.  </li>
            <li>I received this serum at no charge in return for my honest review, and so far I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the Kaeng Raeng cleanse products (well, &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; is a strong word when it comes to detoxing your body, haha,</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t completely in love</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have found results most beneficial when I press the serum gently into my skin (rather than rubbing it in).  </li>
            <li>I previously used pure argan oil and lavender to help when my skin needed calming, and this mixture seems to have the perfect balance all in one place.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I think it&#x27;s a great product and does what it says...</li>
            <li>Kaeng Raeng is very consistent with the quality of there products.</li>
            <li>but it happens when I&#x27;m excited about a product--or productS in this case!), and I was VERY excited to receive the After Glow Moisturizing Facial Serum.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is vegan, organic and all natural.  </li>
            <li>There are probably a TON more uses, so I&#x27;m excited to keep this product in my cabinet, and an extra in my travel bag!</li>
            <li>Not sure what to expect when I bought this for my girlfriend but the reaction I got was great.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin feel so soft and look so good the next day!</li>
            <li>It was also very light on the skin and absorbed well (which apparently not all serums do so</li>
            <li>Thanks KR!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the essential oils (lavender is probably the most prominent top note, and then the grapeseed...not an overpowering smell at all, very comforting and relaxing!), and, remember, A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY!  </li>
            <li>Fabulous combination for my mature skin.</li>
            <li>No weird smell and does not give me acne</li>
            <li>I also feel like it&#x27;s  a bit too scented -- more than I like in a facial</li>
            <li>The serum has this amazing smell and such a soft, silky texture.  </li>
            <li>It is not as greasy as some other oils I&#x27;ve tried (e.g. Antipodes), absorbing nicely in to my skin rather than sitting on the surface.</li>
            <li>Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s facial serum smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>and it has balanced out dry patches on my cheeks and made my skin softer and more glowing without breaking me out.</li>
            <li>The winter makes my skin so dry that it gets itchy and flakes, and on top of that</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, so some moisturizers (yes, even the dermatologist recommended ones) make my skin sting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for other serums that were not even half as effective as Afterglow.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get too much.</li>
            <li>(Or if you want to keep the husband at bay).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s done wonders to my skin and helps heal blemishes much faster than leaving my face to heal itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before I babble on too much,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as much because of the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying all of my girlfriends the whole array of Kaeng Raeng face and body products for the holidays as gifts.  </li>
            <li>It really promotes relaxation and calmness.  </li>
            <li>My skin, for reference, is dry with some fine lines and wrinkles, and I struggle for my skin to retain moisture throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>The all natural oils were quickly absorbed leaving my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent of the oil blend, but I can understand why some might be turned off by it, especially if you are sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used anything like them, and highly recommend them to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable for and all natural, organic products.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; for more than a few minutes after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>I first was interested in it due to the high quality of Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>It seriously makes your skin RADIATE with it&#x27;s own beauty.</li>
            <li>Afterglow is 100% high quality natural ingredients -no</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft!</li>
            <li>(Random, I know, but as my daughter gets older she&#x27;s already getting the &amp;#34;ew don&#x27;t kiss me in public&amp;#34;, and I really cherish being able to rub the serum and oils on her face!  </li>
            <li>on my fingertips, then one drop of essential oil, rub together, and I&#x27;m able to apply the stronger essential oils directly to my daughter&#x27;s neck, back, chest, and face...</li>
            <li>The mixture of all the natural oils (I love the blend of argan, grapeseed, rosehip and other oils) is a surprisingly light consistency - not too heavy at all, and absorbs pretty easily without the heavy, greasy feeling of other oils.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin</li>
            <li>It is the consistency of olive oil, giving me a young glow, without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>I never thought a spray could make my skin feel soft and moisturized the way that the KR</li>
            <li>I apply at night, because the serum is thick and if worn overnight you&#x27;ll get the most benefit from it.</li>
            <li>Between the charcoal mask which helps make my pores smaller and the serum which helps moisturize my skin and makes it SO soft, I&#x27;m a new girl.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets dry in the winter and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I will no longer be investing in all the different oils and instead buy only this one (at $20 a bottle, you really end up saving a lot over purchasing everything separately).</li>
            <li>the three specific uses I have found for this serum so far are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Kaeng Raeng Afterglow serum is amazing. I first was interested in it due to the high quality of Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s products. When I read it was vegan and chemical free I ordered it. Afterglow is amazing. My skin gets dry in the winter and it is very moisturizing. It also smells great. I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for other serums that were not even half as effective as Afterglow. My skin looks so good. Kaeng Raeng is very consistent with the quality of there products. I will be getting more!</li>
            <li> I bought the after glow along with the mask and I am so glad I did. It&#x27;s got a nice, silky texture and leaves your skin feeling nourished. I have been very happy with all of Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> Hate the smell.  Way to greasy!</li>
            <li> Love this serum, love the smell of it too with all the essential oils, leaves skin very smooth and silky!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Kaeng Raeng After Glow serum for the last month and I&#x27;ve been really impressed. I noticed my skin has improved significantly. I have sensitive, combination skin and it has balanced out dry patches on my cheeks and made my skin softer and more glowing without breaking me out. It is not as greasy as some other oils I&#x27;ve tried (e.g. Antipodes), absorbing nicely in to my skin rather than sitting on the surface. It&#x27;s recommended for night-time use, but I&#x27;ve also used this in the mornings occasionally, and find it sits well under liquid foundation if you allow a few moments for it to settle.</li>
            <li> The after glow is the perfect match to go with the facial mask. It seriously makes your skin RADIATE with it&#x27;s own beauty. Like all the gorgeous energy is brought to the surface. These products are immeasurable. I&#x27;ve never used anything like them, and highly recommend them to anyone and everyone. Even guys! Thanks KR!</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t completely in love BUT then by day 3 I could see a difference. I have very sensitive skin, and had previously used another company&#x27;s product that broke me out and irritated my skin. I firmly believe this helped heal and brighten my skin. It gives you a glowing/luminous effect. It also made my skin feel smoother and softer. Part of the appeal for me is that I can recognize and pronounce.</li>
            <li> This product is actually multi-functional. I have very coarse thick hair and we had gone out of town for the weekend and I forgot my Moroccan Oil. I was able to use this in a pinch! I found that on my face if is very good on my cheeks but I have to be careful with my T-Zone and use a half pump.</li>
            <li> Had to write in and give my kudos for this product.  Having tried Bobbi Brown&#x27;s, Shiseido&#x27;s, and La Mer&#x27;s Moisturizing Serums (to name only a few), I have found a keeper--for far less the cost!  My skin, for reference, is dry with some fine lines and wrinkles, and I struggle for my skin to retain moisture throughout the day.  By one or two o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, it gets dry and what I call &amp;#34;craggly&amp;#34;.  Not the case when I use After Glow though-- my skin retains its moisture throughout the day and looks hydrated and refreshed!  I have found results most beneficial when I press the serum gently into my skin (rather than rubbing it in).  The scent is amazing and, like all of KR&#x27;s products, is cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> This is an impressive serum - if you don&#x27;t mind the scent of the frankincense... it&#x27;s packed with multiple essential oils: Grapeseed (moisture control), Jojoba (moisturizing and anti-fungal), Rosehip (moisturizes dry skin, anti-aging), Argan (acne control, moisturizing dry flaky skin, healing burns), Lavender (aromatherapy, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-bacterial), Neroli (acne, skin regeneration), Frankincense (speeds healing of acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot- so be cautious when pumping it out so you don&#x27;t get too much. I apply at night, because the serum is thick and if worn overnight you&#x27;ll get the most benefit from it. (Or if you want to keep the husband at bay).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s done wonders to my skin and helps heal blemishes much faster than leaving my face to heal itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Disclaimer: I was provided a FREE sample of this product for testing and evaluation purposes in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect when I bought this for my girlfriend but the reaction I got was great.  Her and my first impression was that it smelled wonderful!  It was also very light on the skin and absorbed well (which apparently not all serums do so she tells me). It was a big bonus that it was both organic and vegan.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Kaeng Raeng cleanse products (well, &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; is a strong word when it comes to detoxing your body, haha, but, if you&#x27;re going to do it, you MUST give the Kaeng Raeng cleanse a try...sorry, I digress, but it happens when I&#x27;m excited about a product--or productS in this case!), and I was VERY excited to receive the After Glow Moisturizing Facial Serum.  This is my &amp;#34;year of 40&amp;#34;, and my body...and skin...are definitely showing it!  Before I babble on too much, the three specific uses I have found for this serum so far are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  Carrier Oil--I have begun using essential oils because my 7 yo daughter&#x27;s allergies are SO bad.  Some of these oils (like peppermint and oregano) are too harsh for her young skin, so they require a &amp;#34;carrier oil&amp;#34; to apply the product topically.  I use TWO PUMPS (a LITTLE of this stuff goes a LONG way!) on my fingertips, then one drop of essential oil, rub together, and I&#x27;m able to apply the stronger essential oils directly to my daughter&#x27;s neck, back, chest, and face...even around the temples and forehead...without the stinging and burning associated with these stronger oils on younger skin.  (Random, I know, but as my daughter gets older she&#x27;s already getting the &amp;#34;ew don&#x27;t kiss me in public&amp;#34;, and I really cherish being able to rub the serum and oils on her face!  I know that all too soon she&#x27;ll be grown and gone...and maybe she&#x27;ll remember this time when I&#x27;m 80 and in the nursing home and she can use the After Glow Serum on ME!!)&lt;br /&gt;2.)  Beard Oil--(not mine!  but I AM turning 40 this year...we&#x27;ll see!)  So my husband commented how great my skin was looking, and he has sebhorric dermatitis...AND a beard!  Great combo!  I had him test a drop of the serum to his face in different spots on different nights, and he LOVES it!  He&#x27;s stolen my serum for his beard oil!  It&#x27;s helped with the dry, flaky skin he has, and it&#x27;s DEFINITELY cut down on the itching associated with growing the beard.  Added bonus, it helps tame, soften, and improve the appearance of his beard as well as his skin around and underneath.  He&#x27;s sexy anyway, but the serum has been a welcome addition to smoothing and grooming of his beard.&lt;br /&gt;3.)  Microneedling soother--I bought a microneedle set, and, although I&#x27;m inconsistent with how often I use it, I ALWAYS follow up with the After Glow Moisturizing Facial Serum!!  I absolutely LOVE the essential oils (lavender is probably the most prominent top note, and then the grapeseed...not an overpowering smell at all, very comforting and relaxing!), and, remember, A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY!  One to two pumps MAX for me at night, and my skin is getting that &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34; back that I was rapidly losing.  I have also stopped getting my &amp;#34;once a month pimple appearance&amp;#34; (usually 2-4 pimples per cycle).  I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s all because of the serum, but maybe it&#x27;s because of the healthier lifestyle Kaeng Raeng encourages with ALL of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is DEFINITELY an investment, especially since all three members of my household are using it almost daily...if not daily!  I&#x27;m excited to see what additional uses I can find for this serum, and I love how Kaeng Raeng makes it easy to have a &amp;#34;one stop shop&amp;#34; for a healthier you...inside AND out!  Can&#x27;t stress this enough, but do just use a little each time.  I have oily skin, so I never use this in the a.m. (unless it&#x27;s an at home stay inside day), but I WILL try to incorporate a LITTLE bit into my a.m. routine.  I&#x27;m also going to try experimenting by adding other essential oils in the serum to focus on old acne scars and stretch marks!  There are probably a TON more uses, so I&#x27;m excited to keep this product in my cabinet, and an extra in my travel bag!</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizing, My skin feels very soft after using. I just don&#x27;t care for the smell. I haven&#x27;t used it as much because of the smell. Other than that I think it&#x27;s a great product and does what it says...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a duo with the cleansing clay mask. Fabulous combination for my mature skin. The all natural oils were quickly absorbed leaving my skin so soft. Having had skin cancer previously removed I am extremely picky about what I use on my face. Afterglow is 100% high quality natural ingredients -no cheapy products to dilute the quality.</li>
            <li> Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s facial serum smells clean and fresh.  It goes on smooth and soaks in quickly.  I love that it is vegan, organic and all natural.  I don&#x27;t like putting chemicals in my body or on my skin so this product is great for me.  The price is also reasonable for and all natural, organic products.  If you are reading this review, I think you should try it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Kaeng Raeng After Glow serum and the Charcoal Mud Mask together.  Boy, are they great.  The serum has this amazing smell and such a soft, silky texture.  It glides onto my skin, but doesn&#x27;t make it feel sticky like other serums I&#x27;ve tried.  I still like to use it at night because it makes my skin just a little shiny.  But man, when I wake up in the morning it&#x27;s amazing.  The winter makes my skin so dry that it gets itchy and flakes, and on top of that I have super sensitive skin, so some moisturizers (yes, even the dermatologist recommended ones) make my skin sting.  This stuff is so gentle but effective.  I&#x27;ve started using it every night and the difference is amazing.  Between the charcoal mask which helps make my pores smaller and the serum which helps moisturize my skin and makes it SO soft, I&#x27;m a new girl.  I&#x27;m buying all of my girlfriends the whole array of Kaeng Raeng face and body products for the holidays as gifts.  Heck, it&#x27;s a crime not to share something that works this well!</li>
            <li> This makes skin feel so lovely. I use it before bed so I don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; for more than a few minutes after I wash my face. It smells pretty good, but my boyfriend really liked the smell. My skin feels soft!</li>
            <li> I am predisposed to oily skin, but having oily skin doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean well-moisturized skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and only at night because it does make my face shiny.  After I leave this on overnight, my skin still is hydrated and refreshed when I wake.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction of fine lines, but I do feel good about having a natural way to moisturize my face and neck. I enjoy the scent of the oil blend, but I can understand why some might be turned off by it, especially if you are sensitive to smells. I plan to continue to use this as my nightly moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Kaeng Raeng products, specifically their cleanses, for over a year so I do trust the brand. I received this serum at no charge in return for my honest review, and so far I love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  I am in my 40&#x27;s and am often told I look like I&#x27;m 30.  I&#x27;ve used Korres for years and it was perfect for a long time.  my skin is changing and getting dryer, with a dull look to it.  I tried this and will not go back!  It is the consistency of olive oil, giving me a young glow, without being greasy.  My makeup goes on nicely with it.  It lasts for hours.  No weird smell and does not give me acne (I have sensitive skin).  AND it is cheaper?!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I received this product almost to weeks ago and wanted to get a good amount of use in before I reviewed it.  I noticed the scent as soon as I opened the product and used it for the first time - it is so dreamy and wonderful!  It is a very nice, lavender scent (not perfumey, but a natural lavender) that is perfect right before bedtime.  It really promotes relaxation and calmness.  The mixture of all the natural oils (I love the blend of argan, grapeseed, rosehip and other oils) is a surprisingly light consistency - not too heavy at all, and absorbs pretty easily without the heavy, greasy feeling of other oils.  I previously used pure argan oil and lavender to help when my skin needed calming, and this mixture seems to have the perfect balance all in one place.  I will no longer be investing in all the different oils and instead buy only this one (at $20 a bottle, you really end up saving a lot over purchasing everything separately). My skin feels a lot smoother, more plump and moisturized after two weeks.  I will definitely be using this oil from now on!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received this product courtesy of Kaeng Raeng, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing. I usually hate oils and slick things on my face in general, but this made my skin so incredibly soft the next morning that I&#x27;m still using it a week later. I put this on for 30 minutes after taking off all makeup, etc, and then wipe it off with a warm facecloth before sleep. This comes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It made my skin feel so soft and look so good the next day!</li>
            <li> I never thought a spray could make my skin feel soft and moisturized the way that the KR After Glow does.  It&#x27;s an excellent product.  Smells great, feels great and is outstanding great!</li>
            <li> I bought this face serum to go along with the Kaeng mask.  It is wonderful! Together they make a perfect combination for detoxing my skin.</li>
            <li> While I do like this moisturizing serum, I find it a bit too oily for my skin. I also feel like it&#x27;s  a bit too scented -- more than I like in a facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It is  quality product, just not right for me...</li>
