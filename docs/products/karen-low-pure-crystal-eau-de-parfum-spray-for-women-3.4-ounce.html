            <li>My wife bought this, and as others have said we bought at a mall for more than 4 times the price some time ago.</li>

            <li>I love the scent, I bought this at the mall and it was three times the price,</li>
            <li>Top quality</li>
            <li>Super satisfied!</li>
            <li>it has a very sweet but not overbearing scent.  </li>
            <li>Bought a bottle of this for my girlfriend and its the best money spent.</li>
            <li>The perfume is feminine while strong.</li>
            <li>I love Pure Crystal!!</li>
            <li>I had this perfume before, and when it arrived, i must say it was perfectly packaged, brand new box and clear wrap, even a sticky of original guarantee.</li>
            <li>I had bought a bottle of this last year with a great scent.</li>
            <li>The pink-tinted perfume is perfectly showcased in the square, heavy glass perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>Cheap price.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li>And I was even more excited that the price was just right on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so i dont know if this is even an original.....</li>
            <li>My favorite scent---very clean and fresh smelling and at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I find myself re-applying midday just because I enjoy the scent so much.</li>
            <li>The girl loves it second bottle much cheaper than stores good to go will</li>
            <li>I have another Karen Low perfume called Pink, but I love this smell more which smells pretty much like Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li>I was waiting for the right time to buy.</li>
            <li>Its long lasting and smells just like bright crystal!</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it smells almost identical to the bright crystal, it has a light floral scent that last a long time and come in a large bottle ,it shipped super fast and was totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Karen Low because I never heard of it, to my surprise, i love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Im very desapointed!</li>
            <li>First time I bought it at the mall for almost 50.00 dlls.</li>
            <li>I plan on getting ALL that Karen Low has available for women!</li>
            <li>Aside from that, Pure Crystal is a lovely and feminine fragrance that&#x27;s light, fresh, floral and slightly fruity.</li>
            <li>everything seemed fine, except when i went to spray it, for some reason it seemed to have much more alcohol in it and does not even last that long.</li>
            <li>I have pure ice too</li>
            <li>I like pure pink better</li>
            <li>I wear it everywhere in my daily life and to important events.</li>
            <li>Very girly and feminine.  </li>
            <li>it is for real, i purchased it for my sister and she like it</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this perfume at a \\&quot;discount\\&quot; outlet and unknowingly paid the full retail price (twice as much as I would have paid through Amazon.com).</li>
            <li>I bought it blindly and am more than pleased.  </li>
            <li>she went out and bought same product at local perfume shop and was was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Got this for a gift and it does smell good a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Really soft fragance.</li>
            <li>Rather than being a heavy fragrance, you have to sniff the skin where it was sprayed to really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance, seems to last thru the day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to those fakes you buy at the dollar store that are supposed to smell like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>it is a good product and it wasn&#x27;t fake at all...</li>
            <li>My husband had purchased pure pink for me n</li>
            <li>Im soooooooo glad he now had me addicted to the *pure*fragrences</li>
            <li>This is my first Karen Low fragrance; I&#x27;m looking forward to trying her other scents.</li>

            <li> This is my first Karen Low fragrance; I&#x27;m looking forward to trying her other scents.</li>
            <li> Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have enough fixative and it won&#x27;t retain the scent for too long.  </li>
            <li> the scent didn&#x27;t last long either.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting , femenine and afforable.</li>
            <li> Last LONG!</li>
            <li> It is watered down and the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I would have rather paid the full price if I would have known it was a fake.</li>
            <li> Wrong, while it smells like the original, it lasts but a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Only a few sprays required!</li>
            <li> I wear it every other day and get a bunch of compliments</li>
            <li> Im looking forward to the other scents</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell watered down to me and the packaging looked legit (just like the Pink one I bought at the store a couple years ago)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was a fake I got from amazon, because pure crystal I got from the mall</li>
            <li> Sadly we will be looking elsewhere for the real product.</li>
            <li> All the pricing out there is at least double to what I paid for on amazon.</li>
            <li> however it dissipates in a half hour.</li>
            <li> It is a mess because it spills even after I spray it</li>
            <li> unfortunately the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long, bit</li>
            <li> my wife was not satisfied with product, no fragrance, seemed like it was watered down.</li>
            <li> Too bad for the scent is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Jean</li>
            <li> The scent is rather subtle.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for a few minutes of wear.</li>
            <li> This is obviously a knock-off and I was so disappointed when I received it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>

            <li> Great scent.  LOVE IT111  Am on my second bottle in four months.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and it&#x27;s a really good size</li>
            <li> I had bought a bottle of this last year with a great scent. This bottle does not have the same strength or scent. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Love the smell! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The perfume is great. I bought it several times. fragant is awesome!  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have enough fixative and it won&#x27;t retain the scent for too long.  But that&#x27;s is just the way they made the perfume in France.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this perfume at a \\&quot;discount\\&quot; outlet and unknowingly paid the full retail price (twice as much as I would have paid through Amazon.com). Aside from that, Pure Crystal is a lovely and feminine fragrance that&#x27;s light, fresh, floral and slightly fruity. Perfect for summertime! The scent is rather subtle. Rather than being a heavy fragrance, you have to sniff the skin where it was sprayed to really enjoy it. I find myself re-applying midday just because I enjoy the scent so much. The pink-tinted perfume is perfectly showcased in the square, heavy glass perfume bottle. This is my first Karen Low fragrance; I&#x27;m looking forward to trying her other scents.</li>

            <li> Bought a bottle of this for my girlfriend and its the best money spent. The scent is amazing!!!!!!!!!, The scent is lasting an arousing. Gud stuff</li>
            <li> Recived it just in time in great conditions and the packeging is great!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend everyone to purchase this product , it smells great, it has that feminene touch and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Smells great, kinda floral but not too much.  I bought it blindly and am more than pleased.  Great product for any woman!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  Between the price that amazed my wife and having it shipped to the door what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> This perfume smells awesome! I get compliments every time I wear it...it has a very sweet but not overbearing scent.  I would purchase it again :)</li>
            <li> It smells Delicious but it has problems when you spray it! It is a mess because it spills even after I spray it Im very desapointed!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is perfect for the summer time, it&#x27;s lights and floral. I wear it everywhere in my daily life and to important events.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance, seems to last thru the day okay.  Very girly and feminine.  I like that it is present but not too overpowering.  Have already repurchased as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and the price is perfect.  I use to pay double the amount for one.  Will continue to purchase thru here!!</li>
            <li> I went to my local perfume store to ask for a perfume that smelled like jasmine and this is what they showed me. So I went on amazon to compare prices and I found it cheaper. The end. Had to buy it cause it smells soooo good!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and we both love it! She has the $80 smells but this 1 is way better.</li>
            <li> I like pure pink better but this smells ok</li>
            <li> Many compliments when I wear this scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent---very clean and fresh smelling and at a very reasonable price.  The identical spray is sold for 4X the price at a nearby Outlet Shopping Mall  .</li>
            <li> My wife bought this, and as others have said we bought at a mall for more than 4 times the price some time ago. She wore this fragrance for our wedding so it has some meaning to her. I assumed that the price was so low because it had lost popularity or something.  Wrong, while it smells like the original, it lasts but a few minutes.  More alcohol and &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; than anything. It&#x27;s similar to those fakes you buy at the dollar store that are supposed to smell like the real thing.  Sadly we will be looking elsewhere for the real product.</li>
            <li> I had this perfume before, and when it arrived, i must say it was perfectly packaged, brand new box and clear wrap, even a sticky of original guarantee. everything seemed fine, except when i went to spray it, for some reason it seemed to have much more alcohol in it and does not even last that long. as soon as i spray it, it vanishes within minutes. so i dont know if this is even an original..... if its copied, it was a really good copy cause everything is  perfect form the appearance.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this feminine scent!</li>
            <li> I love the scent, I bought this at the mall and it was three times the price, unfortunately the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long, bit I don&#x27;t think it was a fake I got from amazon, because pure crystal I got from the mall the scent didn&#x27;t last long either.  It arrived very quickly and because the price was so good I ordered two so one for my car or purse and one for home so I can refresh the scent, just kinda big for purse so I guess I will put In car.</li>
            <li> Long lasting , femenine and afforable. Keep buying back. First time I bought it at the mall for almost 50.00 dlls. Top quality</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Its long lasting and smells just like bright crystal! Plus its way affordable. Definently purchase this perfume! I have pure ice too n that&#x27;s also great smelling, I always get compliments .</li>
            <li> Smells really good! Would order again! Last LONG! Only a few sprays required! Cheap price. Would tell others about this product!</li>
            <li> my wife was not satisfied with product, no fragrance, seemed like it was watered down. she went out and bought same product at local perfume shop and was was satisfied with it. this is second time this has happened and will not buy perfume on line again. could not return it because no longer have the box.</li>
            <li> I love Pure Crystal!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent however it dissipates in a half hour. What&#x27;s the point of wearing as a perfume? Too expensive for a few minutes of wear. I will never buy again for these reasons. Too bad for the scent is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Jean in Colorado</li>
            <li> This is obviously a knock-off and I was so disappointed when I received it. It is watered down and the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long. I would have rather paid the full price if I would have known it was a fake.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume! I wear it every other day and get a bunch of compliments</li>
            <li> So someone tried selling me this at one of those perfume counters at the mall...for a DISCOUNT of $50 when I tried buying the Bright Crystal by Versace. Thank god I didn&#x27;t end up getting ripped off there. I have another Karen Low perfume called Pink, but I love this smell more which smells pretty much like Bright Crystal. This doesn&#x27;t smell watered down to me and the packaging looked legit (just like the Pink one I bought at the store a couple years ago) And I was even more excited that the price was just right on Amazon. Super satisfied!</li>
            <li> Got this for a gift and it does smell good a little goes a long way. Im looking forward to the other scents</li>
            <li> it is a good product and it wasn&#x27;t fake at all...it is for real, i purchased it for my sister and she like it</li>
            <li> This smells sooooo good. I love it!</li>
            <li> Smells as AMAZING as the bottle looks....I plan on getting ALL that Karen Low has available for women! My fiance has ALL the colognes for men and he loves them...Im soooooooo glad he now had me addicted to the *pure*fragrences</li>
            <li> Everything was right and excellent product. Thank you for all, i am very happy for this buy. Keep on that way</li>
            <li> I was waiting for the right time to buy. All the pricing out there is at least double to what I paid for on amazon. The perfume is feminine while strong. The type of perfume that men will be constantly thinking of you because of this perfume. Definitly my favorite!</li>
            <li> The girl loves it second bottle much cheaper than stores good to go will</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and it&#x27;s very light.  Perfect for everyday.</li>
