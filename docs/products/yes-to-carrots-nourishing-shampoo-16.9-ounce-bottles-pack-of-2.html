    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Otherwise, continue your search for the perfect hair conditioner elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Wonderful mourishing, moisturizing and detangling properties&lt;</li>
            <li>the smell isnt the best.</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome &amp; the detangling properties work well with my type of hair.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious, won&#x27;t harm your color job or brazillian blowout, and improves the texture and appearance of your hair!  </li>

            <li>I use this as a leave in conditioner along with some gel to produce perfect curls.  </li>

            <li>I find this conditioner to be very effective.  </li>

            <li>me tell you, i am in love!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love that this is non-toxic and it works!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>i am happy that it is crulety free and uses organi ingredients.</li>
            <li>(Honeysuckle Rose &amp; GPB Protein) ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and creamy</li>
            <li>A total win for a great price!</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Then I tried their Moisturizing Day Cream which I loved better than any others I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>
            <li>liked the way my hair felt as I applied &amp; massaged.  </li>
            <li>believe products like \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; are for transitioning sulfate product users who may or may not understand what creates beautiful hair, but are easily swayed by products that seem environmentally sound and give good results.</li>
            <li>This is a great price for a product that is free of many of the harmful chemicals in today&#x27;s conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Still feels clean, smells great, AND sulfate free!</li>
            <li>I became acquainted with the \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; brand when as a Amazon Vine member, I chose to receive their Body Butter which I really liked.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>It feels very cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take note.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, too (not to strong)</li>
            <li>favorite conditioners are from Yes-to-Carrots (Yes-to-Carrots &amp; Yes-to-Cucumber) and Aubrey Organics</li>
            <li>I LOVE the effect on my hair it makes.</li>
            <li>Now I like the smell and LOVE IT all the more!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I have to take off the top just to get the product out.</li>
            <li>a try :).</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>One suggestion is that they ditch the plastic cap on top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Yes to Carrots Shampoo and Conditioner are my favorite</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>(so far-going for more products from this line).</li>
            <li>I have found this product to be one of the most pampering hair products on the market, and will continue to purchase and use it.</li>
            <li>Favorite line of hair stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times since purchasing and absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>been using the Pampering shampoo and love it too.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, reasonably priced, does the trick</li>
            <li>To put it simply-I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will try one more time and see how it works otherwise</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair more manageable and shiny</li>
            <li>This product contains more glycerol and tends to make my hair a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I use this product to cowash and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>I like Herbal Essence Hello Hydration much, much better.</li>
            <li>my hair is smooth and the tangles are gone!</li>
            <li>Son wishes it smelled more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but it does the job of his itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I feel like they really cheapened a great product</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably give it one more try, but I&#x27;m kinda nervous about that.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, manageable, static free, tangle free and smells awesome!</li>
            <li>good price and good basic results.</li>
            <li>This natural conditioner is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>My hair went from light and shining healthy looking hair to basically straw.</li>
            <li>And you have to give them a fair shot of about a month before you can really review them.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used this product with the Nourishing Carrot Shampoo, I fell in love!</li>
            <li>it smells great, leaves my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but with this order I noticed sweet almond oil has been added.</li>
            <li>And like that, all of my hair happiness was gone, new look</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it is great for dry hair which they both have.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Redkin products a while and decided to try Yes To Carrots while trying to find a paraben free soap for my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells great and if you&#x27;re like me and wash/condition your hair only 1 or 2 times a week it lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li>I have never been more satisfied and saved so much money.</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>and it said it was over 99% natural and good for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Detangling was pretty easy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this product for the price, and will be purchasing a bottle for my boyfriend to test out, as he attempts to grow his hair for winter.</li>
            <li>I saw it at Target for 7.99 and was really pondering if I should buy it, then I went to ROSS and they had it for 3.99!!!</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair very soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>Rich ...</li>
            <li>But it has a unique smell</li>
            <li>product is super cheap, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>i use this after i clean my hair with the carrot shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it best for dry and normal hair types.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly, tangly hair, and this conditioner somehow leaves my hair smooth and is much easier to comb through after a shower!  </li>
            <li>It has a good clean smell and definitely hydrates my hair.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing with a light, clean scent!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice finish to my hair routine but to be honest, it&#x27;s just an average conditioner.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a girl who wants to care more about the products she uses</li>
            <li>This conditioner helps keep my very curly hair moisturize and healthy.</li>
            <li>such a good buy.</li>
            <li>Not only is it good for you</li>
            <li>It left a light scent and my hair feels lighter and much more healthy.</li>
            <li>I used it one more time (just to see if it was really the conditioner) and the reaction reoccurred.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The conditioner is light so as not to weigh your hair down, but very effectively conditions.  </li>
            <li>If I can continue to find these products I will be a loyal user.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I decided to try it because I am in search of a great natural conditioner for my natural kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Unless you have super sensitized nostrils or allergies, it shouldn&#x27;t bother you.</li>
            <li>Yes to Carrots is not only paraban free and pretty much oraganic, it has a great scent.</li>
            <li>What has impressed me the most though is that when I use it, leave it on for a few minutes (3 min or less) and when I brush it through with a comb in the shower (what most curly hair people do)</li>
            <li>I am trying to switch to more natural products overall and was having an issue finding a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It felt like my dried out wavy hair had become silky and beautiful overnight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to struggle with my hair and damaging it more because its somehow super soft and detangled for me!</li>
            <li>While the hair mud conditioner is full of good stuff like sweet potato and carrot (which the other conditioner *</li>
            <li>Smells so good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair clean, light, not weighted down and with nice curls.</li>
            <li>but I love this conditioner &amp; it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I really didnt like the smell, but with natural products i really havent  found a good smelling product that works.</li>
            <li>I recently learned about PH balance, and aloe vera on hair via youtube, and have since made my own products, and let me tell you, they nourish the heck out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and with more volume.</li>
            <li>So this product received rave reviews by many in and out if the natural hair community.</li>
            <li>This conditioner keeps it soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>As with the new YTC shampoo, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be throwing this out, too.</li>
            <li>I also use it sometimes right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two years now and buy it from amazon because the price is always right.</li>
            <li>i am super glad i got this and will get it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good conditioner that does not strip my hair and a product where i am not using half the container on my hair during one wash.</li>
            <li>One would be surprised how easily they could make a product that worked just as well,</li>
            <li>and I love that both products are natural and really work.</li>
            <li>I did like how while co-washing my hair it provided me great &amp;#34;slip factor&amp;#34; although I detangled and deep conditioned prior or co-washing with JBCO.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite natural hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>What caught my eye about this conditioner is that the label said it was great for hair AND scalp, plus I&#x27;d been searching for a conditioner made with natural ingredients since all the conventional conditioners [loaded with chemicals] make my hair and scalp worse.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>However, if you can tolerate this smell, then you&#x27;ll likely enjoy the product!</li>
            <li>thanks, ceterayl alcohol! :</li>
            <li>and now i am going back to find as many bottles as I can.</li>
            <li>When I first crossed this line I was immediately moved by their diverse but easy-to-understand line.</li>
            <li>then this line can, at first, seem like a God-send, but here&#x27;s the deal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off, I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li>I am an avid Yes to Carrots product user and the product advertised here and in the picture, the \\&quot;Pampering Mud</li>
            <li>Tried Yes to Carrots Conditioner for the first time today after anticipating my purchase for awhile.</li>
            <li>It smells of a lighter scented version of baby powder/lotion upon first opening the bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner after hearing so many recommendations on different hair care blogs, and I must say that it&#x27;s excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>conditioner is thick and creamy and has great slip to use for detangling.</li>
            <li>I subscribe and save to this item, that&#x27;s how devoted I am to it, but consistently, the bottle top is defective, and you can&#x27;t pop it open and squeeze out the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few natural and organic conditioners and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This product worked pretty well at conditioning my hair...</li>
            <li>First of all I have tried almost all the &amp;#34;organic/natural&amp;#34; brands on the market.</li>
            <li>Pricing is right for the amount of product ... plus the product is so very rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my hair clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>This conditoner works just as good as any of the more expensive salon brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to purchasing really crappy sulfate and paraben riddled products, then the \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; product line is most definitely a step up.</li>
            <li>hair is 4b/c, extremely course and tightly coiled - this conditioner is great at keeping the kinks under wraps!</li>
            <li>, I love everything about this conditioner: the smell [a light, baby powderish scent], the texture [thick, yet light and mousse-like] and the results [soft, managable, shiny hair].</li>
            <li>Unless you use a ridiculously large amount of it, your hair will be tangled when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Carrots\\&quot; products have very high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The formula and scent have changed since I purchased this from Whole Foods some time ago.  </li>
            <li>* The real &#x27;Pampering Hair Mud Conditioner&#x27; has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>- kinda negates the whole idea of a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li>Again, anything with alcohol will pretend to moisturize, but really provides no stability for hair cuticles.</li>
            <li>This is not all organic, it&#x27;s not entirely paraben free, and it has a ton of fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t moisturized very well, either.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company &amp; they confirmed the products recently went through a product transformation.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this company&#x27;s products to anyone!</li>
            <li>This hair conditioner left my hair ridiculously soft, shiny, and tamed my frizziness for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have fine, oily hair that always falls flat.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is more oily than &#x27;normal to dry&#x27; or maybe it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t used it for a week as another reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li>I felt right away that the new product felt less rich, less substantial than the shampoo and conditioner that I loved, the original conditioner was so thick it could not even move through the bottle to the opening the way it was designed, but that never stopped me from opening the lid and enjoying it&#x27;s creamy, enriching, wonderfulness.</li>
            <li>The price is soooo reasonable compared to other &#x27;natural&#x27; products in the market, and this product may be even better to the higher end products.</li>
            <li>While I know this might sound strange to some, for me it is a necessity.</li>
            <li>A couple K-Pak treatments later, my hair is strong again but super dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>With the understanding of my hairs ph balance, I feel more in control and less at the mercy of mass produced products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;  My only complaint is that the cap is a huge pain in the a$$ but other than that, there isn&#x27;t enough wonderful things I can say about this product.</li>
            <li>The texture of the conditioner is very nice (neither runny nor too heavy), and it leaves my hair silky, manageable, and full-bodied.  </li>
            <li>Packaging is high quality.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to use two or three times a week.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, highlighted hair that is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>my hair was soft as silk, and seemed so much thicker.</li>
            <li>and the price is right here versus a big store like Target.</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable for such a high quality hair product.  </li>
            <li>I had been using this product for close to a year before they switched the bottle to the new label, which reads &amp;#34;New</li>
            <li>Tho \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot;, tho a HUGE step above most crappy products, is still in itself a somewhat superficial quick-fix and not a true benefit to the hair shaft in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it was super dry and brittle looking.</li>
            <li>before buying products at these big named stores try to find them on clearance isles and discounted places because its all the same thing, but with a significantly diffrent price!!&lt;br /&gt;GOD BLESS,&lt;br /&gt;TRJ</li>
            <li>At first this product left my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>It has a light baby lotion type fragrance that is not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>Unlike most other conditioners that claim that they are nourishing ... yet they just make the hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; better by using unhealthy ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s fairly natural and has very little scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After waiting five minutes, I noticed that my curls were much more defined and moisturized than they were my previous wash, which involved deep conditioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would certainly recommend this conditioner as well as the others mentioned above.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t changed anything, not even shampoos technically, but the company that makes this certainly changed the product when they changed the label, and then chose to lie about it on the label.</li>
            <li>aveda is a great company that only uses plant products but they get expensive after a while.</li>
            <li>I always try to use all natural products on my skin.</li>
            <li>So far i&#x27;ve used this conditioner twice</li>
            <li>If I continue using it I will update my review but the real problem (because hair that is wavy with biolage but looks greasy and slept-on with this shampoo and conditioner can still be pulled back into a ponytail) is the smell.</li>
            <li>Supple and Soft feeling hair.</li>
            <li>Not harsh at all</li>
            <li>I use on a regular basis as a pre-conditioner (before I shampoo to moisturize, soften, detangle) and as a conditioner wash to soften and gently clense my hair.</li>
            <li>It is sort of natural.</li>
            <li>And it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>also both the shampoo and conditioner say on the site 99.4 or 99.8 natural however my bottles say 97% natural..</li>
            <li>By far.</li>
            <li>a 3b natural</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that is bleached and dyed in some parts and completely natural in others.</li>
            <li>This conditioner keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my kinky/coily hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no hair commercial, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I find that it conditions as well as non natural conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I shampooed by AA hair with a natural shampoo &amp; then topped it off with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, somewhat dry hair and my hair LOVES Yes to Carrots!  </li>
            <li>Or maybe they assume the person is ordering for the first time and doesn&#x27;t know that they&#x27;re getting the ol&#x27; bait and switch of getting a bad product under the good [old] product&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>its not a bad smell by any means, and the scent doesnt stay with your hair after its dried, but its definetly not a nice smell like you would get from Garnier Fructis.&lt;br /&gt;i love getting organic products</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have only found two brands of hair care that do not make me break out, and this is by far</li>
            <li>For reference, I have long and very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Yes to Carrots line is the only line of products I have found that my family has been able to use for any amount of time w/o having any negative reaction.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are actually readable, recognizable and REAL ... not full of ingredients that make me want to revisit chemistry class!  </li>
            <li>Please bring the old formula back!</li>
            <li>I suppose this is for preservation purposes, I don&#x27;t know, but after processing this product is a far cry from an actual nutritious carrot drink for your hair.</li>
            <li>and I am a male adult.  </li>
            <li>If you are the type of person who is prone to allergic reactions I would recommend trying any new product out at a local store to see if you have a reaction prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li>I feel \\&quot;Yes-to\\&quot;, like other products may be slightly working against your hairs natural components, but because its so divine in comparison to other products on the market, its hard to tell where it falls short, and until you try a product that is more natural and rich in nutrients you may never know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the third or forth use of this product, my hair is almost back to normal following a perm or coloring session with my hairstylist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I am giving this a 3/5 (besides the fact that I don&#x27;t like the smell of baby powder), is the fact that by the following day after using my hair was super greasy and felt just plain gross.</li>
            <li>know that other reviewers have said that they had an allergic reaction to some items in this product line, which is possible with any product to a certain percentage of people who try it.</li>
            <li>Having curly hair, I&#x27;m generally pretty slow to try new products, but after reading some reviews, I decided to give this a chance.</li>
            <li>even used the CRAZY expensive stuff by Wen that claims to be the absolute best.</li>
            <li>I found out about this product from Curlyniki.com where there are natural BLACK women, like me who are very sensitive to what we put in our hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner tames my wildly fickle colored curly dry hair.</li>
            <li>As far as the product goes, I have curly hair, often dry, often tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li>I am white and have long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I suppose it may be due to the high number of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Yes to Carrots shampoo and conditioner twice a week and the scalp and hair mud mask once a week usually makes my hair much more tame and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product before and this formula seems to be only 97% natural versus the previously bought 99% natural.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Otherwise, continue your search for the perfect hair conditioner elsewhere.</li>

            <li> The shampoo is great too.</li>
            <li> I was even getting compliments from my friends and family about how great my hair looked, to which I would immediately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i love this product!!</li>
            <li> I find this conditioner to be very effective.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Another pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> The price is good also.</li>
            <li> that yes - my beloved Hair Mud was being discontinued.  </li>
            <li> types\\&quot; kind of conditioner, this is a great one whether or not you require your products to be cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it, smells good imo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> smells good</li>
            <li> and I wish that I could still buy the product I loved.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s where the good thing ended.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Excellent product resulting in silky, healthy hair for me and my spouse, and not tested on animals (which is very important to me).</li>
            <li> item as described, quick delivery, excellent!</li>
            <li> Love Yes-to-Carrots conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> me tell you, i am in love!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love that this is non-toxic and it works!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> i am happy that it is crulety free and uses organi ingredients.</li>
            <li> (Honeysuckle Rose &amp; GPB Protein) ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and creamy</li>
            <li> A total win for a great price!</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> Then I tried their Moisturizing Day Cream which I loved better than any others I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell</li>
            <li> liked the way my hair felt as I applied &amp; massaged.  </li>
            <li> believe products like \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; are for transitioning sulfate product users who may or may not understand what creates beautiful hair, but are easily swayed by products that seem environmentally sound and give good results.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for a product that is free of many of the harmful chemicals in today&#x27;s conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Still feels clean, smells great, AND sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I became acquainted with the \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; brand when as a Amazon Vine member, I chose to receive their Body Butter which I really liked.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li> It smells good and leaves my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> It feels very cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take note.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, too (not to strong)</li>
            <li> favorite conditioners are from Yes-to-Carrots (Yes-to-Carrots &amp; Yes-to-Cucumber) and Aubrey Organics</li>
            <li> I LOVE the effect on my hair it makes.</li>
            <li> Now I like the smell and LOVE IT all the more!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I have to take off the top just to get the product out.</li>
            <li> a try :).</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> One suggestion is that they ditch the plastic cap on top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Yes to Carrots Shampoo and Conditioner are my favorite</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> (so far-going for more products from this line).</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be one of the most pampering hair products on the market, and will continue to purchase and use it.</li>
            <li> Favorite line of hair stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times since purchasing and absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> been using the Pampering shampoo and love it too.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, reasonably priced, does the trick</li>
            <li> To put it simply-I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will try one more time and see how it works otherwise</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair more manageable and shiny</li>
            <li> This product contains more glycerol and tends to make my hair a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to cowash and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> I like Herbal Essence Hello Hydration much, much better.</li>
            <li> my hair is smooth and the tangles are gone!</li>
            <li> Son wishes it smelled more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but it does the job of his itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I feel like they really cheapened a great product</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably give it one more try, but I&#x27;m kinda nervous about that.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, manageable, static free, tangle free and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> good price and good basic results.</li>
            <li> This natural conditioner is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> My hair went from light and shining healthy looking hair to basically straw.</li>
            <li> And you have to give them a fair shot of about a month before you can really review them.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this product with the Nourishing Carrot Shampoo, I fell in love!</li>
            <li> it smells great, leaves my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but with this order I noticed sweet almond oil has been added.</li>
            <li> And like that, all of my hair happiness was gone, new look</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is great for dry hair which they both have.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Redkin products a while and decided to try Yes To Carrots while trying to find a paraben free soap for my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells great and if you&#x27;re like me and wash/condition your hair only 1 or 2 times a week it lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li> I have never been more satisfied and saved so much money.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> and it said it was over 99% natural and good for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Detangling was pretty easy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this product for the price, and will be purchasing a bottle for my boyfriend to test out, as he attempts to grow his hair for winter.</li>
            <li> I saw it at Target for 7.99 and was really pondering if I should buy it, then I went to ROSS and they had it for 3.99!!!</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair very soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> Rich ...</li>
            <li> But it has a unique smell</li>
            <li> product is super cheap, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i use this after i clean my hair with the carrot shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it best for dry and normal hair types.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly, tangly hair, and this conditioner somehow leaves my hair smooth and is much easier to comb through after a shower!  </li>
            <li> It has a good clean smell and definitely hydrates my hair.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing with a light, clean scent!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice finish to my hair routine but to be honest, it&#x27;s just an average conditioner.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a girl who wants to care more about the products she uses</li>
            <li> This conditioner helps keep my very curly hair moisturize and healthy.</li>
            <li> such a good buy.</li>
            <li> Not only is it good for you</li>
            <li> It left a light scent and my hair feels lighter and much more healthy.</li>
            <li> I used it one more time (just to see if it was really the conditioner) and the reaction reoccurred.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The conditioner is light so as not to weigh your hair down, but very effectively conditions.  </li>
            <li> If I can continue to find these products I will be a loyal user.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I decided to try it because I am in search of a great natural conditioner for my natural kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Unless you have super sensitized nostrils or allergies, it shouldn&#x27;t bother you.</li>
            <li> Yes to Carrots is not only paraban free and pretty much oraganic, it has a great scent.</li>
            <li> What has impressed me the most though is that when I use it, leave it on for a few minutes (3 min or less) and when I brush it through with a comb in the shower (what most curly hair people do)</li>
            <li> I am trying to switch to more natural products overall and was having an issue finding a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It felt like my dried out wavy hair had become silky and beautiful overnight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to struggle with my hair and damaging it more because its somehow super soft and detangled for me!</li>
            <li> While the hair mud conditioner is full of good stuff like sweet potato and carrot (which the other conditioner *</li>
            <li> Smells so good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair clean, light, not weighted down and with nice curls.</li>
            <li> but I love this conditioner &amp; it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I really didnt like the smell, but with natural products i really havent  found a good smelling product that works.</li>
            <li> I recently learned about PH balance, and aloe vera on hair via youtube, and have since made my own products, and let me tell you, they nourish the heck out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft and with more volume.</li>
            <li> So this product received rave reviews by many in and out if the natural hair community.</li>
            <li> This conditioner keeps it soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> As with the new YTC shampoo, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be throwing this out, too.</li>
            <li> I also use it sometimes right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two years now and buy it from amazon because the price is always right.</li>
            <li> i am super glad i got this and will get it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good conditioner that does not strip my hair and a product where i am not using half the container on my hair during one wash.</li>
            <li> One would be surprised how easily they could make a product that worked just as well,</li>
            <li> and I love that both products are natural and really work.</li>
            <li> I did like how while co-washing my hair it provided me great &amp;#34;slip factor&amp;#34; although I detangled and deep conditioned prior or co-washing with JBCO.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite natural hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> What caught my eye about this conditioner is that the label said it was great for hair AND scalp, plus I&#x27;d been searching for a conditioner made with natural ingredients since all the conventional conditioners [loaded with chemicals] make my hair and scalp worse.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> However, if you can tolerate this smell, then you&#x27;ll likely enjoy the product!</li>
            <li> thanks, ceterayl alcohol! :</li>
            <li> and now i am going back to find as many bottles as I can.</li>
            <li> When I first crossed this line I was immediately moved by their diverse but easy-to-understand line.</li>
            <li> then this line can, at first, seem like a God-send, but here&#x27;s the deal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li> I am an avid Yes to Carrots product user and the product advertised here and in the picture, the \\&quot;Pampering Mud</li>
            <li> Tried Yes to Carrots Conditioner for the first time today after anticipating my purchase for awhile.</li>
            <li> It smells of a lighter scented version of baby powder/lotion upon first opening the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner after hearing so many recommendations on different hair care blogs, and I must say that it&#x27;s excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> conditioner is thick and creamy and has great slip to use for detangling.</li>
            <li> I subscribe and save to this item, that&#x27;s how devoted I am to it, but consistently, the bottle top is defective, and you can&#x27;t pop it open and squeeze out the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few natural and organic conditioners and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This product worked pretty well at conditioning my hair...</li>
            <li> First of all I have tried almost all the &amp;#34;organic/natural&amp;#34; brands on the market.</li>
            <li> Pricing is right for the amount of product ... plus the product is so very rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my hair clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> This conditoner works just as good as any of the more expensive salon brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to purchasing really crappy sulfate and paraben riddled products, then the \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; product line is most definitely a step up.</li>
            <li> hair is 4b/c, extremely course and tightly coiled - this conditioner is great at keeping the kinks under wraps!</li>
            <li> , I love everything about this conditioner: the smell [a light, baby powderish scent], the texture [thick, yet light and mousse-like] and the results [soft, managable, shiny hair].</li>
            <li> Unless you use a ridiculously large amount of it, your hair will be tangled when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Carrots\\&quot; products have very high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The formula and scent have changed since I purchased this from Whole Foods some time ago.  </li>
            <li> * The real &#x27;Pampering Hair Mud Conditioner&#x27; has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> - kinda negates the whole idea of a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li> Again, anything with alcohol will pretend to moisturize, but really provides no stability for hair cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is not all organic, it&#x27;s not entirely paraben free, and it has a ton of fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t moisturized very well, either.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company &amp; they confirmed the products recently went through a product transformation.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this company&#x27;s products to anyone!</li>
            <li> This hair conditioner left my hair ridiculously soft, shiny, and tamed my frizziness for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have fine, oily hair that always falls flat.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is more oily than &#x27;normal to dry&#x27; or maybe it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t used it for a week as another reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li> I felt right away that the new product felt less rich, less substantial than the shampoo and conditioner that I loved, the original conditioner was so thick it could not even move through the bottle to the opening the way it was designed, but that never stopped me from opening the lid and enjoying it&#x27;s creamy, enriching, wonderfulness.</li>
            <li> The price is soooo reasonable compared to other &#x27;natural&#x27; products in the market, and this product may be even better to the higher end products.</li>
            <li> While I know this might sound strange to some, for me it is a necessity.</li>
            <li> A couple K-Pak treatments later, my hair is strong again but super dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> With the understanding of my hairs ph balance, I feel more in control and less at the mercy of mass produced products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;  My only complaint is that the cap is a huge pain in the a$$ but other than that, there isn&#x27;t enough wonderful things I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> The texture of the conditioner is very nice (neither runny nor too heavy), and it leaves my hair silky, manageable, and full-bodied.  </li>
            <li> Packaging is high quality.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to use two or three times a week.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, highlighted hair that is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> my hair was soft as silk, and seemed so much thicker.</li>
            <li> and the price is right here versus a big store like Target.</li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable for such a high quality hair product.  </li>
            <li> I had been using this product for close to a year before they switched the bottle to the new label, which reads &amp;#34;New</li>
            <li> Tho \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot;, tho a HUGE step above most crappy products, is still in itself a somewhat superficial quick-fix and not a true benefit to the hair shaft in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it was super dry and brittle looking.</li>
            <li> before buying products at these big named stores try to find them on clearance isles and discounted places because its all the same thing, but with a significantly diffrent price!!&lt;br /&gt;GOD BLESS,&lt;br /&gt;TRJ</li>
            <li> At first this product left my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> It has a light baby lotion type fragrance that is not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Unlike most other conditioners that claim that they are nourishing ... yet they just make the hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; better by using unhealthy ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s fairly natural and has very little scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After waiting five minutes, I noticed that my curls were much more defined and moisturized than they were my previous wash, which involved deep conditioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would certainly recommend this conditioner as well as the others mentioned above.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t changed anything, not even shampoos technically, but the company that makes this certainly changed the product when they changed the label, and then chose to lie about it on the label.</li>
            <li> aveda is a great company that only uses plant products but they get expensive after a while.</li>
            <li> I always try to use all natural products on my skin.</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;ve used this conditioner twice</li>
            <li> If I continue using it I will update my review but the real problem (because hair that is wavy with biolage but looks greasy and slept-on with this shampoo and conditioner can still be pulled back into a ponytail) is the smell.</li>
            <li> Supple and Soft feeling hair.</li>
            <li> Not harsh at all</li>
            <li> I use on a regular basis as a pre-conditioner (before I shampoo to moisturize, soften, detangle) and as a conditioner wash to soften and gently clense my hair.</li>
            <li> It is sort of natural.</li>
            <li> And it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> also both the shampoo and conditioner say on the site 99.4 or 99.8 natural however my bottles say 97% natural..</li>
            <li> By far.</li>
            <li> a 3b natural</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is bleached and dyed in some parts and completely natural in others.</li>
            <li> This conditioner keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my kinky/coily hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no hair commercial, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I find that it conditions as well as non natural conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I shampooed by AA hair with a natural shampoo &amp; then topped it off with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, somewhat dry hair and my hair LOVES Yes to Carrots!  </li>
            <li> Or maybe they assume the person is ordering for the first time and doesn&#x27;t know that they&#x27;re getting the ol&#x27; bait and switch of getting a bad product under the good [old] product&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li> its not a bad smell by any means, and the scent doesnt stay with your hair after its dried, but its definetly not a nice smell like you would get from Garnier Fructis.&lt;br /&gt;i love getting organic products</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have only found two brands of hair care that do not make me break out, and this is by far</li>
            <li> For reference, I have long and very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Yes to Carrots line is the only line of products I have found that my family has been able to use for any amount of time w/o having any negative reaction.</li>
            <li> Ingredients are actually readable, recognizable and REAL ... not full of ingredients that make me want to revisit chemistry class!  </li>
            <li> Please bring the old formula back!</li>
            <li> I suppose this is for preservation purposes, I don&#x27;t know, but after processing this product is a far cry from an actual nutritious carrot drink for your hair.</li>
            <li> and I am a male adult.  </li>
            <li> If you are the type of person who is prone to allergic reactions I would recommend trying any new product out at a local store to see if you have a reaction prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> I feel \\&quot;Yes-to\\&quot;, like other products may be slightly working against your hairs natural components, but because its so divine in comparison to other products on the market, its hard to tell where it falls short, and until you try a product that is more natural and rich in nutrients you may never know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the third or forth use of this product, my hair is almost back to normal following a perm or coloring session with my hairstylist.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I am giving this a 3/5 (besides the fact that I don&#x27;t like the smell of baby powder), is the fact that by the following day after using my hair was super greasy and felt just plain gross.</li>
            <li> know that other reviewers have said that they had an allergic reaction to some items in this product line, which is possible with any product to a certain percentage of people who try it.</li>
            <li> Having curly hair, I&#x27;m generally pretty slow to try new products, but after reading some reviews, I decided to give this a chance.</li>
            <li> even used the CRAZY expensive stuff by Wen that claims to be the absolute best.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product from Curlyniki.com where there are natural BLACK women, like me who are very sensitive to what we put in our hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner tames my wildly fickle colored curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> As far as the product goes, I have curly hair, often dry, often tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am white and have long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I suppose it may be due to the high number of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Yes to Carrots shampoo and conditioner twice a week and the scalp and hair mud mask once a week usually makes my hair much more tame and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and this formula seems to be only 97% natural versus the previously bought 99% natural.  </li>
            <li> but this really does help tame that.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and wavy hair that is easily dried out and this conditioner worked magically.</li>
            <li> My dry colored hair kept from fading longer than any &amp; all expensive brands of specific color shampoos and the conditioner helped to soften my hair which surely helped with the dryness in this</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who gets itchy and is sensitive to scents and such just walking down the detergent isle in the supermarket and</li>
            <li> I only wish I had found this long ago...</li>
            <li> even though i got the Moisturizing products) and my hair would never style nicely, i couldnt figure out why i was ALWAYS having bad hair days while using those products, so i had to switch back to the chemical stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anything with alcohol in it, whether its a facial or hair product, will dry your skin.</li>
            <li> But now, after a month, my hair looks like a big frizz ball, is horribly dry looking</li>
            <li> In the shower my hair felt soft but, once it dried underneath my white T-shirt</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unnecessary and creates more waste.  </li>
            <li> After my colorist for a recent hair show got a little overzealous with the bleach (she was only supposed to even out my roots and ended up doing the lengths as well), I was left with very short, very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> The new stuff is full of synthetic crap and doesn&#x27;t work anything like the old conditioner!</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair so soft and only takes half the amount of other conditioners to do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be using this stuff for as long as they make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange essence.</li>
            <li> I received this product along with the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;today and am disappointed.. first off the shampoo does not have the orange tint to making me question whether this is the true product.</li>
            <li> I found this product in a local drugstore and bought it because the shampoo and conditioner were on sale for the same price as typical drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> It instantly turned my scalp back into a flaky mess [</li>
            <li> Wet, damp, or dry, after using this hair conditioner, your hair is going to reek strongly of baby powder with a faint hint of marshmallow.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from amazon as well as another retailer and when the respective orders arrived, I opened the box to find Yes to Carrots other conditioner (called Pampering Condioner - not \\&quot;mud\\&quot; conditioner).  </li>
            <li> ive used salon brands and other brands such as John Frieda and didnt get results like this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lack of parabens and other synthetic ingredients was big reason why I bought it as well.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this conditioner works well to get tangles out</li>
            <li> My hair would dry out (</li>
            <li> (I refuse to use towels to dry my hair)</li>
            <li> but I hate to have to deep condition my hair every week because this prodcut just isn&#x27;t doing the job on its own.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t see a big difference for 9.00 a bottle at walgreens not worth it..</li>
            <li> would mention I would not classify this conditioner as a \\&quot;mud\\&quot; which would normally have elicited a vision (to me) of an extremely thick product that one would have to dip your hand into to get some.  </li>
            <li> Tight, dry curls that will behave if given enough TLC.  </li>
            <li> I also spend a LOT of time swimming, and my hair is quick to show the ill effects of it.  </li>
            <li> A rating of 3 is not too bad, but I&#x27;ve been reading about homemade products, and I decided it would be better for my hair to start using baking soda and vinegar instead.  </li>
            <li> though I have thick natural hair</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally wavy hair that becomes frizzy during summer months</li>
            <li> After years of trying to tame my massive mane w/o any luck, I have found that using the Say</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a step up from the cheap brands but if very terrible compared to the high end brands such as Redkin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it rinses out well.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DISCLAIMER: Like the other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type that takes a shower every other day</li>
            <li> I have repurposed the bottles for other things.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It used to leave my hair feeling silky, but now it&#x27;s just like any other drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li> , their other conditioner also has stuff in it that I won&#x27;t even attempt to pronounce or spell</li>
            <li> so, because I recently colored my hair and that usually kills the curl pattern a bit in addition to drying it out.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, it became harder and harder for me to find this porduct in the stores</li>
            <li> At least one to three ingredients will be added that are lacking in benefit, especially to hair products.</li>
            <li> so sad because I really like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and does everything a conditioner should do, and the yummy smell is a bonus (it reminds me of Cabbage Patch Kids from back in the day).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying to have to remove the top to get at the product.  </li>
            <li> I adore the fact that it contains no parabens, sulfates, or other unwanted ingredients, too!  </li>
            <li> i recieved this product as a gift, i had never heard of it previously.</li>
            <li> I have to warn everyone that my previous review was for Yes</li>
            <li> and my hair still felt dry and hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried several others and they were all really thin and not very rich feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, that often gets brittle or dry and this product helps keep it manageable.</li>
            <li> a little goes a lonnnnng way</li>
            <li> Those little guys add up.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> I have very thick, super-curly hair and a dry, flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li> if not BETTER than any mass produced item.</li>
            <li> not sure what all the hype was about im</li>
            <li> Not satisfied</li>
            <li> I have been using this in my girls hair for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> so having my hair feel as disgusting as this product made it feel the day after a shower was a huge turn</li>
            <li> I kept the other pack for myself and needless to say I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I just used this product today and my hair looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li> No matter how you cut it, there is a complex nature behind creating a product and mass producing it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am so addicted to the Say</li>
            <li> I think this product would work for anyone who is tired of their hair being stripped.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This product takes your tired, over-processed or damaged hair and \\&quot;pampers it\\&quot; by infusing your hair with renewed moisture and silky softness with each use.  </li>
            <li> It is now in much worse condition than ever before</li>
            <li> I am NOT happy and I think I will see if I can return this item.</li>
            <li> It weighed my now non-colored hair down so bad and the amount of alcohol used in this made my skin issues flare up within 30 minutes of using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, artificial, and annoying.</li>
            <li> and my hair looks worse than I have ever seen it in my life!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it stinks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bad a smell as the YTC shampoo formula, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> So bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed I am...</li>
            <li> I think it is ruining my hair :(</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> but i hated it.</li>
            <li> I had Chicken Pox!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product from a drugstore chain here in Canada (Shoppers Drug Mart) to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: Like the other Yes to Carrots products, I cannot stand the smell of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, if you don&#x27;t like the smell of baby powder then immediately look elsewhere for another hair conditioner. Wet, damp, or dry, after using this hair conditioner, your hair is going to reek strongly of baby powder with a faint hint of marshmallow. However, if you can tolerate this smell, then you&#x27;ll likely enjoy the product! This hair conditioner left my hair ridiculously soft, shiny, and tamed my frizziness for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am giving this a 3/5 (besides the fact that I don&#x27;t like the smell of baby powder), is the fact that by the following day after using my hair was super greasy and felt just plain gross. I&#x27;m the type that takes a shower every other day so having my hair feel as disgusting as this product made it feel the day after a shower was a huge turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you can tolerate the moderate scent of baby powder and have a shower on a daily basis, then this product is for you. Otherwise, continue your search for the perfect hair conditioner elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This conditioner tames my wildly fickle colored curly dry hair. After years of trying to tame my massive mane w/o any luck, I have found that using the Say Yes to Carrots shampoo and conditioner twice a week and the scalp and hair mud mask once a week usually makes my hair much more tame and manageable. I am so addicted to the Say Yes shampoo and conditioner that I take it with me when I get my hair done. While I know this might sound strange to some, for me it is a necessity. I have very sensitive skin and have only found two brands of hair care that do not make me break out, and this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that other reviewers have said that they had an allergic reaction to some items in this product line, which is possible with any product to a certain percentage of people who try it. I am one of those people who gets itchy and is sensitive to scents and such just walking down the detergent isle in the supermarket and the Say Yes to Carrots line is the only line of products I have found that my family has been able to use for any amount of time w/o having any negative reaction. If you are the type of person who is prone to allergic reactions I would recommend trying any new product out at a local store to see if you have a reaction prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> I always try to use all natural products on my skin. This shampoo is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used. It smells good and leaves my hair clean and shiny. The price is good also.</li>
            <li> Love Yes-to-Carrots conditioner!  Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It keeps it&#x27;s word!  It actually does condition and nourish the hair.  Unlike most other conditioners that claim that they are nourishing ... yet they just make the hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; better by using unhealthy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;- Wonderful mourishing, moisturizing and detangling properties&lt;br /&gt;- Rich ... a little goes a lonnnnng way&lt;br /&gt;- Ingredients are actually readable, recognizable and REAL ... not full of ingredients that make me want to revisit chemistry class!  If you visit the yesttocarrots site, you will find that the produce is actually grown on organic farms in Israel.&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging is high quality.  I have repurposed the bottles for other things.&lt;br /&gt;- Pricing is right for the amount of product ... plus the product is so very rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite conditioners are from Yes-to-Carrots (Yes-to-Carrots &amp; Yes-to-Cucumber) and Aubrey Organics (Honeysuckle Rose &amp; GPB Protein) ... I alternate between these conditioners.</li>
            <li> We do have a water softener installed &amp; that makes a difference too but I love this conditioner &amp; it makes my hair so soft. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The formula and scent have changed since I purchased this from Whole Foods some time ago.  It&#x27;s not as bad a smell as the YTC shampoo formula, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work as well.  It used to leave my hair feeling silky, but now it&#x27;s just like any other drugstore brand.  As with the new YTC shampoo, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be throwing this out, too.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, super-curly hair and a dry, flaky scalp.  What caught my eye about this conditioner is that the label said it was great for hair AND scalp, plus I&#x27;d been searching for a conditioner made with natural ingredients since all the conventional conditioners [loaded with chemicals] make my hair and scalp worse.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I love everything about this conditioner: the smell [a light, baby powderish scent], the texture [thick, yet light and mousse-like] and the results [soft, managable, shiny hair]. The price is also very reasonable for such a high quality hair product.  I&#x27;ll probably be using this stuff for as long as they make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** The real &#x27;Pampering Hair Mud Conditioner&#x27; has been discontinued.  A few months ago, it became harder and harder for me to find this porduct in the stores (I thought it was because it was selling out/popular!), so I figured I&#x27;d just order a bunch online. I ordered it from amazon as well as another retailer and when the respective orders arrived, I opened the box to find Yes to Carrots other conditioner (called Pampering Condioner - not \\&quot;mud\\&quot; conditioner).  I knew something was up, so I called the Yes to Carrots company twice and finally squeezed out from the rep that yes - my beloved Hair Mud was being discontinued.  So what are retailers doing?  Sending people who order the Hair Mud conditioner, the regular &#x27;pampering&#x27; conditioner instead and [I assume] hoping they don&#x27;t notice the difference (the product names and even bottle designs are VERY similar after all). Or maybe they assume the person is ordering for the first time and doesn&#x27;t know that they&#x27;re getting the ol&#x27; bait and switch of getting a bad product under the good [old] product&#x27;s name.  While the hair mud conditioner is full of good stuff like sweet potato and carrot (which the other conditioner *does* have), their other conditioner also has stuff in it that I won&#x27;t even attempt to pronounce or spell - kinda negates the whole idea of a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product.  It instantly turned my scalp back into a flaky mess [thanks, ceterayl alcohol! :(].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in closing, Pampering Hair Mud Conditioner is a great product, it&#x27;s just that odds are that&#x27;s not the item you&#x27;ll get when you order it.  I will say though, that amazon has OUTSTANDING customer service and promptly refunded my money when I called them about this frustrating product mishap!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, that often gets brittle or dry and this product helps keep it manageable. This conditoner works just as good as any of the more expensive salon brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product from Curlyniki.com where there are natural BLACK women, like me who are very sensitive to what we put in our hair. I have been looking for a good conditioner that does not strip my hair and a product where i am not using half the container on my hair during one wash. I saw it at Target for 7.99 and was really pondering if I should buy it, then I went to ROSS and they had it for 3.99!!! I bought it and now i am going back to find as many bottles as I can. I LOVE the effect on my hair it makes. I really didnt like the smell, but with natural products i really havent  found a good smelling product that works. But it has a unique smell and i have grown accustom to it. Now I like the smell and LOVE IT all the more!&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have thick natural hair I think this product would work for anyone who is tired of their hair being stripped.&lt;br /&gt;Also before buying products at these big named stores try to find them on clearance isles and discounted places because its all the same thing, but with a significantly diffrent price!!&lt;br /&gt;GOD BLESS,&lt;br /&gt;TRJ</li>
            <li> i love this product!! i have fine, oily hair that always falls flat. i recieved this product as a gift, i had never heard of it previously. i figured i give it a try. after one wash with the same brand shampoo and then this condidiotner i was amazed! my hair was soft as silk, and seemed so much thicker. i love it. ive used salon brands and other brands such as John Frieda and didnt get results like this!&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i took a star off is bc the smell isnt the best. its not a bad smell by any means, and the scent doesnt stay with your hair after its dried, but its definetly not a nice smell like you would get from Garnier Fructis.&lt;br /&gt;i love getting organic products and ive tried some the stuff from Burt&#x27;s Bees but i hated it. My hair would dry out (even though i got the Moisturizing products) and my hair would never style nicely, i couldnt figure out why i was ALWAYS having bad hair days while using those products, so i had to switch back to the chemical stuff. :/&lt;br /&gt;ive even used the CRAZY expensive stuff by Wen that claims to be the absolute best. Yes to Carrots blows it out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;only using this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Love it! smells great, works very good. However the cap needs to be redesigned. I have to take off the top just to get the product out.</li>
            <li> I have to warn everyone that my previous review was for Yes To Carrots Pampering HAIR MUD conditioner. The new stuff is full of synthetic crap and doesn&#x27;t work anything like the old conditioner! Please bring the old formula back!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to purchasing really crappy sulfate and paraben riddled products, then the \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; product line is most definitely a step up. When I first crossed this line I was immediately moved by their diverse but easy-to-understand line. If you&#x27;re a girl who wants to care more about the products she uses then this line can, at first, seem like a God-send, but here&#x27;s the deal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything with alcohol in it, whether its a facial or hair product, will dry your skin. I&#x27;ve noticed that tho I enjoy this product, it simply doesn&#x27;t provide the moisture I prefer. After reading the label I now understand that the alcohol content is to blame. Again, anything with alcohol will pretend to moisturize, but really provides no stability for hair cuticles. Please go on youtube and type ph balance of hair. You will come across a tutorial that explains what hair is and how it works. Since then I have not looked at any of these products the same...  No matter how you cut it, there is a complex nature behind creating a product and mass producing it. At least one to three ingredients will be added that are lacking in benefit, especially to hair products. I suppose this is for preservation purposes, I don&#x27;t know, but after processing this product is a far cry from an actual nutritious carrot drink for your hair. Tho \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot;, tho a HUGE step above most crappy products, is still in itself a somewhat superficial quick-fix and not a true benefit to the hair shaft in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe products like \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; are for transitioning sulfate product users who may or may not understand what creates beautiful hair, but are easily swayed by products that seem environmentally sound and give good results. It is one thing to care about your hair and body, but another to care about your hair, body AND the environment all the same. One would be surprised how easily they could make a product that worked just as well, if not BETTER than any mass produced item. I recently learned about PH balance, and aloe vera on hair via youtube, and have since made my own products, and let me tell you, they nourish the heck out of my hair. I have never been more satisfied and saved so much money. With the understanding of my hairs ph balance, I feel more in control and less at the mercy of mass produced products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I feel \\&quot;Yes-to\\&quot;, like other products may be slightly working against your hairs natural components, but because its so divine in comparison to other products on the market, its hard to tell where it falls short, and until you try a product that is more natural and rich in nutrients you may never know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give making a ph balanced shampoo and conditioner from aloe vera a try :).</li>
            <li> This conditioner helps keep my very curly hair moisturize and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Redkin products a while and decided to try Yes To Carrots while trying to find a paraben free soap for my hair. This conditioner is a step up from the cheap brands but if very terrible compared to the high end brands such as Redkin. It weighed my now non-colored hair down so bad and the amount of alcohol used in this made my skin issues flare up within 30 minutes of using. It feels very cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take note. This is not all organic, it&#x27;s not entirely paraben free, and it has a ton of fragrance in it. Not good for sensitive skin. ( Wich is my fault for not looking at that detail. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is super cheap, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, highlighted hair that is naturally curly.  I also spend a LOT of time swimming, and my hair is quick to show the ill effects of it.  After using \\&quot;Yes to Carrots Pampering Hair Mud Conditioner\\&quot;, my hair has never looked or felt healthier.  The texture of the conditioner is very nice (neither runny nor too heavy), and it leaves my hair silky, manageable, and full-bodied.  I adore the fact that it contains no parabens, sulfates, or other unwanted ingredients, too!  I only wish I had found this long ago... definitely my \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; hair product!</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;ve used this conditioner twice and I love it. The smell is awesome &amp; the detangling properties work well with my type of hair. I will definitely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> i found a yes to carrots face wash three years ago at an ulta in savannah ga and have never forgotten it. i have used salon hair products for the last ten years but recently i have been looking not only how my products effect my hair but also how they affect the environment and animals. aveda is a great company that only uses plant products but they get expensive after a while. so to break up the dent in my wallet, i bought this and its matching shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let me tell you, i am in love! it smells great, leaves my hair soft and tangle free. i am super glad i got this and will get it on a regular basis. i am happy that it is crulety free and uses organi ingredients. such a good buy.</li>
            <li> I just used this product today and my hair looks ridiculous. Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is more oily than &#x27;normal to dry&#x27; or maybe it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t used it for a week as another reviewer suggested. If I continue using it I will update my review but the real problem (because hair that is wavy with biolage but looks greasy and slept-on with this shampoo and conditioner can still be pulled back into a ponytail) is the smell. In my opinion, it stinks. So bad. The conditioner smells better than the shampoo but the shampoo made me want to throw up (sorry). I&#x27;m just saying-smell it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> I am trying to switch to more natural products overall and was having an issue finding a good conditioner.  I&#x27;d tried several others and they were all really thin and not very rich feeling.  This one is great on my hair.  It&#x27;s nice and creamy and I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I loved this conditioner!  I have fine, curly, tangly hair, and this conditioner somehow leaves my hair smooth and is much easier to comb through after a shower!  It smells delicious, won&#x27;t harm your color job or brazillian blowout, and improves the texture and appearance of your hair!  A total win for a great price!</li>
            <li> So I used this product twice and my hair still felt dry and hard. I kept it in my hair for 3 mins like the bottle suggest. Next time, i ;ll keep it in for 10 mins  and if i notice a different I&#x27;ll update. so sad because I really like the shampoo. I would luv for this product to beecome a staple but I hate to have to deep condition my hair every week because this prodcut just isn&#x27;t doing the job on its own. I have kinky hair 4B hair. I did not buy online. I got it at walmart.</li>
            <li> Excellent product resulting in silky, healthy hair for me and my spouse, and not tested on animals (which is very important to me).</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients. It was wonderful in my hair and I use it as a leave in lotion. Its really great. Supple and Soft feeling hair.</li>
            <li> I have been into the YTC line since it came out in 2007.  I use all cruelty-free products, so this line has been a God-send.  I find this conditioner to be very effective.  It&#x27;s thick and does everything a conditioner should do, and the yummy smell is a bonus (it reminds me of Cabbage Patch Kids from back in the day).  I am not sold on the matching shampoo, however, but that is a separate review.  If you&#x27;re looking for an \\&quot;all hair types\\&quot; kind of conditioner, this is a great one whether or not you require your products to be cruelty-free.  One suggestion is that they ditch the plastic cap on top of the bottle.  It&#x27;s unnecessary and creates more waste.  Those little guys add up.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me...wasn&#x27;t sudsy...didn&#x27;t make my hair softer...nothing...not a thing...I feel like I just bought into all the hype...waste of money</li>
            <li> Smells so good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. Leaves it soft and with more volume. Not harsh at all and the price is right here versus a big store like Target.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great, and while I like the shampoo, I do not like the conditioner. Unless you use a ridiculously large amount of it, your hair will be tangled when you get out of the shower. I dread brushing my hair after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use on a regular basis as a pre-conditioner (before I shampoo to moisturize, soften, detangle) and as a conditioner wash to soften and gently clense my hair. I also use it sometimes right after I shampoo (when I do) as a rinse-out conditioner, as it really softens my hair from the harsh effects of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is 4b/c, extremely course and tightly coiled - this conditioner is great at keeping the kinks under wraps!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It smells nice. It is sort of natural. And it makes my hair soft. Works well with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Yes to Carrots Shampoo and Conditioner are my favorite and I use them both daily.  The conditioner is light so as not to weigh your hair down, but very effectively conditions.  I have long, fine, somewhat dry hair and my hair LOVES Yes to Carrots!  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.  Made my hair clean and soft.  No overpowering smell, where you feel like you cannot breath.  I now use all of Yes to Carrots products from: Body lotion, shampoo, hair condition, bath gel, and night cream (so far-going for more products from this line).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as carrots. It&#x27;s a strange essence. Doesn&#x27;t last either.</li>
            <li> I like it works out well with my hair and I am a male adult.  I would highly recommend to use two or three times a week.</li>
            <li> I received this product along with the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;today and am disappointed.. first off the shampoo does not have the orange tint to making me question whether this is the true product. also both the shampoo and conditioner say on the site 99.4 or 99.8 natural however my bottles say 97% natural.. I can not find a contact number or email address to  have these questions answered. it was sold by amazon LLC.</li>
            <li> First off, I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell. It&#x27;s loud, artificial, and annoying. It didn&#x27;t moisturized very well, either. I think it&#x27;s overpriced perfume. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Prepare to pamper your hair, with \\&quot;Say Yes to Carrots\\&quot; Pampering Hair Mud Conditioner!  This product takes your tired, over-processed or damaged hair and \\&quot;pampers it\\&quot; by infusing your hair with renewed moisture and silky softness with each use.  All of the \\&quot;Say Yes to Carrots\\&quot; products have very high quality ingredients.  By the third or forth use of this product, my hair is almost back to normal following a perm or coloring session with my hairstylist.  I have found this product to be one of the most pampering hair products on the market, and will continue to purchase and use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. She has been using Yes to Carrots for awhile now. I kept the other pack for myself and needless to say I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I use this after the Yes To Carrots shampoo. A little goes a long way and it rinses out well. My hair is soft, shiny, manageable, static free, tangle free and smells awesome! Favorite line of hair stuff. By far.</li>
            <li> I became acquainted with the \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; brand when as a Amazon Vine member, I chose to receive their Body Butter which I really liked.  Then I tried their Moisturizing Day Cream which I loved better than any others I have ever tried.  So thought I&#x27;d try out their shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Another pleasant surprise.  My dry colored hair kept from fading longer than any &amp; all expensive brands of specific color shampoos and the conditioner helped to soften my hair which surely helped with the dryness in this climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would mention I would not classify this conditioner as a \\&quot;mud\\&quot; which would normally have elicited a vision (to me) of an extremely thick product that one would have to dip your hand into to get some.  It is squeezed from the bottle into your hand with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this conditioner as well as the others mentioned above.</li>
            <li> I found this product in a local drugstore and bought it because the shampoo and conditioner were on sale for the same price as typical drugstore brands. The lack of parabens and other synthetic ingredients was big reason why I bought it as well. I have used it 3 times since purchasing and absolutely love this conditioner. I have thick naturally wavy hair that becomes frizzy during summer months but this really does help tame that.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using the Pampering shampoo and love it too. Nice smell and I love that both products are natural and really work. If I can continue to find these products I will be a loyal user.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, reasonably priced, does the trick</li>
            <li> I will not be getting this again not sure what all the hype was about im a 3b natural and when i applied it kinda just sat there on my hair and did NOT have any slip whatsoever, I had to mix this with aussie moist just to finger detangle my hair. I guess it moisturized a bit but i didn&#x27;t see a big difference for 9.00 a bottle at walgreens not worth it..</li>
            <li> I am an avid Yes to Carrots product user and the product advertised here and in the picture, the \\&quot;Pampering Mud Conditioner\\&quot; is not what I received. I received the \\&quot;Pampering Conditioner,\\&quot; two very different products. Also, I placed my order on December 18th and did not receive it until January 27th.</li>
            <li> I have what some people would call &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; hair. Tight, dry curls that will behave if given enough TLC.  I use this as a leave in conditioner along with some gel to produce perfect curls.  Love that it&#x27;s fairly natural and has very little scent.</li>
            <li> item as described, quick delivery, excellent!</li>
            <li> I love that this is non-toxic and it works! The shampoo is great too.Both are vegan and they never use animal testing!  It&#x27;s a 3 on EWG&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> To put it simply-I love this conditioner. I have curly hair that is bleached and dyed in some parts and completely natural in others. This conditioner keeps my hair soft and manageable. I use it as a regular conditioner in the shower and also as a deep conditioner when I sit under the hair dryer. It smells great and if you&#x27;re like me and wash/condition your hair only 1 or 2 times a week it lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so over all that Pantene and Loreal junk loaded with chemicals. All those big name brands were just damaging and drying out my hair. This natural conditioner is a great alternative. I would recommend it best for dry and normal hair types.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Not only is it good for you but it leaves my hair so soft and only takes half the amount of other conditioners to do it. It has a light baby lotion type fragrance that is not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Definite keeper.</li>
            <li> So this product received rave reviews by many in and out if the natural hair community. Therefore, I decided to try it because I am in search of a great natural conditioner for my natural kinky hair. Well let me tell you this is not it. I did like how while co-washing my hair it provided me great &amp;#34;slip factor&amp;#34; although I detangled and deep conditioned prior or co-washing with JBCO. I rinsed my hair and then applied the YTC conditioner, waited the recommended 2-3 minutes then rinsed it out. In the shower my hair felt soft but, once it dried underneath my white T-shirt (I refuse to use towels to dry my hair) it was super dry and brittle looking. Disappointed I am...I did like the price although I bought it from Walgreens for $6.97. I will try one more time and see how it works otherwise it will be going back to the store. As with anything else &amp;#34;everything is not for everybody.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Tried Yes to Carrots Conditioner for the first time today after anticipating my purchase for awhile. I have very thick, curly hair. Left it on for 5 minutes after co-washing (with a lighter conditioner). It smells of a lighter scented version of baby powder/lotion upon first opening the bottle. It did smell a bit stronger in the shower after wetting my hair and lathering it on. Unless you have super sensitized nostrils or allergies, it shouldn&#x27;t bother you. I don&#x27;t mind it, smells good imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting five minutes, I noticed that my curls were much more defined and moisturized than they were my previous wash, which involved deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly so, because I recently colored my hair and that usually kills the curl pattern a bit in addition to drying it out. Detangling was pretty easy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this product for the price, and will be purchasing a bottle for my boyfriend to test out, as he attempts to grow his hair for winter. *Beware: product contains alcohol</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner after hearing so many recommendations on different hair care blogs, and I must say that it&#x27;s excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is thick and creamy and has great slip to use for detangling. Love it. It leaves my kinky/coily hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but with this order I noticed sweet almond oil has been added. My husband and daughter have a nut allergy so I cannot use the 4 bottles I ordered. I contacted the company &amp; they confirmed the products recently went through a product transformation. Too bad!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair more manageable and shiny</li>
            <li> Having curly hair, I&#x27;m generally pretty slow to try new products, but after reading some reviews, I decided to give this a chance. It has a good clean smell and definitely hydrates my hair. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner and the shampoo because I read the bottle and it said it was over 99% natural and good for your hair.  However, it only has a rating of 3 on the EWG website (0 being the best and 9 being the worst).  A rating of 3 is not too bad, but I&#x27;ve been reading about homemade products, and I decided it would be better for my hair to start using baking soda and vinegar instead.  For people who feel the need to use store bought shampoos and conditioners and also do not want to spend a ton of money, this product is sufficient.</li>
            <li> I subscribe and save to this item, that&#x27;s how devoted I am to it, but consistently, the bottle top is defective, and you can&#x27;t pop it open and squeeze out the conditioner.  It&#x27;s annoying to have to remove the top to get at the product.  As far as the product goes, I have curly hair, often dry, often tends to frizz.  This leaves my hair clean, light, not weighted down and with nice curls.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Still feels clean, smells great, AND sulfate free!</li>
            <li> The cap design is awful and doesn&#x27;t work, I have to unscrew the bottle to work, but the conditioner itself is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and this formula seems to be only 97% natural versus the previously bought 99% natural.  This product contains more glycerol and tends to make my hair a bit greasy.  Not satisfied</li>
            <li> I have tried a few natural and organic conditioners and this is by far the best. The coconut oil based ones leave my hair too oily. It&#x27;s no hair commercial, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> smells good but it&#x27;s a basic  conditioner. i use this after i clean my hair with the carrot shampoo.  it&#x27;s a nice finish to my hair routine but to be honest, it&#x27;s just an average conditioner.  good price and good basic results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in my girls hair for the past two years.  I love the smell and it is great for dry hair which they both have.</li>
            <li> After my colorist for a recent hair show got a little overzealous with the bleach (she was only supposed to even out my roots and ended up doing the lengths as well), I was left with very short, very dry hair.  A couple K-Pak treatments later, my hair is strong again but super dry and frizzy.  I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it with the protein since my hair is extra picky these days so a protein-free conditioner is my best bet.  Enter Yes To Carrots.  After only one use, my hair feels aaaahhh-mazing...softer, shinier, and healthier!  And bonus! The scent is kinda floral-y and I&#x27;ve been getting loads of compliments on my &amp;#34;new perfume.&amp;#34;  My only complaint is that the cap is a huge pain in the a$$ but other than that, there isn&#x27;t enough wonderful things I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am white and have long, naturally curly hair. This conditioner keeps it soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair conditioner.  I have very long hair and this conditioner works well to get tangles out and it makes my hair very soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> I use this product to cowash and I love it. Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing with a light, clean scent!  I use this on my hair and on my daughter&#x27;s hair every day.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite natural hair conditioner. My son&#x27;s hair would be SO unruly without it. I&#x27;ve used it for two years now and buy it from amazon because the price is always right. It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver product if you have girls with tangle-prone hair. Smells nice, too (not to strong) my only wish is that it came in gallon size.</li>
            <li> YTC is the best Shampoo/Conditioner formula I have ever tried and am very happy with this purchase. I have long, thick and wavy hair that is easily dried out and this conditioner worked magically. It left a light scent and my hair feels lighter and much more healthy. I would highly recommend this company&#x27;s products to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product worked pretty well at conditioning my hair...BUT it left me looking like I had Chicken Pox!!  I stopped using it and the red blotches all over my body started to go away.  I used it one more time (just to see if it was really the conditioner) and the reaction reoccurred.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.  I have never reacted to a product like this before.  I suppose it may be due to the high number of essential oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  I like Herbal Essence Hello Hydration much, much better.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for a product that is free of many of the harmful chemicals in today&#x27;s conditioners.  I find that it conditions as well as non natural conditioners.  I have used this product of over 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for over one year and I love it! For reference, I have long and very curly hair. Yes to Carrots is not only paraban free and pretty much oraganic, it has a great scent. What has impressed me the most though is that when I use it, leave it on for a few minutes (3 min or less) and when I brush it through with a comb in the shower (what most curly hair people do) my hair is smooth and the tangles are gone! I don&#x27;t have to struggle with my hair and damaging it more because its somehow super soft and detangled for me! Definitely recommend this product if you are deciding between trying it or not. I almost forgot to mention... The price is soooo reasonable compared to other &#x27;natural&#x27; products in the market, and this product may be even better to the higher end products.</li>
            <li> Son wishes it smelled more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but it does the job of his itchy scalp. He uses it exclusively. I may buy him Axe sh and cond so he can smell like a guy and when he gets itchy scalp, he  switches. Idk. For now it&#x27;s carrots!!! Others  didn&#x27;t work. None!  This does</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this product with the Nourishing Carrot Shampoo, I fell in love! It felt like my dried out wavy hair had become silky and beautiful overnight. I was even getting compliments from my friends and family about how great my hair looked, to which I would immediately recommend this product. I had been using this product for close to a year before they switched the bottle to the new label, which reads &amp;#34;New Look, Same Feel&amp;#34;. And like that, all of my hair happiness was gone, new look same feel is a lie! I felt right away that the new product felt less rich, less substantial than the shampoo and conditioner that I loved, the original conditioner was so thick it could not even move through the bottle to the opening the way it was designed, but that never stopped me from opening the lid and enjoying it&#x27;s creamy, enriching, wonderfulness. My hair went from light and shining healthy looking hair to basically straw. It is now in much worse condition than ever before and I haven&#x27;t changed anything, not even shampoos technically, but the company that makes this certainly changed the product when they changed the label, and then chose to lie about it on the label. I feel like they really cheapened a great product and I wish that I could still buy the product I loved. Good luck Yes to Carrots, I will never buy again!</li>
            <li> First of all I have tried almost all the &amp;#34;organic/natural&amp;#34; brands on the market. And you have to give them a fair shot of about a month before you can really review them. At first this product left my hair greasy. But now, after a month, my hair looks like a big frizz ball, is horribly dry looking and my hair looks worse than I have ever seen it in my life! I am NOT happy and I think I will see if I can return this item. I think it is ruining my hair :(</li>
            <li> I shampooed by AA hair with a natural shampoo &amp; then topped it off with this.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way my hair felt as I applied &amp; massaged.  I was impressed &amp; saw good things to come!&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, that&#x27;s where the good thing ended.&lt;br /&gt;Once rinsed &amp; towel-dried, my hair was tangled &amp; dry!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably give it one more try, but I&#x27;m kinda nervous about that.</li>
