            <li> My expectations for these brushes were pretty low.  The price (I think I paid around $28.00) seemed too good to be true.  I was blown away when I received these.  They are quite nice.  They have a nice weight with sturdy handles.  I tugged at the bristles and ferrules and everything stayed firmly in place.  These are very soft and the variety of brushes is awesome.  I have only had the opportunity to try a few of the set so far, but so far they&#x27;ve applied makeup nicely.  I haven&#x27;t washed any of these yet, but they feel like they should hold up just find.  For bargain-brushes, I usually shop ELF Studio, which are $3-6 a piece.  These are softer and feel sturdier and only cost a little over $1 a piece.  No complaints. I am so happy I bought these.</li>

            <li> So soft but do not pick up product well you have to really apply it to the brushes. They clean easily, the brushes are comfortable to hold and are nicely crafted. The hairs do not fall out big Plus. They are worth $27. The case is beautiful. and has a magnet to hold it close which is a bonus. It came with stud earing.</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes in the mail today. I&#x27;m super excited to use them. It had a smell when I opened the package but it went away. The brushes are super soft.</li>

            <li> Very good set, no shedding after I cleaned the brushes. The only brush I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with is the fan brush, it&#x27;s a bit too thin. Maybe an angled gel eyeliner bush would be nice instead of a strait one. Otherwise this is a very good starting makeup brush kit.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set! They&#x27;re so soft and look super nice too.</li>
