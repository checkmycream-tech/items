            <li>It takes off all my makeup and really cleanses my skin and leaves it so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>particularly bc</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but gets it really clean.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and leaves my face feeling soft and It is not drying.  </li>
            <li>That has happened more than once to me, a lot of money to waste.  </li>
            <li>The top doesn&#x27;t fit tightly, and I have often lost a lot of product due to that.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>

            <li>the price is right since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and this is the only product that I have found that keeps my skin clear and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer than soaps you buy for less, so it really costs about the same.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used this for ages. Love it. I only wish they would change the container. The top doesn&#x27;t fit tightly, and I have often lost a lot of product due to that. I have a tube of shampoo, same size, and it is nothing like this Murad tube. The cap is so hard to remove, it drives me nuts. But, better than to waste 1/2 a tube dripping out, and down the bathtub/shower drain. That has happened more than once to me, a lot of money to waste.  Maybe if we complain enough, Murad will  listen &amp; change it! The cleanser is wonderful though. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but gets it really clean. Plus, I have sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all, ever.</li>
            <li> I have been a Murad use for several years and have been very pleased with this cleanser.  It is gentle and leaves my face feeling soft and It is not drying.  I do recommend washing your face twice. I like a lather and it usually takes a second washing to achieve.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for years and I will continue to use them...they work wonders!  The cleanser is gentle and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so it will last a long time...worth the money!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. My skin is less red than it was when I used Clinique or neutragenia.  Very happy with it. Lasts longer than soaps you buy for less, so it really costs about the same.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is gentle and effective. My pores are clearer and my blackheads seem to be disappearing. I use this in conjunction with my clarisonic. My skin is not dried out after using it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It smells so nice and clean, works extremely well. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Love the entire Murad line. Great products! Try this with the Skin Perfecting Lotion - makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I love Murad!  Great cleanser!  I haven&#x27;t broken out since using this.  It&#x27;s in the shower and I have Neutrogena Fresh foaming face wash in the medicine cabinet for before bed.  I also like Bliss Fabulous Foaming Face wash.   I massage the Murad Refreshing Cleanser really well on my face in the morning, and I feel it makes my face look, well, more refreshed.  Even though I use other face wash and like those products as well, my skin has been clearer since adding this to my morning routine.    Great price on Amazon too, with free shipping of course!</li>

            <li> Keeps my skin soft but I will have to continue to use my other Murad product when my face becomes too oily.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but I have a Murad product from a local shop that has a different UPC code on it. Nevertheless, I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the two.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to try this product but I am glad I did. It smells so wonderful and is absolutely refreshing. I really do feel clean after I wash. Others I have used leave either a film or dry me out but this feels like it has just been made for my skin. I do swap back and forth with the ageless acne and ageless moisturizer. I also recommend the eye moisturizer. It has done wonders for myself.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> Has brought back some perkiness in my skin.</li>
            <li> Liked the idea that it cleanses and tones all in one go, but honestly can&#x27;t tell the differance from other cleansers?</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have found for my dry aging skin.  I love how it makes my skin feel and plan on using it again.</li>
            <li> much too drying.  gave me a rash</li>
            <li> I use this most of the time and then use the AHA/BHA scrub a couple days/week. I look this because I it great on sensative skin and takes all of my makeup off. It also has a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Like this cleanser. I&#x27;m 62, still have slightly oily skin, but can have dry areas. This product cleanses well, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other products.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this face cleanser. Since I started using it my skin has cleared up and feels much softer and less oily. I have 30 year old, oily and acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last month and it has done wonders!</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve used in quite some time and the price is right since a little goes a long way. Best of all, no dry feeling and works well with my Clarisonic. I would purchase again</li>
            <li> My brother loved this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser gets the makeup off and face feels clean and refreshed</li>
            <li> This is a great, gentle cleanser that soothes skin while fighting fine lines. Removes makeup, oil, impurities. Leaves my oily-combo skin with dry cheeks perfectly soft but not greasy. This is a great product particularly bc it&#x27;s a large size for a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> Amazing for combo skin. Only cleanser that I use and I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician so I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my face feel SO soft.  I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t burn at all when I use it.  I feel it has really improved the look of my skin as well.  Several people have commented that my skin looks really good and I know Murad is the reason why.</li>

            <li> This cleanser is very gentle and thorough.  You don&#x27;t need a lot. A little bit goes a long way.  Will save your complexion and your money.</li>
            <li> This cleanser removes my waterproof makeup with simple rubbing. Some residual eye makeup is left but a light cotton ball with makeup remover removes the rest. I used to have to rub the eye makeup off then wash my face and I&#x27;d still have the eye makeup on. With this cleanser my skin feels clean and mostly all the waterproof makeup is removed. I&#x27;ve tried all cleansers and this is the only one I will use. Plus it&#x27;s great with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and reasonable pricing</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for over a year now and overall they produce quality products for skin care. The Refreshing Cleanser leaves my skin feeling healthy and refreshed. However, their products come at a price.</li>
