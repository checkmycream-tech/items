            <li>I admit that I am the type of person who sees a cheap beauty product, knows it probably won&#x27;t work but hopes for the best anyway and buys it.</li>
            <li>This works fairly well if used as directed, but the hair feels stiffer and sometimes sticky after 24-48 hours after application.</li>
            <li>I had very healthy 3c-4a hair.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how my hair looks now.</li>
            <li>I just hope it will always be available!</li>
            <li>This stuff is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>It didnt even make my crimpy/wavy/frizzy mass of hair any more relaxed.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>that IS what the instructions say, but I still condition and this product seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, and I plan to buy the rest of the line very soon.  </li>
            <li>Brazilian Smooth is a must have product.</li>
            <li>Now I can wear my hair curley when I want, or use brazilian smooth</li>
            <li>I am beyond thrilled to find it on Amazon, because when I ran out and needed a new bottle, I went to Wal-Mart where I had been purchasing it and was heartbroken to not find it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money - I am stocking up!</li>
            <li>keeps my hair straight and frizz free for days!</li>
            <li>my hair is healthy and very curly again.</li>
            <li>This is some great stuff I tried this the other week</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product I just use the spray I don&#x27;t use that other stuff</li>
            <li>Now (2years after destroying my beautiful curls with this product)</li>
            <li>THANKS 4 THIS ITEM!!</li>
            <li>and then it stayed straight and most importantly FRIZZ FREE for three days with the only maintenance being brushing it when I woke up each day.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to make my hair shiny and frizz free but while some might make it shiny, they actually made it appear more dirty/greasy looking with my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Stellar product.</li>
            <li>This product REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>Five or so spritzes of FX, a comb, through,  a quick blow dry, and a finish with a hot iron, and my hair is sleek, smooth, shiny, and stays that way until I wash it again.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>My iron only goes up to 390F, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>hair is what stylists call \\&quot;fine but lots of it\\&quot;, and mostly straight (with an aggravating 80&#x27;s porn star body wave in multiple directions).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say maybe 20% of my frizz has returned, but I have put almost no effort into getting ready.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The straight style lasts about 5 days for me as I no longer use relaxers in my hair.</li>
            <li>I want it straight.</li>
            <li>because you know, the bottle says 7 days straight.</li>
            <li>The only plus of this product however is that it makes a fantastic detangler.</li>
            <li>Still didnt do much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using less in my hair, using more, nothing changed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall dissatisfied, but hey like I said, kinda knew what I was in for.</li>
            <li>My hair gets oily quick enough as it is, I don&#x27;t need to add on to it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Once I finished my hair looked like someone slapped bacon grease on my head, and having to turn my straightener up so high fried bits of my hair.</li>
            <li>Hell, my straightener couldnt even go as high as the recomended temp (thank</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the Chi 44 flat iron spray I paid double for.</li>
            <li>First of all let me say that I do wash and condition my hair prior to using this, but I do not use a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Heads and shoulders above more expensive and better known brands.</li>
            <li>One year later, my hair had STILL not reverted back into it&#x27;s original curl pattern.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and even my fine, slightly wavy hair gets frizzy shortly after walking out the door.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets frizzy after a blow dry and this kept it straighter and frizz free until the next wash.</li>
            <li>I section my hair and let it air dry, then I spray each section with this right before flat-ironing and my hair is silkier and bouncier than it ever was with a permanent relaxer.</li>
            <li>It is so soft, shiny and frizz free, without being weighed down!</li>
            <li>my options are get a professional to do it, or touch it up 10 times a day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural</li>
            <li>I have natural, 4b, super-thick hair and</li>
            <li>Although once I blowdried my hair it was very stringy feeling and coarse, yet my roots felt oily.</li>
            <li>My daughter has 4c hair and using this product on her hair before flat ironing gets her hair bone straight.  </li>
            <li>If I skip this stuff for a wash or two, my hair gets an absolutely ridiculous amount of static; I feel like a Tesla experiment.  </li>
            <li>Even if you let your hair air dry after, your hair is much smoother than without.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would last at least seven days as stated if I wrap my hair every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on day 5 now and after having washed it I still have used no other products</li>
            <li>I put this stuff on after my shower, and I woke up the next day and my hair is soft and not frizzy at all!  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed and shocked that I found \\&quot;hair heaven\\&quot; in a bottle!</li>
            <li>It works much better than Frizz Ease 3day and is less than half the cost.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t review stuff as a general thing, but I am a fan of this.</li>
            <li>I was really bummed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore but got 3 bottles on Amazon that should last a really long time since you don&#x27;t have to use a ton every application.</li>
            <li>I have very untamed hair that is super frizzy and very thick.</li>
            <li>If you want to, add a little argan oil to the very tips afterwards.  </li>

            <li> The only caveat, as with any other hair product, don&#x27;t use too much, it will make your hair slightly gummy.</li>
            <li> Usually if I want straight hair</li>
            <li> Then flat iron my hair with no additional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always have to flat iron</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it on before I flat iron it....</li>
            <li> I have flat ironed my hair since 1990 when I had to bastardize a crimping iron to do so, just to get that ultra-straight, sleek look that is all the rage now</li>
            <li> Next I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention of simply straightening my hair and keeping it straight for at least a week,</li>
            <li> I have spent the last 10 years trying to figure out some way to get the frizz tamed in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> My hair is similar to one of the reviewers, lots of waves in multiple directions, medium length, medium texture, and fairly thick with major frizz in humidity.</li>
            <li> /smooth my curls when I don&#x27;t blow dry &amp; straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Then I towel dry my hair and spray this evenly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent most of my life in muggy environments (the fog in San Francisco, the humidity in Italy), which is the BANE of sleek hair everywhere.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, I moved to an extremely dry environment (Alaska).  </li>
            <li> When used with Organix dry styling hydrating macadamia, works wonders.</li>
            <li> I was a tad concerned about the no conditioner thing, but my hair wasnt dry at all.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thick, but pretty dry and kinky, I do use a little conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as expected in DC humidity.  </li>
            <li> Iron carefully and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> With this product I just blow dried my hair, barely ran the flat iron over it (spent about 1/3 the usual time)</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used other fx products, I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Other than that, follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little dry from coloring it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on expensive stuff and THIS cheapie formula is the one I totally live by, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wont weigh ur hair down either.</li>
            <li> Also, every product I have tried weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> It has a little wave to it and some frizz around my roots.</li>
            <li> I am almost tempted to stock up heavily for fear they stop making it.</li>
            <li> My result: that heavy, liquid glossy hair that flows over your palm when held instead of sticking out like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dealing with iron infused, calcium/lime laden well water makes it hard to manage your hair.</li>
            <li> This is theonly product I can find that works to straighten my thick hair and not make it oily.  </li>
            <li> and I mean ALOT) of it,</li>
            <li> I admit I was a little skeptical about the product, as I found it in Walgreen&#x27;s clearance section.</li>
            <li> I have thick but thin strands of hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair and have done the expensive keratin treatments.  </li>
            <li> I would be a very, very sad little girl if they did!</li>
            <li> It even keeps my hair from getting that horrible hair band wave when I pull it back.</li>
            <li> Boy was I/it wrong.  </li>
            <li> (yeah, I was ahead of the game on that score!).  </li>
            <li> she washed her hair several times worst product ever</li>
            <li> I found this in the clearance section at Walgreen&#x27;s, and grabbed it because I figured it couldn&#x27;t be bad for a couple of bucks.  </li>
            <li> I have insanely frizzy wavey hair &amp; this product</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>
            <li> and when she showered it smelt terrible</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have spent the last 10 years trying to figure out some way to get the frizz tamed in my hair.  I have just about every product I can think of to help with it and nothing worked that well.  Usually if I want straight hair my options are get a professional to do it, or touch it up 10 times a day.  With this product I just blow dried my hair, barely ran the flat iron over it (spent about 1/3 the usual time) and then it stayed straight and most importantly FRIZZ FREE for three days with the only maintenance being brushing it when I woke up each day.  I&#x27;m on day 5 now and after having washed it I still have used no other products and I&#x27;d say maybe 20% of my frizz has returned, but I have put almost no effort into getting ready.  This product is amazing, and I plan to buy the rest of the line very soon.  You won&#x27;t believe how good the results are!</li>
            <li> Dealing with iron infused, calcium/lime laden well water makes it hard to manage your hair. Brazilian Smooth is a must have product.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as expected in DC humidity.  But for most purposes it worked OK.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  I have insanely frizzy wavey hair &amp; this product keeps my hair straight and frizz free for days! It even keeps my hair from getting that horrible hair band wave when I pull it back. This product also helps reduce the frizz and define/smooth my curls when I don&#x27;t blow dry &amp; straighten my hair. I was really bummed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore but got 3 bottles on Amazon that should last a really long time since you don&#x27;t have to use a ton every application.</li>
            <li> I admit I was a little skeptical about the product, as I found it in Walgreen&#x27;s clearance section. Since I&#x27;ve used other fx products, I gave it a shot. First of all let me say that I do wash and condition my hair prior to using this, but I do not use a leave in conditioner. Then I towel dry my hair and spray this evenly throughout my hair. Next I blow dry. Then flat iron my hair with no additional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straight style lasts about 5 days for me as I no longer use relaxers in my hair. I&#x27;m sure it would last at least seven days as stated if I wrap my hair every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I could find it in the store.</li>
            <li> Works great! Heads and shoulders above more expensive and better known brands. My hair is similar to one of the reviewers, lots of waves in multiple directions, medium length, medium texture, and fairly thick with major frizz in humidity. Five or so spritzes of FX, a comb, through,  a quick blow dry, and a finish with a hot iron, and my hair is sleek, smooth, shiny, and stays that way until I wash it again. FX has almost no scent. The only caveat, as with any other hair product, don&#x27;t use too much, it will make your hair slightly gummy. I&#x27;ve used it after using a daily conditioner and did notice a difference. Stellar product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is some great stuff I tried this the other week it worked good I&#x27;m natural n it last in my hair for 7 days it was bouncy n it stretch my hair I have long hair my co worker thought I had weave in my hair it&#x27;s a great product I just use the spray I don&#x27;t use that other stuff</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair and have done the expensive keratin treatments.  This product works every bit as good without the cost or time at the salon. Now I can wear my hair curley when I want, or use brazilian smooth when&lt;br /&gt; I want it straight. Its the best of both with brazilian smooth. It wont weigh ur hair down either. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. It also smells horrendous. I had very healthy 3c-4a hair. I bought this with the intention of simply straightening my hair and keeping it straight for at least a week, because you know, the bottle says 7 days straight. Boy was I/it wrong.  One year later, my hair had STILL not reverted back into it&#x27;s original curl pattern. I tried everything to remove this product from my hair. I eventually had to do a big chop. Never again will I use this or any straightening cream. Now (2years after destroying my beautiful curls with this product) my hair is healthy and very curly again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand this product, nor it&#x27;s directions.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate and even my fine, slightly wavy hair gets frizzy shortly after walking out the door.  I tried this because of the price and was I ever pleased with the results!  My fine hair feels thicker and fuller and I have no frizz to deal with at all!  To the person who said that you can&#x27;t use with conditioner.....that IS what the instructions say, but I still condition and this product seems to work just fine.  Well worth the money - I am stocking up!</li>
            <li> I have thick but thin strands of hair. I always have to flat iron my hair  to straighten it otherwise I wake up looking like Chaka Khan every morning. I put this stuff on after my shower, and I woke up the next day and my hair is soft and not frizzy at all!  I can&#x27;t wait to try it on before I flat iron it....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have natural, 4b, super-thick hair and this stuff works great! I like it much better than the Chi 44 flat iron spray I paid double for. Because my hair is so thick, but pretty dry and kinky, I do use a little conditioner on my hair. I section my hair and let it air dry, then I spray each section with this right before flat-ironing and my hair is silkier and bouncier than it ever was with a permanent relaxer. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have a lot of fine hair. It has a little wave to it and some frizz around my roots. It&#x27;s also a little dry from coloring it. I have tried so many products to make my hair shiny and frizz free but while some might make it shiny, they actually made it appear more dirty/greasy looking with my blonde hair. And even fewer products tackled the frizz issue! Also, every product I have tried weighed my hair down. The best product I found that \\&quot;somewhat\\&quot; covered all these issues is Chi Silk Infusion. And then one day, I saw this and thought I would give it a try. I was so impressed and shocked that I found \\&quot;hair heaven\\&quot; in a bottle! I am beyond thrilled to find it on Amazon, because when I ran out and needed a new bottle, I went to Wal-Mart where I had been purchasing it and was heartbroken to not find it! It is the most awesome hair product ever and the price is great! I absolutely love how my hair looks now. It is so soft, shiny and frizz free, without being weighed down! I just hope it will always be available! I am almost tempted to stock up heavily for fear they stop making it. I would be a very, very sad little girl if they did!</li>
            <li> I found this in the clearance section at Walgreen&#x27;s, and grabbed it because I figured it couldn&#x27;t be bad for a couple of bucks.  Now I swear by the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is what stylists call \\&quot;fine but lots of it\\&quot;, and mostly straight (with an aggravating 80&#x27;s porn star body wave in multiple directions).  I have flat ironed my hair since 1990 when I had to bastardize a crimping iron to do so, just to get that ultra-straight, sleek look that is all the rage now (yeah, I was ahead of the game on that score!).  I&#x27;ve spent most of my life in muggy environments (the fog in San Francisco, the humidity in Italy), which is the BANE of sleek hair everywhere.  I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on expensive stuff and THIS cheapie formula is the one I totally live by, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, DON&#x27;T use conditioner - it will help some even if you do, but you won&#x27;t get the same level of results.  My iron only goes up to 390F, and it works fine.  Other than that, follow the directions.  Iron carefully and thoroughly.  If you want to, add a little argan oil to the very tips afterwards.  My result: that heavy, liquid glossy hair that flows over your palm when held instead of sticking out like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I moved to an extremely dry environment (Alaska).  If I skip this stuff for a wash or two, my hair gets an absolutely ridiculous amount of static; I feel like a Tesla experiment.  Using this stuff keeps it sleek and static-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t review stuff as a general thing, but I am a fan of this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC! I have very untamed hair that is super frizzy and very thick. This stuff makes it look like I just left a salon and without salon prices! I recommend this to ALL of my friends with frizzy hair. We all love it! Just wish I could still find it in a local store!</li>
            <li> I admit that I am the type of person who sees a cheap beauty product, knows it probably won&#x27;t work but hopes for the best anyway and buys it. That being said I wasn&#x27;t suprised by the let down.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I dont like the fact that I can&#x27;t use conditioner with it. I have fine hair but I have alot (and I mean ALOT) of it, and it breaks very easily so conditioner is a must if I even want to think of brushing it... The only plus of this product however is that it makes a fantastic detangler. My brush glided through my hair like butter after spraying it on. Although once I blowdried my hair it was very stringy feeling and coarse, yet my roots felt oily. My hair gets oily quick enough as it is, I don&#x27;t need to add on to it. It didnt even make my crimpy/wavy/frizzy mass of hair any more relaxed. If anything it seemed to have gotten worse.&lt;br /&gt;When I straightened it, it smelled aweful and my hair smelled like smoke until my hair was washed again. Once I finished my hair looked like someone slapped bacon grease on my head, and having to turn my straightener up so high fried bits of my hair. Hell, my straightener couldnt even go as high as the recomended temp (thank GOD)!&lt;br /&gt;The very next day it rained, so I walked to school with my umbrella. My hair wasnt untouched by the rain yet once I got to class my hair was ALL F@#%ED! It looked like a straighten hadn&#x27;t even touched it.&lt;br /&gt;Despite these things, I still gave it a go for the rest of the week. Still didnt do much. I&#x27;ve tried using less in my hair, using more, nothing changed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall dissatisfied, but hey like I said, kinda knew what I was in for.</li>
            <li> I use this product to help straighten my hair and curb the frizz. It works as it says. It works much better than Frizz Ease 3day and is less than half the cost. You spray it in after you shampoo and if you want to condition after you spray this in. Even if you let your hair air dry after, your hair is much smoother than without. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  My daughter has 4c hair and using this product on her hair before flat ironing gets her hair bone straight.  When used with Organix dry styling hydrating macadamia, works wonders.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair stink and as I put it in my daughters hair when she came home from school she went to cheer and when she showered it smelt terrible she washed her hair several times worst product ever</li>
            <li> great product.  smooths hair instantly.  love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great. My hair gets frizzy after a blow dry and this kept it straighter and frizz free until the next wash.</li>
            <li> This product REALLY works!  I was a tad concerned about the no conditioner thing, but my hair wasnt dry at all.  My hair is super soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> This works fairly well if used as directed, but the hair feels stiffer and sometimes sticky after 24-48 hours after application.</li>
