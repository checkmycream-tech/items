            <li>Portable, I very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I &#x60;m very happy ..</li>
            <li>Excellent seller.</li>
            <li>The product itself is good quality and meets my expectations.  </li>
            <li>can increase it any time I want wich is good.</li>
            <li>Well packaged and arrived in good time.  </li>
            <li>was the one that sparks a lot - good thing it&#x27;s supposed to do that!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the device a lot, but after two weeks it stopped working.</li>
            <li>Its handy and works well.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if I use it faithfully I&#x27;ll see some kind of results.</li>
            <li>WE LOVE IT.Great price and beautifully packaged, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and I am pleased to be able to have one in my own home.</li>
            <li>A wise purchase at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>but have a feeling will need to buy some more electrodes-</li>
            <li>But, when you just have to pop that zit,make sure you zap it with this after.  </li>
            <li>New Spa is a great company company to deal with and I have bought many of their products and have never been dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I ordered the product and received it more quickly than promised.  </li>
            <li>On the good side, the product arrived early and the seller was very quick to answer any questions I had.  </li>
            <li>for they are glase made and filled with gas could just brake while inserting them into the devise.</li>
            <li>All of the attachments perform as described in the instruction manual which is very informative on how to use this product effectively.</li>
            <li>My esthetician recommended I get one of these for regular care of my skin, and works great to me.</li>
            <li>SO BE GENTLE!!!</li>
            <li>the seller is very good also - split the shipment in half .</li>
            <li>it arrived nicely packaged and very professional looking.</li>
            <li>The comb attachment is excellent for waking up a tired feeling scalp.</li>
            <li>so I handle them very gently.</li>
            <li>It helps tightens aged skin and charges the air with ozone that smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I probably have to use it more consistently to see some obvious changes on my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Will recommend this to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a replacement via warranty and had the same problem.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who is interested in an additional routine to help tone their skin.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Seems to actually help breakouts heal faster, which is always a plus. :)</li>
            <li>But it really does work.  </li>
            <li>The results depend on how much time you decide to put into maintenance.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it enough to give a full answer</li>
            <li>if I have more information I will come back in at it later.</li>
            <li>My mother runs skin care salons in Colorado and has been using high frequency machines for over twenty years.</li>
            <li>We have been fine with ours, but friends who have bought this sadly jammed the implement in too far to the wand or used too much force and they broke.</li>
            <li>Now, I use this product only rarely since I no longer have acne issues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s took a long time to get it and takes more longer to get the money back.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you it seems to live up to its advertising.</li>
            <li>Too early to review the effectivity...</li>
            <li>I did try all 4 pieces and the only 1 that really scared me</li>
            <li>I am currently avoiding New Spa products.</li>
            <li>One thing is not good - the storing box is filled with sponge like filling to prevent electrodes from braking - and those electrodes would need some more serious storing compartment.  </li>
            <li>So i took he plunge and bought this one... not much of a plunge as it was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>When it has already broken out, within 2 treatments, the breakout is mostly healed.  </li>
            <li>it s hard to say if it works yet, i still have to use it for a few more months .</li>

            <li> My daughter has reached the lovely teen years and finds her skin breaking out from time to time,as my mother lives several states away going to her for the HF machine was not an option and the salons locally charge crazy prices for treatments.</li>
            <li> In short, I purchased one of these models and it lasted approximately a week&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li> The product is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black male that gets a few shaving bumps that i used to had to use alcohol to treat but with the wand I dont have to be concerned about over-drying my face anymore.</li>
            <li> This product was helpful for my acne issues after I changed my acne treatment serum and some other lifestyle changes.</li>
            <li> but if it works for wrinkles and other things - is benefitial too</li>
            <li> Home remedies and all other acne remedies would work.  </li>
            <li> My teenager has severe acne and the facial spa and dermatologist where she gets her monthly deep cleansing facials use the professional (read very expensive) version of this type of machine on them.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product now for almost over one month and a half.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to receive a low quality thing that does little or no job done because of the low price .</li>
            <li> (the base unit is NOT fragile and very well made).  </li>
            <li> It works well in spite of some bad reviews that I saw previously.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not see any results yet.</li>
            <li> You can not be wrong.</li>
            <li> The machines are VERY expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to contact seller now, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I ordered the product and received it more quickly than promised.  The product itself is good quality and meets my expectations.  I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for almost over one month and a half. I bought it to treat my acne. Unfortunately, I did not see any results yet. I am still using the product, and will review again after a month if it helps with my acne. On the good side, the product arrived early and the seller was very quick to answer any questions I had.  Update: This product was helpful for my acne issues after I changed my acne treatment serum and some other lifestyle changes. It helps penetrate the product deep into your skin. Now, I use this product only rarely since I no longer have acne issues.</li>
            <li> Portable, I very happy with the product. I have been using it for 3 months. I recomend this product. You can not be wrong.</li>
            <li> My mother runs skin care salons in Colorado and has been using high frequency machines for over twenty years. The machines are VERY expensive. My daughter has reached the lovely teen years and finds her skin breaking out from time to time,as my mother lives several states away going to her for the HF machine was not an option and the salons locally charge crazy prices for treatments. So i took he plunge and bought this one... not much of a plunge as it was very inexpensive. WE LOVE IT.Great price and beautifully packaged, easy to use. I use it for skin toning and it works a treat. BUT BEWARE&gt;&gt;&gt; ON ALL OF THESE MACHINES THE GLASS IMPLEMENTS ARE VERY FRAGILE!!! We have been fine with ours, but friends who have bought this sadly jammed the implement in too far to the wand or used too much force and they broke. SO BE GENTLE!!!</li>
            <li> Too early to review the effectivity...it did minimize the pores though but hair and cellulite changes are not noted yet. No complains about shipping and product status</li>
            <li> I liked the device a lot, but after two weeks it stopped working. I&#x27;m trying to contact seller now, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My teenager has severe acne and the facial spa and dermatologist where she gets her monthly deep cleansing facials use the professional (read very expensive) version of this type of machine on them.  This unit has helped her skin immensely within a very short period of time (2 weeks).  My only concern is the fragility of the wands but with care I hope that we can keep them in use for a while (the base unit is NOT fragile and very well made).  If not, I will purchase replacement wands and should it be necessary the entire unit again too.  It is a good product and I am pleased to be able to have one in my own home.</li>
            <li> I got this machine with low expectations.  But it really does work.  I mostly use it for acne breakouts.  When it has already broken out, within 2 treatments, the breakout is mostly healed.  If you can catch them before they form, one treatment will take care of it.</li>
            <li> The product is what I expected. It works well in spite of some bad reviews that I saw previously. I probably have to use it more consistently to see some obvious changes on my skin. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to receive a low quality thing that does little or no job done because of the low price . I&#x60;ve just tried using the mashine - it works fine-produces the same sensation on the skin like in the dermatologist office.even the ozon smel betweemn the electrode and the skin .The description of the item does not explain about ability of the intensity of  power frequency .I can increase it any time I want wich is good. By the way I bought it for the acne treatment but if it works for wrinkles and other things - is benefitial too One thing is not good - the storing box is filled with sponge like filling to prevent electrodes from braking - and those electrodes would need some more serious storing compartment.  the seller is very good also - split the shipment in half . I &#x60;m very happy .. but have a feeling will need to buy some more electrodes- for they are glase made and filled with gas could just brake while inserting them into the devise.</li>
            <li> Home remedies and all other acne remedies would work.  But, when you just have to pop that zit,make sure you zap it with this after.  Its handy and works well.  Well packaged and arrived in good time.  Will recommend this to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> In short, I purchased one of these models and it lasted approximately a week&#x27;s worth of use. I was able to get a replacement via warranty and had the same problem. I am currently avoiding New Spa products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything got this for my hair and have been using for a year now and hasn&#x27;t helped</li>
            <li> I have noticed a revitalization of my epidermis and expect this trend to continue. All of the attachments perform as described in the instruction manual which is very informative on how to use this product effectively. I would recommend to anyone who is interested in an additional routine to help tone their skin. I&#x27;m a black male that gets a few shaving bumps that i used to had to use alcohol to treat but with the wand I dont have to be concerned about over-drying my face anymore. The comb attachment is excellent for waking up a tired feeling scalp. A wise purchase at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I use this for everything 5 minutes a day after my shower I apply lotion and use the mushroom head. It helps tightens aged skin and charges the air with ozone that smells amazing. I use to comb to help my hair grow and stimulate my scalp. I also use the mushroom on my hands and feet for diabetic nueropathy and it has help to restore my feeling somewhat but you have to stick with it. The results depend on how much time you decide to put into maintenance. Only use 20 minutes and then you have to unplug and rest. New Spa is a great company company to deal with and I have bought many of their products and have never been dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does. It&#x27;s easy to use. I can sit and watch television while applying to different areas.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this item to see how well it worked at home. it arrived nicely packaged and very professional looking. I opened it up and read all of the instructions and then it was time to use it. I have read some reviews stating the glass tools were very fragile so I handle them very gently. I did try all 4 pieces and the only 1 that really scared me was the one that sparks a lot - good thing it&#x27;s supposed to do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give a full answer but I can tell you it seems to live up to its advertising. if I have more information I will come back in at it later.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller. Came as ordered! 100% Recommended. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I have bought this item from Germany, because of German Customer duty i couldn&#x27;t get it. They said it Not allowed in German and send it back. It&#x27;s took a long time to get it and takes more longer to get the money back.</li>
            <li> This was a product I purchased and can&#x27;t remember why.  I think I&#x27;ve used it a couple times (on my scalp)since I&#x27;ve had it.  That&#x27;s what it is - it&#x27;s supposed to stimulate the scalp for healthier hair and hair growth.  I guess it&#x27;s one of those things where you can say &amp;#34;I have that&amp;#34;.  Maybe if I use it faithfully I&#x27;ll see some kind of results.</li>
            <li> it s hard to say if it works yet, i still have to use it for a few more months . i do notice a tingeling electric senstation.. so im assuming its working ???</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended I get one of these for regular care of my skin, and works great to me. Seems to actually help breakouts heal faster, which is always a plus. :)</li>
