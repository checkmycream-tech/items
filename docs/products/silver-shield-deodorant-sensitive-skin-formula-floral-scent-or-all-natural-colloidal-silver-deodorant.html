            <li>you think you can get away with, solves this problem mostly.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work ok as a deodorant, but it darkened the skin under my arms.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t make it out :]</li>
            <li>I almost think I would have been better off using nothing.</li>
            <li>Others have had better luck with this one, so maybe this formula just disagreed with my body chemistry or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use the whole product line everything smells great and does do its job.</li>
            <li>This is the only product with excellent results!</li>
            <li>Smelled good at first, till I applied it.</li>
            <li>I think the original formula keeps the stink at bay slightly better, but overall I&#x27;m impressed with this formula</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural as well, which is great, and will not cause any of the health problems that anti-perspirants can cause&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also purchased the original formula, which had a better, nontoxic aroma to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>And a genuine bonus of using Silver Shield is the responsive company that manufactures it.</li>
            <li>This American-made natural and non-toxic deodorant is an excellent alternative to potentially-damaging mainstream aluminium-based products, many of which also yellow and cake shirt armpits over time.</li>
            <li>I have just now ordered the &#x27;lightly&#x27; scented (to me</li>
            <li>I bought it because I wanted a product that was aluminum free.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find out that this deodorant actually works.</li>
            <li>It is a great anti-perspirant--it totally works for me.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered this as another measure of protection from germs and disease as well as desiring to use aluminum &amp; petrochemical free deodorant.</li>
            <li>Best of all, this will-on is refillable, so you can be a supporter of green initiatives too!</li>
            <li>the original formula.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t combat odor after more than an hour or so...disappointed again after trying a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>The floral scent is pleasant, however it dissipates after a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>but you can also purchase refills - economical and environmentally friendly - and made right here in Texas, wahoo!</li>
            <li>But after letting it dry on, the smell fades to a nice light floral smell.</li>
            <li>I used the original formula the first night after receipt and found my underarms not so nice smelling in the morning...did not last.</li>
            <li>That being said I have recommended this to all of my family and friends who like to use more natural products.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, fresh floral</li>
            <li>I decided to go with something more natural and ordered this.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $10.</li>
            <li>I can apply that in the morning and still feel totally fresh until bedtime.</li>
            <li>Okay so like most people I am trying to keep parabins down and NO aluminum or titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li>I have probably not been sweating as much because I haven&#x27;t been as nervous and self conscious when I&#x27;m around others for fear of them being able to smell my armpits.</li>
            <li>I learned that my Sensitive Skin Formula was in the main effective during a normal eight-hour period, but that Original Formula was recommended for longer days and unusual stresses; like the horror of giving a speech before an audience....</li>
            <li>With Silver Shield, I only have to apply in the morning and it keeps me fresh and clean smelling ALL day!  </li>
            <li>Peaceful Patchouli still is the number one pick for me...</li>
            <li>and sure enough it did</li>
            <li>I took off a star, because this product absolutely burns if applied to freshly shaved armpits.  </li>
            <li>I love the Silver Shield deodorant and I have yet to have any BO since I began using last summer of 2013</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Who wants their skin to be darker there than the rest of their body!  </li>
            <li>Having read that 99% of women with breast cancer have chemicals in their breast tissue from deodorants I went looking for a better deodorant for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>Over the years, i&#x27;ve purchased, and used many different types of so called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants, which do not contain aluminium.</li>
            <li>NONE WORKED WELL ENOUGH TO CONTROL ODOUR, FOR MORE THAN 3-4 HOURS.</li>
            <li>You may expect remarkably positive results from Silver Shield, whether you choose this milder formulation designed for sensitive skin or the full-strength Original Formula.</li>
            <li>After using for several weeks I was in heaven with no painful lymph nodes nor any rashes, these were gone...!  </li>
            <li>I normally buy their products at a local farmers market in Texas, but love that they carry it online now for the days</li>
            <li>I tried everything: Botox, certain dri, milk of magnesia, lemon, hibiclens, mouthwash and alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, however, so it does irritate a bit if I put it on right after shaving</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found (and I spent 2 years trying every single one that I could find) that actually works, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but that was to much work.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps odor away very well.  </li>
            <li>Different scents are available.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t remember why</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really comment on effectiveness as I had to wash it off after 10 mins.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out with this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>As many of my close intimate friends know I kicked traditional deodorant/antipersperants to the curb six years ago, but battled finding an all natural product that worked as well as the chemical infused products do at controlling odor.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have tried other aluminum free deodorants but nothing worked as well as Silver Shield.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, and had high hopes since it says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin; however, after a couple of days of using it, my skin was bright red and in serious pain.</li>
            <li>and I live in a hot and dry 100</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money again.</li>
            <li>Kiss My Face Natural Liquid Rock....</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, stay away from this.</li>
            <li>I got this with the sensitive skin version, even.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had nothing to lose by trying the Silver Shield sensitive floral scent.  </li>
            <li>also have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural deoderant/antiperspirant for almost a year.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive when it comes to deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands I found at Whole Foods, but they did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>not work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I am all about using natural products lately.  </li>
            <li>On this particular product, the wetness dissipates quickly enough not to notice it.</li>
            <li>Now even though I gave it a little bit of a sweat test the true test will be how it performs in the summer heat.</li>
            <li>There are plenty out there that fulfill the deoderant end, but until I found Silver Shield there were none that really kept me dry.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I have quite sensitive skin and several mainstream and natural deodorants have made me break out.  </li>
            <li>Silver Shield protects you and your clothes equally well--this is a first-class natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>I will have a do a bit more research on whether silver has any negative effects on the body, but for now, I will keep with it!  </li>
            <li>a slight tingle if you use it right after you shave.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the silver ingredient kills bacteria that produce the odor.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend if you are searching for natural alternatives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several natural, aluminum-free deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Based on other Amazon reviewers, I decided to give this a shot, not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Arm and Hammer natural deodorant for a while now and thought I was doing a good thing for my body until I read that one of the ingredients in the Arm and Hammer deodorant (the tetrasodium EDTA I think) is just as bad as aluminum in regular deodorants.</li>
            <li>I recently spoke with one of the firm&#x27;s principal executives, a thoughtful fellow who spent fifteen minutes explaining in layman&#x27;s terms why Silver Shield works so well.</li>
            <li>And because even small amounts of aluminium applied to the skin in deodorant form reputedly cause brain damage, it is worth considering products that do not rely on the stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff has significantly cut down odor and while it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, it has also cut down on sweat.</li>
            <li>The people behind Silver Botanicals are creating these products with a passion, and I love supporting local small businesses.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any woman, and any other product to anyone else!</li>

            <li> not work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I am all about using natural products lately.  </li>
            <li> On this particular product, the wetness dissipates quickly enough not to notice it.</li>
            <li> Now even though I gave it a little bit of a sweat test the true test will be how it performs in the summer heat.</li>
            <li> There are plenty out there that fulfill the deoderant end, but until I found Silver Shield there were none that really kept me dry.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I have quite sensitive skin and several mainstream and natural deodorants have made me break out.  </li>
            <li> Silver Shield protects you and your clothes equally well--this is a first-class natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> I will have a do a bit more research on whether silver has any negative effects on the body, but for now, I will keep with it!  </li>
            <li> a slight tingle if you use it right after you shave.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the silver ingredient kills bacteria that produce the odor.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if you are searching for natural alternatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural, aluminum-free deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Based on other Amazon reviewers, I decided to give this a shot, not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arm and Hammer natural deodorant for a while now and thought I was doing a good thing for my body until I read that one of the ingredients in the Arm and Hammer deodorant (the tetrasodium EDTA I think) is just as bad as aluminum in regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> I recently spoke with one of the firm&#x27;s principal executives, a thoughtful fellow who spent fifteen minutes explaining in layman&#x27;s terms why Silver Shield works so well.</li>
            <li> And because even small amounts of aluminium applied to the skin in deodorant form reputedly cause brain damage, it is worth considering products that do not rely on the stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff has significantly cut down odor and while it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, it has also cut down on sweat.</li>
            <li> The people behind Silver Botanicals are creating these products with a passion, and I love supporting local small businesses.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any woman, and any other product to anyone else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with some of the other &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants over the years when I stopped using commercial deodorants about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple other \\&quot;natural, no aluminums\\&quot; products, but they did not provide protection that lasted a day.</li>
            <li> It is not enough protection for sports or the gym, but gets me through long stressful days at work.  </li>
            <li> Like all liquid roll-on deodorants, you do need to allow enough time for it to dry before getting dressed.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, I had the slight rashes which went away after awhile.  </li>
            <li> As of late, certain ones and been causing itching and irritation under my arms.</li>
            <li> Silver Shield ensures that its users get dependable performance during a long day&#x27;s work, without fear of being diminished by toxic substances.</li>
            <li> I have been using otc deodorants for a long time.  </li>
            <li> ALL DAY LONG no issues with odor.</li>
            <li> Silver Shield replaced an essentially benign natural mineral salt deodorant that suddenly caused a serious rash, after twelve months of trouble-free usage.</li>
            <li> once I&#x27;m dry.</li>
            <li> I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> Long story short it will give you about a day and a half of protection before it starts to wear off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also seems to keep me dry, even though it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant !</li>
            <li> I could add a few drops of essential oil under my pits Like 21 drops or something</li>
            <li> This is not really an antiperspirant and your body is supposed to sweat</li>
            <li> I have always preferred to utilise deodorant sticks over roll ons, as i do not like the \\&quot;wet feeling\\</li>
            <li> Small price to pay, however, for a product which actually does what it is says and is free of dangerous products.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been sitting on my dresser with my other deodorants.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> Colloidal Silver was the active ingredient in one of my wound care products.</li>
            <li> Both the commercial and some of the &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants would give me painful lymph nodes as well as rashes under the pits as well with my suffering from MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivities).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using less product, the lowest</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little pricey bu</li>
            <li> Once it dried the burning subsided.</li>
            <li> Something simpler, like the Crystal Stick deodorant won&#x27;t keep the odor away through heavy sweating, but also won&#x27;t cause a rash.</li>
            <li> I had tried everything to find something that was natural, worked well and wasn&#x27;t irritating to my skin, and I am so thankful that I found this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced such a bad sting from any deodorant before, even right after shaving.  </li>
            <li> so I usually apply once in the am</li>
            <li> I can usually get through a 12-hour shift at work without having to re-apply it.</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s that time of the month I can get smelly a lot faster than usual and this held up through both of those things.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> No odour, or sweating for at least 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> this product is expensive and does not work for me, too bad because of the positive remarks from people.</li>
            <li> I seriously started to smell like foccacia and this is supposed to be a floral scent.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> When I first smelled it, I thought it had a terrible lemongrass scent.  </li>
            <li> It keeps you from smelling, by killing the bacteria that causes the odor, and making them unable to grow.</li>
            <li> Buy it without hesitation, and you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This one is awful.  </li>
            <li> It was awful!</li>

            <li> This is it! I suffer from hyperhidrosis AND brohmhidrosis and this is the only thing that has worked for me. I tried everything: Botox, certain dri, milk of magnesia, lemon, hibiclens, mouthwash and alcohol. Now I use hibiclens in shower and this once I&#x27;m dry. I shower in the morning and night and use this both times. This stuff has significantly cut down odor and while it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, it has also cut down on sweat. I have probably not been sweating as much because I haven&#x27;t been as nervous and self conscious when I&#x27;m around others for fear of them being able to smell my armpits. If you&#x27;ve tried everything like me, might as well give this stuff a try. I think you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> This stuff works quite well! I think the original formula keeps the stink at bay slightly better, but overall I&#x27;m impressed with this formula and I like the smell. If I could get the smell of this stuff and the strength of the original formula, I&#x27;d be a happy camper! :)</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t combat odor after more than an hour or so...disappointed again after trying a more natural deodorant. about to just&lt;br /&gt;go back to aluminum chlorhydrate at this point.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> This formula smells rancid! I would not waste my money again. Returning it. I also purchased the original formula, which had a better, nontoxic aroma to it. They both left a white residue, so won&#x27;t be using either during the summer months. Even though this formula is for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin, it burned upon application. Once it dried the burning subsided. I used the original formula the first night after receipt and found my underarms not so nice smelling in the morning...did not last. Kiss My Face Natural Liquid Rock....Peaceful Patchouli still is the number one pick for me...at this time. I can go 2 to 3 days without reapplying.</li>
            <li> You may expect remarkably positive results from Silver Shield, whether you choose this milder formulation designed for sensitive skin or the full-strength Original Formula. Silver Shield replaced an essentially benign natural mineral salt deodorant that suddenly caused a serious rash, after twelve months of trouble-free usage. Colloidal Silver was the active ingredient in one of my wound care products. Following the chance discovery of a Silver Shield advert, I decided to investigate colloidal silver deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no aluminium in Silver Shield botanical deodorants. And because even small amounts of aluminium applied to the skin in deodorant form reputedly cause brain damage, it is worth considering products that do not rely on the stuff. But of course effectiveness must not be compromised, and millions of persons simply will not accept second-rate results in favour of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; alternatives to aluminium-based deodorants. Silver Shield ensures that its users get dependable performance during a long day&#x27;s work, without fear of being diminished by toxic substances. And a genuine bonus of using Silver Shield is the responsive company that manufactures it. I recently spoke with one of the firm&#x27;s principal executives, a thoughtful fellow who spent fifteen minutes explaining in layman&#x27;s terms why Silver Shield works so well. I learned that my Sensitive Skin Formula was in the main effective during a normal eight-hour period, but that Original Formula was recommended for longer days and unusual stresses; like the horror of giving a speech before an audience.... This American-made natural and non-toxic deodorant is an excellent alternative to potentially-damaging mainstream aluminium-based products, many of which also yellow and cake shirt armpits over time. Silver Shield protects you and your clothes equally well--this is a first-class natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> When I hit menopause, I could not find any deodorant/antiperspirant that would work....this stuff is wonderful!  It does not block the sweat, but it kills the odor.  Apparently, the silver ingredient kills bacteria that produce the odor.  I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and had high hopes since it says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin; however, after a couple of days of using it, my skin was bright red and in serious pain. If you have sensitive skin, stay away from this.</li>
            <li> Excellent - works wonders on shaving bumps as well!</li>
            <li> Okay so like most people I am trying to keep parabins down and NO aluminum or titanium dioxide. I used a silver shield gel for a couple of days to see if it could in fact control the b.o. and sure enough it did but there was no smell to it. Granted I could add a few drops of essential oil under my pits Like 21 drops or something but that was to much work. I had tried all the crystal deodorants and found they worked for like an hour and then I had to reapply. The only time I need to reapply this is if I eat a lot of garlic( which of course I do ) so I usually apply once in the am and then about 4pm and I am good till morning. This is not really an antiperspirant and your body is supposed to sweat but I am not that vain unless I am dressed up. That being said I have recommended this to all of my family and friends who like to use more natural products. Will be purchasing the refill size shortly.</li>
            <li> As many of my close intimate friends know I kicked traditional deodorant/antipersperants to the curb six years ago, but battled finding an all natural product that worked as well as the chemical infused products do at controlling odor. Well I am here to endorse the best all natural product I&#x27;ve ever found and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Best of all, this will-on is refillable, so you can be a supporter of green initiatives too!</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for me.  You may want to give it a try, but for me, it was a flop.  It gave a burning sensation when used.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but after apply around 9, I could always smell myself by noon. I&#x27;m not a big sweater either.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keeps you from smelling, by killing the bacteria that causes the odor, and making them unable to grow. It&#x27;s 100% natural as well, which is great, and will not cause any of the health problems that anti-perspirants can cause&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that you really only need a teeny tiny bit, and if you use more, you will (at least I do) start to get a rash/irritation that won&#x27;t go away until you stop using the product for a few days. I got this with the sensitive skin version, even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using less product, the lowest you think you can get away with, solves this problem mostly. Something simpler, like the Crystal Stick deodorant won&#x27;t keep the odor away through heavy sweating, but also won&#x27;t cause a rash. I keep both products on-hand, always</li>
            <li> I like the smell, fresh floral but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If non-aluminum deoderants work for you, than this may do the trick, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the silver ingredient of this deodorant and decided to try it out.  The floral scent is pleasant, however it dissipates after a short period of time.  Like all liquid roll-on deodorants, you do need to allow enough time for it to dry before getting dressed.  I am impressed by the odor control of this product. It is not enough protection for sports or the gym, but gets me through long stressful days at work.  I took off a star, because this product absolutely burns if applied to freshly shaved armpits.  I&#x27;ve never experienced such a bad sting from any deodorant before, even right after shaving.  This will sting for several hours and it has even left me with red irritation marks.  Others may or may not have this problem...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with some of the other &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants over the years when I stopped using commercial deodorants about 8 years ago.  Both the commercial and some of the &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants would give me painful lymph nodes as well as rashes under the pits as well with my suffering from MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivities).  I also have autoimmune diseases.  I had nothing to lose by trying the Silver Shield sensitive floral scent.  The first few times I used it, I had the slight rashes which went away after awhile.  After using for several weeks I was in heaven with no painful lymph nodes nor any rashes, these were gone...!  I went and order two bottles of 2X refill.  I have just now ordered the &#x27;lightly&#x27; scented (to me it smells like it is almost unscented...I had bought trial bottles to try from the company and this was one I had ordered to see if I could tolerate the smell) deodorant plus 2X refill bottle for this.  I love the Silver Shield deodorant and I have yet to have any BO since I began using last summer of 2013 and I live in a hot and dry 100+ F Arizona...!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best natural deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used. I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t a waste of my money.  It keeps odor away very well.  I can usually get through a 12-hour shift at work without having to re-apply it.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this as another measure of protection from germs and disease as well as desiring to use aluminum &amp; petrochemical free deodorant. I am very pleased with Silver Shield and will order again.</li>
            <li> Silver Shield Deodorant is really good. I bought it because I wanted a product that was aluminum free. Aluminum can stain clothing. Anyway, I have tried other aluminum free deodorants but nothing worked as well as Silver Shield. I purchased it because it had some very good reviews. It has a very light, floral scent, that isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to keep me dry, even though it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant ! Give it a shot if you&#x27;re looking for aluminum free.&lt;br /&gt;I also have extremely sensitive skin and I&#x27;m not having any problems with burning/stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a slight tingle if you use it right after you shave.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find out that this deodorant actually works. I have tried multiple other \\&quot;natural, no aluminums\\&quot; products, but they did not provide protection that lasted a day. I have been using it for 1 month and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using otc deodorants for a long time.  As of late, certain ones and been causing itching and irritation under my arms. I decided to go with something more natural and ordered this.  Yes, it is a little pricey bu a little goes a long way.  Different scents are available.  This does not irritate and provides exceptional coverage.  Very happy with this purchase and I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural deoderant/antiperspirant for almost a year.  There are plenty out there that fulfill the deoderant end, but until I found Silver Shield there were none that really kept me dry.  It is a great anti-perspirant--it totally works for me.  It is pricey, but it works so well for me that I will continue purchasing until I find a comparable product.  Also, it stings if you apply after shaving.  However, I have found if you shake it before applying that it eliminates the stinging.  Definitely recommend if you are searching for natural alternatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this deodorant for a while. The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t like it. I really don&#x27;t remember why but it&#x27;s been sitting on my dresser with my other deodorants. I&#x27;ve been using Arm and Hammer natural deodorant for a while now and thought I was doing a good thing for my body until I read that one of the ingredients in the Arm and Hammer deodorant (the tetrasodium EDTA I think) is just as bad as aluminum in regular deodorants. So I was looking up colloidal silver spray on amazon so I could use that as deodorant and I remembered I had this deodorant. I decided to give it a try again...and I&#x27;m loving it. I took a shower and put some on and went about my day. ALL DAY LONG no issues with odor. My arm and hammer deodorant only lasts 12 hours. I went to sleep and woke up and gave my underarms a sniff...still no odor. Long story short it will give you about a day and a half of protection before it starts to wear off. I SWEAT and when it&#x27;s that time of the month I can get smelly a lot faster than usual and this held up through both of those things. Now even though I gave it a little bit of a sweat test the true test will be how it performs in the summer heat. If it can withstand me sweating in the summer this is the only deodorant i&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I am all about using natural products lately.  This one is awful.  It seemed to work ok as a deodorant, but it darkened the skin under my arms.  Who wants their skin to be darker there than the rest of their body!  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found (and I spent 2 years trying every single one that I could find) that actually works, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and is well worth the money.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Silver Botanicals! I am extremely sensitive when it comes to deodorant. I had tried everything to find something that was natural, worked well and wasn&#x27;t irritating to my skin, and I am so thankful that I found this!  The people behind Silver Botanicals are creating these products with a passion, and I love supporting local small businesses. I normally buy their products at a local farmers market in Texas, but love that they carry it online now for the days I can&#x27;t make it out :] I highly recommend this to any woman, and any other product to anyone else!</li>
            <li> Smelled good at first, till I applied it. Then after about 2 minutes, I started to smell like thyme or bay leaves or rosemarry or something. It was awful! I seriously started to smell like foccacia and this is supposed to be a floral scent. No thanks! Can&#x27;t really comment on effectiveness as I had to wash it off after 10 mins. Maybe this would be good if they had an unscented version? I might see if the company will exchange me...</li>
            <li> Because I was told by my neurologist to cut out everything with parabens (since they act on estrogen and are carcinogens), I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find a paraben-free and aluminum-free deodorant that actually works.  I&#x27;ve tried several brands I found at Whole Foods, but they did not work for me.  Based on other Amazon reviewers, I decided to give this a shot, not expecting much.  When I first smelled it, I thought it had a terrible lemongrass scent.  But after letting it dry on, the smell fades to a nice light floral smell. And it actually works!  I have very sensitive skin, however, so it does irritate a bit if I put it on right after shaving (so now I wait a bit).  Small price to pay, however, for a product which actually does what it is says and is free of dangerous products.  I will have a do a bit more research on whether silver has any negative effects on the body, but for now, I will keep with it!  Well worth the $10.</li>
            <li> Having read that 99% of women with breast cancer have chemicals in their breast tissue from deodorants I went looking for a better deodorant for my teenage daughter. I use Nivea for Men, Silver Protect (also found here on Amazon) so wanted to find something similar for her. This product fits the bill and then some. Not only do they have three choices for fragrance but you can also purchase refills - economical and environmentally friendly - and made right here in Texas, wahoo! She&#x27;s happy and I&#x27;m happy to get her away from the concoction of chemicals found in most deodorants.</li>
            <li> After concluding that the Silver Shield original formula was the best aluminum-free deodorant was the best I&#x27;d ever tried, I decided to give the floral scent a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not work nearly as well. I&#x27;d apply it in the morning, and by the time I changed after work it was like Armpit Stankville Central. Not good. I almost think I would have been better off using nothing. Others have had better luck with this one, so maybe this formula just disagreed with my body chemistry or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the original formula. I can apply that in the morning and still feel totally fresh until bedtime.</li>
            <li> use the whole product line everything smells great and does do its job.</li>
            <li> Over the years, i&#x27;ve purchased, and used many different types of so called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants, which do not contain aluminium. NONE WORKED WELL ENOUGH TO CONTROL ODOUR, FOR MORE THAN 3-4 HOURS. This is the only product with excellent results! No odour, or sweating for at least 24 hrs. I absolutely love it! I have always preferred to utilise deodorant sticks over roll ons, as i do not like the \\&quot;wet feeling\\&quot; when applied. On this particular product, the wetness dissipates quickly enough not to notice it. Buy it without hesitation, and you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and pleasantly surprised! Gets me through the work day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural, aluminum-free deodorants.  Some have worked fairly well, but I always need to reapply 2 or 3 times a day.  With Silver Shield, I only have to apply in the morning and it keeps me fresh and clean smelling ALL day!  On occasion, I have had to reapply if going out at night.  Additionally, I have quite sensitive skin and several mainstream and natural deodorants have made me break out.  I have not broken out with this product.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this product is expensive and does not work for me, too bad because of the positive remarks from people. I do have pretty&lt;br /&gt;strong bo</li>
