            <li> my hair is too dry for this product.</li>
            <li> It has no offensive odor like the one I had been using and is less costly than the second one I found in the U.S.</li>

            <li> Dried out my hair somewhat but will continue to use to keep the yellow out.</li>
            <li> but if there were other options I would probably not choose this.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother who felt like there might have been a slight difference from buying from a salon.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo, it made my hair feel poor - stringy and almost like it wanted to stretch and break.</li>
            <li> There are definitely worse products out there.</li>
            <li> It sucks !!!!</li>

            <li> came super fast, smells amazing... my hair getting lighter... love it!</li>
            <li> Tried this after hearing great reviews. Personally, I didn&#x27;t like the scent - it almost made me gag. After using the shampoo, it made my hair feel poor - stringy and almost like it wanted to stretch and break. Didn&#x27;t help the color as much as I thought. There are definitely worse products out there. I would use this again if I had to but if there were other options I would probably not choose this.</li>
            <li> my hair is too dry for this product.</li>
            <li> Not a concentrated enough of purple to fight brassiness. The purple is a very light color.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT OT CARE MY NEW LOOK I WILL STOPPED USE THIS PRODUCT, BY THE WAY MY HAIR IS A NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li> It sucks !!!! It was regular shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another product, this is different  quality, different feel, my hair JUST LOOKS GREAT.....at work and in public people just stare and smile, they ask what do us e do and use on your hair and I have recommend PRO-VOKE TOUCH OF SILVER...I&#x27;M A TALL BLACK AFRO-AMERICAN LADY 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; all white in front of part of my hair, and salt and pepper the other parts...MANY THANK-YOU&#x27;S AGAIN...PLEASE MAKE IN LARGER SIZE</li>
            <li> Very good product, I&#x27;m platinum blonde and my natural hair is dark brown.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo, however it smells like detergent.</li>
            <li> it is ok as shampoo....but no effect</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo while traveling in Israel and prefer it to any of the local &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; shampoos in the U.S. It has no offensive odor like the one I had been using and is less costly than the second one I found in the U.S. It can be used every day without turning white hair blue! The only downfall is that I can&#x27;t purchase it at the local store, so I need to plan ahead.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair somewhat but will continue to use to keep the yellow out.</li>
            <li> I think this product works pretty well. However, it took me a month to get it in the mail which really doesn&#x27;t work for me. If you don&#x27;t mind the wait then yes it does do what its suppose to do but for me its to much of a hassle. I won&#x27;t be ordering it again I don&#x27;t think.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. I prefer shimmer lights to this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this shampoo is that it has a nice, particular smell to it,</li>
            <li> excellentresults and shine effect, unlike many other silver shampoos i tried on my highlighted blond hair.</li>
            <li> Great Product and value. Better than anything on the store shelves</li>
            <li> My barber said my hair was the best she has ever seen it since I began using this product. I have silver hair and my water is from a well. With regular shampoo my hair gets brassy very quickly. This product resolved that problem and now my hair sparkles. I&#x27;ve had no problems with dryness and I&#x27;ve had no issues with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best product for us silver, white haired foxes, ha ha, keeps white bright, fantastic product!!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for my chemically treated hair, (platinum/silver).  Use it with the twice a week product.  I just love the bright white look of my hair color.  Wish it was natural.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother who felt like there might have been a slight difference from buying from a salon. Priced fairly and shipped on time but did take awhile.</li>
            <li> Gave this product as a gift to try.  Recipient hasn&#x27;t mentioned it. Received from UK quickly.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this shampoo takes all the brassiness out of gray/silver hair and leaves your hair a beautiful silver and shiny gloss. It has really made me fall in love with my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> cheaper purple shampoo is better than this stuff!!</li>
