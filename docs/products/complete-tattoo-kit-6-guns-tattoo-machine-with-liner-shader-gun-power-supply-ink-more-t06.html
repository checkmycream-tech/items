            <li>this product is a great starter kit</li>
            <li>the ink isnt AS great as you think, dont get your hopes up.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>But the kit is great to work</li>
            <li>Comes with a variety of great stuff, everything you will need to get started.</li>
            <li>She is a great artist and we both have tattoos, so I figured I would buy this for her as a gift.</li>
            <li>All six tattoo machines are in great condition.</li>
            <li>It would have been great if there were some stencil stuff included in the kit, or somthing to apply the stencil and maybe another piece of practice skin.  </li>
            <li>Good starter pack for a great price.</li>
            <li>Good thing i&#x27;ve been around tattooing for a bit and know how i need to set everything up.</li>
            <li>For the money good investment.</li>
            <li>everything is good</li>
            <li>It is a good practice set.</li>
            <li>Good set of tattoo equipment</li>
            <li>The kit is very nice the guns are nice, there are a a lot of ink cups and a holder, 50 needles, a set of metal barrels and also 3 bags of disposable tips.</li>
            <li>I am very Satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Came packaged nicely...</li>
            <li>this will come in handy</li>
            <li>it kind of falls out so get an extension cord and tape it in.</li>
            <li>The guns are all nice except the two \\&quot;fancy guns\\&quot; have some plastic pieces.</li>
            <li>the tattoo guns that came in were so nice when they came in my friend love them to death</li>
            <li>which was great, the practice skin IS just like a mouse pad, So i agree with that dude, The guns work fine and are made decently strong for being a practice starter kit.</li>
            <li>It could have atleast have came with more gloves and a better video.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;practice\\&quot; skin is more like a mouse pad for ur computer.</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than a low-cost learn how to tattoo kit.     </li>
            <li>satisfied with it.     </li>
            <li>Wish it came with more needles.</li>
            <li>The power supply is extremely cheap and broke on me!</li>
            <li>cheap!</li>
            <li>i also bought a  better quality power supply and ink just in case.</li>
            <li>BUT there better then a home made gun.</li>
            <li>the only thing i&#x27;d make better is the ink but who cares for this price you can buy any brand of ink in bulk and STILL SAVE!!!</li>
            <li>The video was okay-showed more of the tattoo in progress which is fine.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have iodine soap or wipes to clean the practice skin off with or the ink will just smear.</li>
            <li>and the power supply is still strong.</li>
            <li>the case is good its a well rounded kit good for getting your feet wet</li>
            <li>The coils are definately cheap.</li>
            <li>the case is ok, it holds everything, but nothing super special.</li>
            <li>The guns are nothing special but great for starting and i have already customized 2 of them.</li>
            <li>okay, it came super fast!</li>
            <li>I thought it was a pretty good starter set although the power supply box stopped working with the first two months which really irritates me because it could not be returned then.</li>
            <li>Good enough to learn on.</li>
            <li>if you are just learning this is a good enough kit if you are a proffessional artist</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got good information on it, but its from youko, which is like the Japanese (I think) version of the US&#x27; youtube.</li>
            <li>All of the guns are very sturdy, and durable, the coils could be better quality.</li>
            <li>it should show u step by step on how 2 set ur equipment up lucky 4</li>
            <li>Only one piece of transfer paper so get more of that and need more gloves.</li>
            <li>maan screw what those other haters say i got my product on time with nothing missing....machines work fine, power supply good.</li>
            <li>I love that this came with everything you need to get started as a new tattoo artist.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very good about crediting my money back and even sent me a prepaid packing slip to ship it back.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>i tested everything its worth the money</li>
            <li>This product is ok, nothing professional</li>
            <li>But it is a very nice tattooing kit for a little over $100.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>You will definitely still need to purchase a better set of ink (the included ink is fine for practice skin, but not for use on anyone&#x27;s body unless you want to spend time re-doing work with better ink later).</li>
            <li>has more than enough cups, grommets, rubberbands.</li>
            <li>I have to say when i first started wanting to tattoo i needed a tattoo gun</li>
            <li>the machines are very cheap chinese made machines that dont really line up correctly.</li>
            <li>The guns themselves are okay, but this freakin power suplly problem is ticking me off, i want a new replacement or a would like to have my money back, i didnt spend so much money for a wack ass!</li>
            <li>Would i recommend this for real tattooists?</li>
            <li>Which I really like.</li>
            <li>are cheap and the ink is low quality</li>
            <li>But what&#x27;s the point if your not gonna get a real apprenticeship in a real shop?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty alright set for someone who is brand new at tattooing like me.</li>
            <li>It took FOREVER to receive the kit, although once I received and used it seems to be decent set up for th price.</li>
            <li>they could have included some greensoap and a few more gloves.</li>
            <li>the pictures show nice cast or at least welded tattoo machine frames.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, sure its a cheap set you can practice on fake skin.</li>
            <li>if you know what your doing allready, dvd is NO good and does not come with a clip cord, power supply cord was so cheap that it did not even fit in the wall socket properly, ink is china based</li>
            <li>The ink is garbage, I really wouldn&#x27;t use it on human skin.</li>
            <li>I will not stop until i get this fixed.</li>
            <li>overall you cant beat it its all tattoo ready with everything youll need.....</li>
            <li>but other than that it is a pretty decent kit.</li>
            <li>kit came pretty quick has everything shown the ink sucks</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a solid set which I have used pretty much daily since received and have had no problems as of yet...</li>
            <li>the center poles should be black not silver but to learn on kit is fine</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not sure if I would use it on a person, it seems to get hung up quite a bit, although with a few modifications it should be fine.</li>
            <li> The power box is plastic, definitely going to try and get a different one, it works but for how long I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> not the best quality , but you get alot for very little   ink is crap ,dvd was crap, guns are ok when tuned properly ,power supply is decent  </li>
            <li> so i would not recomend using it in human skin, only one practice skin other than that the tat machines need some adjustmwnt before use</li>
            <li> Do yourself and everyone else a huge favor and shy away from this product  FYI -</li>
            <li> Its something to mess around with but never actually gonna tattoo anyone with it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rely on that to do tattoos, and the colors are all dark not very vibrant.</li>
            <li> Instead of illegally scaring yourself or others, why don&#x27;t you do the responsible thing and go down to you local shop and see about an apprenticeship.</li>
            <li> Other than the getting halfway through a tat and the power supply going out, I would say that this is an excelent buy, and would recomend this to any novice tattoo artist</li>
            <li> The video was a little weird though haha.</li>
            <li> There are other things you will still need to get to work with this kit, but if you are a tattooist then you already know whats missing</li>
            <li> power supply is a little jumpy though.</li>
            <li> I guess its a matter of preference on how heavy you like your machine you&#x27;re working with.</li>
            <li> Also could have came with atleast a small bottle of green soap and madacide to get started..</li>
            <li> Two of the machines are very heavy in your hand and the others are lighter...</li>
            <li> ur dvd cause it really sucks</li>
            <li> (really not great, but it will get you started)    </li>
            <li> , the included video is of poor quality.</li>
            <li> Wtf?</li>
            <li> So I placed my order and wait for what seemed like forever before receiving piece of crap stamped frame machines with a worse power supply and ink I would dye clothes with</li>
            <li> it really sucks it shows nothin on how 2 set it up and what size needles 2 use its really boring</li>
            <li> This has bad news written all over it.</li>
            <li> The (7) inks looks like crap.</li>
            <li> I wish the kit came with some legit instructional materials for beginners, the DVD is awful.</li>
            <li> 6 guns, assortment of steel and disposable tips, grips, ink caps, ink stand, brushes, practice skin, 1 stencil paper, horrible dvd that skips, rubber bands etc etc.</li>
            <li> This is pathetic.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its a basic kit, something to help you learn, the ink is garbage , but i learned a lot from this kit. its comes organized and in a decnet case. Would i recommend this for real tattooists? No</li>
            <li> the tattoo guns that came in were so nice when they came in my friend love them to death he wont stop using them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty alright set for someone who is brand new at tattooing like me. The ink is garbage, I really wouldn&#x27;t use it on human skin. I wish the kit came with some legit instructional materials for beginners, the DVD is awful. Put some booklets in there or something, come on! Those are my only complaints I guess. There are hundreds or thousands of instructional videos on youtube for the aspiring tattoo artist. There are also books and movies and stuff. So those can get you started before getting an apprenticeship somewhere. I would recommend buying it to learn with, then upgrading. It was worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a pretty good starter set although the power supply box stopped working with the first two months which really irritates me because it could not be returned then.</li>
            <li> you get everything described. power supply is a little jumpy though. for the money youre paying this is a great kit to get. 6 guns, assortment of steel and disposable tips, grips, ink caps, ink stand, brushes, practice skin, 1 stencil paper, horrible dvd that skips, rubber bands etc etc.</li>
            <li> I love that this came with everything you need to get started as a new tattoo artist. The video was a little weird though haha.</li>
            <li> Came packaged nicely... It could have atleast have came with more gloves and a better video. Good thing i&#x27;ve been around tattooing for a bit and know how i need to set everything up. The ink is generic (have used ink before)and the \\&quot;practice\\&quot; skin is more like a mouse pad for ur computer. Also could have came with atleast a small bottle of green soap and madacide to get started.. Unfortunaley i didn&#x27;t get any transfer paper. The guns are nothing special but great for starting and i have already customized 2 of them. Overall i am sastified with the product. For the money good investment.</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than a low-cost learn how to tattoo kit.     the case is ok, it holds everything, but nothing super special. the machines have been holding up well but are inexpensive ones (about 12 bucks). and the power supply is still strong. they could have included some greensoap and a few more gloves. has more than enough cups, grommets, rubberbands. but other than that it is a pretty decent kit. satisfied with it.     -Disposable tips are not sanitary!!   -i would def think twice about using the ink on human skin.   -DVD is a burned copy. you can find the same ones on youtube. (really not great, but it will get you started)    Good enough to learn on.</li>
            <li> look! i payed friggen extra money to get this tattoo kit in one day, not in 3 to 4 days. get it together dammit</li>
            <li> everything is good i tested everything its worth the money the only problem i had was tha cd it really sucks it shows nothin on how 2 set it up and what size needles 2 use its really boring it should show u step by step on how 2 set ur equipment up lucky 4 me i have a buddy 2 show me how u guys have 2 update ur dvd cause it really sucks but i did recive 1 sheet of transfer paper this will come in handy thank u</li>
            <li> this product is a great starter kit if you know what your doing allready, dvd is NO good and does not come with a clip cord, power supply cord was so cheap that it did not even fit in the wall socket properly, ink is china based so i would not recomend using it in human skin, only one practice skin other than that the tat machines need some adjustmwnt before use...again made in china</li>
            <li> okay, it came super fast! which was great, the practice skin IS just like a mouse pad, So i agree with that dude, The guns work fine and are made decently strong for being a practice starter kit. the ink isnt AS great as you think, dont get your hopes up. Wish it came with more needles. Came just as its shown in the picture. Power supply doesnt seem as string as the guns thought. those keys that come with it, i dont even know. They dont work! Lol But the kit is great to work with!---------------------NEVERMIND! The power supply is extremely cheap and broke on me! Its been days and i havent received a reply from the sellers, whats up with that? I will not stop until i get this fixed. Wtf? The guns themselves are okay, but this freakin power suplly problem is ticking me off, i want a new replacement or a would like to have my money back, i didnt spend so much money for a wack ass! cheap! power supply.</li>
            <li> kit came pretty quick has everything shown the ink sucks the machines are very cheap chinese made machines that dont really line up correctly. The coils are definately cheap. the center poles should be black not silver but to learn on kit is fine you get what you pay for if you are just learning this is a good enough kit if you are a proffessional artist dont bother but if you are a pro you would know that already. ive had no problems with power supply except that the plug does not go in the wall socket correctly it kind of falls out so get an extension cord and tape it in. i also bought a  better quality power supply and ink just in case. other wise the kit is just o.k.</li>
            <li> The kit is very nice the guns are nice, there are a a lot of ink cups and a holder, 50 needles, a set of metal barrels and also 3 bags of disposable tips. Which I really like. The guns are all nice except the two \\&quot;fancy guns\\&quot; have some plastic pieces. (Nothing that would melt or affect the tattooing) The power box is plastic, definitely going to try and get a different one, it works but for how long I don&#x27;t know. The (7) inks looks like crap. I wouldn&#x27;t rely on that to do tattoos, and the colors are all dark not very vibrant. But it is a very nice tattooing kit for a little over $100. I would recommend it. I know the product description isn&#x27;t very good so I was just trying to help out. Only one piece of transfer paper so get more of that and need more gloves.</li>
            <li> maan screw what those other haters say i got my product on time with nothing missing....machines work fine, power supply good. the only thing i&#x27;d make better is the ink but who cares for this price you can buy any brand of ink in bulk and STILL SAVE!!! overall you cant beat it its all tattoo ready with everything youll need.....buuut never got to watch the dvd.....who cares got mine next day btw!love the product!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my husband, who is an apprenticing tattooist.  It has ALMOST everything you need to get started. You will definitely still need to purchase a better set of ink (the included ink is fine for practice skin, but not for use on anyone&#x27;s body unless you want to spend time re-doing work with better ink later). Two of the machines are very heavy in your hand and the others are lighter...I guess its a matter of preference on how heavy you like your machine you&#x27;re working with. There are other things you will still need to get to work with this kit, but if you are a tattooist then you already know whats missing and if you&#x27;re apprenticing then you can ask your \\&quot;boss\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the included video is of poor quality. It&#x27;s got good information on it, but its from youko, which is like the Japanese (I think) version of the US&#x27; youtube.</li>
            <li> I have to say when i first started wanting to tattoo i needed a tattoo gun so i went on amazon to look... and bought this but i have to say you get what you pay for these tattoo guns are cheap and the ink is low quality also the video doesnt tell you how to set up or adjust the tattoo guns BUT there better then a home made gun.</li>
            <li> Comes with a variety of great stuff, everything you will need to get started. Only problem is DVD didn&#x27;t work so had to rely on YOUTUBE for set up. Make sure you have iodine soap or wipes to clean the practice skin off with or the ink will just smear. YUK!</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my wife. She is a great artist and we both have tattoos, so I figured I would buy this for her as a gift. The Set comes with everything promised. The equpiment that came with it was all in working order. It is a great starter set for anybody! All six tattoo machines are in great condition. I am very Satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It took FOREVER to receive the kit, although once I received and used it seems to be decent set up for th price. It is a good practice set. Not sure if I would use it on a person, it seems to get hung up quite a bit, although with a few modifications it should be fine. The video was okay-showed more of the tattoo in progress which is fine. It would have been great if there were some stencil stuff included in the kit, or somthing to apply the stencil and maybe another piece of practice skin.  Otherwise it is a solid set which I have used pretty much daily since received and have had no problems as of yet...</li>
            <li> This is pathetic. This has bad news written all over it. Instead of illegally scaring yourself or others, why don&#x27;t you do the responsible thing and go down to you local shop and see about an apprenticeship. I can&#x27;t believe amazon would sell this to the public, promoting scratcher tattooist  with no training in blood pathogens or sterilization could result in  spreading diseases and infections. As of next year it will be against the law to tattoo without proper safety training or out of a house. You must be a licensed and working out of a licensed business that has been and regularly  inspected by the health department.   In conclusion, sure its a cheap set you can practice on fake skin. But what&#x27;s the point if your not gonna get a real apprenticeship in a real shop? The rein of the scratcher tattooist ( not artist) is coming to a swift end. Thank god! Do yourself and everyone else a huge favor and shy away from this product  FYI - it&#x27;s called a tattoo machine, not tattoo gun.</li>
            <li> I just got my set, and used it for a night and the power supply shorted out. Amazon was very good about crediting my money back and even sent me a prepaid packing slip to ship it back. All of the guns are very sturdy, and durable, the coils could be better quality. It does come with everything that is promised. Other than the getting halfway through a tat and the power supply going out, I would say that this is an excelent buy, and would recomend this to any novice tattoo artist</li>
            <li> This product is ok, nothing professional but i cant complain for the price. Its something to mess around with but never actually gonna tattoo anyone with it.</li>
            <li> not the best quality , but you get alot for very little   ink is crap ,dvd was crap, guns are ok when tuned properly ,power supply is decent  the case is good its a well rounded kit good for getting your feet wet but you will need alot that didnt come with kit to actually do anything</li>
            <li> Good starter pack for a great price.</li>
            <li> Good set of tattoo equipment</li>
            <li> the pictures show nice cast or at least welded tattoo machine frames. So I placed my order and wait for what seemed like forever before receiving piece of crap stamped frame machines with a worse power supply and ink I would dye clothes with</li>
