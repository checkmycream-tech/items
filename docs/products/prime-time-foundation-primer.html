            <li>I&#x27;ll go through this quickly, but it will be handy in the meantime.</li>
            <li>This primer is great, really makes makeup go one smooth with out lines.</li>
            <li>The foundation go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>It smooths your complexion to aid your foundation&#x27;s smooth application.  </li>
            <li>You think your make up goes on smooth??</li>
            <li>when foundation is applied over it, your skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>This primer goes on so smoothly and makes your face feel velvety.</li>
            <li>it is so smooth and after putting on  foundation,  </li>
            <li>Helps smooth your skin in preparation for make-up.</li>
            <li>I find that having a great brush for makeup, makes a big difference too.  </li>
            <li>Your foundation goes on so smooth and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>I originally got it in a gift with purchase and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals, and everyone, especially first time</li>
            <li>It really does work, it somehow &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; your make-up, making it more matte looking</li>
            <li>Make sure you really rub it into your skin well.  </li>
            <li>Primers need to be used properly in order to see good results.  </li>
            <li>It seems to smooth out fine lines to where they aren&#x27;t very noticeable and makes putting on the rest of your makeup a breeze.</li>
            <li>I never expected it to feel so good when I applied it for the first time on my face ad neck.</li>
            <li>It was well packaged and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This primer makes Bare Minerals makeup go on more smoothly and lasts longer than without.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>And even if you don&#x27;t add any other product; it FEELS SOOOOOOOO GOOD.  </li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>My bare eccentuals makeup goes on so much better after using the primer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have problem skin, but my pores are quite large in some areas, and it really helps to smooth your skin and gives almost an airbrushed effect.  </li>
            <li>And the product arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly makes your skin feel very soft and</li>
            <li>This one is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Smooth and oh-so soft.  </li>
            <li>Definitely purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I always use a primer first with my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>:)) one drop is enough ...</li>
            <li>This is something that you should try first before purchasing online.</li>
            <li>This product makes your face feel so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was sure I would get a larger container!  </li>
            <li>My eyes had got swollen &amp; I wasn&#x27;t able to open my eyes for 3 weeks!!!</li>
            <li>It made makep easy to apply and actually helped control oil.</li>
            <li>I find that pressed mineral powder looks better over it than the loose powder I was using.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very silicone&#x27;ish.</li>
            <li>and I was really empressed with the way it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it was almost considered a sample, very disapointed.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s because this primer helps so much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li>Clean your skin, moisturize, make sure your skin is dry, and then apply a pea sized amount of primer for entire face.  </li>
            <li>and it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>Applying makeup is so much easier with this primer.</li>
            <li>Using this is very helpful before putting on foundation, because it helps it stay on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Andddd,,I see they charged my credit card 17.73 for this tube, really?</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, no odor, goes on smooth, clear and I can put my make-up on immediately after covering one facial area.</li>
            <li>Using this primer my make-up stays in place all day even in high humidity.</li>
            <li>Love this little product.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, but that fact that this particular bottle was so small for the price is why I rated it &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>It makes my (somewhat dry/normal skin) look and feel so smooth for any other foundation product you might want to add over it.  </li>
            <li>I paid $ for the same exact size tube I got for FREE when I ordered other items from BareMinerals.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The consistency seemed a little strange at first, since I had been using one that was more like a cream.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals makeup also, and this primer makes my makeup stay in place much longer.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s lasted four months now with pretty much daily use.</li>
            <li>It was expensive and I have used other products that I liked better.  </li>
            <li>It never seemed to dry down, and feel soft and smooth like many other primers I have used.  </li>
            <li>This was the first primer I ever used and broke out a little when I first started using it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that I ordered clear so that could be why.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have never had irritation from this product.</li>
            <li>This is a must have with your Bare Minerals Makeuo!!!</li>
            <li>I love this primer and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it would be decent sized, but when it arrived it was much smaller than I assumed it would be</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and is a great base for long-lasting make up!</li>
            <li>still have no regrets about my purchase!</li>
            <li>We were less that half pleased with this transaction.</li>
            <li>followed with bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li>Apparently I did not pay attention to the size information when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>i use this foundation for my regular old make up, which keeps it from rubbing off my face  </li>
            <li>a little small but knew that from reading all the other reviews... great stuff... makeup last all day even in 110 heat!</li>
            <li>I hate to use &amp;#34;one more thing&amp;#34; but I have found that this product really does make a big difference, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I not just if this is only for Bare escentuals</li>
            <li>The only negative comment I can make is that it was smaller than expected-but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the fine print well enough...</li>

            <li> Love this little product.  </li>
            <li> Love the product, but that fact that this particular bottle was so small for the price is why I rated it &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> It makes my (somewhat dry/normal skin) look and feel so smooth for any other foundation product you might want to add over it.  </li>
            <li> I paid $ for the same exact size tube I got for FREE when I ordered other items from BareMinerals.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The consistency seemed a little strange at first, since I had been using one that was more like a cream.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals makeup also, and this primer makes my makeup stay in place much longer.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s lasted four months now with pretty much daily use.</li>
            <li> It was expensive and I have used other products that I liked better.  </li>
            <li> It never seemed to dry down, and feel soft and smooth like many other primers I have used.  </li>
            <li> This was the first primer I ever used and broke out a little when I first started using it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I ordered clear so that could be why.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have never had irritation from this product.</li>
            <li> This is a must have with your Bare Minerals Makeuo!!!</li>
            <li> I love this primer and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it would be decent sized, but when it arrived it was much smaller than I assumed it would be</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and is a great base for long-lasting make up!</li>
            <li> still have no regrets about my purchase!</li>
            <li> We were less that half pleased with this transaction.</li>
            <li> followed with bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li> Apparently I did not pay attention to the size information when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> i use this foundation for my regular old make up, which keeps it from rubbing off my face  </li>
            <li> a little small but knew that from reading all the other reviews... great stuff... makeup last all day even in 110 heat!</li>
            <li> I hate to use &amp;#34;one more thing&amp;#34; but I have found that this product really does make a big difference, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I not just if this is only for Bare escentuals</li>
            <li> The only negative comment I can make is that it was smaller than expected-but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the fine print well enough...</li>
            <li> The consistency is between a gel &amp; a paste, it is clear &amp; you only need a small amount to apply.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is VERY small for the large price.</li>
            <li> the only promblem I have with this product its the size of it but other than that</li>
            <li> my eyelids were patchy, dry, &amp; flakey.</li>
            <li> Makeup hides a lot of evil, so priming first pretty much seals the deal.</li>
            <li> The bare essentials make up makes my face look dried out.</li>
            <li> after the swelling went down forever later...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wedding makeup and haven&#x27;t stopped using it since I was thinking it wouldn&#x27;t last long as the bottle is small</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to put a lot on your face, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other primers.  </li>
            <li> I know when I&#x27;m looking at BareMinerals/Escentual products that \\&quot;Prime Time\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the thing I&#x27;m looking at, it&#x27;s the other product for colors and all the glam we want to see.</li>
            <li> If I had read the other reviews, I would have never purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> a little dab will go a long way!</li>
            <li> A small amount of this primer goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to make the swelling go down...</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are less defined using the primer.</li>
            <li> It arrived, and was the half ounce size.  </li>
            <li> Half of $23 is $11.50</li>
            <li> but there are some nights when you just come home late and pass out from a long night....</li>
            <li> A little dab will do.  </li>
            <li> Use as little as possible because this is a small expensive tube.</li>
            <li> Although I do like this product, I could not believe how small the tube was for the price.  </li>
            <li> But I still am not sure why I need a primer.  </li>
            <li> They say it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but I am not sure about that.</li>
            <li> Although this product is small, you get a lot of time with it.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my face before bed</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about this</li>
            <li> Feels icky.. Made no difference in the foundation&#x27;s coverage or staying power.</li>
            <li> I found no issues with the product that stand out as negative.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, apply thin layers of mineral makeup to face until achieved coverage.  </li>
            <li> , i ordered big one and was sent the small one that cost 3 $.... disappointed</li>
            <li> but I tried this with my powered and liquid foundation and both time it failed.</li>
            <li> I tried it under 2 different foundations, and they both dragged terribly upon application over this primer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to expensive.</li>
            <li> I like this product but its way expensive for the size!  </li>
            <li> Yeah, there&#x27;s nothing bad I can say about it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try this as a base...</li>
            <li> I would hate to think what I&#x27;d do if they stopped making this product.</li>
            <li> I think it has silicone base that helps it spread &amp; distribute well.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed on the size of the tube for the cost</li>
            <li> too expensive for y\the price !!!</li>
            <li> horrible product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This primer makes Bare Minerals makeup go on more smoothly and lasts longer than without. No irritation...it&#x27;s very silicone&#x27;ish. Wrinkles are less defined using the primer.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product.  However, the size that I ordered isn&#x27;t what I thought.  Very tiny .5 ounce trial size.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It smooths your complexion to aid your foundation&#x27;s smooth application.  I&#x27;ve tried other primers.  This one is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Feels icky.. Made no difference in the foundation&#x27;s coverage or staying power.</li>
            <li> Best foundation primer out there! I love Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I absolutely LOVE this Prime Time Foundation Primer.  Why? you ask?  It makes my (somewhat dry/normal skin) look and feel so smooth for any other foundation product you might want to add over it.  And even if you don&#x27;t add any other product; it FEELS SOOOOOOOO GOOD.  Smooth and oh-so soft.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. beware of the tinted one.</li>
            <li> I know when I&#x27;m looking at BareMinerals/Escentual products that \\&quot;Prime Time\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the thing I&#x27;m looking at, it&#x27;s the other product for colors and all the glam we want to see. BUT do not make the mistake of not purchasing \\&quot;Prime Time\\&quot;. It feels great and I feel that it also makes for a very smooth application of the products you want to use over it. Do get it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> love the product. very disappointed on the size of the tube for the cost</li>
            <li> Wonderful product,makes your face silky soft. Will buy again.My bare eccentuals makeup goes on so much better after using the primer.</li>
            <li> Product is as described. I found no issues with the product that stand out as negative. And the product arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Put it on before my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Suggest adding your moisturizer or serums then put this on&lt;br /&gt;last followed with bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li> best product is my make-up bag, works so well! I bike to work and get sweaty but this saves my make-up ALL DAY, literally. soooooo light, you dont event notice it is there! Definitely purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Thus primer is absolutely wonderful! It was perfect alone but also helped make my makeup stay on in the summer heat! It made makep easy to apply and actually helped control oil. I would 100% purchase this product again</li>
            <li> i shoulve have read how big was it when i recieved it it was tiny. too expensive for y\the price !!!</li>
            <li> You think your make up goes on smooth?? Try this as a base...it will be so much better.</li>
            <li> This item was as described. A little dab will do.  Works great.</li>
            <li> A small amount of this primer goes a long way. It glides on smoothly and is a great base for long-lasting make up! I have sensitive skin and have never had irritation from this product.</li>
            <li> Makeup hides a lot of evil, so priming first pretty much seals the deal.</li>
            <li> I would hate to think what I&#x27;d do if they stopped making this product. It glides on smoothly makes your skin feel very soft and when foundation is applied over it, your skin looks fantastic. It seems to smooth out fine lines to where they aren&#x27;t very noticeable and makes putting on the rest of your makeup a breeze.</li>
            <li> Although I do like this product, I could not believe how small the tube was for the price.  Apparently I did not pay attention to the size information when I purchased it.  I just purchased more but did so through Sephora.  Same price, larger size.</li>
            <li> This primer goes on so smoothly and makes your face feel velvety.</li>
            <li> While this is a great product, very misleading on the size. For the price this is what I consider a sample. I buy this product all the time and thought I was getting a deal. Great product no savings.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this item.  There was more talk about it than anything.  It goes on very smooth but I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> i use this foundation for my regular old make up, which keeps it from rubbing off my face  I find that the intended use, with the powder make up, does not work for me.  The bare essentials make up makes my face look dried out.</li>
            <li> I always use a primer first with my mineral makeup. It helps to even skin tone and &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; your face for the mineral makeup application that delivers staying power too. I only have to use this once for the entire day. Great product!</li>
            <li> Wow! This is a perfect foundation primer compared to others I have tried. Others, by mid-day, my make-up would be either faded or blotchy. Using this primer my make-up stays in place all day even in high humidity. Only use a tiny drop as a drop covers a lot of facial areas. It is not sticky, no odor, goes on smooth, clear and I can put my make-up on immediately after covering one facial area. Besides the all-day coverage, the primer gives a glow to my skin and just makes my face feel lighter.</li>
            <li> a little small but knew that from reading all the other reviews... great stuff... makeup last all day even in 110 heat!</li>
            <li> I had never used this product before and I was really empressed with the way it makes my face feel.  The foundation go on more smoothly. I would recommend it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> this primer is nice on my face... it is so smooth and after putting on  foundation,  your face look like silk...  :)) one drop is enough ... i will recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;3 star because i ordered this product and i received it in different packaging, i ordered big one and was sent the small one that cost 3 $.... disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a must have with your Bare Minerals Makeuo!!! I love Bare Minerals, and everyone, especially first time users will be wonderfully impressed with this for your skin!!</li>
            <li> This product is VERY small for the large price. It says 15ml on the product description so I thought it would be decent sized, but when it arrived it was much smaller than I assumed it would be, it&#x27;s only 0.5 fl oz. Love the product, but that fact that this particular bottle was so small for the price is why I rated it &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> the only promblem I have with this product its the size of it but other than that It really good</li>
            <li> Having ordered Prime Time Foundation Primer numerous times, we assumed we were ordering  the one ounce size.  You will notice that no size is given for this product from Flawless Beauty.  It arrived, and was the half ounce size.  We were less that half pleased with this transaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go through this quickly, but it will be handy in the meantime.</li>
            <li> It really does work, it somehow &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; your make-up, making it more matte looking and I notice that when I DON&#x27;T wear it, my make-up tends to wash off or just look &amp;#34;droopy&amp;#34; later in the day.  I hate to use &amp;#34;one more thing&amp;#34; but I have found that this product really does make a big difference, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this product. It was expensive and I have used other products that I liked better.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I ordered clear so that could be why. This is something that you should try first before purchasing online.</li>
            <li> Helps smooth your skin in preparation for make-up. It is essential !</li>
            <li> I never expected it to feel so good when I applied it for the first time on my face ad neck. It felt like silk being spread on my face and neck. I am spoiled now!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
            <li> was so tiny it was almost considered a sample, very disapointed.</li>
            <li> This primer is perfect for any powder &amp; combines for an undetectable finish.  The consistency is between a gel &amp; a paste, it is clear &amp; you only need a small amount to apply. It does not make me break out. I think it has silicone base that helps it spread &amp; distribute well.  The feel is slippery, but not oily.  Use as little as possible because this is a small expensive tube.</li>
            <li> I love Prime Time!  This product makes your face feel so smooth and soft.  I use Bare Minerals makeup also, and this primer makes my makeup stay in place much longer.  I have people tell me what a beautiful complexion I have (I don&#x27;t) and I think it&#x27;s because this primer helps so much.</li>
            <li> If I had read the other reviews, I would have never purchased this product.  The amount you receive is a total ripoff.  I was just so used to receiving a 1 ounce size, that I regrettably took it for granted that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d get once again.  It taught me a very good lesson.  Going forward, I will pay attention to every detail before purchasing!</li>
            <li> This was the first primer I ever used and broke out a little when I first started using it but once skin adjusted to it I loved it. You don&#x27;t have to use too much. Just a pea size and it goes a long way. I bought smashbox primer for $35 and if I compare the two I prefer prime time. I&#x27;ve been using smashbox for about a month and I still break out a lot and have to use more of the smashbox. So yes I love prime time and can&#x27;t wait until I finish smashbox so I can go back to using prime time! It&#x27;s cheaper and works better for me. Btw I do have oily skin and I did notice with the prime time my skin wouldn&#x27;t get as oily throughout the day!!</li>
            <li> As a consumer, I believe that I need a foundation promer, and this one is very nice, with good ingredients.  But I still am not sure why I need a primer.  Perhaps someone can write me back and explain.  But as for price, I just found this on Drugstore.com in the 1 ounce size, and it costs $23.00. Half of $23 is $11.50</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wedding makeup and haven&#x27;t stopped using it since I was thinking it wouldn&#x27;t last long as the bottle is small but it&#x27;s lasted four months now with pretty much daily use. It helps my makeup stay put and feels great.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is a mini size, but for me it still lasts about a month.  I love this primer and a little goes a long way.  Make sure you really rub it into your skin well.  I find that pressed mineral powder looks better over it than the loose powder I was using.  But either still look great.  I don&#x27;t have problem skin, but my pores are quite large in some areas, and it really helps to smooth your skin and gives almost an airbrushed effect.  Primers need to be used properly in order to see good results.  Clean your skin, moisturize, make sure your skin is dry, and then apply a pea sized amount of primer for entire face.  After a few minutes, apply thin layers of mineral makeup to face until achieved coverage.  I find that having a great brush for makeup, makes a big difference too.  I use the jane iredale handi brush and it works the best.</li>
            <li> I not just if this is only for Bare escentuals but I tried this with my powered and liquid foundation and both time it failed.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation primer! I use BM foundation and this makes it so much more even and it lasts much longer. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the picture of the full-size bottle deceive you.  Pay attention only to the trial size bottle because that is what you are getting.  I never would have ordered this if I had known I was only getting a trial size for that price!  Prime Time is a great product, this just isn&#x27;t a good deal.</li>
            <li> Best primer I have found yet and goes with my bare essentials makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like this product but its way expensive for the size!  I was sure I would get a larger container!  But it does work well with the makeup</li>
            <li> It never seemed to dry down, and feel soft and smooth like many other primers I have used.  I tried it under 2 different foundations, and they both dragged terribly upon application over this primer.  Sent it back.  Too pricey to just throw away.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful way to prime your face to use a mineral foundation. I originally got it in a gift with purchase and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> The consistency seemed a little strange at first, since I had been using one that was more like a cream. They say it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but I am not sure about that. However, it is preservative free which is nice.</li>
            <li> Fast service at an excellent price! I look forward to doing business with this supplier in the future! I absolutely love this product...it&#x27;s prob my favorite Primer!!! It works miracles on my skin!!! The only negative comment I can make is that it was smaller than expected-but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the fine print well enough...still have no regrets about my purchase! Love love love!</li>
            <li> Love this primer. Applying makeup is so much easier with this primer.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction. My eyes had got swollen &amp; I wasn&#x27;t able to open my eyes for 3 weeks!!! I tried everything to make the swelling go down...nothing worked! I wouldn&#x27;t ever buy this product again. after the swelling went down forever later...my eyelids were patchy, dry, &amp; flakey. horrible product!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  Would no&#x27;t use anything else.  Skin looks and feels great.  It&#x27;s wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  Have used it before, but to purchase it locally it&#x27;s to expensive.</li>
            <li> Although this product is small, you get a lot of time with it. I&#x27;ve had this product before- I bought it in the middle of May and it lasted all to the end of December (I used it often- 6/7 days a week). You don&#x27;t need to put a lot on your face, a little goes a long way. Using this is very helpful before putting on foundation, because it helps it stay on. And it doesn&#x27;t give you any zits or blemishes. It has a soothing feel. Yeah, there&#x27;s nothing bad I can say about it.</li>
            <li> Love this little product.  I have fair skin and love my foundation...I put this all over my face and all my makeup, foundation and eye makeup whatever stays on ALL NIGHT! I usually wash my face before bed but there are some nights when you just come home late and pass out from a long night....the next morning my makeup was still in place! LOVE IT....won&#x27;t go out without it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! The best primer ever!!!</li>
            <li> This primer is great, really makes makeup go one smooth with out lines.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be able to use my powder foundation with out this!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!&lt;br /&gt;Just a little dab will go a long way!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Your foundation goes on so smooth and stays on all day.  Doesn&#x27;t make your make-up look clumpy or splotchy.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
            <li> I do not see a difference in the makeup if I use this or not. Not sure what to say about this</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, guess when I ordered it though I didn&#x27;t take note of the size. I paid $ for the same exact size tube I got for FREE when I ordered other items from BareMinerals.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t go this route again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andddd,,I see they charged my credit card 17.73 for this tube, really? Like $6 in mailing charges?? For a tube the size of my thumb? Seller is deceptive.</li>
