            <li>/&gt;Bango comes with everything you need to successfully cut your bangs including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She just doesn&#x27;t like the salon because she&#x27;s still a toddler, so she is more happy with this too!</li>
            <li>So I bought good clips and a good pair of hair scissors.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>It is a good idea and does work, but not like having someone else do it for you.</li>
            <li>Everyone loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>Honestly I would just save your money and have a friend cut your bangs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bango is my new best friend!</li>
            <li>Great for quick reliable trims.</li>
            <li>and she got many many compliments!</li>
            <li>Ok, so I bought this kit and I proceed to check out some youtube videos on how to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cheap pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li>and I have gotten so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve an important event in two days!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>cute stylish hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use to cut my bangs just with the guidance of my fingers, with this tool my bangs look 100% better.</li>
            <li>so glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li>I have only had good experiences with this product!</li>
            <li>and it was super easy</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Would be best if someone helped for doing the back and making sure the clip is in at the proper angle.</li>
            <li>I bought it originally to use on my niece.</li>
            <li>I 1st made sure my bangs were perfectly straight, using a straightening iron.</li>
            <li>I used my own inner style and flair and got a fabulous haircut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really surprised at how easy it was to use the Bango!</li>
            <li>(btw, am not an Ulta fan, tend to find better deals on Amazon, but, when trying out new cosmetics, a store is a must).&lt;br /&gt;WOW.</li>
            <li>and it is growing thick and beautiful but fear enters me</li>
            <li>I then clamped my bangs at the top, pulled it thru to about 1/2\\&quot; from the ends, held my scissors at an angle and cut the hair, following the jagged outline.</li>
            <li>but anyway, I sported it for 2 months and now my hair started growing out flat on top</li>
            <li>Now, they still aren&#x27;t quite straight, are shorter than I prefer, and the under-color ones are somewhat longer than the darker-colored ones (I have a light blond bang, above which are</li>
            <li>Really works but</li>
            <li>Precision Shears&lt;br /&gt;Japanese Precision Stainless Steel Blades</li>
            <li>No clips, no DVD...and the clip is very bulky.  </li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>I have no depth or spacial perception and really just wanted to trim my bangs which are on an angle...</li>
            <li>Otherwise...it really might be easier to just make an appointment with your hair stylist</li>
            <li>This gizmo holds your hair very firnly, creating a straight edge to cut along.</li>
            <li>This makes cutting your own hair at home as easy as it is ever gonna get!</li>
            <li>They are super short and divided by which category you want.</li>
            <li>I figured for the cost though if I got a decent pair of scissors to cut my bangs</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for the Bango because I don&#x27;t think these types of products ever work as described.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Actually works and helped me create straight bangs for the first time.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to use this to cut my husbands or sons hair which can get pretty long (2&amp;#34; to 5&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>and I swear I can&#x27;t tell a difference between the professional and this product!</li>
            <li>(Note, even the comb is a little cheap black comb like the school photographers would give us in elementary school 30 seconds before taking our pictures!)</li>
            <li>This clearly shows a DVD and two clips.  </li>
            <li>I used it to cut my bangs once and was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>My four year old daughter Paige</li>
            <li>/&gt;Paige hates having her hair in her face and her bangs are pretty long so she will tell me she needs them cut often.</li>
            <li>; that&#x27;s the only real way it MIGHT be useful.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>She had to go to the Hair Dresser after and get it fixed.</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast and I don&#x27;t have the time to go in for regular bang trims.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The large pink clamp is solid and secure ... holds hair tightly</li>
            <li>: Works pretty good, but very tedious and takes a long time&lt;br /&gt;Short hair:</li>
            <li>I gave up on getting my hair cut at salons because they never got it right, and I&#x27;d spend a half hour at home afterward fixing the haircut</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d worked out a method using a hard plastic headband or two, and my free hands, but, when seeing this item promoted in Women&#x27;s Health mag, decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I am quite picky about my hair, and generally leave it to my stylist, but for reasons of efficiency have been doing a between-cuts trim or two on my bangs.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get the look that I was hoping to from it.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming my hair in general</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t do it soon enough, she takes it upon herself to cut them with the results you&#x27;d imagine from a four year old giving herself a hair</li>
            <li>I recently got my bangs cut by a professional and they grew out.</li>
            <li>me, it cut the middle portion of my bangs too short, and the rest much, much too long.</li>
            <li>It pulls on the bangs so they are perfect when you cut them, but when you take the stupid thing off my bangs were so uneven and crooked.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a bit surprised about these past reviews.</li>
            <li> It took less than five minutes and actually didn&#x27;t look like I did it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a decent pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> I put it down, pulled out my trusty hard plastic hairband, and snipped away in FAR smaller snips-at-an-angle than those gashes in the mold.</li>
            <li> Sectioned my hair off in quarters, parted down the middle, down the back and half of each side</li>
            <li> I just spent $50 on.</li>
            <li> I used the pink pin to hold guide where to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> abandoned my fears, used my pink clip to section off and cut, snip away</li>
            <li> /&gt;The black clips stink.</li>
            <li> Now, I know why the instructional CD (yes; cd!) used LONG bangs (like, partway down the nose), and THICK portions of hair to demo how-to&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The handles are plastic (not coated plastic, really thin plastic) and the blades are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> This is partly due to the large amounts of hair that the too-big angles provide for cutting.......</li>
            <li> all of which seem cheap :(  </li>
            <li> IF a person has thick, and/or long hair/bangs, perhaps. . .</li>
            <li> my bangs, close to my face, they aren&#x27;t long nor thick, and</li>
            <li> After 30 years of bad haircuts, no one gets it right</li>
            <li> I have tried similar products in the past with poor results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;m a little fearful of cutting my own hair, I did actually watch the video before trying it.</li>
            <li> I already recommended this product to three other people, because I&#x27;m afraid if I lend it out, I will not get it back.</li>
            <li> and it really pulls my hair - painfully</li>
            <li> I was too lazy to view the included DVD, but thought it was a no-brainer after examining the items in the kit:</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would recommend this if you don&#x27;t have bangs and want to create them for the 1st time.</li>
            <li> No more will I sit in a chair and spend $50 for a haircut</li>
            <li> and if they do it&#x27;s usually a one time thing and</li>
            <li> so no more.</li>
            <li> As far as cutting bangs: The scissors were of poor quality in my opinion and difficult to cut next to the teeth on the bango.</li>
            <li> It is virtually impossible to cut the tiny little snippets out of the bang clip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to trim around it.  </li>
            <li> 2 clips for holding hair back away from bangs, a comb, scissors (too dull to cut well, so get quality hair cutting scissors)and a plastic clamp with jagged teeth outline.</li>
            <li> - maybe one needs to be ambidextrous when cutting her hair in order to use this properly - but I am not.</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> I used the straight side w/ cutting angles, cutting into the angles; came out terribly, terribly wrong.</li>
            <li> i look like dumb and dumber.</li>
            <li> It turned out awful and I vowed to never do it again, but reconsidered after reading some positive reviews about Bango elsewhere.</li>
            <li> and I just looked like a tired housewife.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Unless you already have an aptitude for cutting hair...</li>
            <li> mine didn&#x27;t come with the hair clips and dvd. :(</li>
            <li> I have not tried to use it, but am disappointed that the product did not come as shown in the picture and advertised in the text with the product.</li>
            <li> I also found it very awkward to hold and cut along the grooves</li>
            <li> People were shocked when told them I cut it!</li>
            <li> I will absolutely hate!  </li>

            <li> This product says that it comes with a DVD and it does not.</li>
            <li> This makes cutting your own hair at home as easy as it is ever gonna get! I gave up on getting my hair cut at salons because they never got it right, and I&#x27;d spend a half hour at home afterward fixing the haircut I just spent $50 on. So forget that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large pink clamp is solid and secure ... holds hair tightly so you can make an even cut. I like the grooves for trimming bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black clips stink. The scissors stink. So I bought good clips and a good pair of hair scissors. Now I&#x27;m good to go. Never paying for another haircut again!</li>
            <li> I play with it a lot on my bang</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything it claims to be...easy, anyone can use it, I did my bangs and I also did my trimmed my ends and I have gotten so many compliments.  I already recommended this product to three other people, because I&#x27;m afraid if I lend it out, I will not get it back.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.  I used it to cut my bangs once and was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> Works as it says. Easy!!! Will always have one now</li>
            <li> Really works but mine didn&#x27;t come with the hair clips and dvd. :(</li>
            <li> This device was not helpful in any way.  It is virtually impossible to cut the tiny little snippets out of the bang clip.</li>
            <li> Honestly I would just save your money and have a friend cut your bangs.  I bought this, but only used it a couple of times and now it is gathering dust.  It is a good idea and does work, but not like having someone else do it for you.</li>
            <li> scissors are a little dull but not a bad purchase. I literally never had bangs in my life and gave myself some using this tool and it was super easy and they look great.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter Paige and I both have bangs and so we often have to make extra trips to the salon just to get our bangs trimmed. If I&#x27;m feeling really brave and don&#x27;t have time for a trip to the salon, I&#x27;ll do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paige hates having her hair in her face and her bangs are pretty long so she will tell me she needs them cut often. If I don&#x27;t do it soon enough, she takes it upon herself to cut them with the results you&#x27;d imagine from a four year old giving herself a hair cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The week after these pics were taken I heard about Bango by Pro Beauty Tools and knew this was something I HAD to have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bango comes with everything you need to successfully cut your bangs including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BANGO®&lt;br /&gt;Patented design creates stylist tension on hair for salon results&lt;br /&gt;Two-sided edge guide for textured and blunt cuts&lt;br /&gt;6\\&quot; Precision Shears&lt;br /&gt;Japanese Precision Stainless Steel Blades&lt;br /&gt;2 Sectioning Clips&lt;br /&gt;Comb&lt;br /&gt;Instructional DVD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m a little fearful of cutting my own hair, I did actually watch the video before trying it. They are super short and divided by which category you want. I wear my bangs to the front and sometimes to the side so I just watched Blunt Bangs. These instructional videos can also be found on the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching I just followed the directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised at how easy it was to use the Bango! Once I had it on my bangs, I just clipped along the edges with the included scissors. It took less than five minutes and actually didn&#x27;t look like I did it myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bango is my new best friend! At only $19.99, I basically have my money back by not going on for a bang cut twice. I am so happy that Paige&#x27;s hair will never again look like it does now. Well, here&#x27;s hoping anyway!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for the Bango because I don&#x27;t think these types of products ever work as described. I figured for the cost though if I got a decent pair of scissors to cut my bangs I wouldn&#x27;t be out anything. It&#x27;s not a decent pair of scissors. The handles are plastic (not coated plastic, really thin plastic) and the blades are not sharp at all. It&#x27;s a very cheap pair of scissors.  I&#x27;ve tried using the bango and it really pulls my hair - painfully so - when I&#x27;m trying to slide or hold it according to the dvd. I also found it very awkward to hold and cut along the grooves - maybe one needs to be ambidextrous when cutting her hair in order to use this properly - but I am not. (Note, even the comb is a little cheap black comb like the school photographers would give us in elementary school 30 seconds before taking our pictures!)</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! It helped me cut a great side fringe!</li>
            <li> This clearly shows a DVD and two clips.  I did not get any of those.  All that was in the package is a comb, scissors and the red Bango clip....all of which seem cheap :(  I have not tried to use it, but am disappointed that the product did not come as shown in the picture and advertised in the text with the product.</li>
            <li> I am not a person who is into fads. I am quite picky about my hair, and generally leave it to my stylist, but for reasons of efficiency have been doing a between-cuts trim or two on my bangs. I&#x27;d worked out a method using a hard plastic headband or two, and my free hands, but, when seeing this item promoted in Women&#x27;s Health mag, decided to give it a shot. Standing in Ulta, I dubiously considered the product in its packaging, but, I figured I&#x27;ll try it out (btw, am not an Ulta fan, tend to find better deals on Amazon, but, when trying out new cosmetics, a store is a must).&lt;br /&gt;WOW. And I&#x27;ve an important event in two days! IF a person has thick, and/or long hair/bangs, perhaps. . . *perhaps*.  I wanted to *trim* my bangs, close to my face, they aren&#x27;t long nor thick, and I used the straight side w/ cutting angles, cutting into the angles; came out terribly, terribly wrong. 1. The moldclip is way too big and bulky. 2. Now, I know why the instructional CD (yes; cd!) used LONG bangs (like, partway down the nose), and THICK portions of hair to demo how-to&#x27;s; that&#x27;s the only real way it MIGHT be useful.&lt;br /&gt;On me, it cut the middle portion of my bangs too short, and the rest much, much too long. I attempted, in several ways, to use the goshdarn thing to assist me in straightening, but, in vain. I put it down, pulled out my trusty hard plastic hairband, and snipped away in FAR smaller snips-at-an-angle than those gashes in the mold. Now, they still aren&#x27;t quite straight, are shorter than I prefer, and the under-color ones are somewhat longer than the darker-colored ones (I have a light blond bang, above which are same-lenth bangs the color of the rest of my hair). This is partly due to the large amounts of hair that the too-big angles provide for cutting.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inferior; stay away. I think this may be my 3rd Amazon review, ever.</li>
            <li> No clips, no DVD...and the clip is very bulky.  It&#x27;s hard to trim around it.  Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Do not even trust this thing with your hair. It pulls on the bangs so they are perfect when you cut them, but when you take the stupid thing off my bangs were so uneven and crooked. i had to cut them so short i look like dumb and dumber. This is total garbage and does not work!</li>
            <li> Unless you already have an aptitude for cutting hair...this doesn&#x27;t really help. I have no depth or spacial perception and really just wanted to trim my bangs which are on an angle...and I was all thumbs with this thing. If you are not a calamity like myself, go for it. Otherwise...it really might be easier to just make an appointment with your hair stylist lol</li>
            <li> Great for quick reliable trims. All the items are there, that you would need, except for a cape. Would be best if someone helped for doing the back and making sure the clip is in at the proper angle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit surprised about these past reviews. My bangs get trimmed every 6 weeks when I come in for a root touch up at my salon. They get too long between appts and I wanted to have the freedom of trimming them up a bit at any time I choose. I have tried to trim them myself after following some instructions at a stylist&#x27;s website. It turned out awful and I vowed to never do it again, but reconsidered after reading some positive reviews about Bango elsewhere. I was too lazy to view the included DVD, but thought it was a no-brainer after examining the items in the kit: 2 clips for holding hair back away from bangs, a comb, scissors (too dull to cut well, so get quality hair cutting scissors)and a plastic clamp with jagged teeth outline. I 1st made sure my bangs were perfectly straight, using a straightening iron. I then clamped my bangs at the top, pulled it thru to about 1/2\\&quot; from the ends, held my scissors at an angle and cut the hair, following the jagged outline. I was amazed that my bangs looked great on my 1st try. Not sure if I would recommend this if you don&#x27;t have bangs and want to create them for the 1st time.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I used it to cut my daughters hair and she got many many compliments! People were shocked when told them I cut it! It&#x27;s so neat. She just doesn&#x27;t like the salon because she&#x27;s still a toddler, so she is more happy with this too!</li>
            <li> No more will I sit in a chair and spend $50 for a haircut I will absolutely hate!  Ok, so I bought this kit and I proceed to check out some youtube videos on how to cut my own hair.  I used the pink pin to hold guide where to cut my hair. I used my own inner style and flair and got a fabulous haircut.  Everyone loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I let it grow out and it is growing thick and beautiful but fear enters me and I sit in a chair and pay $50 only to get a so so haircut. blah, but anyway, I sported it for 2 months and now my hair started growing out flat on top and I just looked like a tired housewife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I abandoned my fears, used my pink clip to section off and cut, snip away and already I have the cutest hairstyle without paying anyone, doing it myself and I love it.  After 30 years of bad haircuts, no one gets it right and if they do it&#x27;s usually a one time thing and so no more. From now I&#x27;m cutting my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even pay attention to the DVD.  Who cares.  The comb, the big giant pink clip and the black clips is all I needed.  Sectioned my hair off in quarters, parted down the middle, down the back and half of each side, I snipped away and bam, cute stylish hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it takes is abandoning your fear, having a vision for your hair and doing it.</li>
            <li> I recently got my bangs cut by a professional and they grew out. I got this and I swear I can&#x27;t tell a difference between the professional and this product! It works perfectly! Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and tried it out thinking it would be great, but NO NO. She had to go to the Hair Dresser after and get it fixed. This product sucks. Stay away!</li>
            <li> I use to cut my bangs just with the guidance of my fingers, with this tool my bangs look 100% better. It is super easy to use. Im so glad I made this purchase I would highly recommend it to anyone. I just have to master the Jagged edges with the scissors for whispy bangs  Happy customer in EL PASO TEXAS</li>
            <li> Actually works and helped me create straight bangs for the first time. My hair grows fast and I don&#x27;t have the time to go in for regular bang trims. I have tried similar products in the past with poor results. This gizmo holds your hair very firnly, creating a straight edge to cut along. Very happy I got this!</li>
            <li> As far as cutting bangs: The scissors were of poor quality in my opinion and difficult to cut next to the teeth on the bango.I can&#x27;t get the look that I was hoping to from it.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming my hair in general: Works pretty good, but very tedious and takes a long time&lt;br /&gt;Short hair: Does not work on. I was hoping to use this to cut my husbands or sons hair which can get pretty long (2&amp;#34; to 5&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter who uses it every month to trim her bangs.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!!! I have bought several as gifts and everyone loves BANGO!!! I bought it originally to use on my niece. I have only had good experiences with this product!</li>
