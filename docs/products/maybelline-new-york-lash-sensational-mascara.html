    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>and it really is sensational!  </li>
            <li>It looks great all day at work and doesn&#x27;t fade or run.</li>
            <li>great thing about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t clump when you apply it.  </li>
            <li>And while that&#x27;s great if you have tons of time do that, if you are almost always in a rush (</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s still a win.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color and darkens the lashes.</li>
            <li>The brush works great when you have lots of lashes that need separated while applying the mascara.</li>
            <li>Minimum effort for great results.</li>
            <li>Looks great on and didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>Works great to enhance your lashes.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is comparable in price, yet superior in quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I applied with a lighter hand and loved the way it looked.</li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t be a deal-breaker if I loved everything else about it.</li>
            <li>and I loved that.</li>
            <li>I tried and not a bit washed off, even with a good scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>wand on the Lash Sensational Mascara is curved.</li>
            <li>, so I thought I&#x27;d give the Lash Sensational a try.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Each lash seems to stand out nicely.  </li>
            <li>Fans eyelashes out nicely.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was some kind of hype about the bristles, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush has plenty of bristles that allows for all of the lashes to reached and some nice effects, and the make-up itself is decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product washes of well with warm water and cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This kind of plastic wand seems to work better when you start with bare/clean lashes versus applying to day-old mascara.</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara really is sensational!</li>
            <li>I have discovered that I need a very light hand with the wand, and to wipe it on the end of the tube before using.</li>
            <li>The good: This mascara lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t flake, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>For me, I love it for every day wear because it looks nice and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline for their mascara.</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I like the brush, which seems to be more versatile than</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite mascara of all.</li>
            <li>Is her favorite as well.</li>
            <li>That being said, that seems to be the case with most mascara wands.</li>
            <li>love the brush the most.</li>
            <li>For me this mascara is just okay.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this mascara and try it as a dupe for younique.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite mascara, but I still like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will pick my favorite Lash Discovery over this any day.</li>
            <li>This is more of a web mascara</li>
            <li>This is a really great mascara, really thickens and lengthens lashes more than any of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many, many kinds</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the Maybelline New Your Lash Sensational Mascara.  </li>
            <li>I thought that this mascara ran quite a bit more than the L&#x27;Oreal does, and thus more easily led to &#x27;raccoon eyes.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>It has a terrific fine toothed brush that separates my lashes perfectly.</li>
            <li>And it washes off very easily without any special makeup</li>
            <li>I thought the brush was good in theory but in reality it made my lashes very clumpy and spidery.</li>
            <li>If I just use my oil free make-up remover this does not come off well so be sure to apply warm water and a good face soap prior to removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and thankfully it doesn&#x27;t clump easily.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily without clumping and does not harden or flake off during the day.  </li>
            <li>I found that it came off easily at night</li>
            <li>It lasts all day without flaking off and it goes on easily.</li>
            <li>You can coat your lashes easily with one application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off too.</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on easily, but the drawback is that it clumps.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to take off once you soak it</li>
            <li>I found the mascara easy to apply without clumping.  </li>
            <li>Also and very important the mascara did not crumble into my eye which is super.</li>
            <li>They must have elves and fairies working their beauty magic at their headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mabelline never fails to outdo their competitors or themselves!</li>
            <li>My daughter tried it and kept it because she liked it so much.</li>
            <li>If the brush was one with softer, denser bristles, application would be fantastic and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy the lumpy</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara is a pretty good mascara for the price - basically ten dollars for a nice mascara (</li>
            <li>Its worth it though, because other than the difficulty removing it, its the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used,</li>
            <li>Original review:</li>
            <li>And while Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara didn&#x27;t do this either, it got pretty damn</li>
            <li>If you naturally have long lashes, this will be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li>This is a good, basic mascara choice when looking for a mascara that costs under $10.  </li>
            <li>This is certainly good enough mascara.  </li>
            <li>No issues with it flaking off after a full day of wear.  </li>
            <li>I then apply an oil free makeup remover on a Q-Tip and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite that, I really do like the Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Super product and works well.</li>
            <li>, it is kind of creepy when you see in come off, like eyelash skins, but it doesn&#x27;t smear and comes off so easily that this type has become my favorite kind of mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wearably pretty, comfortable mascara that won&#x27;t make your eyes itch.</li>
            <li>I put on mascara, I use the tip end first and then smooth it through.  </li>
            <li>A new favorite for me.</li>
            <li>time Maybelline comes out with a new mascara, I believe there is no way Maybelline or any company can top that one.</li>
            <li>Regardless of one or two layers, I did find that the mascara did help extend my lashes and if applied right can look full without being clumpy or gooey looking like some others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This formula really stays on through the humidity, sweat and tears , but yet removes easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara is my new go-to mascara.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new favorite even though I own a different type of Maybelline mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to remove which means clean lashes for a fresh application the next day.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>I use this product on the daily and loved it so much I had to subscribe to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascaras for years, my favorites being the Volum&#x27; Express The Falsies and Volum&#x27; Express Colossal.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself seems nice once you get it on in the proper amount.</li>
            <li>I like the more &#x27;natural&#x27; color and</li>
            <li>This new Lash Sensational version works just as great as my other two favorites, but the brush on this one is very different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It stays on through a normal day and removes easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using some higher end products the last few years, some good, some not so good.</li>
            <li>With one coat, I would say this does a good job at adding subtle definition to eyelashes for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>It costs  fraction of some of my other mascaras and is superior all around.</li>
            <li>I want a mascara that I can use right out of the package, without practicing.</li>
            <li>Color is a nice, rich black.</li>
            <li>I recently started using Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about using a curved wand, but was surprised at how helpful it really is to apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like I am), the absolute last thing I&#x27;m going to do is try to get all of the tendrils nice and curled by rotating the brush this way and that way.  </li>
            <li>one thing that I was kind of put off about is that you have to pull the brush upwards and do this maneuver to get every single eyelash plumped up.  </li>
            <li>Love the shape of the brush - lots of bristles in a curved shape that seems to reach and coat every lash with a dark, smooth, just the right thickness, non clumping mascara.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I have teeny, tiny lashes.  </li>
            <li>Another great thing is that this mascara really is long lasting.  </li>
            <li>In fact, if I am in a rush and I have to do all of this work (not really a lot of work, but when you&#x27;re in a rush everything seems like a lot of work) to get nicely curled lashes, that just means that the mascara is the first thing in my beauty routine to go.  </li>
            <li>I also love the color of the bottle (though that has nothing to do with the actual product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Easily removed with make-up remover but didn&#x27;t smudge during the day, which is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>The first tube I&#x27;ve ever had that problem with.  </li>
            <li>But, Maybelline never fails to surprise me.</li>
            <li>I think I would like this mascara much more if the applicator was different.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality mascara, similar at the one I’ve been using for many years from Maybelline, and what it makes it outstanding is the fanning brush, which allows to spread the mascara evenly to achieve a dramatic or natural look, depending of the hour of the day or the mood, I’m in.</li>
            <li>The tube is tapered, which makes it hard to stand up on a flat surface, and it rolls, so this is not the best choice for travel or using in the ladies&#x27; room.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty long-lasting, although summer will be the real test of that.     </li>
            <li>I like the final effect and the fact that is so easy to wash out, and in spite of it, while being worn, it didn’t smear or peel off.</li>
            <li>a Red Carpet look, it&#x27;s easy to take off with eye make-up remover before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can apply a second layer if you want thicker lashes or just let the first one suffice for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>It has never taken me so little time to apply--and I have nice looking lashes</li>
            <li>This might be one of my favorites that I&#x27;ve tried lately and certainly feel good about recommending it.</li>
            <li>This mascara is decent and a good value but not a whole lot different than the brands I used when I first started experimenting with makeup some (gulp)</li>
            <li>I am very fussy about mascara -</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune on designer mascara because Maybelline really makes the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wand pulls out way too much mascara on the brush/comb, so your lashes get all globbed up.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it really extends what lashes I have.</li>
            <li>It pulls way, way, way too much product out of the bottle, so it&#x27;s coated with mascara.</li>
            <li>Then, I don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li>Each time, the brush deposited about three times too much mascara</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t know why they have to allow so much onto the brush.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t put too much on at once.</li>
            <li>It really does make my lashes look fuller.</li>
            <li>The crescent shaped brush really fills with the mascara</li>
            <li>did manage to get the look I prefer by applying just the tiy bit of mascara and without twisting the brush too much, so that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with irritation and it removes nicely with eye make up remover</li>
            <li>okay, probably good enough, but not great.</li>
            <li>The tube is so thick, it doesn&#x27;t fit into most of the slots in my makeup organizer.  </li>
            <li>Not fun, but if you take extra time, it will look good.</li>
            <li>This is a good example of \\&quot;drugstore makeup\\&quot; that is about the same as the much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>One could apply a second coat for a more dramatic look, but I think it&#x27;s nice that with one coat it doesn&#x27;t really look like one is wearing mascara.  </li>
            <li>I think I might be switching to a new brand!</li>
            <li>I typically use a mascara with longer bristles, and I&#x27;ve gotten better results with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so I will be very interested if I purchase a new one if the brush is the same.</li>
            <li>have thin lashes that are on the shorter side, so for special occasions, I need something that adds more volume than this does.  </li>
            <li>It makes lashes soft and beautiful looking, not clumpy or fake.</li>
            <li>Application of the mascara is not hard.</li>
            <li>Apparently our eyelashes are actually in different layers and this new mascara and brush promises to  accent and make the most of every upper and lower eyelash.  </li>
            <li>The gimmick with this new product is that the brush has \\&quot;layers of bristles\\&quot; for \\&quot;layers of lashes\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>My favorite was Lash Stilletto, which I couldn&#x27;t find at the store I usually shop at</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water resistant in terms of a few tears, but it wipes away easily with baby oil, petroleum jelly, or the like.</li>
            <li>--I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance and don&#x27;t like the extra time that takes, and with this mascara, it&#x27;s really a necessity.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this last brush are a little more spiky looking.</li>
            <li>The brush is easy enough to use and the color I have \\&quot;very black\\&quot; is very black as promised.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s time to wash it off, it comes off completely with a make-up remover cloth.</li>
            <li>It washes off well too and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive</li>
            <li>it usually takes me a while, as I put it on, and try to get the gobs of mascara to smooth out and not look so fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The formula dries so quickly that there are literally long pieces of dried mascara at the ends of your lashes, and they have to be pulled off because the lower part of the lash doesn&#x27;t have as much on it.</li>
            <li>while the brush did a good job of coating the lashes, I do think the product did come on a little thick.</li>
            <li>I felt the formula was very similar to the Maybelline New</li>
            <li>We are in that fun part of the allergy year in which we get lots of pollen blowing in from the desert, which makes for lots of sneezes and slightly watery eyes.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t &#x27;flicking&#x27; or &#x27;turning&#x27; good enough (but I&#x27;m sorry,</li>
            <li>It is subtle enough for day wear if the user doesn&#x27;t apply too many coats.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t turn hard.  </li>
            <li>Neither is the L&#x27;Oreal mascara that I generally use, but I prefer that to this.  </li>
            <li>I also like the larger, somewhat thick, bullet-shaped tube, because it is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid $25 for Estes Lauter, Clinique, and other high end brands,  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;I will pick my favorite Lash Discovery over this any day.</li>
            <li> This is more of a web mascara</li>
            <li> This is a really great mascara, really thickens and lengthens lashes more than any of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many, many kinds</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Maybelline New Your Lash Sensational Mascara.  </li>
            <li> I thought that this mascara ran quite a bit more than the L&#x27;Oreal does, and thus more easily led to &#x27;raccoon eyes.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> It has a terrific fine toothed brush that separates my lashes perfectly.</li>
            <li> And it washes off very easily without any special makeup</li>
            <li> I thought the brush was good in theory but in reality it made my lashes very clumpy and spidery.</li>
            <li> If I just use my oil free make-up remover this does not come off well so be sure to apply warm water and a good face soap prior to removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and thankfully it doesn&#x27;t clump easily.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily without clumping and does not harden or flake off during the day.  </li>
            <li> I found that it came off easily at night</li>
            <li> It lasts all day without flaking off and it goes on easily.</li>
            <li> You can coat your lashes easily with one application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to wash off too.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on easily, but the drawback is that it clumps.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to take off once you soak it</li>
            <li> I found the mascara easy to apply without clumping.  </li>
            <li> Also and very important the mascara did not crumble into my eye which is super.</li>
            <li> They must have elves and fairies working their beauty magic at their headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mabelline never fails to outdo their competitors or themselves!</li>
            <li> My daughter tried it and kept it because she liked it so much.</li>
            <li> If the brush was one with softer, denser bristles, application would be fantastic and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy the lumpy</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara is a pretty good mascara for the price - basically ten dollars for a nice mascara (</li>
            <li> Its worth it though, because other than the difficulty removing it, its the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used,</li>
            <li> Original review:</li>
            <li> And while Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara didn&#x27;t do this either, it got pretty damn</li>
            <li> If you naturally have long lashes, this will be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li> This is a good, basic mascara choice when looking for a mascara that costs under $10.  </li>
            <li> This is certainly good enough mascara.  </li>
            <li> No issues with it flaking off after a full day of wear.  </li>
            <li> I then apply an oil free makeup remover on a Q-Tip and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite that, I really do like the Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara.  </li>
            <li> I really like this Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Super product and works well.</li>
            <li> , it is kind of creepy when you see in come off, like eyelash skins, but it doesn&#x27;t smear and comes off so easily that this type has become my favorite kind of mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wearably pretty, comfortable mascara that won&#x27;t make your eyes itch.</li>
            <li> I put on mascara, I use the tip end first and then smooth it through.  </li>
            <li> A new favorite for me.</li>
            <li> time Maybelline comes out with a new mascara, I believe there is no way Maybelline or any company can top that one.</li>
            <li> Regardless of one or two layers, I did find that the mascara did help extend my lashes and if applied right can look full without being clumpy or gooey looking like some others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This formula really stays on through the humidity, sweat and tears , but yet removes easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara is my new go-to mascara.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my new favorite even though I own a different type of Maybelline mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to remove which means clean lashes for a fresh application the next day.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> I use this product on the daily and loved it so much I had to subscribe to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascaras for years, my favorites being the Volum&#x27; Express The Falsies and Volum&#x27; Express Colossal.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself seems nice once you get it on in the proper amount.</li>
            <li> I like the more &#x27;natural&#x27; color and</li>
            <li> This new Lash Sensational version works just as great as my other two favorites, but the brush on this one is very different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It stays on through a normal day and removes easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using some higher end products the last few years, some good, some not so good.</li>
            <li> With one coat, I would say this does a good job at adding subtle definition to eyelashes for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> It costs  fraction of some of my other mascaras and is superior all around.</li>
            <li> I want a mascara that I can use right out of the package, without practicing.</li>
            <li> Color is a nice, rich black.</li>
            <li> I recently started using Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about using a curved wand, but was surprised at how helpful it really is to apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I am), the absolute last thing I&#x27;m going to do is try to get all of the tendrils nice and curled by rotating the brush this way and that way.  </li>
            <li> one thing that I was kind of put off about is that you have to pull the brush upwards and do this maneuver to get every single eyelash plumped up.  </li>
            <li> Love the shape of the brush - lots of bristles in a curved shape that seems to reach and coat every lash with a dark, smooth, just the right thickness, non clumping mascara.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have teeny, tiny lashes.  </li>
            <li> Another great thing is that this mascara really is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> In fact, if I am in a rush and I have to do all of this work (not really a lot of work, but when you&#x27;re in a rush everything seems like a lot of work) to get nicely curled lashes, that just means that the mascara is the first thing in my beauty routine to go.  </li>
            <li> I also love the color of the bottle (though that has nothing to do with the actual product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Easily removed with make-up remover but didn&#x27;t smudge during the day, which is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> The first tube I&#x27;ve ever had that problem with.  </li>
            <li> But, Maybelline never fails to surprise me.</li>
            <li> I think I would like this mascara much more if the applicator was different.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality mascara, similar at the one I’ve been using for many years from Maybelline, and what it makes it outstanding is the fanning brush, which allows to spread the mascara evenly to achieve a dramatic or natural look, depending of the hour of the day or the mood, I’m in.</li>
            <li> The tube is tapered, which makes it hard to stand up on a flat surface, and it rolls, so this is not the best choice for travel or using in the ladies&#x27; room.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty long-lasting, although summer will be the real test of that.     </li>
            <li> I like the final effect and the fact that is so easy to wash out, and in spite of it, while being worn, it didn’t smear or peel off.</li>
            <li> a Red Carpet look, it&#x27;s easy to take off with eye make-up remover before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can apply a second layer if you want thicker lashes or just let the first one suffice for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> It has never taken me so little time to apply--and I have nice looking lashes</li>
            <li> This might be one of my favorites that I&#x27;ve tried lately and certainly feel good about recommending it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is decent and a good value but not a whole lot different than the brands I used when I first started experimenting with makeup some (gulp)</li>
            <li> I am very fussy about mascara -</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune on designer mascara because Maybelline really makes the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wand pulls out way too much mascara on the brush/comb, so your lashes get all globbed up.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> and it really extends what lashes I have.</li>
            <li> It pulls way, way, way too much product out of the bottle, so it&#x27;s coated with mascara.</li>
            <li> Then, I don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li> Each time, the brush deposited about three times too much mascara</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t know why they have to allow so much onto the brush.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t put too much on at once.</li>
            <li> It really does make my lashes look fuller.</li>
            <li> The crescent shaped brush really fills with the mascara</li>
            <li> did manage to get the look I prefer by applying just the tiy bit of mascara and without twisting the brush too much, so that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with irritation and it removes nicely with eye make up remover</li>
            <li> okay, probably good enough, but not great.</li>
            <li> The tube is so thick, it doesn&#x27;t fit into most of the slots in my makeup organizer.  </li>
            <li> Not fun, but if you take extra time, it will look good.</li>
            <li> This is a good example of \\&quot;drugstore makeup\\&quot; that is about the same as the much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> One could apply a second coat for a more dramatic look, but I think it&#x27;s nice that with one coat it doesn&#x27;t really look like one is wearing mascara.  </li>
            <li> I think I might be switching to a new brand!</li>
            <li> I typically use a mascara with longer bristles, and I&#x27;ve gotten better results with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so I will be very interested if I purchase a new one if the brush is the same.</li>
            <li> have thin lashes that are on the shorter side, so for special occasions, I need something that adds more volume than this does.  </li>
            <li> It makes lashes soft and beautiful looking, not clumpy or fake.</li>
            <li> Application of the mascara is not hard.</li>
            <li> Apparently our eyelashes are actually in different layers and this new mascara and brush promises to  accent and make the most of every upper and lower eyelash.  </li>
            <li> The gimmick with this new product is that the brush has \\&quot;layers of bristles\\&quot; for \\&quot;layers of lashes\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My favorite was Lash Stilletto, which I couldn&#x27;t find at the store I usually shop at</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water resistant in terms of a few tears, but it wipes away easily with baby oil, petroleum jelly, or the like.</li>
            <li> --I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance and don&#x27;t like the extra time that takes, and with this mascara, it&#x27;s really a necessity.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this last brush are a little more spiky looking.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy enough to use and the color I have \\&quot;very black\\&quot; is very black as promised.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time to wash it off, it comes off completely with a make-up remover cloth.</li>
            <li> It washes off well too and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive</li>
            <li> it usually takes me a while, as I put it on, and try to get the gobs of mascara to smooth out and not look so fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The formula dries so quickly that there are literally long pieces of dried mascara at the ends of your lashes, and they have to be pulled off because the lower part of the lash doesn&#x27;t have as much on it.</li>
            <li> while the brush did a good job of coating the lashes, I do think the product did come on a little thick.</li>
            <li> I felt the formula was very similar to the Maybelline New</li>
            <li> We are in that fun part of the allergy year in which we get lots of pollen blowing in from the desert, which makes for lots of sneezes and slightly watery eyes.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t &#x27;flicking&#x27; or &#x27;turning&#x27; good enough (but I&#x27;m sorry,</li>
            <li> It is subtle enough for day wear if the user doesn&#x27;t apply too many coats.  </li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t turn hard.  </li>
            <li> Neither is the L&#x27;Oreal mascara that I generally use, but I prefer that to this.  </li>
            <li> I also like the larger, somewhat thick, bullet-shaped tube, because it is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid $25 for Estes Lauter, Clinique, and other high end brands,  </li>
            <li> if I have to do all those steps for it to go on smoothly, I&#x27;ll stick to a product that takes less effort), but at least once the mascara was on, it stayed in place and didn&#x27;t flake off or run.</li>
            <li> I have really stubby small lashes and</li>
            <li> I was not blessed with long lashes, and have been battling with mascaras my entire life.  </li>
            <li> I usually remove my eye makeup with baby oil, which with every other mascara (including the waterproof kinds) it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> The short side of the brush that&#x27;s intended to help you get to the base of your lashes works fairly well, but wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if the other side of the brush was not so sparsely bristled.  </li>
            <li> I have sparse but long lashes that seem to attract every flake and clump that mascara can deliver.</li>
            <li> negative is the brush is a bit on the small side, it takes several swipes to get full coverage.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other mascaras, this works well with glasses (no smears on the inner lens) or contacts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a true black mascara that that doesn&#x27;t flake and washes off well, but is very hard to apply without clumps.  </li>
            <li> While this Maybelline mascara isn&#x27;t going to replace my current favorite, it wasn&#x27;t bad -</li>
            <li> When you go to put it on, your lashes end up a big, stuck together, gloopy mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting, it&#x27;s actually very black</li>
            <li> But my guess is: I will think roughly what I think now:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this kind of wand before and hated it, but this mascara was different.</li>
            <li> The brush on this particular brand is small, curved, with small bristles.  </li>
            <li> such things usually are.  </li>
            <li> The secret is the amount of layers one applies, I’m using only one, because this product is dark and thick, and as I write this review, the ‘natural’ look is what is in, at the present time.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have yet to meet a mascara that gives me the same long luxurious lashes that the males in my family have been unnecessarily blessed with.  </li>
            <li> I worked on the turn it suggests and it does take a minute to get it down, but</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s down - it does seem to work.  </li>
            <li> so you should be careful to let this fully dry onto your lashes as if you touch them they will sick together which happened to me the first time I used it, but a mistake on my part.</li>
            <li> The mascara (color: blackest black) coats each lash with color.</li>
            <li> I buy the blackest black.</li>
            <li> It flakes off when you remove it instead of clumping in a greasy mess on your lashes.</li>
            <li> like my lashes long and not too thick, well separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good formula, very bad brush, ridiculously shaped tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One can use it to apply just a little bit of mascara to outer lashes, or layer the stuff on.....which is seldom my preferred mode.  </li>
            <li> The color of the mascara is very dark</li>
            <li> Because it has a hard plastic brush with bristles that are spaced widely, I end up with globs of mascara that I have to eliminate.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, allergy prone eyes--I&#x27;ve had trouble with everything from Covergirl to Lancome to expensive organic mascaras.  </li>
            <li> This mascara does not clump up if you apply it slowly and carefully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a rest and then try using it again in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The liquid ink formula coats my lashes in Very Black giving me the look I had been looking for since 1968.</li>
            <li> I often use a mascara base or booster for those special occasions.  </li>
            <li> You can eventually get thick, dark looking lashes that aren&#x27;t spidery, but it&#x27;s a pain.  </li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because this is tough stuff to remove!  </li>
            <li> Usually when mascara gets clumpy, it is also drying out.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are delicate and manage to grab all of my lashes.</li>
            <li> every complaint I have would, I believe, be solved.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick, doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li> life&#x27;s not fair.  </li>
            <li> It is really hard for me to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or flake or smudge throughout the day, but, my search is over!</li>
            <li> you use this mascara&#x27;s brush, and aplly the msacara as instructed, you get a very thick layer of mascara, lumpy even.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it when it looks thick, clumpy and fake and when it smears.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not GREAT mascara.  </li>
            <li> Having some mascara flecks inside an eye while wearing contacts, is a horrible experience, so this product is highly recommended for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it flakes quite a bit over the course of a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding it difficult to distribute the mascara evenly on all my lashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad:</li>
            <li> Very frustrating to use!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This mascara is decent and a good value but not a whole lot different than the brands I used when I first started experimenting with makeup some (gulp) forty years ago.  The gimmick with this new product is that the brush has \\&quot;layers of bristles\\&quot; for \\&quot;layers of lashes\\&quot;.  Apparently our eyelashes are actually in different layers and this new mascara and brush promises to  accent and make the most of every upper and lower eyelash.  The brush is easy enough to use and the color I have \\&quot;very black\\&quot; is very black as promised.  It  seems wetter than some mascara which is a plus and thankfully it doesn&#x27;t clump easily.  It is subtle enough for day wear if the user doesn&#x27;t apply too many coats.  This is a good example of \\&quot;drugstore makeup\\&quot; that is about the same as the much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, allergy prone eyes--I&#x27;ve had trouble with everything from Covergirl to Lancome to expensive organic mascaras.  Surprisingly, this doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.  It&#x27;s a wearably pretty, comfortable mascara that won&#x27;t make your eyes itch. It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear on application. Unfortunately, it flakes quite a bit over the course of a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is comparable to much more expensive mascaras, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on. Not Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a good, basic mascara choice when looking for a mascara that costs under $10.  I think it&#x27;s great for everyday wear.  It goes on easily without clumping and does not harden or flake off during the day.  I guess I&#x27;m done with Cover Girl now because my Cover Girl mascaras harden and sometimes flake off.  This stuff is comparable in price, yet superior in quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin lashes that are on the shorter side, so for special occasions, I need something that adds more volume than this does.  I often use a mascara base or booster for those special occasions.  If you naturally have long lashes, this will be perfect for you.  For me, I love it for every day wear because it looks nice and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara is my new go-to mascara.  I am very fussy about mascara - I don&#x27;t like it when it looks thick, clumpy and fake and when it smears.  I recently started using Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara and it really is sensational!  Love the shape of the brush - lots of bristles in a curved shape that seems to reach and coat every lash with a dark, smooth, just the right thickness, non clumping mascara. Each lash seems to stand out nicely.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with irritation and it removes nicely with eye make up remover pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline for their mascara. You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune on designer mascara because Maybelline really makes the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand on the Lash Sensational Mascara is curved. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about using a curved wand, but was surprised at how helpful it really is to apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara does not chip, flake or throw specs onto my eyelid when applying. It glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t turn hard.  When it&#x27;s time to wash it off, it comes off completely with a make-up remover cloth. None was left on my eyes afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite even though I own a different type of Maybelline mascara.</li>
            <li> I have sparse but long lashes that seem to attract every flake and clump that mascara can deliver. I really love this mascara. It has a terrific fine toothed brush that separates my lashes perfectly. The mascara (color: blackest black) coats each lash with color. It dries quickly and lasts all day. I found that it came off easily at night and I don&#x27;t wake up with residual everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other mascaras, this works well with glasses (no smears on the inner lens) or contacts. It looks great all day at work and doesn&#x27;t fade or run. It costs  fraction of some of my other mascaras and is superior all around. Highly recommended. A new favorite for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this kind of wand before and hated it, but this mascara was different. I applied with a lighter hand and loved the way it looked. This mascara does not clump up if you apply it slowly and carefully. It&#x27;s water resistant in terms of a few tears, but it wipes away easily with baby oil, petroleum jelly, or the like. It flakes off when you remove it instead of clumping in a greasy mess on your lashes. It&#x27;s very easy to remove which means clean lashes for a fresh application the next day. This kind of plastic wand seems to work better when you start with bare/clean lashes versus applying to day-old mascara.</li>
            <li> This is certainly good enough mascara.  I like the brush, which seems to be more versatile than such things usually are.  One can use it to apply just a little bit of mascara to outer lashes, or layer the stuff on.....which is seldom my preferred mode.  But it&#x27;s an option, one of several that the brush design makes possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not GREAT mascara.  Neither is the L&#x27;Oreal mascara that I generally use, but I prefer that to this.  We are in that fun part of the allergy year in which we get lots of pollen blowing in from the desert, which makes for lots of sneezes and slightly watery eyes.  I thought that this mascara ran quite a bit more than the L&#x27;Oreal does, and thus more easily led to &#x27;raccoon eyes.&#x27;  I&#x27;ll give it a rest and then try using it again in a few weeks.  But my guess is: I will think roughly what I think now:  okay, probably good enough, but not great.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite mascara of all. I buy the blackest black. This formula really stays on through the humidity, sweat and tears , but yet removes easily with makeup remover. It creates a tube effect on the lashes and when you remove it in the shower,  it comes off in pieces, not leaving you with racoon eyes. I&#x27;ve paid $25 for Estes Lauter, Clinique, and other high end brands,  but now that I&#x27;ve found this,  In never going back. My daughter tried it and kept it because she liked it so much. Is her favorite as well.</li>
            <li> I use this product on the daily and loved it so much I had to subscribe to it. I have really stubby small lashes and this mascara makes it seem as though I have lashes FOR DAYS! It is really hard for me to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or flake or smudge throughout the day, but, my search is over!</li>
            <li> Where to begin?! The wand pulls out way too much mascara on the brush/comb, so your lashes get all globbed up. The brush&#x27;s teeth aren&#x27;t close enough together, so it adds to the clumping together effect. The formula dries so quickly that there are literally long pieces of dried mascara at the ends of your lashes, and they have to be pulled off because the lower part of the lash doesn&#x27;t have as much on it. Taking the mascara off at the end of the day is a pain as well...tends to come off in pieces. Very frustrating to use!!</li>
            <li> This is a good quality mascara, similar at the one I’ve been using for many years from Maybelline, and what it makes it outstanding is the fanning brush, which allows to spread the mascara evenly to achieve a dramatic or natural look, depending of the hour of the day or the mood, I’m in. The secret is the amount of layers one applies, I’m using only one, because this product is dark and thick, and as I write this review, the ‘natural’ look is what is in, at the present time. I like the final effect and the fact that is so easy to wash out, and in spite of it, while being worn, it didn’t smear or peel off. As a contact lens wearer, this is essential on any mascara I use. Having some mascara flecks inside an eye while wearing contacts, is a horrible experience, so this product is highly recommended for me.</li>
            <li> I have actually used loreal mascara for years but thought I would try this. I really like it. It does not leave smudges when my eyes are watering. It lasts all day without flaking off and it goes on easily. I do curl my lashes then apply this and it really extends what lashes I have. I think I might be switching to a new brand!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have teeny, tiny lashes.  The only people in my family who have been graced with bodacious, luxurious lashes have been the males...who have all told me they have no use for them.  So, yeah, life&#x27;s not fair.  Anyway, I have yet to meet a mascara that gives me the same long luxurious lashes that the males in my family have been unnecessarily blessed with.  And while Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara didn&#x27;t do this either, it got pretty damn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t clump when you apply it.  That&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve always had an issue with.  Another great thing is that this mascara really is long lasting.  I&#x27;ll put it on in the morning at about 9:00AM, and it will still be on when I wash my face at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I was kind of put off about is that you have to pull the brush upwards and do this maneuver to get every single eyelash plumped up.  And while that&#x27;s great if you have tons of time do that, if you are almost always in a rush (like I am), the absolute last thing I&#x27;m going to do is try to get all of the tendrils nice and curled by rotating the brush this way and that way.  In fact, if I am in a rush and I have to do all of this work (not really a lot of work, but when you&#x27;re in a rush everything seems like a lot of work) to get nicely curled lashes, that just means that the mascara is the first thing in my beauty routine to go.  So, that&#x27;s why the four stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, I really do like the Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara.  It&#x27;s long lasting, it&#x27;s actually very black like it states, and there isn&#x27;t any clumpiness associated with it.  So, it&#x27;s still a win.</li>
            <li> The good: This mascara lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t flake, and dries quickly. It&#x27;s a great color and darkens the lashes. You can coat your lashes easily with one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The brush. Oh, the brush. It pulls way, way, way too much product out of the bottle, so it&#x27;s coated with mascara. When you go to put it on, your lashes end up a big, stuck together, gloopy mess. I don&#x27;t like to go back and separate my lashes after I apply mascara--I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance and don&#x27;t like the extra time that takes, and with this mascara, it&#x27;s really a necessity.</li>
            <li> With one coat, I would say this does a good job at adding subtle definition to eyelashes for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look.  Fans eyelashes out nicely.  One could apply a second coat for a more dramatic look, but I think it&#x27;s nice that with one coat it doesn&#x27;t really look like one is wearing mascara.  Not too thick, doesn&#x27;t clump.  No issues with it flaking off after a full day of wear.  And it washes off very easily without any special makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is the brush is a bit on the small side, it takes several swipes to get full coverage.  That being said, that seems to be the case with most mascara wands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of brands of mascara, but Maybelline always falls back to being my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the brush the most. The bristles are delicate and manage to grab all of my lashes. I also love the color of the bottle (though that has nothing to do with the actual product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily removed with make-up remover but didn&#x27;t smudge during the day, which is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I was not blessed with long lashes, and have been battling with mascaras my entire life.  Of course, over the years, things have gotten worse--not better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder of wonders:  This combination of application brush and mascara consistency works for me just fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  It has never taken me so little time to apply--and I have nice looking lashes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays on through a normal day and removes easily.  I also like the larger, somewhat thick, bullet-shaped tube, because it is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascaras for years, my favorites being the Volum&#x27; Express The Falsies and Volum&#x27; Express Colossal. This new Lash Sensational version works just as great as my other two favorites, but the brush on this one is very different. The bristles on this last brush are a little more spiky looking. The brush works great when you have lots of lashes that need separated while applying the mascara. It gets the color onto even smallest thinnest lashes, without making it clumpy. It makes lashes soft and beautiful looking, not clumpy or fake. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Short version: 2.5 out of 5.  Good formula, very bad brush, ridiculously shaped tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long version:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a true black mascara that that doesn&#x27;t flake and washes off well, but is very hard to apply without clumps.  Because it has a hard plastic brush with bristles that are spaced widely, I end up with globs of mascara that I have to eliminate.  Not fun, but if you take extra time, it will look good. You can eventually get thick, dark looking lashes that aren&#x27;t spidery, but it&#x27;s a pain.  If the brush was one with softer, denser bristles, application would be fantastic and every complaint I have would, I believe, be solved.  The short side of the brush that&#x27;s intended to help you get to the base of your lashes works fairly well, but wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if the other side of the brush was not so sparsely bristled.  The tube is so thick, it doesn&#x27;t fit into most of the slots in my makeup organizer.  The first tube I&#x27;ve ever had that problem with.  That wouldn&#x27;t be a deal-breaker if I loved everything else about it.</li>
            <li> After using this mascara for the life of its contents, I found that the application got quite clumpy as weeks wore on.  There was still quite a bit of product left that was moist.  Usually when mascara gets clumpy, it is also drying out.  For me this mascara is just okay.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara really is sensational! The liquid ink formula coats my lashes in Very Black giving me the look I had been looking for since 1968. This is a mascara not only gives my eyes a Red Carpet look, it&#x27;s easy to take off with eye make-up remover before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time Maybelline comes out with a new mascara, I believe there is no way Maybelline or any company can top that one. But, Maybelline never fails to surprise me. And here, they&#x27;ve done it again. Amazing. They must have elves and fairies working their beauty magic at their headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mabelline never fails to outdo their competitors or themselves!</li>
            <li> Edited: I upped it from 3 to 4 stars. I have discovered that I need a very light hand with the wand, and to wipe it on the end of the tube before using. Then, I don&#x27;t apply too much. Color is a nice, rich black. It seems pretty long-lasting, although summer will be the real test of that.     Original review: \\&quot;Learn the turn\\&quot;? I don&#x27;t have the time. I tried to put it on four times. Each time, the brush deposited about three times too much mascara and I had to wipe it off and start again, or have clumps in my lashes. I want a mascara that I can use right out of the package, without practicing. I also don&#x27;t know why they have to allow so much onto the brush. I wind up wiping it on a tissue so I don&#x27;t put too much on at once. I am wasting the product and at $7 a pop, would rather not. I&#x27;ll update as I figure this out. The mascara itself seems nice once you get it on in the proper amount. The tube is tapered, which makes it hard to stand up on a flat surface, and it rolls, so this is not the best choice for travel or using in the ladies&#x27; room.</li>
            <li> I really like this Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara. It really does make my lashes look fuller. The crescent shaped brush really fills with the mascara and I used both sides to fill out upper and lower lashes. Super product and works well. Also and very important the mascara did not crumble into my eye which is super. Easy to wash off too.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this product.  I thought it was some kind of hype about the bristles, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put on mascara, I use the tip end first and then smooth it through.  it usually takes me a while, as I put it on, and try to get the gobs of mascara to smooth out and not look so fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, there was no globbing up of the mascara.  This has never happened before. Not only is it faster, and easier, it separates the lashes instantly. Minimum effort for great results.</li>
            <li> The brush on this particular brand is small, curved, with small bristles.  I&#x27;m finding it difficult to distribute the mascara evenly on all my lashes.  I typically use a mascara with longer bristles, and I&#x27;ve gotten better results with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s mid-day, and the mascara I applied this morning is already leaving some smudging under my eyes.  So I likely will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mascara and try it as a dupe for younique. Application of the mascara is not hard. I thought the brush was good in theory but in reality it made my lashes very clumpy and spidery. The color of the mascara is very dark and I loved that. The mascara goes on easily, but the drawback is that it clumps.I think I would like this mascara much more if the applicator was different.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Mascara is a pretty good mascara for the price - basically ten dollars for a nice mascara (the color I used was their black/brown). The brush has plenty of bristles that allows for all of the lashes to reached and some nice effects, and the make-up itself is decent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using some higher end products the last few years, some good, some not so good. While this Maybelline mascara isn&#x27;t going to replace my current favorite, it wasn&#x27;t bad - I like the more &#x27;natural&#x27; color and while the brush did a good job of coating the lashes, I do think the product did come on a little thick. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t &#x27;flicking&#x27; or &#x27;turning&#x27; good enough (but I&#x27;m sorry, if I have to do all those steps for it to go on smoothly, I&#x27;ll stick to a product that takes less effort), but at least once the mascara was on, it stayed in place and didn&#x27;t flake off or run.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites!! It is a Skin type mascara so it is easy to take off once you soak it, it is kind of creepy when you see in come off, like eyelash skins, but it doesn&#x27;t smear and comes off so easily that this type has become my favorite kind of mascara. I love this brand.</li>
            <li> I am blonde so need mascara to not appear washed out</li>
            <li> It is not my favorite mascara, but I still like it. The brush could have longer bristles. Looks great on and didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> Your opinion of this masacra will depend on how you prefer your lashes to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my lashes long and not too thick, well separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this mascara&#x27;s brush, and aplly the msacara as instructed, you get a very thick layer of mascara, lumpy even. I don&#x27;t enjoy the lumpy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to get the look I prefer by applying just the tiy bit of mascara and without twisting the brush too much, so that&#x27;s that. It washes off well too and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will pick my favorite Lash Discovery over this any day.</li>
            <li> Works great to enhance your lashes.  I worked on the turn it suggests and it does take a minute to get it down, but once it&#x27;s down - it does seem to work.  I found the mascara easy to apply without clumping.  You can apply a second layer if you want thicker lashes or just let the first one suffice for a more natural look.  Regardless of one or two layers, I did find that the mascara did help extend my lashes and if applied right can look full without being clumpy or gooey looking like some others I have tried.  This might be one of my favorites that I&#x27;ve tried lately and certainly feel good about recommending it. Marilyn</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Maybelline New Your Lash Sensational Mascara.  I felt it did to lengthen, thicken, and separates my lashes.  This is more of a web mascara so you should be careful to let this fully dry onto your lashes as if you touch them they will sick together which happened to me the first time I used it, but a mistake on my part. I felt the formula was very similar to the Maybelline New Your Volum Express - The Rocket Mascara which I did not care for, perhaps it was the brush on that one that just didn&#x27;t work for me. This product washes of well with warm water and cleanser.  I then apply an oil free makeup remover on a Q-Tip and it comes right off.  If I just use my oil free make-up remover this does not come off well so be sure to apply warm water and a good face soap prior to removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the picture in the description my brush did not look like the.  The bristles were EXTREMELY short so I will be very interested if I purchase a new one if the brush is the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascaras for years.  My favorite was Lash Stilletto, which I couldn&#x27;t find at the store I usually shop at, so I thought I&#x27;d give the Lash Sensational a try.  This is a really great mascara, really thickens and lengthens lashes more than any of the others I&#x27;ve used. Better than even the expensive dept. store brands. And it doesn&#x27;t end up flaking off making me look like a raccoon by the end of the day.  I only give it 4 stars because this is tough stuff to remove!  Forget about it being washable - I tried and not a bit washed off, even with a good scrubbing.  I usually remove my eye makeup with baby oil, which with every other mascara (including the waterproof kinds) it comes right off.  Not with this mascara!  I have to soak my eyelashes with the baby oil, and even then, rub them vigorously to get it all off.  I am going to try different eye makeup removers to use with this mascara.  Its worth it though, because other than the difficulty removing it, its the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many kinds</li>
