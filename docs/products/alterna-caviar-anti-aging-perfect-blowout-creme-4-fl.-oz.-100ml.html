            <li>This stuff is magic and love my hair again.</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments.</li>
            <li>Had gotten a full-size sample from a friend who attended &amp;#34;Her Goody Bag&amp;#34; beauty show in NYC, so I was able to use it a lot before I needed to buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for women who love a good blow-out but with out the added frizz.</li>
            <li>I can notice a huge difference in my hair, every time I use this line.</li>
            <li>The texture of my hair was smooth with no frizz.  </li>
            <li>The product leaves your hair smooth and shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Like a light clean citrus.</li>
            <li>It did smell okay, but that doesn&#x27;t say much.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled that they developed a blow-out creme.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my hair is super greasy from having this stuff on it all day.</li>
            <li>I am still getting used to the right amount to use in my hair, but it really does avoid the frizz and make it easy to style.</li>
            <li>Works great on my wavy hair - super straight and shiny blow drys with minimal frizz!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>Normally I like the smell of hair care products because they smell fresh or like a light perfume.</li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and when I use this product my hair looks great</li>
            <li>It stayed straight for days!</li>
            <li>The products work their magic, especially this one.  </li>
            <li>This creme makes styling my new short haircut very easy.</li>
            <li>Good product, but not sure I would purchase this again.  </li>
            <li>This blowout creme does absolutely nothing for my hair, no shine, no body, no straightening.  </li>
            <li>I have very course and curly hair that I blow out every day.  </li>
            <li>The Blowout Creme helps to make my hair very shiny, manageable and straighter.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really funky.</li>
            <li>This is straight up chemical smell.</li>
            <li>It really tames and fly-aways and gives a glossy shine to the hair without being greasy.</li>
            <li>It works really well for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to blow out my hair.  </li>
            <li>It twists so that you are sure to make a mess when you close it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>This works very well to straighten my hair with ease, it also makes my hair feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Way too expensive in salons, but a great place here....</li>
            <li>My hair tends to have frizzy fly-aways and feel dry and brittle, when I do a blow-out, but I was surprised with how smooth my hair was after using just one application of this creme.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way to make your hair smooth, shiny and frizz free after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, this product weighed it down and left a film on it.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for a while, and then picked it back up a couple of days ago and realized much my hair needs it!</li>
            <li>I blow dry then flat iron, and this product makes me hair stay beautifully styled for a few days until next shampoo.</li>
            <li>The texture of the hair completely changes.</li>
            <li>Left my hair smooth but by the end of the day I had an odd greasy feeling but the hair didn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li>I had so much body my hair actually bounced, and the results lasted for several days before washing.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair naturally, but it cuts drying time and I can wash every other day instead of every day!</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, color treated hair (purple) with an variety of different textures but mostly very curly, past shoulder length.</li>

            <li> I have fine, thick, color treated hair (purple) with an variety of different textures but mostly very curly, past shoulder length. This makes my hair satiny and luxurious, and does reduce drying time. I like the smell, and the bottle. Great price on Amazon (I originally purchased from sephora). This works very well to straighten my hair with ease, it also makes my hair feel soft and moisturized. I blow dry then flat iron, and this product makes me hair stay beautifully styled for a few days until next shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent, hair is smooth and no flyaways</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using alterna caviar shampoo and conditioner, so I thought I&#x27;d give their styling products a try.  This blowout creme does absolutely nothing for my hair, no shine, no body, no straightening.  My hair just looked limp and uncontrolled, actually worse than if I had used no product at all.  It did smell okay, but that doesn&#x27;t say much.  I won&#x27;t be finishing this product, not worth any amount of  money.</li>

            <li> Love Alterna Products, and this being no exception.  Would recommend this brand and their shampoos and conditioners.  Well worth the price</li>
            <li> I had hopes for this product but let&#x27;s face it, there are comparable products at the drugstore that do the same thing and cost a lot less! The smell is really funky. Normally I like the smell of hair care products because they smell fresh or like a light perfume. This is straight up chemical smell. When I wake up in the morning my hair is super greasy from having this stuff on it all day. The silver cap at the bottom does not open or come off. It twists so that you are sure to make a mess when you close it. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, this product weighed it down and left a film on it. I will not be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly hair and turns to frizz the minute I put down the dryer.

            <li> I don&#x27;t often straighten my hair, but when I do I can&#x27;t survive without this product. It really tames and fly-aways and gives a glossy shine to the hair without being greasy. I was going to buy this product at Ulta but found it on Amazon for $5 cheaper so now I know where I will be shopping for the rest of my hair care products!</li>
            <li> The product leaves your hair smooth and shiny and frizz free. It is definitely a keeper. I have thick wavy hair and when I use this product my hair looks great and I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> Love this line! Makes huge difference with my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite sometime. Had gotten a full-size sample from a friend who attended &amp;#34;Her Goody Bag&amp;#34; beauty show in NYC, so I was able to use it a lot before I needed to buy it. I have curly frizzy hair, and with Cavier Blowout Creme, I have very little to no frizzing on a rainy day when I&#x27;ve blown out my hair. Could never get it from Sephora, which carries this line, so ordering it from Amazon is the easiest and quickest way to purchase it, for me. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. So happy I found it on Amazon, this was the best price any where.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It works really well for curly hair. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product in the salon and I love it! I stopped using it for a while, and then picked it back up a couple of days ago and realized much my hair needs it! I have straight hair naturally, but it cuts drying time and I can wash every other day instead of every day! Some things that should be noted, it needs to be purchased from an authorized seller or salon. If it&#x27;s expired, you won&#x27;t achieve the ideal results. For me, it&#x27;s great! I pair it with the Rapid Repair Spray for amazing results</li>
            <li> I had a chemical reaction to a body wave and thought nothing would help..  this is the best product I have ever used  and has helped with the condition of my hair....</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to blow out my hair.  My stylist is always happy when I bring it with me.  I do not relax my hair, hence my hair tends to frizz.</li>
            <li> Very good product! This creme makes styling my new short haircut very easy. It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, just use a little and blow dry.</li>
            <li> Best blow out cream ever!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that has worked. It made my hair easy to straighten, it was shiny and smooth and smelled great! It stayed straight for days!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair heavy and unmanageable. Really disappointed. Love alterna kendi oil and dry oil spray, but this product is horrible.</li>
            <li> It seems to dull the hair. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;ve been very satisfied that is what prompted me to try this cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have been a using Alterna products for years, including the shampoos and conditioners, and styling mousse. Even when I switch to try a different hair brand, I always come back to Alterna. Nothing compares. I can notice a huge difference in my hair, every time I use this line. I was thrilled that they developed a blow-out creme. My hair tends to have frizzy fly-aways and feel dry and brittle, when I do a blow-out, but I was surprised with how smooth my hair was after using just one application of this creme. The texture of the hair completely changes. I even tried it on my mother, who has very thin and delicate hair. I could not believe how healthy it made her hair look!

            <li> I am still getting used to the right amount to use in my hair, but it really does avoid the frizz and make it easy to style. Get it!</li>
            <li> Best blow out product !</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t heard of Alterna before, check it out.  The entire line of haircare is unbeatable.  They are conscious manufacturers that make the BEST smelling products of all time.  The products work their magic, especially this one.  It really is the PERFECT blowout creme :)</li>
            <li> I like the product but find it can be heavy on the hair.  I prefer a mist because it does not weigh down the hair.  Good product, but not sure I would purchase this again.  My hair needs volume.</li>
            <li> Love this! Way too expensive in salons, but a great place here....wonderful smell and tames the frizz!  Does not weigh hair down.</li>
