            <li> WOW!</li>

            <li> It is an aroma for a mature lady and a young girl.  </li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> The perfume itself was kind of okay, but both the lotion and butter was HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Wish the body butter and lotion were bigger sizes to last as long as the perfume does.  </li>
            <li> I would describe it as a slightly vanilla scent -- smokey and like a grown up women but not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a Christmas gift,  but it arrived much, much,  too late.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received one compliment yet, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on me long.</li>
            <li> I like that a little bit goes a long way, to where it last me a while.</li>
            <li> Was received way after the expected time.  </li>
            <li> I been trying to find this for the past couple of months and finally it showed that Amazon was selling it.</li>
            <li> The lotion smelled like a wet mop that went sour.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells like Dark Kiss a little.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance was nice but that nasty body butter and lotion looked like like runny sand with no smell.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> I use to get my body sprays from Victoria secret and Bath and body works.</li>
            <li> My point is I wasn&#x27;t looking for some victoria secret or bath and body work fragrance.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I opened the lotion it smelled nothing like the one my supervisor brought me from macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it just doesn&#x27;t stand out for me.</li>
            <li> Very bad experience.</li>

            <li> This is the first fragrance I have bought in a very long time that I just love the smell of.  It has a seductive tone that really sets it off.  Also great price on set.</li>
            <li> I love this set. It smells so good. It lasts all day long. At first, I was hesistant to buy it because of the price but its definitely original. Received it right on time as well. Thanks Amazon. Happy customer!</li>
            <li> It came so perfect! it was packaged so so SO VERY WELL! even included three samples ! :)  I would buy again from u any time!   Perfect job!</li>
            <li> It lasts on me, which I have others to do.  Wish the body butter and lotion were bigger sizes to last as long as the perfume does.  Or maybe those could be sold separately.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume, it is one of my favorites! It has a spicy and sweet undertone that works well together. My husband loves it too. It&#x27;s definitely a head turner ;).</li>
            <li> I love the smell, feel, and texture of the body lotion and body butter. It is smooth and creamy and NOT sticky.  The cologne has a sexy smell when  combined with the lotion and body butter leaves a scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and is long-lasting. I get alot of compliments about this fragrance from both men and women.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! This perfume smells amazing. I receive compliments all the time. It&#x27;s a rich, long lasting fragrance that is a great scent for anytime of the day.</li>
            <li> The price, delivery, and customer service is 5 stars all the way. The actual product and perfume in itself is just ok. This fragrance had so many good reviews and I just thought it would be this amazing, sexy, fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it just doesn&#x27;t stand out for me. Before I got into different fragrances like oh lola, Hollywood, and Chance I use to get my body sprays from Victoria secret and Bath and body works. My favorites were love spell and Dark kiss. This fragrance smells like Dark Kiss a little.  My point is I wasn&#x27;t looking for some victoria secret or bath and body work fragrance. I really wanted something that&#x27;s like WOW! I haven&#x27;t received one compliment yet, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on me long.</li>
            <li> Is a bit too strong for my taste.  Will regift it to someone I know that wears the strong stuff.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume it smells great i will be buying more of her product i am very very please.</li>
            <li> get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> I wish Id read all the reviews before my purchase.  The fragrance was nice but that nasty body butter and lotion looked like like runny sand with no smell. waste of money</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent, its not fruity or musky but maybe somewhere in between its also not over powering so if you want a strong perfume this is not it. One of my friends advised that she likes it but its for a mature woman she&#x27;s 29 and I am 25....my mother is in love with it and wants a set of her own. Whilst wearing it thus far I have received no compliments and no one has asked me what I am wearing. None of this takes away from me liking the scent though, I would gladly try another Queen fragrance.</li>
            <li> Queen has been my favorite since it was introduced, It has such a soft and clean smell. So many people ask me what im wearing.</li>
            <li> Queen is an intoxicating fragance that makes you feel like you are in Saint Tropez and everyone is in amour with you. This fragance makes a woman feel exactly like it&#x27;s name sake a Queen.</li>
            <li> I received this as a present from my older daughter years ago and love it.  People are constanty asking me what do I have on.  Great scent.  My teen daughter loves it too.  The scent is warm, not overpowering and lasts all day.  It is an aroma for a mature lady and a young girl.  I have ordered this from Amazon several times and will continue - this is my trademark scent.  This time I will order my daughter one.  LUV IT</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and I took a chance because I didn&#x27;t know what it smelled like. But count on Queen Latifah -- it is very nice in my opinion.  I would describe it as a slightly vanilla scent -- smokey and like a grown up women but not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a Christmas gift,  but it arrived much, much,  too late. Was received way after the expected time.  Product scent wasn&#x27;t really described. Overall I would not purchase again if I had the choice.</li>
            <li> This scent is wonderful.  I like that a little bit goes a long way, to where it last me a while.</li>
            <li> Like it think i will order more often</li>
            <li> Queen Latifah Queen by Latifah for Woman Gift Set...I use often sometime...Not alot. But really so good smell of fragrance...Wow wonderful smell fresh like musk fragrance...I love it!</li>
            <li> I received this as a birthday present two years ago and fell IN LOVE WITH IT!!! I been trying to find this for the past couple of months and finally it showed that Amazon was selling it. When I received the gift set I was sooooo happy. Unfortunately, when I opened the lotion it smelled nothing like the one my supervisor brought me from macy&#x27;s. The lotion smelled like a wet mop that went sour. The perfume itself was kind of okay, but both the lotion and butter was HORRIBLE. I will NEVER purchase perfume from off Amazon again. Very bad experience. Will be returning ASAP...</li>
