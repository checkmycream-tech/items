            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this product many times and each time I have been completely pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, I love to use it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and was so upset when they stopped making it.</li>
            <li>I had to purchase one and will purchase more.</li>
            <li>This assuming the fabric is okay to spray.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>But since I am not using it, I don&#x27;t think I can say much more about it.</li>
            <li>lovely fragrance  not over powering</li>
            <li>This is so light, beautiful, and modern.</li>
            <li>huge bottle for the money, nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>was replaced and new one smells good, and bottle is fine, nice price,</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny and more!  </li>
            <li>i love that this is smooth and not overpowering when you are walking into a room people can smell this every time i always receive compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Upadating from original post: Now my wife likes this scnet and has asked me to order more.</li>
            <li>This is a very mild fragrance</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to get such a good sized bottle of my favorite scent for such a great price.</li>
            <li>If you have strong body chemistry,this might not work.</li>
            <li>It is sweet, feminine and sophisticated.  </li>
            <li>First the goods: big bottle, good scent, cheap price, the Arden brand makes for a good gift :)</li>
            <li>I like it ,but I wish it was a little stronger because then it would be perfect ....</li>
            <li>It smellls like cheap barbie perfume for kids.  </li>
            <li>Light scent with some power.</li>
            <li>Great gift for my wife who loves Red Door.</li>
            <li>This is a very clean, fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth investing in!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw it on Amazon</li>
            <li>I got this recently for my girlfriend as a birthday gift, she loved it.</li>
            <li>The perfume reminds me a lot of the \\&quot;True Love\\&quot; perfume that I have worn off and on for some years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its funny how it smells strong when you first spray it ,but it is really a very mild smell....</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something not over powering and light, you will like this very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong but not so much and it lasts for a longer.</li>
            <li>really like the light, floral scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It took a while to get to me, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>nice but doesnt last</li>
            <li>totally worth the price..</li>
            <li>and I like it even more than the original Red Door!</li>
            <li>It is clean and fresh, very sutble.</li>
            <li>I especially love mixing it with either the Avon Chic in Black or Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Red Door</li>
            <li>It was shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never tested it before just tested the other version Red Door Classic, but I must say this fragance is delicious.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my fiend who like it very much.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, subtle, and sexy.</li>
            <li>I have used Red Door for many years but was intrigued with this version since I had never heard of it.  </li>
            <li>I love Red Door just not that one.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell how many compliments I have received when wearing Red Door Revealed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Arden never fails.</li>
            <li>First time trying the perfume</li>
            <li>I love it so much,very pleased,makes me feel womanly.</li>
            <li>Have worn Red Door for 20 years or longer and love it</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as pictured and on time.</li>
            <li>This is a gift for my girlfriend&#x27;s daughter,she love this perfume,cheap price for a big size bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, delicate smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>Its a fairly pleasant and long lasting fragrance,bought it for my grandmother</li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews and decided to try it since it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>floral, feminine, light and also long lasting:)</li>
            <li>You definitely wouldn&#x27;t do this for silk or fine fabrics, but you could spray on a T-shirt, or sweater without damage.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care for it as much.  </li>
            <li>I call this one pink door :).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Prompt and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Tired of not getting what I pay for,  always getting replica of what I love, glad to receive the real thing.</li>
            <li>The fragance is soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>I like the gentle perfume&lt;</li>
            <li>Wow, I love the big size.  </li>
            <li>Is a fan of original red door, but she really likes this too.</li>
            <li>I love Red Door Revealed but this particular product smelled old.</li>
            <li>It is nothing like the original red door.  </li>
            <li>use it more than any other perfume I have</li>
            <li>Especially because it&#x27;s so economical ;)</li>
            <li>This is the lite version, it seems of the bright red bottle of the Elizabeth red door which I wanted to buy for a relative of mine</li>
            <li>It is a lovely scent, but falls just a bit short of Red Door.</li>
            <li>I do like it, its a lighter, more fruity &amp; flowery scent than the regular Red Door.</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than Red Door now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product of eau de parfum spray.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend both this fragrance and this seller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and musky like the original Red Door.</li>
            <li>Elisabeth Arden has some very soft scented perfumes and this is a classic.</li>
            <li>and it was brand new.</li>
            <li>She had told me it was hard to find for her, thanks again Amazon :)</li>
            <li>I usually do not like perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Item is exactly as described and would purchase again in the future.  </li>
            <li>I usually use the regular Red Door scent but decided to try this one because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I was very surpised and didn&#x27;t realize how big it would be.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on it.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping I would like it as much as I like Red Door...</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised on the size of the bottle....</li>
            <li>I usually wear red door &amp; I&#x27;m soo pleased with this scent</li>
            <li>I will order again in the very near future.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is clean and fresh, little bit of floral scent  but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, the scent fades rather quickly, other than that, its very nice.</li>
            <li>Long lasting smell, very professional and can be worn as romantic.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this fragrance for the past few years and wasnt able to find it anywhere but on Amazon</li>

            <li> I had to purchase one and will purchase more.</li>
            <li> This assuming the fabric is okay to spray.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> But since I am not using it, I don&#x27;t think I can say much more about it.</li>
            <li> lovely fragrance  not over powering</li>
            <li> This is so light, beautiful, and modern.</li>
            <li> huge bottle for the money, nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> was replaced and new one smells good, and bottle is fine, nice price,</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny and more!  </li>
            <li> i love that this is smooth and not overpowering when you are walking into a room people can smell this every time i always receive compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Upadating from original post: Now my wife likes this scnet and has asked me to order more.</li>
            <li> This is a very mild fragrance</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to get such a good sized bottle of my favorite scent for such a great price.</li>
            <li> If you have strong body chemistry,this might not work.</li>
            <li> It is sweet, feminine and sophisticated.  </li>
            <li> First the goods: big bottle, good scent, cheap price, the Arden brand makes for a good gift :)</li>
            <li> I like it ,but I wish it was a little stronger because then it would be perfect ....</li>
            <li> It smellls like cheap barbie perfume for kids.  </li>
            <li> Light scent with some power.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my wife who loves Red Door.</li>
            <li> This is a very clean, fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth investing in!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I got this recently for my girlfriend as a birthday gift, she loved it.</li>
            <li> The perfume reminds me a lot of the \\&quot;True Love\\&quot; perfume that I have worn off and on for some years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its funny how it smells strong when you first spray it ,but it is really a very mild smell....</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something not over powering and light, you will like this very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong but not so much and it lasts for a longer.</li>
            <li> really like the light, floral scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get to me, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> nice but doesnt last</li>
            <li> totally worth the price..</li>
            <li> and I like it even more than the original Red Door!</li>
            <li> It is clean and fresh, very sutble.</li>
            <li> I especially love mixing it with either the Avon Chic in Black or Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Red Door</li>
            <li> It was shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tested it before just tested the other version Red Door Classic, but I must say this fragance is delicious.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my fiend who like it very much.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, subtle, and sexy.</li>
            <li> I have used Red Door for many years but was intrigued with this version since I had never heard of it.  </li>
            <li> I love Red Door just not that one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell how many compliments I have received when wearing Red Door Revealed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden never fails.</li>
            <li> First time trying the perfume</li>
            <li> I love it so much,very pleased,makes me feel womanly.</li>
            <li> Have worn Red Door for 20 years or longer and love it</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It came exactly as pictured and on time.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my girlfriend&#x27;s daughter,she love this perfume,cheap price for a big size bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, delicate smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> Its a fairly pleasant and long lasting fragrance,bought it for my grandmother</li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews and decided to try it since it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> floral, feminine, light and also long lasting:)</li>
            <li> You definitely wouldn&#x27;t do this for silk or fine fabrics, but you could spray on a T-shirt, or sweater without damage.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care for it as much.  </li>
            <li> I call this one pink door :).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Prompt and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Tired of not getting what I pay for,  always getting replica of what I love, glad to receive the real thing.</li>
            <li> The fragance is soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> I like the gentle perfume&lt;</li>
            <li> Wow, I love the big size.  </li>
            <li> Is a fan of original red door, but she really likes this too.</li>
            <li> I love Red Door Revealed but this particular product smelled old.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like the original red door.  </li>
            <li> use it more than any other perfume I have</li>
            <li> Especially because it&#x27;s so economical ;)</li>
            <li> This is the lite version, it seems of the bright red bottle of the Elizabeth red door which I wanted to buy for a relative of mine</li>
            <li> It is a lovely scent, but falls just a bit short of Red Door.</li>
            <li> I do like it, its a lighter, more fruity &amp; flowery scent than the regular Red Door.</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than Red Door now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product of eau de parfum spray.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend both this fragrance and this seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and musky like the original Red Door.</li>
            <li> Elisabeth Arden has some very soft scented perfumes and this is a classic.</li>
            <li> and it was brand new.</li>
            <li> She had told me it was hard to find for her, thanks again Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I usually do not like perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described and would purchase again in the future.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the regular Red Door scent but decided to try this one because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I was very surpised and didn&#x27;t realize how big it would be.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping I would like it as much as I like Red Door...</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised on the size of the bottle....</li>
            <li> I usually wear red door &amp; I&#x27;m soo pleased with this scent</li>
            <li> I will order again in the very near future.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is clean and fresh, little bit of floral scent  but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, the scent fades rather quickly, other than that, its very nice.</li>
            <li> Long lasting smell, very professional and can be worn as romantic.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this fragrance for the past few years and wasnt able to find it anywhere but on Amazon</li>
            <li> The only thing that I can say about this purchase that hasn&#x27;t already been said a million times, is that I got a very large sized bottle for a very small price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a big bottle for so little money,I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and smells divine!</li>
            <li> I like it as have used Red Door for a long time.</li>
            <li> its just like a glass box :| , the smell doesnt last very long...</li>
            <li> It has been discontinued and I was amazed to get it at all, much less in such a big bottle for such a low price!!  </li>
            <li> This is like a watered down version of Red Door that doesn&#x27;t last very long on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Did not live up to my expectations based on my experience of how Elizabeth Arden perfumes smell.</li>
            <li> It sells for over $55 in very, very limited retail locations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s little bit fruitier smell than Red Door.</li>
            <li> This Perfume has very little smell, kinda flowery, does not last long.</li>
            <li> The shipment  arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> so I thought I &#x27;d try it; not much to lose.  </li>
            <li> The smell was rather weak and did not last too long.</li>
            <li> Cost so much less than buying it in the store</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday...</li>
            <li> My mother-n-law was told this was not available any longer.  </li>
            <li> I guess I should have purchased it from a local store. :(</li>
            <li> but it stinks.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with it!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this stuff is nasty.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is one of my favorite scents. i love that this is smooth and not overpowering when you are walking into a room people can smell this every time i always receive compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find this perfume in stores any longer so I ordered my Mom the largest bottle I could find. She loved it!!!! Thank you</li>
            <li> Great service and order processing.  I LOVE my parfum...it&#x27;s just how I remembered it!  It&#x27;s a discontinued item from the dept. stores so I was VERY glad to find it here and at a bargain!  I wear it everyday...light and floral but the smell stays with you!  I always get compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth investing in!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. It is my favorite. It took a while to get to me, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Price and quality of product are excellent, further shipping was prompt...item received in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I got this recently for my girlfriend as a birthday gift, she loved it. She had told me it was hard to find for her, thanks again Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Big bottle. It was shipped super fast. Long lasting and smells divine!</li>
            <li> I bought this parfum based solely on the reviews. I am happy with the scent. It is clean and fresh, very sutble. A lighter scent than the regular Red Door. If you are looking for something not over powering and light, you will like this very much.</li>
            <li> this stuff is nasty.  It is nothing like the original red door.  It smellls like cheap barbie perfume for kids.  DO NOT waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light....nice but doesnt last</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it.  I though it would smell nice but it stinks. I won&#x27;t buy the scent again.I love Red Door just not that one.</li>
            <li> My mother-n-law was told this was not available any longer.  What a thrill to find it here for such a bargain!  I usually do not like perfumes.  They can even give me a headache.  This is so light, beautiful, and modern.</li>
            <li> Long lasting smell, very professional and can be worn as romantic. Thanks</li>
            <li> First the goods: big bottle, good scent, cheap price, the Arden brand makes for a good gift :)&lt;br /&gt;The bads: The bottle is really simple...I would have liked something more fancy...its just like a glass box :| , the smell doesnt last very long...probably 2-3 hours and its not like the scent lingers after you pass through the corridor...its only when somebody comes close to you that he/she will be able to smell it.I think its just OK. Nothing great.</li>
            <li> My order just came today, and I am really happy with it! The perfume reminds me a lot of the \\&quot;True Love\\&quot; perfume that I have worn off and on for some years.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the light, floral scent that is not overpowering. So glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Definitely one of my favorites. The shipment  arrived sooner than expected. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. :-)</li>
            <li> Really love this fragrance.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;d never tested it before just tested the other version Red Door Classic, but I must say this fragance is delicious. It&#x27;s strong but not so much and it lasts for a longer. I recommended for executive women who have no time to re apply it.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to have this item arrived at my home !&lt;br /&gt;I received it Yesterday and tasted on my hubby ^^;&lt;br /&gt;scent feel so good !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it !! Even though l never tried this perfume before and bought just from review .</li>
            <li> My friend loved this as a birthday gift.  She says that it is \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smelling.</li>
            <li> Its a fairly pleasant and long lasting fragrance,bought it for my grandmother and she loved it ,she said its smell reminds her of Charlie..totally worth the price..</li>
            <li> I like it as have used Red Door for a long time. Tried this. Somewhat pricey. Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> Good smelling perfume.  Thank Elizabeth Arden.  I will order again in the very near future.  Great item, I like it.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice. I ordered it whit a bottle of Sunflowers By Elizabeth Arden, which is even better! That&#x60;s the reason I don&#x60;t give 5 stars, because next to Sunflowers it is just ends up in 2º place.&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t misinterpret me, this is a elegant and sofphisticated eau de parfum and definitely a good purchase for an every day scent.</li>
            <li> received it all secured and well</li>

            <li> absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Its funny how it smells strong when you first spray it ,but it is really a very mild smell....I like it ,but I wish it was a little stronger because then it would be perfect ....Especially because it&#x27;s so economical ;)</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! It sells for over $55 in very, very limited retail locations. Amazon is the only place I buy it now. Can&#x27;t tell how many compliments I have received when wearing Red Door Revealed. Love it!</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance.  I especially love mixing it with either the Avon Chic in Black or Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Red Door</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, I love to use it. The fragance is soft and fresh. I buy it whenever I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it so much,very pleased,makes me feel womanly.It&#x27;s such a big bottle for so little money,I was pleasantly surprised.The scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love Red Door Revealed but this particular product smelled old. I am very disappointed. I know that there is always a risk in ordering online. I guess I should have purchased it from a local store. :(</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and was so upset when they stopped making it. I was so excited when I saw it on Amazon I had to purchase one and will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to my expectations based on my experience of how Elizabeth Arden perfumes smell. The smell was rather weak and did not last too long.</li>
            <li> Have worn Red Door for 20 years or longer and love it BUT  the REVEALED IS JUST NOT FOR ME</li>
            <li> This is a very mild fragrance and I do not get compliments as when I&#x27;m wearing the red door with the red packaging.</li>
            <li> I like the gentle perfume&lt;br /&gt;It is not overpowering and my grandchildren associate it with me&lt;br /&gt;I use it more than any other perfume I have</li>
            <li> A regular product that I can&#x27;t say enough about.  Great service and just as it was described.  I would encourage any one to try it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the smell of this perfume.It smelled like soap to me but it could be me since my body checmistry is no match for perfumes.I gave it to my fiend who like it very much.If you have strong body chemistry,this might not work.</li>
            <li> This is like a watered down version of Red Door that doesn&#x27;t last very long on your skin.  If you want to have the fragrance last a bit longer spray it on your clothes and not on your skin.  This assuming the fabric is okay to spray.  You definitely wouldn&#x27;t do this for silk or fine fabrics, but you could spray on a T-shirt, or sweater without damage.  Otherwise, if you like Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Red Door - stick with that instead of the Revealed.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It has a light and spicy scent and is great for day-time wear. It&#x27;s now my signature scent.</li>
            <li> This is the lite version, it seems of the bright red bottle of the Elizabeth red door which I wanted to buy for a relative of mine but she was very happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it does deserve 5 stars for the price. But since I am not using it, I don&#x27;t think I can say much more about it.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> NEEDS TO COME BACK TO STORES!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite!!! It came exactly as pictured and on time.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my wife who loves Red Door.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my girlfriend&#x27;s daughter,she love this perfume,cheap price for a big size bottle.</li>
            <li> lovely fragrance  not over powering</li>
            <li> this is a awesome item I love it its just how it says here I will be ordering soon thanx</li>
