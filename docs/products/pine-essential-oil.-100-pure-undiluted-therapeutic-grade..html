            <li>I love the scent of pine, but I go home to Hawaii for Christmas - not a lot of pine there!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li>Smells really wonderful; not too strong or too light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to put some drops into bath water.  </li>
            <li>but it lacks the wonderful pine tree smell that is so much a part of Christmas.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell very strong at all.</li>
            <li>Smells like Pine and mostly hid the Bee smell from the honey in my moustache wax recipe.</li>
            <li>Love this smell - it is like walking through a forest</li>
            <li>- I use this oil for so many things including pain, sinus headache and cleaning.</li>
            <li>For pine this one opens my lungs better, which helps my asthma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK I guess.</li>
            <li>Love thr scent.</li>
            <li>It ran out in two days, for the price you can do a lot better.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something a bit sweeter smelling maybe more like a fir smell.</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>It smelled more like bark from a tree and had no frangrance of a Christmas</li>
            <li>I have some pine cones in a decorative basket to help freshen my pet&#x27;s litter area on the sly :)  </li>
            <li>A good quality pine oil should smell like fresh cut pine trees - this brand does not.</li>
            <li>Great value, highly concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received exactly what was described, quickly, and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Extremely high quality and a great price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>The scent straight from the bottle is a bit too much for me and it would probably be best to mix it with something else if you don&#x27;t enjoy the scent of pine alone.</li>
            <li>The scent was very potent at first, but wore of very quickly.</li>
            <li>The oil smells very nice, with a good pine scent, that has a slightly &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; aroma.</li>
            <li>it was so strong.</li>
            <li>lovely scent, great for mixing with lime essential oil for a fresh, clean homemade air freshener!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of pine, especially in winter and this product is very good, also it came fast and without problems.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>They got back to me within an hour, and gave me some great advice on what to add.  </li>
            <li>Pine is honestly not a fragrance I would choose if I wanted to fill my room up with a scent, but for those that love the smell of Christmas trees and forests, this oil would be perfect for you!</li>
            <li>This oil smells like Pine and we are enjoying using it very much.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that the pine essential oil from Plant Therapy Essential Oils has a good, strong, true scent, and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love just sniffing it, makes me feel peaceful.</li>
            <li>only thing I would have liked more is if they carried a 2oz bottle.</li>
            <li>But I am glad that Plant Therapy creates their oils to be PURE, instead of focusing solely on the scent.</li>
            <li>It is lovely and is often mistaken for a real tree</li>
            <li>It is also quite good at removing sticky residue left from retail price tags and stickers, or anyt.&lt;br /&gt;hing sticky for that matter.  </li>
            <li>If you smell from the bottle, it has a very industrial, almost petrochemical odor to it; however, when you dispense the drops, the smell is a bit more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of pine - and this is a good match, but the aroma is not very strong.</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema flare-ups and will be trying the oil on my hands.</li>
            <li>Just to open a little bottle and inhale this bracing, clean, awakening fragrance, with lots of pleasant associations, is really nice.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance of pine is just very clarifying, powerful but not overwhelming, very pleasant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waste of a great product.</li>
            <li>and I have found it useful for cleaning laminate flooring and countertops.  </li>
            <li>Doterra, Young Living, Edens Garden and more.</li>
            <li>This company is known for having some powerful oils, but they missed the mark on this one-sorry.</li>
            <li>Other bottles aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>, butt hey never seemed to get it quite right, so I ended up paying for oils that I just didn&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t use, so I decided to give it a try myself.  </li>
            <li>What I like about the bottle is that the drops come out at the right speed to count.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>Good product, price needs to be adjusted slightly to keep up with competitors.</li>
            <li>The scent goes away very fast though.</li>
            <li>should buy this.&lt;br /&gt;Women too if you&#x27;re interested in the scent.  </li>
            <li>I carry it in my bag, and always take a whiff first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I had some Rosalina oil around and thought the two scents would go well together, so I mixed them and it was much better for</li>
            <li>and I would buy it again if I ever needed more pine essential oil.</li>
            <li>It is my first time using this brand</li>
            <li>I contacted them via email with a question regarding advice on what oil would be good to add to what I had mixed ( which I loved already, but was just looking for that last element to perfectly round it out).  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone that wants to clean their home naturally..</li>
            <li>So I mixed with other oil to make smell better. :)</li>
            <li>They are worth paying a little more for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice!&lt;br /&gt;Probably quite therapeutic!&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>and I missed the fragrance of a real tree</li>
            <li>It smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li>but we were scared of the cats eating the real tree.</li>
            <li>Made me think of my childhood when we had real trees every time I came in the room</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it was a spill from another container before packaging, or if the cap was not sealed properly - be more careful though,</li>
            <li>Now the tree looks and smells real.  </li>
            <li>It is very concentrated</li>
            <li>was very disapointed in my choice of oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Put it on items like Christmas Trees, wreaths and make them smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li>And the cost is very affordable.</li>
            <li>This has a subtle pine scent like a pine tree, but not too strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I like these oils a lot because they seem to be more concentrated and pure than other brands.  </li>
            <li>Thank God I am using this oil to clean my hardwood floors, because I would not recommend using it topically or aromatically.  </li>
            <li>aroma is pleasant but it is just not strong enough, not even close.  </li>
            <li>Out of all of the various oils that we have tried in our vaporizer this pine essential oil is the favorite.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I want pure and natural, not something manipulated to smell this way or that.</li>
            <li>, the scent does not linger for long however, but I find that true for all the pine essence I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I read somewhere that the scent of pine is good for depression, so I ordered this oil, and it seems to me to really be true.&lt;br /&gt;Depression, of both the slight and big variety, has been a problem in my life for years, and I&#x27;m always looking for various ways to work with it.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this product is very authentic and just subtle enough to emulate the smell of a real tree in the living room.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I like this product and it seems to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount because the seller was attempting to clear stock in preparation for a label redesign.</li>
            <li>Now when I feel something coming on, I put a few drops on a cotton ball in the corner of the shower and enjoy the aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>alright!&lt;br /&gt;I needed this for my experimental scent machine.&lt;br /&gt;Men</li>
            <li>I bought this to add to a diy natural cleaner.</li>
            <li>would be very hesitant to recommend any essesial oil to someone because it&#x27;s obvious</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy Essential Oils are very comparable to&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may need a larger quantity if you use it regularly, otherwise it may run out fast.</li>
            <li>Tried using increased amount of oil but the scent is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I had to use several drops to get any sort of scent and the scent that I got smelled more dirty than of fresh cut pine.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I want pure and natural, not something manipulated to smell this way or that.</li>
            <li> , the scent does not linger for long however, but I find that true for all the pine essence I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I read somewhere that the scent of pine is good for depression, so I ordered this oil, and it seems to me to really be true.&lt;br /&gt;Depression, of both the slight and big variety, has been a problem in my life for years, and I&#x27;m always looking for various ways to work with it.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this product is very authentic and just subtle enough to emulate the smell of a real tree in the living room.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I like this product and it seems to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount because the seller was attempting to clear stock in preparation for a label redesign.</li>
            <li> Now when I feel something coming on, I put a few drops on a cotton ball in the corner of the shower and enjoy the aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> alright!&lt;br /&gt;I needed this for my experimental scent machine.&lt;br /&gt;Men</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to a diy natural cleaner.</li>
            <li> would be very hesitant to recommend any essesial oil to someone because it&#x27;s obvious</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy Essential Oils are very comparable to&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may need a larger quantity if you use it regularly, otherwise it may run out fast.</li>
            <li> Tried using increased amount of oil but the scent is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I had to use several drops to get any sort of scent and the scent that I got smelled more dirty than of fresh cut pine.</li>
            <li> This is not exactly what I was expecting as far as the smell goes.....</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product; I wanted something to refresh a winter potpourri, but this oil has a strong medicinal odor, reminding me more of a hospital than Christmas.</li>
            <li> Fragrance does not last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> While the smell of pine is decent, I was surprised that the essential \\&quot;oil\\&quot; was quite thin in consistence, almost watery.</li>
            <li> Back to the product, the only reason I knock it down a star is due to competitive pricing from another company with a product that as far as my senses can tell, is identical, but cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Had to change this review, the product ran out far too soon, the strength simply isn&#x27;t enough to last or carry past one corner of the room.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Although not a high quality brand, I do like Plant Therapy, but only for cleaning.</li>
            <li> There really is a big difference between therapeutic grade oils and other regular oils.</li>
            <li> bottle is a bit bigger than the other essential oils I have from Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 36mL while the other oils are only 10mL.</li>
            <li> I added about 7 or 8 drops to my cleaning bucket with water and castille soap and after a few minutes I had to open up the windows and doors and then put the bucket outside</li>
            <li> I usually order more expensive E.O.&#x27;s</li>
            <li> You can also put a little bit on your temples and inner wrists before bedtime, since the smell is so comforting and takes your mind away from any worries or anxiety that interfere with sleep.</li>
            <li> at least my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it like it is cedar.</li>
            <li> Could only tell that I had used it for a few minutes then it faded.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t kidding when they say you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> The product was everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days</li>
            <li> It is what I expected.</li>
            <li> We bought a fake Christmas tree, I was looking for that fresh tree smell.  </li>
            <li> I would give it one less star, but for the fact, it is real pine oil, and not diluted down with other oils, but this is way too weak.</li>
            <li> I used it along with other oils to make a pine relief medicine</li>
            <li> This is unlike any other essential oils I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I would try other brands for comparison.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this stuff, however, the artificial Christmas tree only needs two drops to make my house smell like an enchanted forest.</li>
            <li> - it is NOT pure and smells just like burned rubber!  </li>
            <li> Collect green pine cones, cut them and let the aroma loose.</li>
            <li> I have ordered about  30 different oil in this past year and this is the only one I am not happy with.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for some less costly for cleaning purposes.  </li>
            <li> I found that un-like other reviews the scent was not strong at all.</li>
            <li> It seems a little bit on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> I kept refilling my freshener, but the fragrance still was not very potent.</li>
            <li> Will try to update after a few weeks to tell of my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Five or six drops a week is all you need to help destroy the odor.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used a cinnamon to drop small droplets upon the wood stove, but the pine does not give me the desired affect.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint - the weak scent.</li>
            <li> Usually I like Now Foods, but not for pine.</li>
            <li> We used this mixed with a bit of water to spray on a fake Christmas tree for the smell.</li>
            <li> We put up an artificial tree last Christmas</li>
            <li> Several years ago we transitioned to an artificial tree.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This brand of pine essential oil is just awful (sorry to say)</li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops of this oil on a cotton ball or two and hid them in my artificial Chistmas tree.  </li>
            <li> Sprinkled it all over our fake tree and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference!</li>
            <li> Been using their oils for a couple years and never had a bad experience.</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t a bad idea...  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the strength of the scent.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of pine-sol, but this oil is nothing like that.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells like Pine and mostly hid the Bee smell from the honey in my moustache wax recipe.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent!  I used this with Frankinsense for a cough that wouldn&#x27;t go awayy, and seems to have done the trick.  Now when I feel something coming on, I put a few drops on a cotton ball in the corner of the shower and enjoy the aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Love this smell - it is like walking through a forest - I use this oil for so many things including pain, sinus headache and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the Pine and the Holiday Season oils.  I&#x27;ve put drops in both an oil warmer and potpourri and cannot detect a scent from either one.</li>
            <li> Top-grade stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like pine needles alright!&lt;br /&gt;I needed this for my experimental scent machine.&lt;br /&gt;Men should buy this.&lt;br /&gt;Women too if you&#x27;re interested in the scent.  It&#x27;s very nice!&lt;br /&gt;Probably quite therapeutic!&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the strength of the scent. We put up an artificial tree last Christmas and I missed the fragrance of a real tree so I bought this to add piney fragrance to the air. I poured this into some water and simmered it but no one could smell anything.</li>
            <li> Usually I like Now Foods, but not for pine. For pine this one opens my lungs better, which helps my asthma.</li>
            <li> It smells like the real thing. The scent goes away very fast though. It seems a little bit on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK I guess. Doesn&#x27;t smell very strong at all. Could only tell that I had used it for a few minutes then it faded.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t create mush fragrance.</li>
            <li> Tried using increased amount of oil but the scent is barely noticeable.  Collect green pine cones, cut them and let the aroma loose.</li>
            <li> Out of all of the various oils that we have tried in our vaporizer this pine essential oil is the favorite.  I hate the smell of pine-sol, but this oil is nothing like that.  This has a subtle pine scent like a pine tree, but not too strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It smells like Pine-Sol.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like Christmas tree at all.  So I mixed with other oil to make smell better. :)</li>
            <li> lovely scent, great for mixing with lime essential oil for a fresh, clean homemade air freshener!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t kidding when they say you only need a few drops. I added about 7 or 8 drops to my cleaning bucket with water and castille soap and after a few minutes I had to open up the windows and doors and then put the bucket outside it was so strong. In moderation it does smell wonderful and does a wonderful job cleaning and deodorizing.  There really is a big difference between therapeutic grade oils and other regular oils.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like pine.  I liken the scent to turpentine.  I threw it away 2 days after trying it in my oil warmer.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that the scent of pine is good for depression, so I ordered this oil, and it seems to me to really be true.&lt;br /&gt;Depression, of both the slight and big variety, has been a problem in my life for years, and I&#x27;m always looking for various ways to work with it.  Just to open a little bottle and inhale this bracing, clean, awakening fragrance, with lots of pleasant associations, is really nice.  I carry it in my bag, and always take a whiff first thing in the morning.  It&#x27;s also nice to put some drops into bath water.  The fragrance of pine is just very clarifying, powerful but not overwhelming, very pleasant and I would say hopeful, encouraging.  Highly recommended.  You can also put a little bit on your temples and inner wrists before bedtime, since the smell is so comforting and takes your mind away from any worries or anxiety that interfere with sleep.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of pine - and this is a good match, but the aroma is not very strong. That&#x27;s my only complaint - the weak scent. But I am glad that Plant Therapy creates their oils to be PURE, instead of focusing solely on the scent. I want pure and natural, not something manipulated to smell this way or that.</li>
            <li> Pine oil is great for soothing the nerves. Got it on time. Love thr scent.</li>
            <li> Smelling it I can almost see myself surrounded by pines.  Thank you!  The product came as ordered without any damage.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to a diy natural cleaner. It&#x27;s smells wonderful almost like I&#x27;m using Pine Sol.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that wants to clean their home naturally..</li>
            <li> Smells just like a christmas tree. Sprinkled it all over our fake tree and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference!</li>
            <li> The product was everything that I expected. I used it along with other oils to make a pine relief medicine&lt;br /&gt;as a rub.</li>
            <li> Pine is honestly not a fragrance I would choose if I wanted to fill my room up with a scent, but for those that love the smell of Christmas trees and forests, this oil would be perfect for you! It definitely smells like pine. The scent straight from the bottle is a bit too much for me and it would probably be best to mix it with something else if you don&#x27;t enjoy the scent of pine alone. I had some Rosalina oil around and thought the two scents would go well together, so I mixed them and it was much better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pine essential oil is said to help reduce inflammation and associated redness and can cure skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. I have mild eczema flare-ups and will be trying the oil on my hands. It&#x27;s only been a few days and I cannot draw any conclusions yet. It&#x27;s also said to be an analgesic so I&#x27;ll try it the next time my muscles are bothering me. Will try to update after a few weeks to tell of my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is a bit bigger than the other essential oils I have from Plant Therapy! It&#x27;s 36mL while the other oils are only 10mL. It comes with a convenient drop reducer cap. Overall, I like this product and it seems to be exactly as advertised. It smells like a pine tree and I would buy it again if I ever needed more pine essential oil. I received this product at a discount because the seller was attempting to clear stock in preparation for a label redesign.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil, smells great!</li>
            <li> Had to change this review, the product ran out far too soon, the strength simply isn&#x27;t enough to last or carry past one corner of the room.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is pleasant but it is just not strong enough, not even close.  It ran out in two days, for the price you can do a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is not exactly what I was expecting as far as the smell goes.....it is nice, but does not smell like the pine tree we have in our front yard!  Still, I will use it as it does have a nice aroma!</li>
            <li> What more can I say, on time, well packaged, well described and a quality product to boot for a great price?</li>
            <li> We used this mixed with a bit of water to spray on a fake Christmas tree for the smell. LOL. Cheap, I know but we were scared of the cats eating the real tree. It served its purpose and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I put a couple of drops of this oil on a cotton ball or two and hid them in my artificial Chistmas tree.  It was great!! Made me think of my childhood when we had real trees every time I came in the room</li>
            <li> Love Plant Therapy oils! Extremely high quality and a great price and free shipping. Been using their oils for a couple years and never had a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I ordered several varieties of oils from Plant Therapy.  They arrived on time, and as described.  I had been having oils compounded for me at a local store, butt hey never seemed to get it quite right, so I ended up paying for oils that I just didn&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t use, so I decided to give it a try myself.  The products that I received from plant therapy totally exceeded my expectations.  They smelled much better than anything that I had bought elsewhere,the scent of each each perfectly indicative of their names.  I contacted them via email with a question regarding advice on what oil would be good to add to what I had mixed ( which I loved already, but was just looking for that last element to perfectly round it out).  They got back to me within an hour, and gave me some great advice on what to add.  I will definitely be using them for all my oil and aromatherapy purchases in the future.  Great service, great product!</li>
            <li> I am using the pine in a mixture for pain.  What I like about the bottle is that the drops come out at the right speed to count.  Other bottles aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of pine, especially in winter and this product is very good, also it came fast and without problems.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of pine, but I go home to Hawaii for Christmas - not a lot of pine there! Thanks to this stuff, however, the artificial Christmas tree only needs two drops to make my house smell like an enchanted forest. Great value, highly concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small criticism: the packaging inside the box was smeared with pine oil, as was the exterior of the bottle. Don&#x27;t know if it was a spill from another container before packaging, or if the cap was not sealed properly - be more careful though, next time guys! It&#x27;s a waste of a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  Several years ago we transitioned to an artificial tree.  It is lovely and is often mistaken for a real tree but it lacks the wonderful pine tree smell that is so much a part of Christmas. The smell of this product is very authentic and just subtle enough to emulate the smell of a real tree in the living room.  Now the tree looks and smells real.  It is very concentrated so a drop or two every day does the trick.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Fragrance does not last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product; I wanted something to refresh a winter potpourri, but this oil has a strong medicinal odor, reminding me more of a hospital than Christmas.</li>
            <li> Received the product as promised and was eager to use it in the steam shower. While the smell of pine is decent, I was surprised that the essential \\&quot;oil\\&quot; was quite thin in consistence, almost watery. This is unlike any other essential oils I have used in the past. You may need a larger quantity if you use it regularly, otherwise it may run out fast. I would try other brands for comparison.</li>
            <li> The bottle states this is pinus sylvestris and not pinus pinaster - scots pine not maritime pine - this can be critical information if you need to apply it to your skin for a condition.  It works for some of my issues, but not all, and at least my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it like it is cedar.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.  It was a very reasonable price, and the scent and concentration were excellent.</li>
            <li> This oil smells like Pine and we are enjoying using it very much. I like to walk in the house and pick up the smell of pine.</li>
            <li> We bought a fake Christmas tree, I was looking for that fresh tree smell.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a bit sweeter smelling maybe more like a fir smell. I bought this to add to my mop bucket for a seasonal scent. I found that un-like other reviews the scent was not strong at all. I had to use several drops to get any sort of scent and the scent that I got smelled more dirty than of fresh cut pine. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> GREAT products from a GREAT supplier. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have had good experiences with this companies product.  This particulur essence smells like you would expect pine to smell like, the scent does not linger for long however, but I find that true for all the pine essence I have tried.  Guess nothing short of growing a pine tree in your house would fix that!  Which isn&#x27;t a bad idea...  Back to the product, the only reason I knock it down a star is due to competitive pricing from another company with a product that as far as my senses can tell, is identical, but cheaper.  Good product, price needs to be adjusted slightly to keep up with competitors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil thinking I could use it as a Christmas tree scent inside our home.  It smelled more like bark from a tree and had no frangrance of a Christmas tree.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disapointed in my choice of oil.&lt;br /&gt;I would be very hesitant to recommend any essesial oil to someone because it&#x27;s obvious I don&#x27;t know how to choose a frangrance.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your inquiry.&lt;br /&gt;C. St.Peter</li>
            <li> Very nice oil.  I  have been diffusing it for the past few days and it is quite long lasting and refreshing.  It is my first time using this brand and I&#x27;m glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li> The oil smells very nice, with a good pine scent, that has a slightly &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; aroma. Worked well.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would have liked more is if they carried a 2oz bottle. I had bought a 2oz bottle of rosemary oil at the same time, which is 6x the size, and will last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Not the smell I was looking for. I had previously used a cinnamon to drop small droplets upon the wood stove, but the pine does not give me the desired affect.</li>
            <li> I like these oils a lot because they seem to be more concentrated and pure than other brands.  They are worth paying a little more for.  I bought this one to expand my assortment of oils and I have found it useful for cleaning laminate flooring and countertops.  It is also quite good at removing sticky residue left from retail price tags and stickers, or anyt.&lt;br /&gt;hing sticky for that matter.  Try using an essential oil instead of goo gone</li>
            <li> This is very good stuff. The last time I purchased pine essential oil, the scent wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; - it was from a different manufacturer. I am pleased to say that the pine essential oil from Plant Therapy Essential Oils has a good, strong, true scent, and I am very pleased with it. I will be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> Love it has a great smell. Put it on items like Christmas Trees, wreaths and make them smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem right. The smell is not at all like pine and it has no strength. I have ordered about  30 different oil in this past year and this is the only one I am not happy with. It must be the company.</li>
            <li> Excellent for homemade deodorant!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality pine oil that can be used in oil blends or for steaming.. the aroma is good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, great value!</li>
            <li> Smells really wonderful; not too strong or too light.  I love just sniffing it, makes me feel peaceful.</li>
            <li> I have some pine cones in a decorative basket to help freshen my pet&#x27;s litter area on the sly :)  Five or six drops a week is all you need to help destroy the odor.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what was described, quickly, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of essential oils. Doterra, Young Living, Edens Garden and more. Plant Therapy Essential Oils are very comparable to&lt;br /&gt;the essential oils I have mentioned. And the cost is very affordable. Shipping is very good.</li>
            <li> OMGosh ... This brand of pine essential oil is just awful (sorry to say) - it is NOT pure and smells just like burned rubber!  I usually order more expensive E.O.&#x27;s but I was looking for some less costly for cleaning purposes.  Thank God I am using this oil to clean my hardwood floors, because I would not recommend using it topically or aromatically.  If you smell from the bottle, it has a very industrial, almost petrochemical odor to it; however, when you dispense the drops, the smell is a bit more tolerable.  A good quality pine oil should smell like fresh cut pine trees - this brand does not. Although not a high quality brand, I do like Plant Therapy, but only for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I used the essential oils for a room freshener. The scent was very potent at first, but wore of very quickly. I kept refilling my freshener, but the fragrance still was not very potent. Not very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I would give it one less star, but for the fact, it is real pine oil, and not diluted down with other oils, but this is way too weak. This company is known for having some powerful oils, but they missed the mark on this one-sorry.</li>
