            <li>Excellent quality oil and service was fast.</li>
            <li>, it was so nicely packaged and wrapped.  </li>
            <li>the fact that Sandalwood is not included is kind of a shame.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s kinda nice.</li>
            <li>The service was excellent and it was a great price for such a selection.  </li>
            <li>These oils seem nice.</li>
            <li>They have been wonderful and just as good as Young Livings products.</li>
            <li>I have made some bath salts for soaking and the rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you how many times this kit has come in handy already</li>
            <li>Wonderful precious really natural oils!</li>
            <li>While they don&#x27;t come with much info, the company has an excellent web site that lists all their available oils along with their uses, description of scent, country of origin</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it an awesome investment but a great bang for your buck when getting pure EOs.</li>
            <li>I did some research on brands and this one is a much better buy oppose to Doterra or YL.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more blends and not as many citrus neat oils.</li>
            <li>I love these oils and Eden&#x27;s Garden.</li>
            <li>The oils come in two boxes that sit on top of another.</li>
            <li>This company is top notch in everything they do.  </li>
            <li>So many oils and I can&#x27;t wait to use all of them.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with this set of essential oils.</li>
            <li>This company is top notch in everything they do.</li>
            <li>I ordered this set because I wanted to purchase as many of the oils at one time that I could afford.</li>
            <li>I have to say Eden&#x27;s Gardens oils are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the set  Essentials Oils and would recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>I love Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>
            <li>- don&#x27;t let the price fool you - these are the best quality essential oils</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the vast array of oils!</li>
            <li>The quality is top notch.  </li>
            <li>In fact the company contacted me when I placed an order for 4 bottles of my favorite oils and they realized that I was going to pay shipping costs 4 times</li>
            <li>Great value for good quality essential oil.</li>
            <li>They are the best essential oils I have ever found!</li>
            <li>Thank you Eden&#x27;s Garden for this convenient and awesome selection of essential oils.</li>
            <li>was a Christmas Gift and I Love, Love,</li>
            <li>Love all the oils.</li>
            <li>and I love learning about the combinations of scent.</li>
            <li>I have also read two books on EO to help me learn more about how to use them.</li>
            <li>I love them and how they are coloured in the bottles.</li>
            <li>I love your product.</li>
            <li>Also u can combine the oils to make your own unique fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the package it comes in is super duper cute!</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with these scents!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge set, the variety is great, and they&#x27;re high quality.</li>
            <li>great starter kit, wished it had a portfolio book with the product for easier storage and mobility, but so far products are as described.</li>
            <li>The oils are very high quality; the labeling is elegant and so nicely packaged and wrapped.</li>
            <li>I have been find out so much and coming up with my own recipes and there is so many possibilities with these oil.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need the carrying case that goes with it ($40) because the box it comes in is just fine.</li>
            <li>After looking around and doing lots of research for pure essential oils, these are amazing quality for a great price.</li>
            <li>What a great way to start, or expand, your collection of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I find that Lavender relaxes me, Eucalyptus helps with my sinus and allergies issues,  Tea Tree is excellent on cuts and breakouts, just to name a few.  </li>
            <li>I have been so happy with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I use the lavender as an air freshener by putting about 10-20 drops into a spray bottle filled with distilled water.</li>
            <li>They also have a great diffuser that I keep in my back office.</li>
            <li>-- I was filled with giddiness like a kid on Xmas morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>I am just learning about essential oils, and this is a great starter set.</li>
            <li>It has exceeded my expectations and I am having so much fun with it!  </li>
            <li>I got really excited when it came in the mail</li>
            <li>And it was exactly how it was described my 64 biles fit perfectly in that carrying case that I had previously  </li>
            <li>I am still in the process of learning about essential oils and what creates a quality product, but so far, I have been very happy with these.  </li>
            <li>They smell true to the item and have retained their scent well.  </li>
            <li>All the items were in tack upon arrival and I think that this is a good way to start off your essential  oil collection</li>
            <li>These are my 1st purchase and I wish I had went ahead and bought the full set.</li>
            <li>Overall, the Essential Oils are of very good quality, smell fantastic, and have proven to be very useful.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about becoming an aromatherapist, since I&#x27;ve already learned so much just from using the oils in this kit.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>I use these essential oils to make homemade products like soaps, bath fizzies/bombs, bath salts, sugar scrubs and more!</li>
            <li>Ugh, this is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It was also packaged in such a way that it looked like a box of nice chocolates.</li>
            <li>These are high quality and are easy to mix with lotions, oils and</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The oil strenght is good, the smells are intense and the bottles look high quality and professionally put together.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t smell as good as other oils</li>
            <li>(I have to do this several times depending on the severity of the headache) and not only does the headache go away, but I smell great and feel calm and relaxed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to make my own beauty products and needed a large selection of oils for the recipes.</li>
            <li>These oils are great quality and such a variety of different oils.  </li>
            <li>This is my first kit of essential oils and boy am I pleased.</li>
            <li>When you open each box you take the top level out to reveal the bottom level of oils.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the essential oils when I opened the box...</li>
            <li>Many people do not realize that Essential Oils can help aid in many daily conditions as well as help prevent illness.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>They last forever and many i haven&#x27;t even needed to use yet.</li>
            <li>All bottles were sealed and came exactly as pictured in the product description.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost $200 and contains SOOOO MANY different oils,</li>
            <li>Great if you&#x27;re a beginner oil user but would probably do well to just go to your local earthy whole foods like store and try a bunch of individual oils and buy $200 of the smells</li>
            <li>I have already ordered more oils from them since this purchase and will order from them again in the future.</li>
            <li>The 101 ways pamphlet is under the eos on the bottom in the first box.</li>
            <li>So, often times I get many more drops of these oils than I&#x27;m trying to get, and that can be a problem with something so potent, and so expensive.</li>
            <li>Also, these are all 100%natural oils, not fake chemical</li>
            <li>love it wished i would of bought the bigger one because every time i need a blend</li>
            <li>They are more than what I expected and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Along with this set, I purchased four other oils including Rose.</li>
            <li>I know, pure torture.</li>
            <li>I have now had them for a few months and, while I do not use them sparingly, I do have half bottles of a lot of them and they smell just as wonderful as when I opened them.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a large variety of oils.</li>
            <li>It has been a such a huge blessing.</li>
            <li>This is a very comprehensive set</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of some of the oils.</li>
            <li>you really like.</li>
            <li>So customer service is excellent and the quality of the oils is top of the line as they burn slowly and it only takes a few drops  to use.</li>
            <li>I really wish they would change the droppers.</li>
            <li>Everyone loves it and wants more:)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about oils</li>
            <li>but I really like these.  </li>
            <li>These scents are very fresh and invigorating which last for months on end.</li>
            <li>They drip VERY quickly, and I find it hard to be precise.</li>
            <li>The bottles are all clearly labeled and straight, no sloppy glue lines on the edges.  </li>
            <li>This set is a great combination of the most common essential oils and was about half the price of buying them separately.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the oil comes out too quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also really glad I switched to essential oils vs traditional medicine for a lot of things!</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>This was my very first essential oil purchase!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>This seller is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The oils are very high quality, the labeling is classy.  </li>
            <li>As for Eden&#x27;s Garden, they packaged the product securely and I received it before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>Not only did it come pretty much overnight</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth considering the cost of the oils if you added them up separately.  </li>
            <li>I am just beginning with essential oils, and have been having a lot of fun with them.</li>
            <li>So, when her birthday came around she specifically asked for the Supreme Aromatherapy set to expand her new collection (and obsession).  </li>
            <li>Recipes can be altered with as little as one-two too many drops falling into your creation, especially perfumes so I do need to figure out how to get the oil to cooperate when I only need a specific amount of oil! :)</li>
            <li>Very professional company.  </li>
            <li>I am been making soaps and scented moisturizers all day long, having so much fun mixing and matching scents.  </li>
            <li>were divine, which I hope is an indicator that the essential oils are 100% pure since I am still fairly new to eos.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a few drops in an unscented candle, and the entire room is filled with a peaceful fragrance.</li>
            <li>For those outside of the industry, Eden&#x27;s Garden includes a cute little packet explaining uses for their products.</li>
            <li>Shipping came exceedingly fast almost as fast as expedited and I only chose standard!</li>
            <li>What natural remedies and aids will you find in your kit?  </li>
            <li>American Express is very responsive to this stuff and after I provided all this information, I was reimbursed.  </li>
            <li>really learning a lot about essential oils.</li>
            <li>There are several pre-mixed formulations ready to use.  </li>
            <li>, what part of the plant the EO comes from, what other oils it blends well with, and any cautions you should be aware of.</li>
            <li>I DO love the oils, but the droppers are SO frustrating.</li>
            <li>Despite being backed up due to the holidays, I still recieved my oils within a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>They are pure, not watered down like others.</li>
            <li>This one comes with some REAL stinkers that unless you had a VERY specific purpose for them would be a complete waste.</li>
            <li>too many synergy blends come with this set and there is no rose or geranium or other oils ive needed.</li>
            <li>and I only need to buy a few new oils to complete my inventory.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> that alone spread a warm feeling through me.  </li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil and service was fast.</li>
            <li> , it was so nicely packaged and wrapped.  </li>
            <li> the fact that Sandalwood is not included is kind of a shame.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s kinda nice.</li>
            <li> The service was excellent and it was a great price for such a selection.  </li>
            <li> These oils seem nice.</li>
            <li> They have been wonderful and just as good as Young Livings products.</li>
            <li> I have made some bath salts for soaking and the rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many times this kit has come in handy already</li>
            <li> Wonderful precious really natural oils!</li>
            <li> While they don&#x27;t come with much info, the company has an excellent web site that lists all their available oils along with their uses, description of scent, country of origin</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it an awesome investment but a great bang for your buck when getting pure EOs.</li>
            <li> I did some research on brands and this one is a much better buy oppose to Doterra or YL.</li>
            <li> I wish there was more blends and not as many citrus neat oils.</li>
            <li> I love these oils and Eden&#x27;s Garden.</li>
            <li> The oils come in two boxes that sit on top of another.</li>
            <li> This company is top notch in everything they do.  </li>
            <li> So many oils and I can&#x27;t wait to use all of them.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this set of essential oils.</li>
            <li> This company is top notch in everything they do.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because I wanted to purchase as many of the oils at one time that I could afford.</li>
            <li> I have to say Eden&#x27;s Gardens oils are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the set  Essentials Oils and would recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> I love Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t let the price fool you - these are the best quality essential oils</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the vast array of oils!</li>
            <li> The quality is top notch.  </li>
            <li> In fact the company contacted me when I placed an order for 4 bottles of my favorite oils and they realized that I was going to pay shipping costs 4 times</li>
            <li> Great value for good quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> They are the best essential oils I have ever found!</li>
            <li> Thank you Eden&#x27;s Garden for this convenient and awesome selection of essential oils.</li>
            <li> was a Christmas Gift and I Love, Love,</li>
            <li> Love all the oils.</li>
            <li> and I love learning about the combinations of scent.</li>
            <li> I have also read two books on EO to help me learn more about how to use them.</li>
            <li> I love them and how they are coloured in the bottles.</li>
            <li> I love your product.</li>
            <li> Also u can combine the oils to make your own unique fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the package it comes in is super duper cute!</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed with these scents!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge set, the variety is great, and they&#x27;re high quality.</li>
            <li> great starter kit, wished it had a portfolio book with the product for easier storage and mobility, but so far products are as described.</li>
            <li> The oils are very high quality; the labeling is elegant and so nicely packaged and wrapped.</li>
            <li> I have been find out so much and coming up with my own recipes and there is so many possibilities with these oil.</li>
            <li> We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need the carrying case that goes with it ($40) because the box it comes in is just fine.</li>
            <li> After looking around and doing lots of research for pure essential oils, these are amazing quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> What a great way to start, or expand, your collection of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I find that Lavender relaxes me, Eucalyptus helps with my sinus and allergies issues,  Tea Tree is excellent on cuts and breakouts, just to name a few.  </li>
            <li> I have been so happy with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use the lavender as an air freshener by putting about 10-20 drops into a spray bottle filled with distilled water.</li>
            <li> They also have a great diffuser that I keep in my back office.</li>
            <li> -- I was filled with giddiness like a kid on Xmas morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li> I am just learning about essential oils, and this is a great starter set.</li>
            <li> It has exceeded my expectations and I am having so much fun with it!  </li>
            <li> I got really excited when it came in the mail</li>
            <li> And it was exactly how it was described my 64 biles fit perfectly in that carrying case that I had previously  </li>
            <li> I am still in the process of learning about essential oils and what creates a quality product, but so far, I have been very happy with these.  </li>
            <li> They smell true to the item and have retained their scent well.  </li>
            <li> All the items were in tack upon arrival and I think that this is a good way to start off your essential  oil collection</li>
            <li> These are my 1st purchase and I wish I had went ahead and bought the full set.</li>
            <li> Overall, the Essential Oils are of very good quality, smell fantastic, and have proven to be very useful.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about becoming an aromatherapist, since I&#x27;ve already learned so much just from using the oils in this kit.</li>
            <li> That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> I use these essential oils to make homemade products like soaps, bath fizzies/bombs, bath salts, sugar scrubs and more!</li>
            <li> Ugh, this is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was also packaged in such a way that it looked like a box of nice chocolates.</li>
            <li> These are high quality and are easy to mix with lotions, oils and</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The oil strenght is good, the smells are intense and the bottles look high quality and professionally put together.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smell as good as other oils</li>
            <li> (I have to do this several times depending on the severity of the headache) and not only does the headache go away, but I smell great and feel calm and relaxed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to make my own beauty products and needed a large selection of oils for the recipes.</li>
            <li> These oils are great quality and such a variety of different oils.  </li>
            <li> This is my first kit of essential oils and boy am I pleased.</li>
            <li> When you open each box you take the top level out to reveal the bottom level of oils.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the essential oils when I opened the box...</li>
            <li> Many people do not realize that Essential Oils can help aid in many daily conditions as well as help prevent illness.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> They last forever and many i haven&#x27;t even needed to use yet.</li>
            <li> All bottles were sealed and came exactly as pictured in the product description.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost $200 and contains SOOOO MANY different oils,</li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;re a beginner oil user but would probably do well to just go to your local earthy whole foods like store and try a bunch of individual oils and buy $200 of the smells</li>
            <li> I have already ordered more oils from them since this purchase and will order from them again in the future.</li>
            <li> The 101 ways pamphlet is under the eos on the bottom in the first box.</li>
            <li> So, often times I get many more drops of these oils than I&#x27;m trying to get, and that can be a problem with something so potent, and so expensive.</li>
            <li> Also, these are all 100%natural oils, not fake chemical</li>
            <li> love it wished i would of bought the bigger one because every time i need a blend</li>
            <li> They are more than what I expected and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Along with this set, I purchased four other oils including Rose.</li>
            <li> I know, pure torture.</li>
            <li> I have now had them for a few months and, while I do not use them sparingly, I do have half bottles of a lot of them and they smell just as wonderful as when I opened them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a large variety of oils.</li>
            <li> It has been a such a huge blessing.</li>
            <li> This is a very comprehensive set</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of some of the oils.</li>
            <li> you really like.</li>
            <li> So customer service is excellent and the quality of the oils is top of the line as they burn slowly and it only takes a few drops  to use.</li>
            <li> I really wish they would change the droppers.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves it and wants more:)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about oils</li>
            <li> but I really like these.  </li>
            <li> These scents are very fresh and invigorating which last for months on end.</li>
            <li> They drip VERY quickly, and I find it hard to be precise.</li>
            <li> The bottles are all clearly labeled and straight, no sloppy glue lines on the edges.  </li>
            <li> This set is a great combination of the most common essential oils and was about half the price of buying them separately.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the oil comes out too quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also really glad I switched to essential oils vs traditional medicine for a lot of things!</li>
            <li> Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li> This was my very first essential oil purchase!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> This seller is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The oils are very high quality, the labeling is classy.  </li>
            <li> As for Eden&#x27;s Garden, they packaged the product securely and I received it before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Not only did it come pretty much overnight</li>
            <li> You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth considering the cost of the oils if you added them up separately.  </li>
            <li> I am just beginning with essential oils, and have been having a lot of fun with them.</li>
            <li> So, when her birthday came around she specifically asked for the Supreme Aromatherapy set to expand her new collection (and obsession).  </li>
            <li> Recipes can be altered with as little as one-two too many drops falling into your creation, especially perfumes so I do need to figure out how to get the oil to cooperate when I only need a specific amount of oil! :)</li>
            <li> Very professional company.  </li>
            <li> I am been making soaps and scented moisturizers all day long, having so much fun mixing and matching scents.  </li>
            <li> were divine, which I hope is an indicator that the essential oils are 100% pure since I am still fairly new to eos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a few drops in an unscented candle, and the entire room is filled with a peaceful fragrance.</li>
            <li> For those outside of the industry, Eden&#x27;s Garden includes a cute little packet explaining uses for their products.</li>
            <li> Shipping came exceedingly fast almost as fast as expedited and I only chose standard!</li>
            <li> What natural remedies and aids will you find in your kit?  </li>
            <li> American Express is very responsive to this stuff and after I provided all this information, I was reimbursed.  </li>
            <li> really learning a lot about essential oils.</li>
            <li> There are several pre-mixed formulations ready to use.  </li>
            <li> , what part of the plant the EO comes from, what other oils it blends well with, and any cautions you should be aware of.</li>
            <li> I DO love the oils, but the droppers are SO frustrating.</li>
            <li> Despite being backed up due to the holidays, I still recieved my oils within a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> They are pure, not watered down like others.</li>
            <li> This one comes with some REAL stinkers that unless you had a VERY specific purpose for them would be a complete waste.</li>
            <li> too many synergy blends come with this set and there is no rose or geranium or other oils ive needed.</li>
            <li> and I only need to buy a few new oils to complete my inventory.</li>
            <li> I only wish it came with a few less Synergy blends and a few more oils like chamomile.</li>
            <li> If you try to tilt the bottle less to control the speed better, it will usually just leak along the lip and drip down the side.</li>
            <li> these are highly concentrated, so a few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> If you are a body worker or serious about essential oils just save up and buy decent ones one by one if you have to.</li>
            <li> They include a small brochure giving 45 ways to use essential oils and I have tried several of them.</li>
            <li> A small pamphlet was also included that explains the benefits and uses for the various essential oils included in the box set.  </li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> I tried several other oils at work as well (just a drop on a tissue) and everyone felt that they provided a little pick-me-up to their day.</li>
            <li> Additionally I use it as a perfume but remember a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to buy the other 64.</li>
            <li> What other company would do that?</li>
            <li> I will purchase some other singles and blends from Eden&#x27;s Garden that didn&#x27;t come with this kit!</li>
            <li> You get a little of everything.</li>
            <li> I did have a little leakage from one bottle, but it was no biggie.</li>
            <li> I just apply a little lavender oil to my temples and forehead with a Q-tip</li>
            <li> im missing one oil.</li>
            <li> I was a little anxious to recieve my product.</li>
            <li> : I am truly a customer, not affiliated with this company in anyway and don&#x27;t usually write feedbacks.</li>
            <li> Everyday I have tried something new with these oils and have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just a little sad and disappointing that even though this company received their merchandise back, they didn&#x27;t think to reimburse me.</li>
            <li> I have been in the aromatherapy world for a lot of years and have seen my share of bad oils.  </li>
            <li> I guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have ordered oils from this company twice and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My package of essential oils was delivered on time  And it was exactly how it was described my 64 biles fit perfectly in that carrying case that I had previously  Bought</li>
            <li> Fantastic company!!!  Phenomenal oils!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first kit of essential oils and boy am I pleased. I did some research on brands and this one is a much better buy oppose to Doterra or YL. Everyday I have tried something new with these oils and have yet to be disappointed. I wish there was more blends and not as many citrus neat oils. Shipping came exceedingly fast almost as fast as expedited and I only chose standard! Great job Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> Great oils! I am so glad I purchased from your company!</li>
            <li> I love these oils and Eden&#x27;s Garden. Despite being backed up due to the holidays, I still recieved my oils within a reasonable time. I placed my order on Sunday Dec 14 and recieved them that Friday Dec 19. The oils come in two boxes that sit on top of another. When you open each box you take the top level out to reveal the bottom level of oils. When I got the USPS box, it had a very obvious scent to it. I am absolutely thrilled by this set. Not only is it an awesome investment but a great bang for your buck when getting pure EOs. I would definately reccomend this.</li>
            <li> LOVE Edens Garden products!!!</li>
            <li> It works for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> What a great way to start, or expand, your collection of essential oils.  Arrived quickly and well packed.  I love the smell of the essential oils when I opened the box...that alone spread a warm feeling through me.  My order shipped the same day and arrived two business days later.  Many people do not realize that Essential Oils can help aid in many daily conditions as well as help prevent illness.  I find that Lavender relaxes me, Eucalyptus helps with my sinus and allergies issues,  Tea Tree is excellent on cuts and breakouts, just to name a few.  What natural remedies and aids will you find in your kit?  Excellent quality oil and service was fast.</li>
            <li> This was my very first essential oil purchase! It has exceeded my expectations and I am having so much fun with it!  Would recommend to anyone who is looking to get started with essential oils/aromatherapy.  I&#x27;m thinking about becoming an aromatherapist, since I&#x27;ve already learned so much just from using the oils in this kit. I will purchase some other singles and blends from Eden&#x27;s Garden that didn&#x27;t come with this kit!</li>
            <li> I bought these to try out different essential oils. This is a great set with tons of variety! I only wish it came with a few less Synergy blends and a few more oils like chamomile. Very happy with these though</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great. A steal. A million uses. Can&#x27;t wait to buy the other 64.</li>
            <li> This pack is amazing! You get a little of everything. I did have a little leakage from one bottle, but it was no biggie. I got really excited when it came in the mail and I could smell them all. Ugh, this is well worth the price. I&#x27;m in love! Not to mention the package it comes in is super duper cute!</li>
            <li> Great Product and service would recommend to anyone. Thank U</li>
            <li> What a treat to get this set in the mail.  Not only did it come pretty much overnight, it was so nicely packaged and wrapped.  But the biggest surprise came when I opened the boxes.  I have been in the aromatherapy world for a lot of years and have seen my share of bad oils.  This company is top notch in everything they do.  The oils are very high quality, the labeling is classy.  This set had just about everything someone could ask for.  Great mixture of all the top 64 oils.  Would highly recommend.  Also, purchased a 64 oil holder with it, that works great.  Thanks!  I will be returning.</li>
            <li> Loved the variety. It makes a great way to try tons of scents!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my oils!!!</li>
            <li> Best bang for my buck! So many oils and I can&#x27;t wait to use all of them.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this set of essential oils. They last forever and many i haven&#x27;t even needed to use yet. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a large variety of oils.</li>

            <li> I purchased the beginner Essential Oil set offered by Eden&#x27;s Garden during Christmas 2010 for my wife who is a physical therapist and wanted to incorporate aromatherapy with her patients.  She tested those out for a while and has diffused the oils and used them with carrier oils for massage, as well.  The aromas were great and did not cause any skin irritations when used with carrier oils.  So, when her birthday came around she specifically asked for the Supreme Aromatherapy set to expand her new collection (and obsession).  I ordered it in March and everything arrived in perfect condition and was packaged nicely.  She really loved the set.  All bottles were sealed and came exactly as pictured in the product description.  You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth considering the cost of the oils if you added them up separately.  Overall, the Essential Oils are of very good quality, smell fantastic, and have proven to be very useful.  The only thing that would help is a recipe guide or list or oils that go well together.</li>
            <li> These oils are great quality and such a variety of different oils.  I really like the smell of some of the oils.</li>
            <li> I think this set bc it&#x27;s almost $200 and contains SOOOO MANY different oils, the fact that Sandalwood is not included is kind of a shame. Otherwise, there are several mint smells, and citrus smells that I use faithfully. Great if you&#x27;re a beginner oil user but would probably do well to just go to your local earthy whole foods like store and try a bunch of individual oils and buy $200 of the smells you really like. This one comes with some REAL stinkers that unless you had a VERY specific purpose for them would be a complete waste.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because I wanted to purchase as many of the oils at one time that I could afford. This set is a great combination of the most common essential oils and was about half the price of buying them separately. I use the lavender as an air freshener by putting about 10-20 drops into a spray bottle filled with distilled water. It is great. You can also do this with lemon and peppermint. Lavender can also be used for pain relief or muscle strain. The best use, though, is for burns. I burned my palm on a skillet handle and put lavender oil on it immediately. It didn&#x27;t blister or peel and the pain went away within about ten minutes. It was very red and had the imprint of the handle, but that was gone in about a day. I am just beginning with essential oils, and have been having a lot of fun with them. Along with this set, I purchased four other oils including Rose. I have made some bath salts for soaking and the rose is my favorite. It smells wonderful. As for Eden&#x27;s Garden, they packaged the product securely and I received it before the expected delivery date. They include a small brochure giving 45 ways to use essential oils and I have tried several of them. I have already ordered more oils from them since this purchase and will order from them again in the future. They have a great website.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and often look for quality oils for my clients. I have to say Eden&#x27;s Gardens oils are my favorite. I have foolishly (LOL) tried cheaper oils, and boy, did I learn my lesson. These are high quality and are easy to mix with lotions, oils and remedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden&#x27;s oils are heaven. For those outside of the industry, Eden&#x27;s Garden includes a cute little packet explaining uses for their products. I got a lot good ideas! Just a few drops in an unscented candle, and the entire room is filled with a peaceful fragrance. They also have a great diffuser that I keep in my back office. BEWARE: these are highly concentrated, so a few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li> Lots to choose from. I like it.</li>
            <li> everything I needed to start my soap business will purchase again!!!!</li>
            <li> Great set of oils!  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Oils are truly therapeutic grade- I will def save some money and buy from them</li>
            <li> I was a little anxious to recieve my product. When i recieved it today, I could not wait to get home to try some. I was pleased with the set  Essentials Oils and would recommend it to others.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered twice by accident and cancelled the 2nd order...on the USPS tracking they had stopped the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later I happened to review my credit card statement and saw I was still charged for the 2nd order even though they said they would reimburse me.  On the tracking #, it was still &amp;#34;in transit&amp;#34; even a year later.  American Express is very responsive to this stuff and after I provided all this information, I was reimbursed.  Just a little sad and disappointing that even though this company received their merchandise back, they didn&#x27;t think to reimburse me.</li>
            <li> It was like Christmas when this arrived!  I love Eden&#x27;s Garden - don&#x27;t let the price fool you - these are the best quality essential oils and I use them every day.  Will always buy Eden Garden.</li>
            <li> really learning a lot about essential oils. great starter kit, wished it had a portfolio book with the product for easier storage and mobility, but so far products are as described.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the vast array of oils! The quality is top notch.  I should have purchased the larger size!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I use it in a defuser, apply it to my skin and even ingest some of it in my purified water.</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed with these scents! I have bought them for myself and for friends. I will continue to! Thanks for a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> After looking around and doing lots of research for pure essential oils, these are amazing quality for a great price. The oils came packed in a 8&#x27; Length, 5 3/4&amp;#34; Width and 4 1//2&amp;#34; deep box. Organized in four layers, so the oils don&#x27;t jumble around, but also makes it helpful to organize them how you want. They are more than what I expected and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> These oils are not the best I have ever encountered. too many synergy blends come with this set and there is no rose or geranium or other oils ive needed. They don&#x27;t smell as good as other oils but I am making use of them best I can since I paid the money for them. I have been using them for cleaners and mopping the floors and that&#x27;s kinda nice. If you are a body worker or serious about essential oils just save up and buy decent ones one by one if you have to.</li>
            <li> Oh my GOSH!!! I&#x27;ve have been keeping my eyes on this product for approx. 2 years - no lies. I know, pure torture. I finally decided to cough up the coins and get it. I was probably skipping home that evening from work, knowing that my package was awaiting me -- I was filled with giddiness like a kid on Xmas morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smells emanating from the stacked boxes once I opened the package were divine, which I hope is an indicator that the essential oils are 100% pure since I am still fairly new to eos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents: Everything came as stated in the description box (no leaks -- well packaged). The eos are alphabetized, so there is no need to put them in order. The 101 ways pamphlet is under the eos on the bottom in the first box.</li>
            <li> The service was excellent and it was a great price for such a selection.  I am been making soaps and scented moisturizers all day long, having so much fun mixing and matching scents.  I am still in the process of learning about essential oils and what creates a quality product, but so far, I have been very happy with these.  They smell true to the item and have retained their scent well.  I have now had them for a few months and, while I do not use them sparingly, I do have half bottles of a lot of them and they smell just as wonderful as when I opened them.</li>
            <li> Excellent collection of oils! Love them!</li>
            <li> Eden&#x27;s Garden is the only company I purchase my therapidic/burning oils. I have reordered from them several times.  I ended up purchasimg the Preimum Collection set of oils  This company has great customer service. In fact the company contacted me when I placed an order for 4 bottles of my favorite oils and they realized that I was going to pay shipping costs 4 times so they refunded me for 3 of the shipping chargeds. What other company would do that? So customer service is excellent and the quality of the oils is top of the line as they burn slowly and it only takes a few drops  to use. Also u can combine the oils to make your own unique fragrance. Additionally I use it as a perfume but remember a little goes a long way.  Don&#x27;t miss out on a great company and their exceptional products. I guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed. And just to let everyone know out there in feedback land: I am truly a customer, not affiliated with this company in anyway and don&#x27;t usually write feedbacks. But I had to write the feedback in this case. Happy with my oils!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in good condition.  Great value for good quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> I use these essential oils to make homemade products like soaps, bath fizzies/bombs, bath salts, sugar scrubs and more! They are the best essential oils I have ever found!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this set for me as a gift. I was ECSTATIC! It&#x27;s a huge set, the variety is great, and they&#x27;re high quality. I use them for cosmetic applications, in cleaning, aromatherapy... all sorts of things. I could say that I use essential oil every day. I DO love the oils, but the droppers are SO frustrating. They drip VERY quickly, and I find it hard to be precise. If you try to tilt the bottle less to control the speed better, it will usually just leak along the lip and drip down the side. So, often times I get many more drops of these oils than I&#x27;m trying to get, and that can be a problem with something so potent, and so expensive. So, I docked two stars for this. I really wish they would change the droppers. My oils from Now Foods don&#x27;t do this!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many times this kit has come in handy already and I&#x27;ve only had it a month or two! I&#x27;m also really glad I switched to essential oils vs traditional medicine for a lot of things! (I also home make a lot of our home and bathroom products)</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time. It was also packaged in such a way that it looked like a box of nice chocolates. All the items were in tack upon arrival and I think that this is a good way to start off your essential  oil collection</li>
            <li> I just received by 64-pack of essential oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden! What a wonderful deal! All items arrived intact and smelling amazing! Thank you Eden&#x27;s Garden for this convenient and awesome selection of essential oils. This seller is highly recommended. Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I made a lip balm with shea butter, beeswax, vitamin e, and Edens Garden Tangerine Essential Oil. Everyone loves it and wants more:)&lt;br /&gt;This was a Christmas Gift and I Love, Love, Love all the oils. They are pure, not watered down like others. Also, these are all 100%natural oils, not fake chemical flavors.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Eden Garden for making my hobby so enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;I will be back as I run out, your the best!!&lt;br /&gt;PS</li>
            <li> Excellent scents that are worth every penny. These scents are very fresh and invigorating which last for months on end.</li>
            <li> Great value and customer service is superb.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about oils but I really like these.  These are my 1st purchase and I wish I had went ahead and bought the full set.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> Finding great healing and pain relief with this set. It has been a such a huge blessing. Treating fibromyalgia, scholiosis, and arthritis with these.</li>
            <li> Very professional company.  I have ordered oils from this company twice and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  I think the lavender scent should linger a bit longer but all in all I do love the oils and for the quality the price is excellent!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need the carrying case that goes with it ($40) because the box it comes in is just fine. I got it and I love learning about the combinations of scent. These oils seem nice. Great starter for me</li>
            <li> They have been wonderful and just as good as Young Livings products.</li>
            <li> Had almost everyrthing I wanted. Still had to pick up a couple extras that were not included. Still very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this dream set.</li>
            <li> This Kit is wonderful. I&#x27;ll have a great time studying the oils and experimenting with combinations. There is a wide variety of oils for nearly every purpose.</li>
            <li> love it wished i would of bought the bigger one because every time i need a blend im missing one oil.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I am just learning about essential oils, and this is a great starter set. While they don&#x27;t come with much info, the company has an excellent web site that lists all their available oils along with their uses, description of scent, country of origin, what part of the plant the EO comes from, what other oils it blends well with, and any cautions you should be aware of. I have also read two books on EO to help me learn more about how to use them. I don&#x27;t need to take aspirin for headaches any more! I just apply a little lavender oil to my temples and forehead with a Q-tip (I have to do this several times depending on the severity of the headache) and not only does the headache go away, but I smell great and feel calm and relaxed. I was passing out tissues at work with a drop of lavender oil on them to my co-workers! Everyone loved the smell. I tried several other oils at work as well (just a drop on a tissue) and everyone felt that they provided a little pick-me-up to their day. It has been so fascinating to learn about these oils and to experience their aromas.</li>
            <li> The product is beautifully packaged, perfect for any gift or to use yourself.  A small pamphlet was also included that explains the benefits and uses for the various essential oils included in the box set.  The oils themselves are very clean and wonderfully fragrant.  There are several pre-mixed formulations ready to use.  The bottles are all clearly labeled and straight, no sloppy glue lines on the edges.  Very pleased with this set.</li>
            <li> Wonderful precious really natural oils! I love them and how they are coloured in the bottles. Great product! Recommanded!</li>
            <li> I love your product. i have used aura cacia and now brands. i use your oils to season foods, cosmetic,health and cleaning applications.</li>
