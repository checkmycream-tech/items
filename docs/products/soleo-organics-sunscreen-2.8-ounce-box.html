    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Mountain biking, crossed the Atlantic in my sailboat, best, highest quality Organic product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I think it has a very pleasant smell as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the best in terms of EWG&#x27;s non-toxic sunscreen rating, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a good product.</li>
            <li>This stuff works GREAT.</li>
            <li>and it is a very effective sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Very effective at blocking sun.  </li>
            <li>But then I&#x27;m sure lots of people would complain about the scent, so it&#x27;s probably just perfect as it is.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this sunscreen because the ingredients looked great and having a 18 month boy, who loves the beach I needed something good.</li>
            <li>However, if you knead the bottle so all the good stuff mixes together, you&#x27;re good to go.   </li>
            <li>:)  Go Soleo!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It has so many good qualities - completely safe and non-toxic both for the wearer and the water supply it eventually gets washed into.  </li>
            <li>Used while in Ecuador (very very strong sun) and Costa Rica.</li>
            <li>this is an effective, easy to use, safe sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>When used properly it is VERY water resistant, gave great sun protection</li>
            <li>The ones claiming to be chemical free and non-hypoallegenic lie!  </li>
            <li>Oh organic product I love you.    </li>
            <li>I went to Puerto Rico and stayed at the beach for 5 days, I was under my umbrella most of the time, but when I was out and swimming this product protected me.</li>
            <li>It worked under the most extremes conditions.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;NO</li>
            <li>The stripes become even more visible after swimming.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>The sheen is worth the effective blocking.  </li>
            <li>No bad smells and safer than most sunscreens out there.  </li>
            <li>and there, it&#x27;s probably fine.  </li>
            <li>So far this is the very best of the natural sunscreen&#x27;s I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It just sat on my son&#x27;s face like a layer of light purple frosting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was definitely worth trying, but it&#x27;s time for me to shop around some more.</li>
            <li>So overall, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen and it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Our water play is so much more fun since we started using Soleo.</li>
            <li>OK I love the fact that it is all natural with no bad things in it</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>Organic, a true breakthru product.  </li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t have red eyes after water play any more!</li>
            <li>It stands up to the intense NZ Sun fabulously.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it to protect the reef systems from the harmful effects of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>Yes it is a bit greasy, but your skin will love you for it as it&#x27;s natural oils, that your skin will absorbs in a minutes anyways.</li>
            <li>must* apply it 30 minutes before sun exposure, but it says that right on the bottle.</li>
            <li>More info on sunscreens in general at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>For the first time I can put sunscreen on and not worry about getting an itchy rash from it.  </li>
            <li>The price went up quite a bit since I bought my first tube...</li>
            <li>There are better products on the market with low toxicity ratings.</li>
            <li>Exact product as promised.</li>
            <li>We look like ghosts, but we don&#x27;t get burns, we don&#x27;t miss spots because it&#x27;s a visible sunscreen, and we know exactly what we&#x27;re putting on our bodies.  </li>
            <li>It does not get absorbed very well either, so you feel sticky and skin stays shiny.</li>
            <li>I am a user of natural skin care products and over the years have tried many natural suncreams.  </li>
            <li>All it has going for it is a positive environmental compliance review.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen because it is safe for the reefs and other reviews said is goes on like normal sunscreen which we found to be true.  </li>
            <li>The only time I&#x27;ve had problems with it is when I didn&#x27;t properly knead the bottle before the first use--ended up super greasy; and when I didn&#x27;t apply it a full 30 minutes before exposure--washed right off and burned right away.  </li>
            <li>I switched my family from Soleo to a back-up tube of California Baby from last year, and it STILL worked better, even being over a year old!    </li>
            <li>You get the point that I am really allergic to sunscreen?    </li>
            <li>And it really works too.  </li>
            <li>My friend told me that my arms are also very greasy and i was asked to wipe it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Positives: Odorless, very water resistant.  </li>
            <li>But, it does leave a whitish sheen, no matter how much you try to rub and massage into the skin.</li>
            <li>My husband even put some straight in his eye to see if it burned or stung, he said it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the medium in which the sunscreen material is suspended is very runny.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens contain chemical sunscreens which were approved back in the 70&#x27;s by the FDA, but which have since been shown to absorb thru the skin and cause hormone issues in people - Oxybenzone is the most common and acts like estrogen when it is absorbed thru the skin.  </li>
            <li>I can guarantee you that you won&#x27;t get a sunburn with this product, it really does</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d be ready to use on the kids for the summer.</li>
            <li>I read the other review from 2009 and maybe they got better since then.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and that it did not cause any allergic reactions (many of the creams or sun screens do)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit greasy but smells much better and costs less than this one.</li>
            <li>But if it&#x27;s your main protection against the sun--think twice.  </li>
            <li>I think this is the main reason.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re still on the hunt for a chemical free suncream take a look at UV Natural especially there Baby cream, it&#x27;s not just for the babies.</li>
            <li>The best sunscreen is useless if it isn&#x27;t actually applied.</li>
            <li>Would give it 5 stars if they would just add a small amount of natural pleasant scent to it, such as lavender or citrus.  </li>
            <li>For our eldest, who is becoming image-conscious, I have added mineral makeups to give her face a sparkly, creamy look that&#x27;s less ghoulish.    </li>
            <li>Always patch test new products</li>
            <li>I use this for myself and I&#x27;ve used this on my son since he was 10 months old.</li>
            <li>I choose to write a review today because we used it on my 7 month old nephew in 90 degree blaring heat</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to knead the bottle when using as natural ingredients separate in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It just goes to prove just because it&#x27;s packed with natural ingredients</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a 2 year old that we use this on, we have been using it on her since she was 6 months old.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s in a form that is easy to spread and you use less than a regular sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve also tried California baby in the stick form (only CalBaby version to be rated as safe as Soleo) and it was awfully hard to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s major ingredient is zinc oxide and not chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Also, it smells pretty strongly like stale vegetable oil, and the smell stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;In regards to protection</li>
            <li>Soleo uses Zinc Oxide instead, and it is in a formula with large enough molecules that the Zinc Oxide isn&#x27;t absorbed into the body, so it avoids negative effects that the chemicals cause.  </li>
            <li>I tried Soleo all natural Sunscreen on the Albuquerque Century bike ride (6/6/09), starting at 6:00 AM, finishing at 2:00 PM, with a partly cloudy sky for part of the ride.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are 100% pure, it contains NON-Nano technology Zinc Oxide particles as the active sunscreen ingredient, and it doesn&#x27;t go on TOO terribly white.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this is only titanium dioxide suspended in some sort of oil.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it is a physical sunscreen, so that means there will be a white hue all over the skin you apply this gunk</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find it particularly oily or greasy, just persistent.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find it particularly oily or greasy, just persistent.  </li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t purchased commercial sunscreen in three years, and likely won&#x27;t need to for at least another three years, so our initial investment of less than $50 (too long to remember exactly how much now) has long paid off.      </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer, I also bought this product due to its low toxicity and high ratings on Skin Deep.</li>
            <li> We just bought and used this product due to its high ratings on Skin Deep (an agency that uses a rating system to inform the public of the toxicity of a products ingredients) but after using it for a few days on our trip to Florida, we tossed it in the trash.    </li>
            <li> The only draw back is that the container was small (2.6 oz) and me and my husband used it all up in those 5 days at the beach.</li>
            <li> Literally breaking into blisters and a red itchy rash if I get a little bit on me.  </li>
            <li> Not sure of the limits of how long each application lasts, but I was applying at least every two hours and certainly after getting out of the water.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to rub it in enough to get rid of the white cast of the zinc oxide;</li>
            <li> I never really worried about getting burnt but as time marches on wrinkles and melanoma are lurking somewhere.    </li>
            <li> A bigger one was not available.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I can wear everyday and not be allergic to it.</li>
            <li> After a couple years of purchasing different brands of expensive \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunblocks, and still wondering about the safety of some of the ingredients,  we ordered a few pounds of zinc oxide powder, and mixed it up with coconut oil to the desired consistency (other natural things like castor oil or beeswax can be used to achieve your preferred mixture).      </li>
            <li> Besides, the oil just separated from the other whitish ingredients.</li>
            <li> The other reviewer said this sunscreen didn&#x27;t protect well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve also added essential oils to some of our mixtures to repel bugs, which has worked well for us, and, again, saved us a small fortune over the years.</li>
            <li> It seams expensive but a bottle lasts a long time you don&#x27;t need to use as much as normal sunblocks.</li>
            <li> I previously tried other ~organic sunscreens without this problem.  </li>
            <li> Over the course of a day, this stuff will migrate down your body, and, if you applied it to your face and bald head like me, into your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> other reviewers also said it&#x27;s greasy!</li>
            <li> When I received it, I saw the expiration date was 6/15 (less than 3mo from now).</li>
            <li> And no matter how long and hard I rub it into my skin, it leaves light-purple stripes all over.</li>
            <li> As far as greasiness, it is more difficult to apply than the crap at the megamart.</li>
            <li> Last year, we used California Baby products and though it was bit tough to rub in, our kids never burned.    </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it works well under my mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the few extra bucks to know you are being protected from the sun and evil chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It is a little thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negatives:  it&#x27;s quite expensive; it&#x27;s very thick, making it hard for my arthritic hands to squeeze it out of the tube; apply too much</li>
            <li> Especially since it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally impossible to find a natural, non-chemical sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t turn your skin at least a little bit white-ish, because that&#x27;s the nature of using zinc or titanium crystals as the sunblock medium.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with all the whiney, negative comments.</li>
            <li> I was really uncomfortable all day long until came home and took the shower.</li>
            <li> but we had several bad burns on our little ones.   </li>
            <li> And maybe some people got an old batch, because mine doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t complaint about it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t react to it.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s not all fragranced like the crap you buy at the local megamart, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;awful\\&quot; by any means.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately here in NZ it cost a grip, so stocking up on our US trip.</li>
            <li> This unfortunately was not one that my skin or my family&#x27;s could tolerate.  </li>
            <li> Greasy; difficult to apply; stinks, and the odor stays in clothes; does not come close to SPF 30 in protection; expensive.  </li>
            <li> But out of all the sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a TON, this one is the least whitening!!!  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if I can get past the terrible feeling it leaves on my skin.</li>
            <li> (Now all I have is a very expensive tube of skin oil...)</li>
            <li> Disappointed I was sent a product that would expire before summer!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is so greasy and disgusting.</li>

            <li> Greasy; difficult to apply; stinks, and the odor stays in clothes; does not come close to SPF 30 in protection; expensive.  All it has going for it is a positive environmental compliance review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with all the whiney, negative comments. I use this for myself and I&#x27;ve used this on my son since he was 10 months old. This stuff works GREAT. You *must* apply it 30 minutes before sun exposure, but it says that right on the bottle. And maybe some people got an old batch, because mine doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. Yeah, it&#x27;s not all fragranced like the crap you buy at the local megamart, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;awful\\&quot; by any means. As far as greasiness, it is more difficult to apply than the crap at the megamart. However, if you knead the bottle so all the good stuff mixes together, you&#x27;re good to go.   The only time I&#x27;ve had problems with it is when I didn&#x27;t properly knead the bottle before the first use--ended up super greasy; and when I didn&#x27;t apply it a full 30 minutes before exposure--washed right off and burned right away.  When used properly it is VERY water resistant, gave great sun protection (I&#x27;m a redhead!), and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or my baby boy&#x27;s skin.   We&#x27;ve also tried California baby in the stick form (only CalBaby version to be rated as safe as Soleo) and it was awfully hard to rub into your skin. It just sat on my son&#x27;s face like a layer of light purple frosting. It didn&#x27;t ever absorb in, even after 45 minutes. We&#x27;re sticking with the organic stuff.</li>
            <li> Since 5th grade I have been allergic to commercial sunscreens.  Literally breaking into blisters and a red itchy rash if I get a little bit on me.  Being darker skinned I never really worried about getting burnt but as time marches on wrinkles and melanoma are lurking somewhere.    I have tried every sunscreen under the sun.  The ones claiming to be chemical free and non-hypoallegenic lie!  SPF in even chapstick makes my lips puff up.  You get the point that I am really allergic to sunscreen?    Enter Soleo.  For the first time I can put sunscreen on and not worry about getting an itchy rash from it.  My daughter won&#x27;t get yelled at for lying on my towel or trying to hold my hand.  Oh organic product I love you.    I choose to write a review today because we used it on my 7 month old nephew in 90 degree blaring heat and he did not burn!  I balked when they pulled the Coppertone out for him.  Here take my Soleo I said.  She texted me tonight asking for the name of the product.    Soleo rocks.  It is worth the few extra bucks to know you are being protected from the sun and evil chemicals.  Don&#x27;t forget to knead the bottle when using as natural ingredients separate in the bottle. :)  Go Soleo!</li>
            <li> So far this is the very best of the natural sunscreen&#x27;s I&#x27;ve found.  The ingredients are 100% pure, it contains NON-Nano technology Zinc Oxide particles as the active sunscreen ingredient, and it doesn&#x27;t go on TOO terribly white.  It&#x27;s literally impossible to find a natural, non-chemical sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t turn your skin at least a little bit white-ish, because that&#x27;s the nature of using zinc or titanium crystals as the sunblock medium.  But out of all the sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a TON, this one is the least whitening!!!  And it really works too.  Would give it 5 stars if they would just add a small amount of natural pleasant scent to it, such as lavender or citrus.  But then I&#x27;m sure lots of people would complain about the scent, so it&#x27;s probably just perfect as it is.  The price went up quite a bit since I bought my first tube...hopefully that&#x27;s just temporary!</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because it is safe for the reefs and other reviews said is goes on like normal sunscreen which we found to be true.  It tends to stay a bit greasy feeling on your skin but it is worth it to protect the reef systems from the harmful effects of sunscreen.  I think it has a very pleasant smell as well and it is a very effective sunscreen.  This is the travel size so you can take it carry on.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed. It is so greasy and disgusting. When I put this on my neck, my hair was stuck to all over my neck and had to wipe the sunblock but it is so sticky, could not solve the problem. My friend told me that my arms are also very greasy and i was asked to wipe it. I was really uncomfortable all day long until came home and took the shower. It isn&#x27;t worth the money. I will never buy this.</li>
            <li> We just bought and used this product due to its high ratings on Skin Deep (an agency that uses a rating system to inform the public of the toxicity of a products ingredients) but after using it for a few days on our trip to Florida, we tossed it in the trash.    We have four kids, ranging in age from 1-12, and we are vigilant about sun protection (our kids all wear rash-guards as well as sun screens while swimming) and re-applications of lotions but we had several bad burns on our little ones.   Last year, we used California Baby products and though it was bit tough to rub in, our kids never burned.    This stuff was greasy too, but I would have tolerated that if it had worked!    Mid-vacation I switched my family from Soleo to a back-up tube of California Baby from last year, and it STILL worked better, even being over a year old!    I&#x27;d use this product with hesitancy.  If you&#x27;re going out for a bit of sun here and there, it&#x27;s probably fine.  But if it&#x27;s your main protection against the sun--think twice.  There are better products on the market with low toxicity ratings.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  It has so many good qualities - completely safe and non-toxic both for the wearer and the water supply it eventually gets washed into.  Organic, a true breakthru product.  However, I&#x27;ll probably try something else next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  it&#x27;s quite expensive; it&#x27;s very thick, making it hard for my arthritic hands to squeeze it out of the tube; apply too much and it&#x27;s hard to rub it in enough to get rid of the white cast of the zinc oxide; not enough and you&#x27;ll burn (remember it&#x27;s \\&quot;only\\&quot; SPF 30, which is marginal here in the Texas sun). And altho it doesn&#x27;t pollute the water supply, what about the environmental cost of shipping it from Australia to the U.S.?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: Odorless, very water resistant.  I have to wash my hands with soap - twice - after applying!  Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find it particularly oily or greasy, just persistent.  Days when I&#x27;m not wearing my mineral makeup with built-in SPF, I mix a dab of Soleo in with my daytime moisturizer to give my face some sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was definitely worth trying, but it&#x27;s time for me to shop around some more.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer, I also bought this product due to its low toxicity and high ratings on Skin Deep. However, as soon as I received this product and open it, it smelled like rancid oil and the foul smell last all day after put it on the face. Besides, the oil just separated from the other whitish ingredients. When I squeeze it and tried to applied some, lots of yellowish oil dripped out before I could get to the essential UV blocking white part. No wonder other reviewers also said it&#x27;s greasy! The other reviewer said this sunscreen didn&#x27;t protect well. I think this is the main reason. If you only put the oil on the face instead of the zinc oxide (the white part), there&#x27;s no protection at all.     I also tried Badger spf30 this summer. It&#x27;s a bit greasy but smells much better and costs less than this one. If you are looking for a zinc oxide only sunscreen, go for Badger spf30 and don&#x27;t wast your money on Soleo.</li>
            <li> I went to Puerto Rico and stayed at the beach for 5 days, I was under my umbrella most of the time, but when I was out and swimming this product protected me. I loved the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and that it did not cause any allergic reactions (many of the creams or sun screens do) So overall, I am happy with it. It worked under the most extremes conditions. sun+heat+water   The only draw back is that the container was small (2.6 oz) and me and my husband used it all up in those 5 days at the beach. A bigger one was not available.  m. font</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen because the ingredients looked great and having a 18 month boy, who loves the beach I needed something good. It stands up to the intense NZ Sun fabulously. Unfortunately here in NZ it cost a grip, so stocking up on our US trip. I read the other review from 2009 and maybe they got better since then. All I know is that it has worked for us. Yes it is a bit greasy, but your skin will love you for it as it&#x27;s natural oils, that your skin will absorbs in a minutes anyways.</li>
            <li> This suncream brought out an excema reaction on both mine and my son&#x27;s skin.  It just goes to prove just because it&#x27;s packed with natural ingredients doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t react to it.  I am a user of natural skin care products and over the years have tried many natural suncreams.  This unfortunately was not one that my skin or my family&#x27;s could tolerate.  Always patch test new products if you have sensitive skin and I recommend you to do so with this cream.  If you&#x27;re still on the hunt for a chemical free suncream take a look at UV Natural especially there Baby cream, it&#x27;s not just for the babies.</li>
            <li> Exact product as promised. Recommend seller!!!</li>
            <li> After a couple years of purchasing different brands of expensive \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunblocks, and still wondering about the safety of some of the ingredients,  we ordered a few pounds of zinc oxide powder, and mixed it up with coconut oil to the desired consistency (other natural things like castor oil or beeswax can be used to achieve your preferred mixture).      We haven&#x27;t purchased commercial sunscreen in three years, and likely won&#x27;t need to for at least another three years, so our initial investment of less than $50 (too long to remember exactly how much now) has long paid off.      We look like ghosts, but we don&#x27;t get burns, we don&#x27;t miss spots because it&#x27;s a visible sunscreen, and we know exactly what we&#x27;re putting on our bodies.  For our eldest, who is becoming image-conscious, I have added mineral makeups to give her face a sparkly, creamy look that&#x27;s less ghoulish.    We&#x27;ve also added essential oils to some of our mixtures to repel bugs, which has worked well for us, and, again, saved us a small fortune over the years.</li>
            <li> I tried Soleo all natural Sunscreen on the Albuquerque Century bike ride (6/6/09), starting at 6:00 AM, finishing at 2:00 PM, with a partly cloudy sky for part of the ride.  Upon finishing the ride I noticed my face and arms were burnt, as if I had not applied any sun block. I previously tried other ~organic sunscreens without this problem.  (Now all I have is a very expensive tube of skin oil...)</li>
            <li> OK I love the fact that it is all natural with no bad things in it but it is soooooooooo greasy and even after you bathe/shower it seems to linger on your skin.  It worked well at providing sun protection but I don&#x27;t know if I can get past the terrible feeling it leaves on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and it is worth every penny.  No bad smells and safer than most sunscreens out there.  I use it everyday and it works well under my mineral makeup.  It is a little thick but still I can get it spread without the white residue.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very effective at blocking sun.  But, it does leave a whitish sheen, no matter how much you try to rub and massage into the skin. The sheen is worth the effective blocking.  Not sure of the limits of how long each application lasts, but I was applying at least every two hours and certainly after getting out of the water.  Used while in Ecuador (very very strong sun) and Costa Rica.</li>
            <li> I have a 2 year old that we use this on, we have been using it on her since she was 6 months old. It is the only sunblock my husband and I have found that does not burn her eyes. My husband even put some straight in his eye to see if it burned or stung, he said it doesn&#x27;t. Our water play is so much more fun since we started using Soleo. My daughter doesn&#x27;t have red eyes after water play any more! It seams expensive but a bottle lasts a long time you don&#x27;t need to use as much as normal sunblocks.</li>
            <li> surf/swim/mtn. bike/live in so-cal: french/scandinavian skin tone: applying on face/body: using SOLEO 5+ years: LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;NO JOKE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE IT!</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is only titanium dioxide suspended in some sort of oil.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it is a physical sunscreen, so that means there will be a white hue all over the skin you apply this gunk to.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the medium in which the sunscreen material is suspended is very runny. Over the course of a day, this stuff will migrate down your body, and, if you applied it to your face and bald head like me, into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best in terms of EWG&#x27;s non-toxic sunscreen rating, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a good product. The best sunscreen is useless if it isn&#x27;t actually applied.</li>
            <li> this is an effective, easy to use, safe sunscreen.  Most sunscreens contain chemical sunscreens which were approved back in the 70&#x27;s by the FDA, but which have since been shown to absorb thru the skin and cause hormone issues in people - Oxybenzone is the most common and acts like estrogen when it is absorbed thru the skin.  Soleo uses Zinc Oxide instead, and it is in a formula with large enough molecules that the Zinc Oxide isn&#x27;t absorbed into the body, so it avoids negative effects that the chemicals cause.  Plus it&#x27;s in a form that is easy to spread and you use less than a regular sunscreen.  More info on sunscreens in general at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is where I got the information I quoted above.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this product. It is very hard to apply. And no matter how long and hard I rub it into my skin, it leaves light-purple stripes all over. The stripes become even more visible after swimming. It does not get absorbed very well either, so you feel sticky and skin stays shiny. Also, it smells pretty strongly like stale vegetable oil, and the smell stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;In regards to protection, I can&#x27;t complaint about it. Wearing it, I have not got sunburn or freckles.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It totally works!  It&#x27;s major ingredient is zinc oxide and not chemicals.  It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I can wear everyday and not be allergic to it.</li>
            <li> this product does not work!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy it you will burn!&lt;br /&gt;very disappointing&lt;br /&gt;does not do anything at all&lt;br /&gt;i would not recommend this to anyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  Mountain biking, crossed the Atlantic in my sailboat, best, highest quality Organic product I have ever used.  Remember to knead like it says.</li>
            <li> I can guarantee you that you won&#x27;t get a sunburn with this product, it really does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a lot of time outside under the Florida sun and no sunburn anytime.</li>
            <li> I bought this in March so I&#x27;d be ready to use on the kids for the summer. When I received it, I saw the expiration date was 6/15 (less than 3mo from now). Disappointed I was sent a product that would expire before summer! Especially since it is so expensive.</li>
