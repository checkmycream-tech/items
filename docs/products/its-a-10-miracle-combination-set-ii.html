            <li>I liked the packaging for the products.</li>
            <li>After using the leave-in conditioner once, my hair looked better that when I washed it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using all 3 products now for about 2 months, and my hair has never been this healthy.  </li>
            <li>Proclaim argan oil serum (you can get that at sally&#x27;s for under 8.00 and works much better than Moroccanoil at triple the price)</li>
            <li>Love the</li>
            <li>and I love  this</li>
            <li>I like this product and it&#x27;s performance; however, if you tend to have more oily hair than I would not recommend the moisturizing shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>the shampoo is pretty good...</li>
            <li>all-in-all, the It&#x27;s a 10 products are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just the nature of my tons of fine textured curls...</li>
            <li>but for you lucky girls with normal hair, i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work much better for you than it does for me.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, healthy, and my color has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo would be great for someone with damaged and dry hair.</li>
            <li>i love the mask, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>, people always say how much they love my hair, and its because of this product.</li>
            <li>this is the best hair product on the market today, I have thick, coarse, colored hair, and it makes it smooth, and soft, and so beautiful</li>
            <li>Product  came quick like promised</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!!</li>
            <li>it helps release tangles and smooth the cuticle layer very well.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth, shiny, and soft, light and airy, but not flyaway, with just enough weight to keep fine hair under control.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>The first thing I tried was the leave-in conditioner (recomended by the worker at the beauty store I was at).  </li>
            <li>After many coloring and daily straightening...</li>
            <li>I have overprocessed thin, blonde hair and if these can make my hair more silky and manageable and full of body, well than I give it 5 stars!!!!</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t think most people use and much conditioner as i do, so it&#x27;ll probably last longer for others.  </li>
            <li>very important for dry curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild and l did not think it cleaned enough because my hair looked greasy the day after I had just washed it.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair very well, but then again, nothing works on my knots.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t seem to get much benefit from this item though.</li>
            <li>They didnt do much for me</li>
            <li>but they might work really well for someone else.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product really helps restore my hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much improvement on my hair.</li>
            <li>I mainly used it when I travel</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have fine, long, and naturally blond hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in Cabo, and swim in the ocean a lot.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and shiny !</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I spent the most money I&#x27;ve ever spent for my hair on this product</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 all over, work it in and let it soak for a while, then apply Sebastian Wet gel before my hair is halfway dry.</li>
            <li> This company is very responsive and stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> and she said that this product made her hair a lot less dry and straw like.</li>

            <li> I based my purchase off the reviews and had to get it because I struggle with my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products that usually make my hair frizzy, feel heavy, dull the color.  </li>
            <li> Hsve forwarded this name brand to her in the past.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift to someone who, due to bad dyeing has broken hair, plus the fact she is losing it...</li>
            <li> My daughter had bad breakage and she used this along with the mizani overnight treatment and her hair is healthier with a lot less breakage.</li>
            <li> expensive, but i like to indulge once in a while, so i&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all and will not continue using it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after using this product.</li>

            <li> I have fine, long, and naturally blond hair.  I have tried a lot of products that usually make my hair frizzy, feel heavy, dull the color.  NOT WITH THESE PRODUCTS!      The first thing I tried was the leave-in conditioner (recomended by the worker at the beauty store I was at).  I wanted something for my hair in between washings because washing my hair everyday dries it out.  After using the leave-in conditioner once, my hair looked better that when I washed it.  A few months after using the product, I bought the shampoo and mask.      I have been using all 3 products now for about 2 months, and my hair has never been this healthy.  It&#x27;s soft, healthy, and my color has never looked better.  It&#x27;s a 10 does everything it says it does.  I recomend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> i love the mask, very moisturizing.  but i use a lot of product on my longer hair so a jar doesn&#x27;t last me long.  pretty expensive for the number of uses i get.  but i don&#x27;t think most people use and much conditioner as i do, so it&#x27;ll probably last longer for others.  it helps release tangles and smooth the cuticle layer very well.    the shampoo is pretty good...low lather, so i assume low or no sulfates.  very important for dry curly hair.  smells good too.  i&#x27;m planning on getting the daily conditioner to use in conjunction with the shampoo.    the leave-in is great.  doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair very well, but then again, nothing works on my knots.  that&#x27;s just the nature of my tons of fine textured curls...by the end of the day it&#x27;s literally tangled like dreadlocks underneath.  that being said, when i use It&#x27;s a 10, i don&#x27;t have to use a creamy leave-in conditioner along with it, which has always been a must for me.  i spray It&#x27;s a 10 all over, work it in and let it soak for a while, then apply Sebastian Wet gel before my hair is halfway dry. i seal it with a little Proclaim argan oil serum (you can get that at sally&#x27;s for under 8.00 and works much better than Moroccanoil at triple the price), then let it air dry the rest of the way and voila...it&#x27;s smooth, shiny, and soft, light and airy, but not flyaway, with just enough weight to keep fine hair under control.  i wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best leave-in i&#x27;ve ever used (that would probably be Kiehl&#x27;s formula 133), but for you lucky girls with normal hair, i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work much better for you than it does for me.    all-in-all, the It&#x27;s a 10 products are pretty good.  expensive, but i like to indulge once in a while, so i&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> these hair products deliver!! I have overprocessed thin, blonde hair and if these can make my hair more silky and manageable and full of body, well than I give it 5 stars!!!!</li>
            <li> Even though I have been using this product for a short time, I can already tell a difference in the condition of my hair.  Highly recommend It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Combination Set.</li>
            <li> Love the It&#x27;s a 10 products!! ALL of them.  Definitely a MUST if you are like me and get your hair colored once a month.  Very moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> this is the best hair product on the market today, I have thick, coarse, colored hair, and it makes it smooth, and soft, and so beautiful , people always say how much they love my hair, and its because of this product.</li>
            <li> This company is very responsive and stands behind their products. I Would buy from them again. thank you very much</li>
            <li> I liked the packaging for the products. I tend to have limp/oily hair. I didn&#x27;t seem to get much benefit from this item though. The products do smell good. They didnt do much for me but they might work really well for someone else. (Reviewed by my girlfriend)</li>
            <li> Product  came quick like promised and I love  this it&#x27;s a 10!! Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the lowest price I found on the web and in stores. My daughter had bad breakage and she used this along with the mizani overnight treatment and her hair is healthier with a lot less breakage. She has been using it about a week.</li>
            <li> Awesome results !  After many coloring and daily straightening... It made my hair soft and shiny ! Buy it for sure!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after using this product. It did nothing for my hair. Seemed like any other average shampoo. Not impressed at all and will not continue using it. Bought something else instead.</li>
            <li> Sent to my friend who is outside all the time and she said that this product made her hair a lot less dry and straw like. Great product!</li>
            <li> the hair mask should be called  it is an 11!!!!!!!i truly like the leave in and found the shampoo to be good also.</li>
            <li> This combination set was good for me price I mainly used it when I travel</li>
            <li> I use this product faithfully.  This was a gift to someone who, due to bad dyeing has broken hair, plus the fact she is losing it...Hsve forwarded this name brand to her in the past.  PLUS THE FACT YOUR PRICES CAN&#x27;T BE BEATTEN.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is the best ever.  The stylin lotion is very good, and the shampoo is okay.  I live in Cabo, and swim in the ocean a lot.  This product really helps restore my hair.</li>
            <li> I based my purchase off the reviews and had to get it because I struggle with my hair everyday. Unfortunately, I spent the most money I&#x27;ve ever spent for my hair on this product and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference compared to cheaper products.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it&#x27;s performance; however, if you tend to have more oily hair than I would not recommend the moisturizing shampoo.  It&#x27;s very mild and l did not think it cleaned enough because my hair looked greasy the day after I had just washed it.  The mask is great and the leave in conditioner is nice.  The shampoo would be great for someone with damaged and dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I didn&#x27;t see much improvement on my hair.</li>
