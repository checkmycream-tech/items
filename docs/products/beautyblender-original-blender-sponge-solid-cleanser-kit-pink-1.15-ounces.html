    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look airbrushed and flawless and it is the perfect way to blend out my under eye concealer (I use Maybelline&#x27;s Age Defy!).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can be used for both powder and liquid make-up, spreads evenly and flawlessly.</li>
            <li>The packaging was perfect and the boxes remained in tact through shipping.</li>
            <li>The cleanser does a superb job of thoroughly cleaning it out.</li>
            <li>Best beauty blender ever.</li>
            <li>The makeup looks flawless when I blend it all together with the BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What can be said about a beauty blender besides its perfect, wonderful, amazing, flawless and an absolute necessity!!!!</li>
            <li>Great price for two great products and no problems with shipping.</li>
            <li>I have never been so happy with a cosmetic applicator--</li>
            <li>My makeup looks great.</li>
            <li>Happy with this set.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>The beauty blender is amazing!</li>
            <li>Mine came packaged perfectly together in an adorable plastic, cylinder case (just as shown in picture).</li>
            <li>But this sponge has me wearing it 3 times a week because it looks so good.</li>
            <li>The pointy end is good to blend concealer, which I apply in the eye area, OVER foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happy with product and very happy with how fast shipping was!</li>
            <li>Love it, and this was a great price.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m so glad it does!</li>
            <li>I regret not having this tool for all the years that I&#x27;ve seen the magic it can create on your skin!</li>
            <li>I love the blending powder of this sponge!</li>
            <li>The sponge apples my Clinique like a dream, and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Amazing price for an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I would give 5 stars because the sponge itself is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It does amazing things with my makeup.</li>
            <li>Its amazing</li>
            <li>Best of all, it gives the skin a very natural look.</li>
            <li>I tried using mild face wash to clean the sponge, but it wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>Great deal for a first time user.</li>
            <li>I love the beauty blender, but I do think this is being misrepresented in the image.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>However, after using this I have to say I like the way my foundation applies much better.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t like Beauty Blender:)</li>
            <li>I love the finish that the beauty blender leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Many people here have no idea how to use this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this bender.</li>
            <li>Love it,  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This beauty blender applies my makeup in such a flawless way!</li>
            <li>The container was larger than I thought, and the beautyblender was perfectly packaged, and underneath is the FULL SIZED cleanser bar!</li>
            <li>#34;travel sized&amp;#34; but it would not be travel friendly, as noted in the description.</li>
            <li>this is the original one.</li>
            <li>It really is worth it!</li>
            <li>, you get the original BeautyBlender +</li>
            <li>This simply the most amazing make-up/beauty tool I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I guess part of me just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much money for a sponge while another part of me didn&#x27;t believe it would make a huge difference!  </li>
            <li>Prior to using the Beauty Blender I was using a Sigma F80 and loved it.</li>
            <li>Absolute must have for a smooth and precise application.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, very good to use in every single day.</li>
            <li>The solid bar is great to use with the BB (good spot clean for other brushes too but it isn&#x27;t a deep clean).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but this blends it so my face looks fresh and smooth for hours.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I wanted to  see if it was worth  trying before spending the money...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li>the rip won&#x27;t affect the usage of it right now ...</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Although just using it 1x, I strongly believe this will be my new go to foundation applicator.</li>
            <li>The full size solid, its like what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>but it may in the future if it rips any more</li>
            <li>I love the BeautyBlender sponges and I needed a solid cleanser.</li>
            <li>First you must soak it in water, and squeeze out excess water and use it when it&#x27;s damp.</li>
            <li>cost too much to be tearing at this point in time.</li>
            <li>It gives me more control  than any other applicator I have  ever  tried.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on brushes and really just want to throw most of them away</li>
            <li>and I have to say that it does live up to its hype!</li>
            <li>You need to wet it and towel dry it to see its real size (and to apply effectively and evenly).</li>
            <li>For fuller coverage, I guess you would have to spend a little more time.</li>
            <li>in my wrinkled areas giving my 54yr old face a much smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely In love, a little hard to explain why, but I know understand why people love it so much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my BB.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; has stopped that completely.  </li>
            <li>Natural makeup..</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sponge has to be completely saturated to plump up.</li>
            <li>I love that it came with the solid cleanser since brush cleansers can be too harsh on sponges.  </li>
            <li>Despite having heard tons of positive things about this little sponge, I was still reluctant to spend so much on a sponge.</li>
            <li>It is the normal, regular beauty blender and it does indeed come with the extraoap.</li>
            <li>There is something truly different about the composition of the sponge which makes it amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would buy the cleanser again (since it&#x27;s so expensive), but I heard that Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap from Target is a nice dupe.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim the other day after hearing countless positive reviews from friends and makeup artists.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is very helpful, and I would highly recommend getting at least one cleanser which will last you through several sponges.</li>

            <li> However, this product really has been unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> Well, I finally bit and bought one the other day</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike it the pink dye because who knows what chemicals were used and when I wash it, the pink comes out a bit.</li>
            <li> This is not a normal makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> It will sheer down the coverage though so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> the blender cleanser solid is travel sized, NOT full sized, and it did not come with a case, as pictured in the seller&#x27;s image.  </li>
            <li> The Beauty Blender makes it so easy to apply and never goes on too thick or too thin.  </li>
            <li> The sponge needs to be wet before applying makeup and this creates a dewy finish to your makeup that looks like everything was airbrushed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not buy any other cheaper ones on Amazon because pink water comes out when they soak it in water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they have started packaging these differently from when some of these reviews were written, but</li>
            <li> Downfall: I received an empty cleanser!</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel like actual skin instead of a heavy caked on makeup feeling!</li>
            <li> Just wet it down, wring it in a towel so its not soaking then press into skin.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing gets the sponge spotless like the solid cleansing bar.</li>
            <li> Love this, just wish it were a little less expensive!!</li>
            <li> You can use small amount that goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> All those nasty makeup brushes that never seem to get clean, this is your new lease on life.</li>
            <li> This solid cleanser and sponge was less expensive than the solid cleanser was by itself at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Helps give a less cakey look.</li>
            <li> to do the same job seemed ridiculous to me.</li>
            <li> Will no longer waste my $ on dupes.</li>
            <li> THIS little baby is a LIFE SAVER!</li>
            <li> You stipple with the round end, dab, dab, dab, delicately.</li>
            <li> I usually loathe having to augment a pricy purchase with accessories and cleaning stuff, but the cleansing bar rocks.</li>
            <li> I put this on my wish list and received as a gift as I had a hard time justifying the cost.</li>
            <li> I mean, come on, it&#x27;s a sponge</li>
            <li> I usually apply my makeup with my fingers so the thought of buying a sponge (that&#x27;s $17!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used very expensive brushes to blend my makeup only to eventually end up with creases in my makeup when it would settle throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> like seriously.</li>
            <li> I have always hated using sponges, but this is not like a normal make-up sponge.</li>
            <li> This is a beauty secret anyone can get their hands on.</li>
            <li> To the people that says this is expensive and complaining about the mini travel cleaner...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You must be silly if you pass this up.</li>
            <li> The foundation as the tendency to stain the sponge and can make it look dirty, while in actuality, you just cleaned it!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just purchased my 1st beauty blender! Absolutely In love, a little hard to explain why, but I know understand why people love it so much. You have to try for yourself. I&#x27;ve only been buying dupes but yes No comparison at all. Yes I feel it&#x27;s alittle expensive for a sponge, but it does the job a lot better than the dupes. Will no longer waste my $ on dupes.</li>
            <li> I NEVER leave product reviews.  However, this product really has been unbelievable!  I&#x27;ve always used very expensive brushes to blend my makeup only to eventually end up with creases in my makeup when it would settle throughout the day.  This &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; has stopped that completely.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but this blends it so my face looks fresh and smooth for hours.  I have no clue how it works.  But I&#x27;m so glad it does!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, very good to use in every single day.</li>
            <li> i like it.  the only thing is that after 3 uses it has a tiny tear in it. i may be cleaning it to rough.&lt;br /&gt;it cost too much to be tearing at this point in time. the rip won&#x27;t affect the usage of it right now ...but it may in the future if it rips any more</li>
            <li> I just received the bb this week! I absolutely love it!! Although just using it 1x, I strongly believe this will be my new go to foundation applicator.</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender, but I do think this is being misrepresented in the image.  I&#x27;m not sure if they have started packaging these differently from when some of these reviews were written, but the blender cleanser solid is travel sized, NOT full sized, and it did not come with a case, as pictured in the seller&#x27;s image.  This may be &amp;#34;travel sized&amp;#34; but it would not be travel friendly, as noted in the description.</li>
            <li> What can be said about a beauty blender besides its perfect, wonderful, amazing, flawless and an absolute necessity!!!! This is not a dupe and it is not a &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;travel sized&amp;#34; version... You need to wet it and towel dry it to see its real size (and to apply effectively and evenly). It is the normal, regular beauty blender and it does indeed come with the extraoap. Mine came packaged perfectly together in an adorable plastic, cylinder case (just as shown in picture). Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great price for two great products and no problems with shipping. I can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Despite having heard tons of positive things about this little sponge, I was still reluctant to spend so much on a sponge. I mean, come on, it&#x27;s a sponge right? Well, I finally bit and bought one the other day and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!! Prior to using the Beauty Blender I was using a Sigma F80 and loved it. However, after using this I have to say I like the way my foundation applies much better.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like Beauty Blender:)</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I have seen the Beauty Blender in all my trusted beauty tutorials on Youtube but I ended up procrastinating about buying it.  I guess part of me just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much money for a sponge while another part of me didn&#x27;t believe it would make a huge difference!  But it did!  I love the finish that the beauty blender leaves on my skin.  I use the Missha BB cream and it is a dewy type of formulation with medium coverage.  The Beauty Blender makes it so easy to apply and never goes on too thick or too thin.  It makes my skin look airbrushed and flawless and it is the perfect way to blend out my under eye concealer (I use Maybelline&#x27;s Age Defy!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, if you are having second thoughts about buying this, I would bat those thoughts away and click BUY!  I regret not having this tool for all the years that I&#x27;ve seen the magic it can create on your skin!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my BB. Love it, and this was a great price.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for an amazing product. I love the BeautyBlender sponges and I needed a solid cleanser. This solid cleanser and sponge was less expensive than the solid cleanser was by itself at Sephora.</li>
            <li> This simply the most amazing make-up/beauty tool I&#x27;ve ever used. I have always hated using sponges, but this is not like a normal make-up sponge. There is something truly different about the composition of the sponge which makes it amazingly soft. Can be used for both powder and liquid make-up, spreads evenly and flawlessly. Best of all, it gives the skin a very natural look. For fuller coverage, I guess you would have to spend a little more time. It&#x27;s really worth every penny. I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on brushes and really just want to throw most of them away now.&lt;br /&gt;The product came just as it is shown in the picture. The packaging was perfect and the boxes remained in tact through shipping. The cleanser is very helpful, and I would highly recommend getting at least one cleanser which will last you through several sponges. I tried using mild face wash to clean the sponge, but it wasn&#x27;t very good. The cleanser does a superb job of thoroughly cleaning it out.</li>
            <li> Absolute must have for a smooth and precise application. This is a beauty secret anyone can get their hands on. A+ all the way!</li>
            <li> Many people here have no idea how to use this. If you read the instructions. First you must soak it in water, and squeeze out excess water and use it when it&#x27;s damp. To the people that says its tiny.. When you soak it in water the blender becomes twice the size!!! this is the original one. Do not buy any other cheaper ones on Amazon because pink water comes out when they soak it in water. To the people that says this is expensive and complaining about the mini travel cleaner... At Nordstrom they sell this for $20 plus $15 for same size cleaner.. You are basically saving $10 bucks plus shipping cost. Anyways.. I recommend this to anybody that likes shading... Natural makeup.. You can use small amount that goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I love the blending powder of this sponge! Just wet it down, wring it in a towel so its not soaking then press into skin. Helps give a less cakey look. It will sheer down the coverage though so keep that in mind. The only thing I dislike it the pink dye because who knows what chemicals were used and when I wash it, the pink comes out a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim the other day after hearing countless positive reviews from friends and makeup artists. I usually apply my makeup with my fingers so the thought of buying a sponge (that&#x27;s $17!) to do the same job seemed ridiculous to me. However, I tried it out and I have to say that it does live up to its hype! The sponge needs to be wet before applying makeup and this creates a dewy finish to your makeup that looks like everything was airbrushed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I got this version with the solid cleanser because cleaning the sponge is definitely difficult. The foundation as the tendency to stain the sponge and can make it look dirty, while in actuality, you just cleaned it! I don&#x27;t know if I would buy the cleanser again (since it&#x27;s so expensive), but I heard that Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap from Target is a nice dupe.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars because the sponge itself is AMAZING. like seriously. I almost never wear makeup. But this sponge has me wearing it 3 times a week because it looks so good. Downfall: I received an empty cleanser! It must&#x27;ve been a factory error and seller did not respond.</li>
            <li> THIS little baby is a LIFE SAVER! I ordered it, and it was at my doorstep in 2 days, packaged in a big box with bubble wrap. The container was larger than I thought, and the beautyblender was perfectly packaged, and underneath is the FULL SIZED cleanser bar! The sponge apples my Clinique like a dream, and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I put this on my wish list and received as a gift as I had a hard time justifying the cost. I understand the excitement around the BeautyBlender sponge now. IF you make the time in your routine, you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge has to be completely saturated to plump up. I use it with my liquid foundation the same way you would a brush. You stipple with the round end, dab, dab, dab, delicately. The pointy end is good to blend concealer, which I apply in the eye area, OVER foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to commit to a $20 beauty sponge, pony up for the solid cleanser too and you can use it for up to a year. Nothing, and I mean nothing gets the sponge spotless like the solid cleansing bar. I usually loathe having to augment a pricy purchase with accessories and cleaning stuff, but the cleansing bar rocks. All those nasty makeup brushes that never seem to get clean, this is your new lease on life.</li>
            <li> Great...comes in hsndy</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this bender. It gives me more control  than any other applicator I have  ever  tried.  I don&#x27;t end up with excess foundation  in my wrinkled areas giving my 54yr old face a much smoother appearance.  I checked it out on several utube videos before purchasing becauce I wanted to  see if it was worth  trying before spending the money...it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Love this, just wish it were a little less expensive!!</li>
            <li> This is not a normal makeup sponge. It does amazing things with my makeup. I have never been so happy with a cosmetic applicator--be it a different type of sponge or part of my MAC brush collection. This trumps all!</li>
            <li> It really is worth it! I held out for a while because I did want to pay the price but now I can&#x27;t stop using it. My makeup looks great.</li>
            <li> This made me question all my foundation brush purchases. The beauty blender is amazing! The solid bar is great to use with the BB (good spot clean for other brushes too but it isn&#x27;t a deep clean).</li>
            <li> Love it,  just hope that it last awhile,  seeing how it is pricey.</li>
            <li> Best beauty blender ever. Love it</li>
            <li> Beauty Blender&#x3D;Holy Grail Product. This was a repurchase. Happy with product and very happy with how fast shipping was!</li>
            <li> Happy with this set. You basically are saving 10$+ with this set. Its amazing, you get the original BeautyBlender + The full size solid, its like what more can you ask for? The BB works wonders, I use it with the Kat Von D Lock-It Tattoo Foundation and NYX Cosmetic HD Concealer wands for Contour and Highlight. The makeup looks flawless when I blend it all together with the BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must be silly if you pass this up.</li>
            <li> This beauty blender applies my makeup in such a flawless way! It makes my face feel like actual skin instead of a heavy caked on makeup feeling! I love that it came with the solid cleanser since brush cleansers can be too harsh on sponges.  Great deal for a first time user.</li>
