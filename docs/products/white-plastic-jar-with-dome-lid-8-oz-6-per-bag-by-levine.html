            <li>Love the jars.</li>
            <li>If you make your favorite body scrub or moisturizer and want to give it as a gift.  </li>
            <li>They should have added more protection for shipping or something.</li>
            <li>I bought them to mix my own lotions and rubs and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and worked great for scrubs and beauty products for mothers day baskets and gifts no complaints and would order again</li>
            <li>nice containers  and good looking very practical.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfectly for that, and I expect could have many other uses too.</li>
            <li>Great plastic jars, I use them to put my shea butter mixes for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>These containers are very large and nicely made.  </li>
            <li>I bought other jars for my creams but this is the best!</li>
            <li>Labels adhere easily &amp; they stack well.</li>
            <li>They could be easily decorated.</li>
            <li>It was a huge pain to unwrap them and to rip off the tape from each of the 6 jars.</li>
            <li>I am making body butters this Christmas and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>The tops fit well</li>
            <li>and I feel secure using them.</li>
            <li>I thought these were great jars, and they may be for dry product, but I make salt scrubs to sell.  </li>
            <li>These are the perfect size for homemade body butters that I have started to make for myself and some friends with extremely dry skin that is very sensitive too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use these for gifts, once I design some cool labels.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and nothing was damaged or scratched.</li>
            <li>The jars are just what I needed, and I&#x27;ve already filled them with my handmade lotion ready to give away.</li>
            <li>They are just the right size, will be giving as gifts</li>
            <li>They came right on time as estimated.</li>
            <li>They seem to be pretty airtight and leakproof, overall I was pleased.</li>
            <li>I not only love these jars because I can make my body care products and take them into the shower without fear of breaking.</li>
            <li>Definitely returning for more jars and bottles for my skin care business</li>
            <li>Like them, and will be ordering more, and in different sizes.</li>
            <li>They look very professional, they will make my gifts look special.</li>
            <li>fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy jars.</li>
            <li>and they work really well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>However, I am compelled to give a 2/5 for the whole &#x27;ordering experience&#x27; because the way these came packaged were illogical.</li>
            <li>Yes  it is true about the packaging leaving sticky residue on the containers, but it really didn&#x27;t take too long for me to get the residue off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>also, the jars are not double-walled like I normally use</li>
            <li>I was looking for a simple jar to put my shea butter in and when these arrived they were better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>They are actually sort of pretty.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as advertised - white plastic jars with dome lids.</li>
            <li>Lids secure tightly and they look exactly like the body lotion tubs you would get from a commercial store.</li>
            <li>I have used these a couple times so far</li>
            <li>Good product besides the weird ammonia smell when I opened the jars.</li>
            <li>Will have to cool the salve a little before adding to prevent melting.</li>
            <li>They were wrapped in what seemed like 5 miles of clear packaging tape around the actual jars.</li>

            <li> They were wrapped in what seemed like 5 miles of clear packaging tape around the actual jars.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it left a horrible sticky residue that took a lot of work to clean.</li>
            <li> I knew this going in, but I wanted to get rid of the gross sticky residue so desperately that mucking up the finish of the jars was ok.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that the base has two parts that seem like they could come apart, so after washing you need to make sure water didn&#x27;t get trapped in between the layers of plastic.</li>
            <li> They are not as thick as i thought they would be, but thats no big deal for me.</li>
            <li> The lid stays on there and there isn&#x27;t any leakage on the side when it&#x27;s upside down or knocked over</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll want to decorate them or consider something a little fancier.</li>
            <li> wrap plastic over them so there isn&#x27;t residue left behind.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s from being made or what, but dish soap and water got rid of it.</li>
            <li> I read a few comments on how it was packaged, mine arrived neatly in a cellophane bag, no tape!</li>
            <li> These jars are very plain, so if you&#x27;re selling or giving as gifts</li>
            <li> I do understand that the cold weather makes plastic fragile.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the other 4 will probably not be used because I don&#x27;t feel like spending 2 hours of my life cleaning them off.</li>
            <li> And the packaging was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Some of the containers were a little dirty.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed by that.</li>
            <li> Just really incredibly awfully annoying.  </li>

            <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li> I made my own whipped lotion and put them in here. One batch used 5 of the containers, so I like how big they are. Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my home made bath scrub</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my needs, great packaging, functional and stylish container.</li>

            <li> I received the 4oz jars, not the 8 oz. also, the jars are not double-walled like I normally use so I was disappointed by that. they did come with a lid under the dome lid for better protection against spillage or contamination if shipping.&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to receive them because they came from outside the U.S. and I didn&#x27;t notice that when I ordered them... or the fact that they were single-wall. I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> I am making body butters this Christmas and these fit the bill.They look very professional, they will make my gifts look special.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making homemade lotion&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> They worked very well and were very attractive.  I am glad I ordered them.  I will order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for homemade body butters that I have started to make for myself and some friends with extremely dry skin that is very sensitive too.</li>
            <li> I got this to put homemade lotion in to give as gifts. They work nicely and have a nice weight and feel to them. They seem to be pretty airtight and leakproof, overall I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Well made plastic jars with lids to share coconut oil with family.</li>
            <li> Good product besides the weird ammonia smell when I opened the jars. Not sure if that&#x27;s from being made or what, but dish soap and water got rid of it.</li>
            <li> Used these to gift my DIY products. Very sturdy jars. Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These containers are very large and nicely made.  I am very impressed with the quality of the container.  I would recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> I made a shea butter recipe and used these jars to store it. It works like any jar I suppose.</li>
            <li> Some of the containers were a little dirty. And the packaging was ridiculous. But the quality of the container seems good and I&#x27;ll just run them through the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> Perfect, sturdy easy to fill. Labels adhere easily &amp; they stack well. Got these for hand made lotion &amp; they work well for that.</li>
            <li> These are great jars to store my home made body butter in.  They are just the right size, will be giving as gifts so Im sure I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I bought other jars for my creams but this is the best! It&#x27;s big and sturdy. I pour in my homemade creams while still alittle warm but these don&#x27;t warp. I also used this when I make facial astringents for my kids and it works great! I wish I had purchased more!!!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for to put some cream that I make into. They are actually sort of pretty. They could be easily decorated.</li>
            <li> Bought these plastic jars to fill with homemade lotion.  They are lovely, really perfect for that purpose.  However, the jars are all taped together in a bundle of 6 with what looked like packaging tape.  Removing them from the tape left sticky residue on the jars that I had to sit and rub off with a towel and oil for 20 minutes.  Just really incredibly awfully annoying.  I love these jars, but I will look for another seller so I don&#x27;t have to rub that adhesive off again.  Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!</li>
            <li> Great product! Will be perfect for putting in my homemade lotions and body scrub. Lids secure tightly and they look exactly like the body lotion tubs you would get from a commercial store. A great find!</li>
            <li> I am using these jars for my line of skin care products. Perfect size and the quality is outstanding! I will definitely order this product again.</li>

            <li> Love the jars. They came right on time as estimated. Definitely returning for more jars and bottles for my skin care business</li>

            <li> The jars are just what I needed, and I&#x27;ve already filled them with my handmade lotion ready to give away.</li>
            <li> This is a great size. I use them for home made lotion &amp; creams. Didn&#x27;t need six but gave some as gifts.</li>
            <li> If you make your favorite body scrub or moisturizer and want to give it as a gift.  These make it a real present for your friends !</li>
            <li> Mine are perfect. I read a few comments on how it was packaged, mine arrived neatly in a cellophane bag, no tape! Will be using them for my whipped body butters, and salves. They are not as thick as i thought they would be, but thats no big deal for me. Will have to cool the salve a little before adding to prevent melting.</li>
            <li> I bought these to put homemade sugar scrub and body butter in. Lots of people use glass jars, but I don&#x27;t want glass in the shower with me! These jars are very plain, so if you&#x27;re selling or giving as gifts you&#x27;ll want to decorate them or consider something a little fancier. My only concern is that the base has two parts that seem like they could come apart, so after washing you need to make sure water didn&#x27;t get trapped in between the layers of plastic. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The jars were to pack the homemade moisturizer cream that I mix together.  Perfect size and fit for bedside chest.</li>
            <li> Jars comes with lid and perfect for cremes</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Perfect for homemade lotions and scrubs.</li>
            <li> Two of mine leaked from the bottom. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> nice containers  and good looking very practical.  Like them, and will be ordering more, and in different sizes. .hank you Sarah</li>
            <li> Theses arrived to me with one of them in the box shattered. I was very surprised. The package itself was not damaged, only the product. I do understand that the cold weather makes plastic fragile. They should have added more protection for shipping or something. I am returning them and looking someplace local for my jars instead.</li>
            <li> Nice jars for storing body butter.</li>
            <li> These jars are perfect! They are made well and you can use them for just about anything. I bought them to mix my own lotions and rubs and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I make my own whipped shea butter and I store it in these containers. Works great for me.</li>
            <li> Got these for cocoa butter. Ended up also using them for a salt and olive oil scrub, and for zinc powder. They&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> I used to these to contain my homemade body lotions for Christmas gifts.  A great hit with all the ladies!</li>
            <li> I really hate to give this product such a low rating, as the product itself was great. They are exactly as advertised - white plastic jars with dome lids. I would give the actual product itself a 4/5. However, I am compelled to give a 2/5 for the whole &#x27;ordering experience&#x27; because the way these came packaged were illogical. They were wrapped in what seemed like 5 miles of clear packaging tape around the actual jars. I don&#x27;t understand this method. It was a huge pain to unwrap them and to rip off the tape from each of the 6 jars. On top of that, it left a horrible sticky residue that took a lot of work to clean. I&#x27;m talking 30 minutes per jar of rubbing with olive oil. Even that didn&#x27;t work so I had to bring out acetone and as you know, acetone messes up plastic. I knew this going in, but I wanted to get rid of the gross sticky residue so desperately that mucking up the finish of the jars was ok. I&#x27;m just baffled why anybody would think packaging them this way would be a good idea. Perhaps if they must be taped together, maybe there should be a layer of shrink wrap plastic over them so there isn&#x27;t residue left behind. I find myself not using these jars for the intended use (to store homemade body butter) because I don&#x27;t want to spend the time cleaning off the jars of residue. I did clean off two with great difficulty, so I&#x27;ll just cycle through those two. Sadly, the other 4 will probably not be used because I don&#x27;t feel like spending 2 hours of my life cleaning them off.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy jar which is reusable.  Just what I wanted, just what I got.  May be larger than I need, but it was what I ordered.  Use for homemade creams.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.. they were perfit</li>
            <li> I used these jars for some creams and homemade bath stuff I do myself. Worked perfectly for that, and I expect could have many other uses too.</li>
            <li> Yes  it is true about the packaging leaving sticky residue on the containers, but it really didn&#x27;t take too long for me to get the residue off. Great product for the price and does exactly what i need them to do.</li>
            <li> Great quality jars.  Serves the purpose of what I needed them for.  All of the lids close perfectly and it is very easy to open and close.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Very nice for my salt scrub</li>
            <li> I thought these were great jars, and they may be for dry product, but I make salt scrubs to sell.  These would always leak the oil from the scrubs.  Even if I put a plastic wrap around the inside of the jar, or tape around the outside rim, before shipping.  I have started using another jar that does not leak.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and worked great for scrubs and beauty products for mothers day baskets and gifts no complaints and would order again</li>
            <li> Perfect for my homemade salt scrubs.</li>
