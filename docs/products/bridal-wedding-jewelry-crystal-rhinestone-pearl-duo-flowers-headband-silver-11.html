            <li>Beautiful wow would buy again!</li>
            <li>Very elegant and not too much...</li>
            <li>I thought it would look more bold than it ended up looking.</li>
            <li>looks cheap.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my daughter for Prom and it fit well and was comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely smaller than it appears in the picture but was perfect for my 9 yr old daughter&#x27;s flower girl dress.</li>
            <li>She has short hair and it really looked great.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The band is very rigid and strong.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Very attractive, but to tight for adult head.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this looked amazing for my wedding.</li>
            <li>Runs small, fits my 5.5 yr old granddaughter perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delicate but beautiful.</li>
            <li>So pretty on.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>I do not have an unusually large head.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty, but maybe for a young girl or flower girl, not the bride.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made hair band.</li>
            <li>I really like this headband.  </li>
            <li>The jewel piece sits too high for what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>Head size is normal.</li>
            <li>But, the metal corners were digging into my head and gave me a huge head ache after a few hours.</li>
            <li>It is much, much easier to use since it is a hair band unlike similar pieces which have to be bobby pinned into place.</li>
            <li>Might not be the substantial piece a bride or adult may be looking for.</li>
            <li>The decorative piece of this is a lot smaller in real life.</li>
            <li>Stone area is smaller then I expected but very pretty.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and looks just like the picture.</li>

            <li> Loved it! It was perfect on my head... Very elegant and not too much...</li>
            <li> looks cheap. fits tight behind the ears.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wedding and decided not to wear it due to it being so tight on my head. The metal sides poked into my head.</li>
            <li> Love my head piece! Didn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg to buy...  But was still beautiful!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, just not what I was looking for. The jewel piece sits too high for what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my daughter for Prom and it fit well and was comfortable. She has short hair and it really looked great.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made hair band. It&#x27;s delicate but beautiful. It looks almost like a vintage piece. It is much, much easier to use since it is a hair band unlike similar pieces which have to be bobby pinned into place. It&#x27;s definitely smaller than it appears in the picture but was perfect for my 9 yr old daughter&#x27;s flower girl dress. Might not be the substantial piece a bride or adult may be looking for.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Received item looking perfectly as described. Fits perfectly and comfortablly.</li>
            <li> So pretty on. Perfect with pearls.</li>
            <li> Very attractive, but to tight for adult head. I do not have an unusually large head. Head size is normal.</li>
            <li> Beautiful headpiece...thanks!</li>
            <li> Beautiful. GD wore it to Gatsby theme prom.</li>
            <li> Broke while putting in my hair for my wedding</li>
            <li> Beautiful headpiece. Very lovely and didn&#x27;t pinch my head.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL! Got it for my sister&#x27;s wedding and it was just perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Runs small, fits my 5.5 yr old granddaughter perfectly.</li>
            <li> Looks gorgeous and fits well.</li>
            <li> Used for my wedding. It looked great with my up-do. One of the pearls did fall out as soon as I opened it but you couldn&#x27;t tell. I&#x27;d buy if you&#x27;re looking for an accent piece.</li>
            <li> The band is very rigid and strong. I got a lot of compliments on it. For the price, I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this looked amazing for my wedding. But, the metal corners were digging into my head and gave me a huge head ache after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wow would buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like this headband.  Goes great with anything that I wear !  Thank You</li>
            <li> Stone area is smaller then I expected but very pretty.</li>
            <li> I purchased this headband for my wedding and it was exactly what I wanted! It was beautiful!</li>
            <li> The picture is a bit deceiving.  The decorative piece is smaller than it appears in the picture.  It is very pretty, but maybe for a young girl or flower girl, not the bride.</li>
            <li> The decorative piece of this is a lot smaller in real life. I thought it would look more bold than it ended up looking.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and looks just like the picture. So pretty.</li>
