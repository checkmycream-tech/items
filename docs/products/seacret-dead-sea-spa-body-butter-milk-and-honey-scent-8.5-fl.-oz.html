    <ol>
            <li> Probably the softest my hands have ever felt after using a lotion/cream.  I used in tandem with the Seacret Milk and Honey Salt Scrub and yes indeed, I am a fan.  I&#x27;ve moved my other lotions back and put this puppy up front.  The scent is fresh and perfect for summer...It&#x27;s my new go to.  Gorgeous You! delivered as promised...won&#x27;t hesitate to shop there again.</li>
            <li> The smell is glorious. Think sweet ocean breeze, and a whiff of honey~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A translated ingredient list looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;Water, shea butter, skin softeners, beeswax, emulsifiers, cocoa butter, milk sugar *gluconolactone*, olive fruit extract, dead sea salt, essential oils and fruit extracts, honey, and finally a few chemicals that add scent, emulsify, and protect the skin from UV rays. The actual ingredient is pretty long, and has chemicals. If the ingredients doesn&#x27;t scare you, give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long, LONG way, and this product is also paraben free!</li>
            <li> This product works great along with the seacret oil and salt scrub! Doing this once a week helps keep your skin looking and feeling soft and silky smooth!</li>

            <li> I purchased this product in a store once and absolutely loved it! The very mild scent was amazing. This product is very similar in the way it soaks into my skin, but the scent doesn&#x27;t match. It is in a different container, they must have changed the formula. It smells OK, whereas the old formula smelled amazing - not perfumey - natural and light. Oh well.</li>
            <li> this is what a cream suppose to be like. It Is the best cream I have ever tried. My babies are seacret babies. This is the only product that my daughter does best for her sensitive skin, she used to break out with eczema. Not any more. Found my secret, seacret products.</li>
