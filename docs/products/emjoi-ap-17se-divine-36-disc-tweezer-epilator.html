    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have used this product for some months and it was just perfect till I started having lots of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>It comes with a shaver and exfoliating attachment, which make it so wonderfully multi-purpose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t have to bother carrying a razor or shaving cream around, deal with soap or water, or fuss with at-home waxing kits (or pay a bunch of money to get it done!!!)  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect answer.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>and I love the color :D    </li>
            <li>and then im good for a a week or two.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered this from Amazon, It works really good, muuuuch faster and easier to use that braun one.</li>
            <li>This is sooo good</li>
            <li>but since then it&#x27;s been fairly painless.  </li>
            <li>Aside from not being able to use this in the shower, its been working great.  </li>
            <li>or i deside to spend alot more money on a NONO!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m totally satisfied!</li>
            <li>A much better alternative than waxing or tweezers!</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great, cleans up easily and has kept a charge for weeks.</li>
            <li>It works amazing.</li>
            <li>This epilator works amazing for everything except my legs.</li>
            <li>Purchased this because I liked the idea of not being glued to a wall socket.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose the Emjoi because the attachments and accessories are really nice.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>sure, there&#x27;s time, effort and discomfort involved, but afterward, I feel so cleansed - kind of like how I feel after taking a satisfying dump.  </li>
            <li>and it took maybe 30 seconds before I just couldn&#x27;t handle any more.  </li>
            <li>I do wish I could use it more often and in more places...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d read the reviews before buying it, so I should have known better, but I figured I would be the exception and it would work.</li>
            <li>It is not, which is okay, but in case anyone else came across this during a search, I wanted to inform.  </li>
            <li>Well, I wasn&#x27;t about to give Epilady any more of my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using until something better comes along</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use that any more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a 3.5 star because it is better than shaving</li>
            <li>I do love that you can charge it</li>
            <li>I do love the color</li>
            <li>Excellent price considering all of the above.    </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Its much better just read the reviews and you will agree.</li>
            <li>Assuming I test more with the epilator attachment, I&#x27;ll add to this review.  </li>
            <li>Love this&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>but it gets better with time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>So easy.  </li>
            <li>I tried the razor just to see how it worked and it seemed fine as well.  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the attachments.  </li>
            <li>And then you&#x27;re smooth for weeks to come.</li>
            <li>The razor cleans up anything you might have missed and the buffer makes the skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very ergonomical - it fits nicely in my hand</li>
            <li>What bugs me about all these epilator brands is their claims about legs being smooth for 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Basically, I&#x27;m happy because of the above statement...</li>
            <li>It leaves a comfortable, smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>It takes a lot of time to get my legs completely smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and not a painful as you might think.  </li>
            <li>It can be used successfully on any type of hair, coarse or fine.  </li>
            <li>Though I do love my epilator very very much.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I even got another one for my daughter which she also loves it, I recommended it very much.</li>
            <li>I suggest not making the same mistake :P</li>
            <li>Try waxing or threading instead (or let me know if you find a *good* hand-held product!)</li>
            <li>But in-growns are an issue, so definitely use this with good exfoliation, and also with an after-shave serum designed to eliminate ingrown hairs.    </li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m lucky.</li>
            <li>I was going to just replace the head, but for $10 more I bought a new one.  </li>
            <li>True, it hurts at first.</li>
            <li>The original (came out many, many years ago, and while it lasted many years, it finally broke down and needed replacement)</li>
            <li>The exfoliation attachment removed the dry skin from my arm nicely without irritation so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>When I work up enough courage to do my arms, I love the finished product</li>
            <li>My first gave me ZERO ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>My last Emjoi lasted for many years, so I decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to finally have an epilator again...</li>
            <li>The first one I bought while living in California &amp; have had it over 15 years</li>
            <li>All in all its the best product I have tried, but its not perfect.  </li>
            <li>Till now (after two years) I couldn&#x27;t  stop having ingrowns, I used many different products, saw a doctor...</li>
            <li>It did hurt to use it the first time, probably becasue</li>
            <li>I have been able to cut back on the amount of time I spend on hair removal on my legs and face.  </li>
            <li>it stopped working after 5 minutes and when i tried to charge at first</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this Epilator instead get the Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover!!!!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions consistently for several months, didn&#x27;t see much of an improvement at all, and the Emjoi hurt more than anything</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to wait for a bunch of hair to grow to a certain length to use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy and fast to use and is the same as shaving with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mainly waxed the armpit area, so I&#x27;m interested to see the pros/cons between waxing and using the epilator.</li>
            <li>At the wrist and smushy parts are absolutely unbearable.  </li>
            <li>Very displeased.</li>
            <li>Mine only stay smooth from epilation for one week,</li>
            <li>Cleans hair very well</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that the exfoliator attachment really does much, but I like the razor attachment.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tested the epilator attachment yet though.  </li>
            <li>I bought the original model Epilady back in 1989.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with the return thinking it would operate fine so long as I kept the device plugged in.  </li>
            <li>The shaver gets the few hairs I miss and makes my arms super smooth along with the buffer.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it completely ripped out my hair like a lawn mower.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to keep buying razors that can get expensive but not as awesome as advertised; results vary differently for each person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though my main interest was the shaver/trimmer attachment, since this unit had the epilator attachment, I figured what the heck.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely wasn&#x27;t worth my money.</li>
            <li>Throwing in the towel and purchasing a new epilator.</li>
            <li>However with time, noticed around 8 months, the epilator does not go as fast and catches less hair so will have to go over it many times in different directions.</li>
            <li>I tested the epilator on my legs, which I&#x27;ve never done before and didn&#x27;t get very far because of the pain (which will decrease with time, but I haven&#x27;t gotten there yet).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light torn on then went down and stopped charging.</li>
            <li>This one, wider is a bit more difficult for bikini area, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>works very well feet look different after 2 times</li>
            <li>So, all this time, I&#x27;d been shaving my legs and pits, and I got fed up with all the stubble and having to do it so frequently.  </li>
            <li>frequently can cause ingrown..</li>
            <li>Out of all the heads, I only use the tweezer and then the electronic razor to catch anything I miss because the epilator can take about 10 minutes each leg to really get everything visible.</li>
            <li>Works as well as I remember my old one working</li>
            <li>I returned it and bought instead the Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover</li>
            <li>the first time and second time I tried it and my leg was so irritated and red</li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s a light color, (shows) can get dirty easily.</li>
            <li>I have a higher tolerance for pain but obviously not high enough.  </li>
            <li>It is not overly loud, and it works on very short hairs.</li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks of law mowing action my epilator just suddenly stopped pulling out hair like it used to.</li>
            <li>I have only tried the epilation head so far, not the razor head or the exfoliator head.  </li>
            <li>I love it and for less than the price of one round of waxing, I&#x27;d take it every time.</li>
            <li>This one, however is better for larger areas, such as legs, because the dolphin is rather narrow that it takes a long time to cover larger areas.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem to be as painful as my older model and it fits nicely into my hand.</li>

            <li> works very well feet look different after 2 times</li>
            <li> So, all this time, I&#x27;d been shaving my legs and pits, and I got fed up with all the stubble and having to do it so frequently.  </li>
            <li> frequently can cause ingrown..</li>
            <li> Out of all the heads, I only use the tweezer and then the electronic razor to catch anything I miss because the epilator can take about 10 minutes each leg to really get everything visible.</li>
            <li> Works as well as I remember my old one working</li>
            <li> I returned it and bought instead the Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover</li>
            <li> the first time and second time I tried it and my leg was so irritated and red</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s a light color, (shows) can get dirty easily.</li>
            <li> I have a higher tolerance for pain but obviously not high enough.  </li>
            <li> It is not overly loud, and it works on very short hairs.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of law mowing action my epilator just suddenly stopped pulling out hair like it used to.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the epilation head so far, not the razor head or the exfoliator head.  </li>
            <li> I love it and for less than the price of one round of waxing, I&#x27;d take it every time.</li>
            <li> This one, however is better for larger areas, such as legs, because the dolphin is rather narrow that it takes a long time to cover larger areas.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem to be as painful as my older model and it fits nicely into my hand.</li>
            <li> I did a little testing on my forearm, and it seemed to work, but mainly I bought it for the shaver/trimmer attachment for the armpit area.  </li>
            <li> The reason being is that just 3 weeks after purchasing this item it has slowed down considerably.</li>
            <li> Although I want to give it 4 stars for its initial performance, the longevity of the product deserves absolutely no stars at all.</li>
            <li> it had been so long since I&#x27;d done it,</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worse or better.  </li>
            <li> Instead of seeing stubble on the 3rd day after shaving and perhaps waiting until a five days to a week to shave again, I can hold off epilating until a week for some stubble and one and a half to two weeks to finally do the deed again, if lazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doing my armpits are great though and less painful!</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator (I blew the first one plugging it into a wall socket with wrong voltage).</li>
            <li> Actually mine are usually gone by the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my legs for years (actually it&#x27;s a thick sugar solution) and now some hair are coming in too thin and fine to wax.  </li>
            <li> I can only use this on my arms and even then I&#x27;m literally shaking and crying.  </li>
            <li> It is for the people who only want to remove hair once every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was left with red bumpy skin and with hairs left behind.</li>
            <li> Then, a few years later, I bought another one, same model, and let&#x27;s just say that they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em the way they used to - it crapped out within a few months!  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, dark and deeply rooted hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands &amp; they just don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I admit, it did hurt at first but the second time wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse thick hair, like I do I would recommend a stronger epilator.</li>
            <li> , less black (if hair leg is black), and SPARSER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gentler than the previous model I had.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this has happened with any other purchasers of this product.</li>
            <li> I remove hair once, a few hairs break off, it misses a few, but gets the majority.  </li>
            <li> I do seem to get quite a few ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I had an epilator for a few years and lost it.</li>
            <li> It is quite painful at first</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much hair on my legs, so I used to use tweezers, and that was painful.</li>
            <li> but think i wouldnt if i used the exfoilator pad with it like it says too, but im lazy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They have very few hairs every week - just maintaining a hair here and there - cldnt be happier&lt;</li>
            <li> leaving me with missed areas, ingrown hairs, stubby legs and very uncomfortable skin in general.</li>
            <li> This was my first Epilator and hated it.</li>
            <li> It looks like that may be the weak link for this epilator.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, and you do get used to how it feels, but not for the weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried waxing or any other form of painful hair removal</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not remove hair well enough and re-do same areas 3 time in one month.  I also am finding the charger is not working.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, dark and deeply rooted hairs.  THIS THING HURTS!  I&#x27;ve never tried waxing or any other form of painful hair removal so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worse or better.  I can only use this on my arms and even then I&#x27;m literally shaking and crying.  I have a higher tolerance for pain but obviously not high enough.  At the wrist and smushy parts are absolutely unbearable.  I tried using it on my legs once and it took maybe 30 seconds before I just couldn&#x27;t handle any more.  When I work up enough courage to do my arms, I love the finished product and I really enjoy the attachments.  The shaver gets the few hairs I miss and makes my arms super smooth along with the buffer.  I do wish I could use it more often and in more places...ps under the arms is impossible for me.</li>
            <li> Got this for the wifey, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I liked the idea of not being glued to a wall socket. Found out almost immediately the power level is drastically lower when not plugged in, and thus does not epilate properly. I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with the return thinking it would operate fine so long as I kept the device plugged in.  This is my second epilator (I blew the first one plugging it into a wall socket with wrong voltage). My first gave me ZERO ingrown hairs. This one gives me a smattering of ingrown hairs after each run through. Throwing in the towel and purchasing a new epilator.</li>
            <li> This product definitely wasn&#x27;t worth my money. I followed the directions consistently for several months, didn&#x27;t see much of an improvement at all, and the Emjoi hurt more than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read the reviews before buying it, so I should have known better, but I figured I would be the exception and it would work. I suggest not making the same mistake :P Try waxing or threading instead (or let me know if you find a *good* hand-held product!)</li>
            <li> This product appeared when I searched for wet/dry female trimmers/shavers and I never double checked to see if it was a wet/dry trimmer.  It is not, which is okay, but in case anyone else came across this during a search, I wanted to inform.  Aside from not being able to use this in the shower, its been working great.  I tested the epilator on my legs, which I&#x27;ve never done before and didn&#x27;t get very far because of the pain (which will decrease with time, but I haven&#x27;t gotten there yet).  The trimmer works great, cleans up easily and has kept a charge for weeks.</li>
            <li> works very well feet look different after 2 times</li>
            <li> My last Emjoi lasted for many years, so I decided to give this one a try.  It is not overly loud, and it works on very short hairs. It does not seem to be as painful as my older model and it fits nicely into my hand. I tried the razor just to see how it worked and it seemed fine as well.  The exfoliation attachment removed the dry skin from my arm nicely without irritation so I will continue to use it. My only concern is the gear that spins the heads is a tiny plastic thing. It looks like that may be the weak link for this epilator.</li>
            <li> I tried the Panasonic epilator and it did not even compare to this one. True, it hurts at first. After a couple strokes you start to get immune to it. And then you&#x27;re smooth for weeks to come. I love it and for less than the price of one round of waxing, I&#x27;d take it every time. The razor cleans up anything you might have missed and the buffer makes the skin so smooth. I just use some Sally Hansen no bumps gel afterwards and within a day or so all the bumps are gone too. Actually mine are usually gone by the next morning. Great product.</li>
            <li> Though I do love my epilator very very much. I must give it 3 stars. The reason being is that just 3 weeks after purchasing this item it has slowed down considerably. The first time I used it, it completely ripped out my hair like a lawn mower. I admit, it did hurt at first but the second time wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Around the knees still hurt for me. After about 3 weeks of law mowing action my epilator just suddenly stopped pulling out hair like it used to. leaving me with missed areas, ingrown hairs, stubby legs and very uncomfortable skin in general. I am not sure if this has happened with any other purchasers of this product. Although I want to give it 4 stars for its initial performance, the longevity of the product deserves absolutely no stars at all. Very displeased.</li>
            <li> I bought the original model Epilady back in 1989.  It lasted me about 10 years.  Then, a few years later, I bought another one, same model, and let&#x27;s just say that they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em the way they used to - it crapped out within a few months!  Planned obsolecense should be illegal.  So, all this time, I&#x27;d been shaving my legs and pits, and I got fed up with all the stubble and having to do it so frequently.  Well, I wasn&#x27;t about to give Epilady any more of my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As wierd as it sounds, I chose this Emjoi model for its looks.  I love the color.  I just got it yesterday and tried it out today, so the jury&#x27;s still out on its durability and longevity.  It&#x27;s very ergonomical - it fits nicely in my hand and I like the storage bag.  I have only tried the epilation head so far, not the razor head or the exfoliator head.  I am glad to finally have an epilator again...sure, there&#x27;s time, effort and discomfort involved, but afterward, I feel so cleansed - kind of like how I feel after taking a satisfying dump.  What bugs me about all these epilator brands is their claims about legs being smooth for 4-6 weeks.  Are you kidding me?!  Mine only stay smooth from epilation for one week, maybe two if I&#x27;m lucky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for 2yrs now. I&#x27;ve never gone back to shaving after owning one. It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs after one go for me, but the results still last way longer than when I used to shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still painful and in growth does not reduce</li>
            <li> Great product.  The first one I bought while living in California &amp; have had it over 15 years &amp; it still works.  I was going to just replace the head, but for $10 more I bought a new one.  Emjoi makes great products &amp; that&#x27;s why I purchase my epilators from them.  I have tried other brands &amp; they just don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my legs for years (actually it&#x27;s a thick sugar solution) and now some hair are coming in too thin and fine to wax.  This device has saved my summer. It&#x27;s easy to use and not a painful as you might think.  It can be used successfully on any type of hair, coarse or fine.  You don&#x27;t have to wait for a bunch of hair to grow to a certain length to use it.  Even if you just see one hair, you can immediately take care of it.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and the hair has not yet come back.</li>
            <li> This product works!! If you can stand the pain of 36 tweezer plucking hair at lightspeed your all set.  Dont get me wrong I do like this product, and you do get used to how it feels, but not for the weak. It is for the people who only want to remove hair once every few weeks.  PROCESS: I remove hair once, a few hairs break off, it misses a few, but gets the majority.  Then 4-5 days later i do the area again to get those it missed or broke and then im good for a a week or two.  And each time i do it the results seem to last longer. I do seem to get quite a few ingrown hairs but think i wouldnt if i used the exfoilator pad with it like it says too, but im lazy.  Some redness initialy but goes away after 8-12 hours and doesnt come back.  All in all its the best product I have tried, but its not perfect.  I will keep using until something better comes along or i deside to spend alot more money on a NONO! laser of some sort.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun epilator for four years, as I moved to US I couldn&#x27;t use that any more. So I ordered this from Amazon, It works really good, muuuuch faster and easier to use that braun one. and I love the color :D    Update:  I have used this product for some months and it was just perfect till I started having lots of ingrown hairs. I stopped using this epilator in that time. Till now (after two years) I couldn&#x27;t  stop having ingrowns, I used many different products, saw a doctor... still I have the problem  I believe this is not problem with this specific brand of epilator, all epilators if you use it frequently can cause ingrown..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a 3.5 star because it is better than shaving and I don&#x27;t have to keep buying razors that can get expensive but not as awesome as advertised; results vary differently for each person.&lt;br /&gt;  Hurts like %#$^$ the first time and second time I tried it and my leg was so irritated and red but then I got used to it and the hair does grows back THINNER, less black (if hair leg is black), and SPARSER. Instead of seeing stubble on the 3rd day after shaving and perhaps waiting until a five days to a week to shave again, I can hold off epilating until a week for some stubble and one and a half to two weeks to finally do the deed again, if lazy.&lt;br /&gt;  I still had ingrown hairs with exfoliation, an ingrown hair lotion may help with that. Out of all the heads, I only use the tweezer and then the electronic razor to catch anything I miss because the epilator can take about 10 minutes each leg to really get everything visible. Doing my armpits are great though and less painful! I do love that you can charge it and it can become a mobile device, like for vacation.&lt;br /&gt;  I do love the color but since it&#x27;s a light color, (shows) can get dirty easily. However with time, noticed around 8 months, the epilator does not go as fast and catches less hair so will have to go over it many times in different directions. I may try waxing to save time and get hopefully the same/better results...</li>
            <li> I love this product, I even got another one for my daughter which she also loves it, I recommended it very much.</li>
            <li> This is sooo good it just makes me happy every time I use it.     1. It&#x27;s a great epilator - 2 speed settings.  2. It&#x27;s cordless!!! I recently took it camping and looooved it. So easy.  3. It comes with a shaver and exfoliating attachment, which make it so wonderfully multi-purpose.  I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t have to bother carrying a razor or shaving cream around, deal with soap or water, or fuss with at-home waxing kits (or pay a bunch of money to get it done!!!)  4. Excellent price considering all of the above.    Basically, I&#x27;m happy because of the above statement... I hate shaving, I hate dealing with shaving accessories, and I have the cost-effective AND convenient alternative to waxing.  But in-growns are an issue, so definitely use this with good exfoliation, and also with an after-shave serum designed to eliminate ingrown hairs.    Otherwise, I&#x27;m totally satisfied!</li>
            <li> Great. Easy to use! Cleans hair very well</li>
            <li> Works as well as I remember my old one working (I had an emjoi gold about 10 years ago).  It did hurt to use it the first time, probably becasue it had been so long since I&#x27;d done it, but since then it&#x27;s been fairly painless.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that the exfoliator attachment really does much, but I like the razor attachment.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected!  I have been able to cut back on the amount of time I spend on hair removal on my legs and face.  It leaves a comfortable, smooth feeling.  I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This was my first Epilator and hated it. It hurt and didn&#x27;t pluck all the hairs!! I would go over an area 4-5 times and the hair was still there I was left with red bumpy skin and with hairs left behind. I returned it and bought instead the Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover and I love it. It works amazing. Gets all the hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!! Don&#x27;t buy this Epilator instead get the Emjoi Soft Caress Cordless Hair Remover!!!! Its much better just read the reviews and you will agree.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud, but it works great.  And the charge it holds between charges is great.  I haven&#x27;t really tested the epilator attachment yet though.  I did a little testing on my forearm, and it seemed to work, but mainly I bought it for the shaver/trimmer attachment for the armpit area.  It fits comfortably in your hand, and so far, it hasn&#x27;t pulled the hair or been uncomfortable.  Assuming I test more with the epilator attachment, I&#x27;ll add to this review.  Even though my main interest was the shaver/trimmer attachment, since this unit had the epilator attachment, I figured what the heck.  I&#x27;ve mainly waxed the armpit area, so I&#x27;m interested to see the pros/cons between waxing and using the epilator.</li>
            <li> Love this&lt;br /&gt;Gave it to all my girlfriends and taught my daughter and her friends to use it when they turned 12 (instead of shaving)&lt;br /&gt;They have very few hairs every week - just maintaining a hair here and there - cldnt be happier&lt;br /&gt;AND when we&#x27;re on vacation we never have to go look for a waxing place (except for bikini area) because I shaved once and never again!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid that the Emjoi Epilator would be painful, but it was not.  It&#x27;s really easy and fast to use and is the same as shaving with an electric razor.  I wanted something that would remove the hair, but did not want to spend hundreds of dollars for the &amp;#34;No-No&amp;#34;. This is the perfect answer. The price and the result is definitely a &amp;#34;Yes-Yes&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> This epilator works amazing for everything except my legs. It is quite painful at first but it gets better with time. It takes a lot of time to get my legs completely smooth. If you have coarse thick hair, like I do I would recommend a stronger epilator. However, it works wonders for the entire upper body!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much hair on my legs, so I used to use tweezers, and that was painful. This makes the job a lot faster and much less painful. A much better alternative than waxing or tweezers!</li>
            <li> I prefer the Dolphin model for bikini area, and because it&#x27;s cordless, rechargeable, and waterproof, so it can be used in the bath.  This one, however is better for larger areas, such as legs, because the dolphin is rather narrow that it takes a long time to cover larger areas.  This one, wider is a bit more difficult for bikini area, but not bad.  The original (came out many, many years ago, and while it lasted many years, it finally broke down and needed replacement) did not work well for bikini area at all.</li>
            <li> it stopped working after 5 minutes and when i tried to charge at first it&#x27;s light torn on then went down and stopped charging.</li>
            <li> I had an epilator for a few years and lost it. I&#x27;m glad I chose the Emjoi because the attachments and accessories are really nice. It&#x27;s also gentler than the previous model I had.</li>
