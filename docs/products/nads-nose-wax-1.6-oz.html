            <li>I am so happy I found this product Bc</li>
            <li>Works great, but instructions are misleading as to the re-usability of applicator.  </li>
            <li>I so happy to have discovered this.</li>

            <li>Amazing Product!</li>
            <li>Highly effective!  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but this product is superb.</li>
            <li>Direction were easy to understand and my nose looks great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>in all a good product</li>
            <li>I cannot comprehend all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Works good.  </li>
            <li>and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>Most incredible part?</li>
            <li>Does a really  good job with the hairs it does reach.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s good to go for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Item works good and does the job.  </li>
            <li>I did what any manly, heroic, &#x27;Merrrrrican man would do: I did it</li>
            <li>The trick is to heat the applicator in a microwave for 5 minutes or so and to remove the melting wax and hair off the applicator, then it becomes perfectly good for reusing.  </li>
            <li>Works just as good as going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Worked good on the blackheads on my nose too.  </li>
            <li>This nose wax is perfect for removing unwanted nose hair, the applicators are unique.</li>
            <li>its cool to see the hair on the was lol!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>No&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was I happy it got most of the hairs?</li>
            <li>I still use this wax and it works great once you figure out the &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; and get creative with home made</li>
            <li>It worked great, removed about 90-95% of my nose hair and it stayed mostly gone for over a month.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The product came with more applicators and wipes than stated on the box!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to FULLY commit to &amp;#34;the pull&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic !!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy and would recommend to anyone who wants to Wax the Nose Hair...!</li>
            <li>The product smells great and the fragrance is very mild</li>
            <li>this is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This nose hair removal waxing kit is amazing.</li>
            <li>It was truly amazing to see the amount of hair that came out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to try this, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>And BTW, this is not wax, but some kind of plastic that melts.  </li>
            <li>It effectively cleared out all unwanted nose hairs for 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Good product works well and everything i wished they was more so</li>
            <li>It is nice to have this product instead of pulling or trimming nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>I liked the results</li>
            <li>I would have liked to see them be reusable in some way instead of tossing out lots of plastic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own lifestyle, get this and get that stuff out.</li>
            <li>Everything cleaned up nicely.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and very thorough for nose waxing if used correctly.</li>
            <li>I am my own hero.</li>
            <li>Very cool product!</li>
            <li>After spending time plucking, I was a bit nervous about trying this product, but it was fairly painless and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use .</li>
            <li>I have regrettably used nose hair trimmers and tweezers to try to groom myself but have found that waxing is by far, the best solution.  </li>
            <li>so be sure to have some tweezers handy.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to have more applicators in the pack, so all of the product can be used without throwing out the unused portion.</li>
            <li>I bought Nads nose wax kit for the first time based on the great reviews, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions precisely, and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, virtually painless and very effective.</li>
            <li>It was pretty nice to be able to rip them all out in two good yanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great, removes all unwanted hair, easy to use, I find it extremely useful compared to nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li>Easy and fairly pain free if done correctly.</li>
            <li>Applicators fit the nostril OK but easy to use, good results.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and very delighted with the results.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>As others have said, there is plenty of wax for more applications.</li>
            <li>This may work better for men though.  </li>
            <li>you are a guy, don&#x27;t hesitate for a moment to buy this thinking its a women&#x27;s product - we are the people who need it most, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Have recommended to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the directions fully.  </li>
            <li>I have tried trimmers for many years and they didn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>I decided to order more and give them out to my enemies.  </li>
            <li>, I figured I&#x27;d better not screw this up.</li>
            <li>better then</li>
            <li>Took me much longer to heat up my wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I just held a miniature spa day for my nostrils, they have never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>* if you do not follow the directions it will hurt a bit :)</li>
            <li>well I just paid over $8 to have this done in a salon and after leaving thought I could surely do that.</li>
            <li>My partner however was okay with it and prefers it.</li>
            <li>I team to have been blessed (not cursed) with a body covered mostly by hair.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully in time, my practice will lead to perfection and I will be able to get more hairs out at a time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a better alternative.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more plastic applicators and would like to know where to order more of them.</li>
            <li>Nearing 50, I have struggled with staying on top of my grooming.  </li>
            <li>This time I wanted something more thorough.  </li>
            <li>This was certainly more thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems these give more or a precision approach.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li>This stuff pulls the nose hair out for sure.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using this kit and will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>It has a paper pull off top</li>
            <li>If anyone can recommend a bulk wax product that would work like this wax works, it would sure be helpful.</li>
            <li>but once I used it I changed my mind and am pleased I bought it.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for better results.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve not been able to replicate the results.</li>
            <li>Can get many uses from one box.</li>
            <li>I went and bought popsicle sticks from walmart and can get many uses from the one thing of wax.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s safe)</li>
            <li>My daughter and I used to have this done at the salon, not any more.</li>
            <li>went after my son, he has a unibrow, not any more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Giving five stars even though I think more of the plastic applicators should be included.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I used to pay for this to be done, but now I can do it better myself</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just kinda a wierd feeling, which is literally working out to be about 1 a month or more between waxings.</li>
            <li>This works much better.</li>
            <li>However, with as awesome as the results are I would and will buy this product in the future without thinking twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so we haven&#x27;t tried it yet :)</li>
            <li>did have to insert the wax twice in each nostril just to make sure that I got all the hairs out.</li>
            <li>So the prices isn&#x27;t great for only two uses, but it is a good kit.</li>
            <li>and I wish it came with more sticks and nose sticks..</li>
            <li>They just want you to buy more kits, 8 uses instead of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>This company is BS-ing telling you to dump them out and buy more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it got about 99%, certainly more than I thought</li>
            <li>I went on and bought 10 more.</li>
            <li>but it is a must have for most of us.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>I have purchased it twice now and love it.</li>
            <li>I did not see a way to buy more plugs</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use, good product.</li>
            <li>When* I was able to get the wax to a good, usable consistency I had to work very fast to place the applicator in the nostril.</li>
            <li>The wax doesn&#x27;t seem like normal wax, it seems kind of like a plastic, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>This is a great wax kit that lasts for a decent while.  </li>
            <li>My nose looks very clean and no stubble.</li>
            <li>More like a strong pull feeling (I imagine its what velcro would feel like being pulled apart).  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, if you run out of the nose applicators, just use wooden wax applicators the kind with the angled end...</li>
            <li>An amazing product, simple and VERY effective....</li>
            <li>As with most here, it worked fine for me</li>
            <li>I bought this kit and will use it again, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t do as good as job as the professionals...</li>
            <li>---I recommend leaving the wax in close to the full 2 minutes, as the wax will adhere more securely to more hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t hurt, which was surprising.</li>
            <li>its really painless.&lt;br /&gt;You can also buy more wax cheaply and reuse the tub!!</li>
            <li>worked great and is very easy , and at 52 of age beats trimming constantly , also it is easy and pain free.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as I had envisioned</li>
            <li>This product is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>it was really easy.</li>
            <li>The directions were really easy to follow</li>
            <li>Easy to use, virtually painless</li>
            <li>This product works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>so I get the visible nose hairs and this stuff is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I used the method described by another reviewers (i.e. freeze the applicator and the wax is easily removed) to reuse them.</li>
            <li>wax is so easy to use</li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>, some folks recommended freezing the applicators for reuse, but I just reheated them (for about 3 1/2 minutes) and then used paper towels to remove the wax/hair and it was easy</li>
            <li>This product is sooooo easy to use and is so painless (I know it looks like it should hurt</li>
            <li>Painless and easy.</li>
            <li>This is much easier and much more effective.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend cleaning and reusing the applicators or you&#x27;ll run out way before you run out of wax</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and make sure it doesn&#x27;t cool off before applying.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as effective as I wanted on the first try.</li>
            <li>This wax is more aggressive and stings more as you rip your noise hair out, but you get a whole lot more wax 14oz vs 1.6oz  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly, you may need to down each nostril twice to get all the hair.</li>
            <li>This wax comes out easily, too, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m guessing a huge majority</li>
            <li>I can breathe through my nose again, which represents a huge leap forward in the evolutionary timeline of my/our species.</li>
            <li>The safety applicator is HUGE for my nose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It still leaves the hair deeper in your nose, which have important health</li>
            <li>The kit is simple, instructions are great, and they give you everything you need.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trimming for years using an electric trimmer, with much success I might add, but my nose hairs just kept getting thicker and causing me more discomfort.</li>
            <li>I just wait until the wax hardens and it comes off easily then clean it with alcohol</li>
            <li>I am still kinda in shock as to how pain free it was.  </li>
            <li>This wax set is great and this is already the 3rd set i bought!</li>
            <li>Great item,  last longer than plucking, and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>I have no idea who thinks this is pain free.</li>
            <li>messy and and perfect</li>
            <li>After two applications for each nostril he was nose hair free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not a nose waxing expert, but this worked great for me.</li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;know a guy&amp;#34; who grows such great amounts of nostril hair he has to grow a mustache just to match.</li>
            <li>5 stars means this product would be perfect and it is not perfect but it is quite good</li>
            <li>In the process of doing so, I realized just how much obstruction the hair causes in my nostrils, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed easier, and more efficient breathing</li>
            <li>Watch videos online to see how others do it, super easy and fulfilling to get rid of those offending you-know-whats.</li>
            <li>Quick easy and rather painless considering alternatives.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions carefully it is super easy.  </li>
            <li>This kit is super simple and works great.  </li>
            <li>Using the spoon to stir before the actual application doesn&#x27;t do much good either, because the wax dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>But I contacted the company and they were kind enough to send me more, free of charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pretty satisfied</li>
            <li>Seemed expensive but this kind of relief is priceless.  </li>
            <li>Also it seems wasteful that the applicators are not reusable; the remnant wax won&#x27;t clean off.  </li>
            <li>This took some doing to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>but one reviewer said you can easily clean them by freezing them.  </li>
            <li>but it feels clean</li>
            <li>- - - if you need a clean nose, you cannot beat this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To clean the applicators for re-use, get as much wax off as you can then put them in a coffee cup you don&#x27;t care about filled most of the way with water.</li>
            <li>then I realized I wanted to keep my nose clean all the time, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the pro to do it.  </li>
            <li>Truly, you have no idea how hairy the inside of your nose is until you clean it out.  </li>
            <li>Though some people have stated they could clean off and reuse the plastic applicators.</li>
            <li>I want to just add that you can (and you need to) clean off&lt;br /&gt;the applicators so you can reuse them.</li>
            <li>its really painless.&lt;br /&gt;You can also buy more wax cheaply and reuse the tub!!w to do it.</li>
            <li>Evective, clean and painless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy-to-use, smelt pleasant and totally worked.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I listened to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in early may and have gone more than a month without visible nose hairs!  </li>
            <li>wax itself is nothing special.</li>
            <li>Right, yeeeouch!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely excellent product, hard wax that will yank that nose hair out by the fistful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tweezers, manual/powered nose trimmers, even shaving the nostrils externally (which is good in a pinch, but can cut the skin on your nose)</li>
            <li>Not painful either, just dip the applicator in the wax and shove up your nose.</li>
            <li>The wax is good and different from the one at the salons.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;This was great for getting rid of pesky nose hair quickly and easily; however I think the company could have come up with a less wasteful design.  </li>
            <li>the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inserted the Q-tip with the cotton removed into the warmed wax, swirled it about, stuck it up my nose and then let it cool for about 75 seconds.</li>
            <li>it to let the wax cool a bit and be evenly distributed on the applicator</li>
            <li>I will also say now I am really noticing more then ever</li>
            <li>They really should provide more applicators though.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I did it right the first time, I tried again.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;After 40 the hair that stopped growing on other places on my body started coming out of my nose</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wax does break off the applicators pretty easily to reuse them.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does as promised it removes nose hairs quickly and without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a mustache and there is a convenient protector that is mildly adhesive and protects the mustache .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started looking for a trimmer because my nose hair is getting more an more dominant as I am headed solidly into my 4th decade on this planet.</li>
            <li>Waited 90-100 seconds and then pulled quickly with one switch motion.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quick.</li>
            <li>I grabbed ahold of the stick and prepared to quickly pull it out and thought nothing</li>
            <li>One quick yank and I had miniature furry popsicle of wax and hair.</li>
            <li>It lasts longer than trimming and is more effective at getting to the harder to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Until using this, I&#x27;d gently try my razor or electric nose trimmer with OK success.  </li>
            <li>wax really does break off cleanly!</li>
            <li>but it works good as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>Accomplished the job quickly and easily</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good is simple to do and after your first time pulls alot easier each time,,not</li>
            <li>But it was well-worth it to get a funny video (taken by my daughter!)</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time tonight and was amazed!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back again, I breathe much better now!</li>
            <li>Wear gloves as it will be hot!  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, there are very few waxing products tailored for men and while male waxing is still taboo for the most part, what guy wouldn&#x27;t want to look his best?</li>
            <li>Application was fairly easy but the wax turns to concrete fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>only highly intelligent people can grasp the concept of a baby skin smooth inner nostril,</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great because I was so apprehensive to use it on such a sensitive</li>
            <li>I’ve had marginal success using the product on nose hair.</li>
            <li>Was the amount of pain worth the desired results?  </li>
            <li>this product is worth your time.</li>
            <li>One of the fun places it tends to sprout is in my nose.  </li>
            <li>But it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>And it worked so awesome that I am recommending it to every guy I know who is annoyed with nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>this is kind of gross</li>
            <li>they work well for ears...  not that useful for a nose blackhead remover- use nasal strips for that.  </li>
            <li>its ok otherwise, just expected more after those raving reviews.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of work to get the wax heated up just right and do all the prep work, but the result is so worth it.</li>
            <li>True, there are NOT enough applicators, but this product works effectively and most critically, painlessly.</li>
            <li>+ times if you do it right.</li>
            <li>It will take some practice to heat the wax to the correct consistency and to get the timing right of it setting in your nose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this as there is no other product like this on the market and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, nothing will make your significant other laugh more than you walking around the house with a plastic handle dangling from your nose while you feel super self-conscious about wax-related hair</li>
            <li>Works great for men&#x27;s nostril hair, which is usually thicker.</li>
            <li>I might try the wooden popsicle sticks next time - I suspect the wood will do a better job of gathering and holding the warm wax.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and dark hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, just give it a nice hard tug, and be satisfied when you see how it got even the smallest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works, and is not very painful at all.</li>
            <li>directions are clear and the product is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have been going to get it done professionally, but this works better and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I fixed this problem by using q-tips to apply the wax to the easy to each places of the nose.</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t hurt if  you pull quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very much</li>
            <li>used as directed on surface of nose to clean pores and remove a single follicle , also easy and great , just follow directions and use a stopwatch or stopwatch app on a smart phone dip little ball on end of applicator into warmed wax</li>
            <li>Best to clean the tools as they don&#x27;t provide enough to empty the wax, but that&#x27;s not a big chore.  </li>
            <li>It removes massive amounts of nose hair, safely.  </li>
            <li>But it hurts like nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt before the first time you try it.  </li>
            <li>same price or better here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!  </li>
            <li>Waxing your upper lip hurts more so if you can stand that you are all set.</li>
            <li>So, I did it again in each nostril, and it pulled even more hairs, which at that point I felt a completely different sensation in my nose...</li>
            <li>But it worked really well, and is worth every funny/painful moment.</li>
            <li>Just got this and tried it for the first time....</li>
            <li>First off, pros</li>
            <li>This thing worked, and the first time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not difficult; you just have to do it right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I heated it again for one more minute and did it a second time.  </li>
            <li>;) Works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy(31) and was interested in using this after I saw it on a website .  </li>
            <li>As a married man I have a wife always commenting on things that need addressing, nose hair being one of them.</li>
            <li>there was that much in there!</li>
            <li>Two things to keep in mind - be SURE to give this wax enough time to harden - like 90+ seconds.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t throw away the used sticks, wash them off with hot water or freeze em&#x27; to get the wax off.</li>
            <li>We use popsicle sticks, coated well and then just up the nose, not too deep then twist to make sure you get all the hair around the opening of your nostril.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>my first attempt).</li>
            <li>Well enough to be completely satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>Sure, it worked well enough.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend was pretty grossed out by the used applicators, so I just thew them out.</li>
            <li>applications unless you have only one or more than 2 nasal passages!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough wax in the tub for a hundred or more applications!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>the first time I used it I had a lot of hair and it hurt anyway.</li>
            <li>3 times the first day to get rid of all the hair.</li>
            <li>This likely forces some customers to buy more kits before they are out of wax, but Nads disguises this as &amp;#34;helping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>and my business is suddenly booking more clients than ever before</li>
            <li>Sure, none of that is necessarily connected to the nose waxing, but it did all happen AFTER I started waxing.</li>
            <li>Only wish there were more applicators or</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted to use on my husband</li>
            <li>Does exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li>You have to follow the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>Then I use that hot knife to take chunks of GiGi wax out of its container and put it into the Nad&#x27;s container.  </li>
            <li>That is 9 times more wax for only $11.50 vs $18 for another Nad&#x27;s kit.  </li>
            <li>But pretty painless.</li>
            <li>first you nuke the wax.  </li>
            <li>Well this product really helped with that!</li>
            <li>Had to apply few times to get the result, good if you like pain...</li>
            <li>Easy, mess free, and quick.</li>
            <li>I had good results when using it on my nose, really helps remove black heads.  </li>
            <li>A life without the extremely long nose hair is definitely one that&#x27;s more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>tonight!!!&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with 8 insert stocks, if you use the flat end of the sticks to treat the surface of your nose you will be able use all the wax at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pretty scared to use this product but my desire to not have long nose hairs itching my nose was much greater.</li>
            <li>Does the job right because really who wants a hairy nose?</li>
            <li>works good and very little pain.</li>
            <li>As this is my first time waxing nose hairs, I am very content with the results after immediate use.</li>
            <li>Removed 90% of my nose hair which I am not sure is a good thing</li>
            <li>but it is easy and gets lots of tiny hairs out.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t trim my nose hairs first (and I am a VERY hairy guy, with way too much hair in places you do not need hair)</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, with certain death on the line</li>
            <li>Fast and easy and relatively painless.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully next time will be easier since the key seems to be to make sure you heat it up much longer than the directions say and if you have stubborn hairs, leave it in your nostrils a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>, my wife and I just got approved for a new home (much larger, much more modern than where we&#x27;ve been), and wife is hotter than ever.</li>
            <li>I held a paper towel over my upper lip and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Have a blob of warm wax grab virtually every tender, little nose hair and</li>
            <li>with a little trial and error, was able to achieve mission success.</li>
            <li>The instructions and cautions are clear (it even includes pictures), the supplies are plentiful for more than a one time use, it is quick, and other than the anticipation</li>
            <li>Works very well, just ish</li>
            <li>Ive gone my whole life plucking the strays</li>
            <li>the glory that follows is only known to the people that posses this product and are intelligent enough to use it properly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and Im much happier with the Nads results.</li>
            <li>However, my nose was very tender for about two days afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the real jewel is the applicators.</li>
            <li>I have way too much nose hair.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think it would.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really hurt either, just feels like all the blood rushes to my hose at once.</li>
            <li>I really dislike nose hair.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have much wax to use them with.</li>
            <li>Used this on my boyfriend and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real PITA to scrub it out.  </li>
            <li>I got this product, and it really works.</li>
            <li>Absolutely painless.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Nads!</li>
            <li>It really changed my life (n-n)</li>
            <li>We are so fascinated with this that the whole family used it.</li>
            <li>thanks PRIME) and</li>
            <li>If you pluck your nose hairs, try this as you will be amazed at how painless it really is.  </li>
            <li>This was absolutely painless....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than waxing at a salon every month.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think it would.  </li>
            <li>I then pulled it out as fast as I could.  </li>
            <li>Run the whole thing in microwave for 2.5 minutes.</li>
            <li>wax is absolutely tenacious when fully hardened and it will yank out any hair</li>
            <li>I got two sinus infections after using this product because I removed so much hair from my nostrils.</li>
            <li>I have a really hairy nose</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions, but the wax takes much longer then prescribed to melt to a somewhat workable consistency.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as you&#x27;d think.  </li>
            <li>it really works..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>also need to push it up until its snug and hold it there, not let it dangle.&lt;br /&gt;You need to yank it out as fast as you can for it to be painless, believe it or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You would have never thought that much hair is up your honker and I will say ever since I have done this</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I thought I knew how much hair was up there.</li>
            <li>the point: this product works very well.</li>
            <li>And the hair stays away much much longer than plucking or clipping.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t get it for the pore cleaning as I did not think much of that.</li>
            <li>(however, there IS a ton of wax provided and it will most likely last me a year or more, even with multiple applications per use).&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so fast-</li>
            <li>Hardens a bit too fast.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>The wax stuck to the more sensitive edges of my nostrils, causing some pain later when I had to scrap it off.  </li>
            <li>In a matter of a few minutes, it was effective.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li>It works as expected for nostrils and despite my imagination pulling it fast and in one motion works :-)  </li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re just only so effective), for a total of four applicators per use.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many trimming devices and none has worked as good as this not to mention that one would need to repeat less frequently compared to typical trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that more sticks should be included</li>
            <li>The other mystery to me is why the wax container does not have a screw on top.</li>
            <li>New as could be!  </li>
            <li>On more than half of the occasions I’ve used it, I was left with most of the wax stuck inside my nose, which then had to be peeled out bit by bit, all the while plucking individual hairs out in the process.</li>
            <li>but now I do it more regularly, less cost and on my schedule.  </li>
            <li>Super simple!  </li>
            <li>from my experience it did not hurt - I also had to use it twice to do a decent job.</li>
            <li>I have tweezed, pulled, cut and tried all kinds of things with the results being a super sore nose or ingrown hairs that totally suck.</li>
            <li>you could buy extra since there is enough  for more waxings.  </li>
            <li>mainly because each nostril will require two times.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all your nose hair removal needs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to someone seeking a long-term alternative to trimming.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions, although I may have put applied a bit more wax than the pictures illustrate (a little would come out of my nostril when I inserted.</li>
            <li>said jungle, it leaves behind a lot of the little fine hairs that only show up in bright light, which is what I was hoping to eliminate.</li>
            <li>I much prefer using the waxing pot with sticks at home that NAD&#x27;s device, which does not give you professional results.</li>
            <li>The ball on the end of the applicator is much tinier than it appears and it barely goes into your nostril, so it doesn&#x27;t remove much hair at all.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised the first time I had my nose hair waxed professionally that there is no pain at all...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or leaves residue like normal wax.</li>
            <li>It gums up quickly if the consistency is just right (just a little thicker than honey).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite possible to heat the wax to a burning temperature if you don&#x27;t do it right.  </li>
            <li>I put the white nose things in the freezer for about 10 minutes if that then tapped on them which a butter knife and the wax and hair come right off in the garbage can.  </li>
            <li>will have to trim more frequently, but it&#x27;s easier, less painful, and more effective.</li>
            <li>Rather than try to find a new pro, I tried Amazon.  </li>
            <li>But you&#x27;ll live</li>
            <li>But after two tries per nostril my nose was clean.  </li>
            <li>directions sound more complicated than it needs to be, though.  </li>
            <li>wait for it to dry then yank quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works well, not hard to apply, very gentle with skin, easy to clean residue from skin but hard from other places like tile or counters</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the wax container doesn&#x27;t have a lid that fits securely over the jar after you first open it, but once the wax hardens back up</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive nose and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>lowered the price from $19.99 to $13.99 - far more realistic for the small amount of wax supplied&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>but if you put the applicator in the freezer (in a plastic baggie) you can easily remove the wax from the applicator and reuse it as long as you have wax left.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, have thick nose hair and this thing better than any other trimmer</li>
            <li>Directions are simple, and the product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>Have to due many times to get the proper job.  </li>
            <li>Used this product and for first the time my nose is not itching me constantly!  </li>
            <li>It removed way more hair than I do when plucking, and without all the watery eyes / sinus explosion that I usually experience with plucking.</li>
            <li>That was only after I did it the first time after heating for around 6 minutes</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>This got virtually every hair and was completely painless!  </li>
            <li>Initially I was worried about getting burned but the wax never seems to get that hot.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I had ever waxed my nose hair, and it will not be my last.</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive nosehairs (it hurts to tweeze!)</li>
            <li>This actually worked really well!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the wax can drip on your facial hair causing clean up to be difficult--and possibly painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleaned one nostril quite well, the other it didn&#x27;t clean even after two attempts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>worked exactly as described, little pain but worth the result</li>
            <li>All the other reviews can pretty much fill you in on it</li>
            <li>After my wax ran out I decided to order GiGi Brazilian Body Hard Wax, 14 Ounce  instead of reordering Nad&#x27;s because you get a lot more wax.  </li>
            <li>and it is really hard to find someone who does it right or is even willing to do it at all!</li>
            <li>no wonder trimming and pulling didn&#x27;t work - way too many to get using tweezers - this product pulls out dozens of hairs at a time - I was shocked by how many).  </li>
            <li>The step process is clear to read and</li>
            <li>The product has clear instructions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparison to my old method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to have my nose waxed professionally, but after moving, I let it slide.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the wax in too far with these.</li>
            <li>Save yourself the aggravation and just get it done by a professional</li>
            <li>it is nearly painless</li>
            <li>Maybe I put too much wax on my applicator, but I&#x27;d say there is enough wax for about 10 applications.</li>
            <li>and it is the price of having it done once professionally.  </li>
            <li>All of the hair in my nose near the opening were just plucked in one yank.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the container plastic started to melt, but it still did not feel like &amp;#34;hard honey,&amp;#34; or at least I wasn&#x27;t sure if it did.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got an old kit</li>
            <li>Surprised how painless this was and how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>It was so simple to use and very thorough in the nose hair removal.  </li>
            <li>He will thank you, from a professional standpoint of course.</li>
            <li>, I wasn&#x27;t all that precise about heating up the wax, or even coating the applicator, and while I did time the thing I don&#x27;t think letting it go outside of the 90-120 second window they state would be a big problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it only comes with a few applicators so you have to be creative.  </li>
            <li>But let it sit for about 3 minutes after to cool down</li>
            <li>I should mention that I&#x27;ve never waxed anything on my body before, so waxing in general was a new experience.</li>
            <li>a word of caution, be careful about waxing again right away if you notice that you missed some nose hair, it can tear the tender flesh (which hurts, and takes a while to heal).</li>
            <li>Again, left behind so many hairs that I waited a couple hours to give my nose a break and heated up the jar again for around 7 minutes and left it in a full two minutes each nostril.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sensitive about the monkey fist of hair that grows in my nose, and thought that yanking on a plastic stick that has been melded to said monkey fist with melted wax would be my last experience before death, having ripped the brain right out of my skull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe you could scrap the wax off the flat service into the trash without too much trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>little tricky at first but easy to use and honestly didnt hurt nearly as bad as the eyebrows and it last much longer than using the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I saw this posted on a celebrity gossip blog as one of the most ridiculous products ever, but nose hair is one of my biggest pet peeves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;, stick it in nostril , time to a minimum 90 seconds maximum 120 seconds , pull quickly and clean with provided anti-bacterial wipe , repeat on other nostril , then I used spatula on other end to apply to each side of surface of nose , wait 30 seconds and peel one corner and pull quickly to deep clean skin , I recommend disposing of applicators due to the possibility of transmitting bacteria , and there are plenty of extra applicators and mustache protectors to last a long time , and at this price , I anticipate it will last a year , before I need another kit, super product.</li>
            <li>a little but not bad</li>
            <li>It works, but dries very fast, be careful you do not go beyond time they say on the package.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 26 year old guy with very hairy nostrils, they got all the hair in the front of my nose (the stuff the is unsightly and irritates), and left the helpful hair in the far back.</li>
            <li>I had a small cheap electric trimmer that broke to I came on Amazon looking for one</li>
            <li>Once you jury rig the Q-tips by removing the cotton and figure out how long to heat the wax, the wax works really.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a small plastic tub filled with wax that you melt in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;One minute</li>
            <li>they probably forgot long ago air is supposed to go through there, hahahahaha.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gross and my wife was disgusted but it worked a lot better than the applicators supplied by NAD&#x27;s (love that name!).</li>
            <li>I tried 4x overall on different occasions and it was to much hassle.</li>
            <li>agree with previous comments, you almost have to reuse the applicators to make this purchase even close to worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li>It appears that leaving the product in place too long is better than leaving it in to briefly, but it’s all a little too inexact for me.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to mess around with clippers, this is a simple way to clean things up.</li>
            <li>Do be aware that unlike shaving off your mustache people may notice the naked look above you lip but it is not likely they will mention it, nor will they pay you a compliment.</li>
            <li>Many other reviewers comment that there was little or no pain</li>
            <li>I got ahold of him, got the wax properly warmed and dipped the applicator twice to give it a nice thick blob, then stuffed it up his nose and twisted a bit to make sure all the ickies were coated.</li>
            <li>Like many of you, I was skeptical, but after reading several positive reviews, I decided to go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your nose stinging for a little after, but definitely worth it</li>
            <li>Works great for nose hair, I gave four stars cause it missed a few hairs down low and also because it didn&#x27;t work well for black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it was relatively painless!</li>
            <li>But it barely hurt at all.</li>
            <li>It requires that you direct the insert into different angles to get into some areas.</li>
            <li>It sounded weird, but I liked the idea of removing, rather than trimming the hair, so I thought I&#x27;d try</li>
            <li>and I was looking for better, but this product is way worse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might work if you I first spent a half hour first removing every last hair (like with the electric nose hair trimmer)</li>
            <li>of me laughing hysterically - first because standing there holding a stick inside of my nose for almost a minute looked ridiculous, and secondly because after the first yank I knew I was absolutely stuck &amp; committed to another HARDER yank.  </li>
            <li>Used only once so far and only purchased for nose hair.  </li>
            <li>and it left behind so many hairs</li>
            <li>A little timid at first, but read some helpful reviews.  </li>
            <li>Took a little nerve to pull the first time.  </li>
            <li>but the wax did take heating for around 7 full minutes before it finally got to the consistency of thick honey.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer mean&#x27;t by three applications--it comes with several applicators and enough wax for at least that many uses.  </li>
            <li>They could easily cut them in half and have provided twice the nose applicators with the same amount of plastic, but they wanted to screw us over my adding the flat side to all of them (could have just done a couple and doubled up on round ends on the rest).  </li>
            <li>Did not clean up the area around the entrance to the nostrils very well.  </li>
            <li>But the price is a little too much.</li>
            <li>I only wish you got a few more applicators in the pack since it seems to be impossible to clean and reuse them.</li>

            <li> Most incredible part?</li>

            <li> He&#x27;s good to go for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Item works good and does the job.  </li>
            <li> I did what any manly, heroic, &#x27;Merrrrrican man would do: I did it</li>
            <li> The trick is to heat the applicator in a microwave for 5 minutes or so and to remove the melting wax and hair off the applicator, then it becomes perfectly good for reusing.  </li>
            <li> Works just as good as going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Worked good on the blackheads on my nose too.  </li>
            <li> This nose wax is perfect for removing unwanted nose hair, the applicators are unique.</li>

            <li> I still use this wax and it works great once you figure out the &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; and get creative with home made</li>
            <li> It worked great, removed about 90-95% of my nose hair and it stayed mostly gone for over a month.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The product came with more applicators and wipes than stated on the box!  </li>

            <li> The product smells great and the fragrance is very mild</li>
            <li> this is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This nose hair removal waxing kit is amazing.</li>
            <li> It was truly amazing to see the amount of hair that came out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to try this, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> And BTW, this is not wax, but some kind of plastic that melts.  </li>
            <li> It effectively cleared out all unwanted nose hairs for 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Good product works well and everything i wished they was more so</li>
            <li> It is nice to have this product instead of pulling or trimming nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> I liked the results</li>
            <li> I would have liked to see them be reusable in some way instead of tossing out lots of plastic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own lifestyle, get this and get that stuff out.</li>
            <li> Everything cleaned up nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very thorough for nose waxing if used correctly.</li>
            <li> I am my own hero.</li>
            <li> Very cool product!</li>
            <li> After spending time plucking, I was a bit nervous about trying this product, but it was fairly painless and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use .</li>
            <li> I have regrettably used nose hair trimmers and tweezers to try to groom myself but have found that waxing is by far, the best solution.  </li>
            <li> so be sure to have some tweezers handy.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice to have more applicators in the pack, so all of the product can be used without throwing out the unused portion.</li>
            <li> I bought Nads nose wax kit for the first time based on the great reviews, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions precisely, and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, virtually painless and very effective.</li>
            <li> It was pretty nice to be able to rip them all out in two good yanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great, removes all unwanted hair, easy to use, I find it extremely useful compared to nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> Easy and fairly pain free if done correctly.</li>
            <li> Applicators fit the nostril OK but easy to use, good results.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and very delighted with the results.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> As others have said, there is plenty of wax for more applications.</li>
            <li> This may work better for men though.  </li>
            <li> you are a guy, don&#x27;t hesitate for a moment to buy this thinking its a women&#x27;s product - we are the people who need it most, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Have recommended to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the directions fully.  </li>
            <li> I have tried trimmers for many years and they didn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> I decided to order more and give them out to my enemies.  </li>
            <li> , I figured I&#x27;d better not screw this up.</li>
            <li> better then</li>
            <li> Took me much longer to heat up my wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I just held a miniature spa day for my nostrils, they have never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> * if you do not follow the directions it will hurt a bit :)</li>
            <li> well I just paid over $8 to have this done in a salon and after leaving thought I could surely do that.</li>
            <li> My partner however was okay with it and prefers it.</li>
            <li> I team to have been blessed (not cursed) with a body covered mostly by hair.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully in time, my practice will lead to perfection and I will be able to get more hairs out at a time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a better alternative.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more plastic applicators and would like to know where to order more of them.</li>
            <li> Nearing 50, I have struggled with staying on top of my grooming.  </li>
            <li> This time I wanted something more thorough.  </li>
            <li> This was certainly more thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems these give more or a precision approach.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li> This stuff pulls the nose hair out for sure.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using this kit and will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> It has a paper pull off top</li>
            <li> If anyone can recommend a bulk wax product that would work like this wax works, it would sure be helpful.</li>
            <li> but once I used it I changed my mind and am pleased I bought it.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for better results.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve not been able to replicate the results.</li>
            <li> Can get many uses from one box.</li>
            <li> I went and bought popsicle sticks from walmart and can get many uses from the one thing of wax.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s safe)</li>
            <li> My daughter and I used to have this done at the salon, not any more.</li>
            <li> went after my son, he has a unibrow, not any more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Giving five stars even though I think more of the plastic applicators should be included.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I used to pay for this to be done, but now I can do it better myself</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just kinda a wierd feeling, which is literally working out to be about 1 a month or more between waxings.</li>
            <li> This works much better.</li>
            <li> However, with as awesome as the results are I would and will buy this product in the future without thinking twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so we haven&#x27;t tried it yet :)</li>
            <li> did have to insert the wax twice in each nostril just to make sure that I got all the hairs out.</li>
            <li> So the prices isn&#x27;t great for only two uses, but it is a good kit.</li>
            <li> and I wish it came with more sticks and nose sticks..</li>
            <li> They just want you to buy more kits, 8 uses instead of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> This company is BS-ing telling you to dump them out and buy more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it got about 99%, certainly more than I thought</li>
            <li> I went on and bought 10 more.</li>
            <li> but it is a must have for most of us.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> I have purchased it twice now and love it.</li>
            <li> I did not see a way to buy more plugs</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use, good product.</li>
            <li> When* I was able to get the wax to a good, usable consistency I had to work very fast to place the applicator in the nostril.</li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t seem like normal wax, it seems kind of like a plastic, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> This is a great wax kit that lasts for a decent while.  </li>
            <li> My nose looks very clean and no stubble.</li>
            <li> More like a strong pull feeling (I imagine its what velcro would feel like being pulled apart).  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great, if you run out of the nose applicators, just use wooden wax applicators the kind with the angled end...</li>
            <li> An amazing product, simple and VERY effective....</li>
            <li> As with most here, it worked fine for me</li>
            <li> I bought this kit and will use it again, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t do as good as job as the professionals...</li>
            <li> ---I recommend leaving the wax in close to the full 2 minutes, as the wax will adhere more securely to more hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t hurt, which was surprising.</li>
            <li> its really painless.&lt;br /&gt;You can also buy more wax cheaply and reuse the tub!!</li>
            <li> worked great and is very easy , and at 52 of age beats trimming constantly , also it is easy and pain free.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as I had envisioned</li>
            <li> This product is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> it was really easy.</li>
            <li> The directions were really easy to follow</li>
            <li> Easy to use, virtually painless</li>
            <li> This product works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> so I get the visible nose hairs and this stuff is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I used the method described by another reviewers (i.e. freeze the applicator and the wax is easily removed) to reuse them.</li>
            <li> wax is so easy to use</li>
            <li> The directions are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> , some folks recommended freezing the applicators for reuse, but I just reheated them (for about 3 1/2 minutes) and then used paper towels to remove the wax/hair and it was easy</li>
            <li> This product is sooooo easy to use and is so painless (I know it looks like it should hurt</li>
            <li> Painless and easy.</li>
            <li> This is much easier and much more effective.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend cleaning and reusing the applicators or you&#x27;ll run out way before you run out of wax</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and make sure it doesn&#x27;t cool off before applying.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as effective as I wanted on the first try.</li>
            <li> This wax is more aggressive and stings more as you rip your noise hair out, but you get a whole lot more wax 14oz vs 1.6oz  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly, you may need to down each nostril twice to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> This wax comes out easily, too, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m guessing a huge majority</li>
            <li> I can breathe through my nose again, which represents a huge leap forward in the evolutionary timeline of my/our species.</li>
            <li> The safety applicator is HUGE for my nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It still leaves the hair deeper in your nose, which have important health</li>
            <li> The kit is simple, instructions are great, and they give you everything you need.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming for years using an electric trimmer, with much success I might add, but my nose hairs just kept getting thicker and causing me more discomfort.</li>
            <li> I just wait until the wax hardens and it comes off easily then clean it with alcohol</li>
            <li> I am still kinda in shock as to how pain free it was.  </li>
            <li> This wax set is great and this is already the 3rd set i bought!</li>
            <li> Great item,  last longer than plucking, and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> I have no idea who thinks this is pain free.</li>
            <li> messy and and perfect</li>
            <li> After two applications for each nostril he was nose hair free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely not a nose waxing expert, but this worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;know a guy&amp;#34; who grows such great amounts of nostril hair he has to grow a mustache just to match.</li>
            <li> 5 stars means this product would be perfect and it is not perfect but it is quite good</li>
            <li> In the process of doing so, I realized just how much obstruction the hair causes in my nostrils, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed easier, and more efficient breathing</li>
            <li> Watch videos online to see how others do it, super easy and fulfilling to get rid of those offending you-know-whats.</li>
            <li> Quick easy and rather painless considering alternatives.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions carefully it is super easy.  </li>
            <li> This kit is super simple and works great.  </li>
            <li> Using the spoon to stir before the actual application doesn&#x27;t do much good either, because the wax dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> But I contacted the company and they were kind enough to send me more, free of charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pretty satisfied</li>
            <li> Seemed expensive but this kind of relief is priceless.  </li>
            <li> Also it seems wasteful that the applicators are not reusable; the remnant wax won&#x27;t clean off.  </li>
            <li> This took some doing to clean it out.  </li>
            <li> but one reviewer said you can easily clean them by freezing them.  </li>
            <li> but it feels clean</li>
            <li> - - - if you need a clean nose, you cannot beat this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To clean the applicators for re-use, get as much wax off as you can then put them in a coffee cup you don&#x27;t care about filled most of the way with water.</li>
            <li> then I realized I wanted to keep my nose clean all the time, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the pro to do it.  </li>
            <li> Truly, you have no idea how hairy the inside of your nose is until you clean it out.  </li>
            <li> Though some people have stated they could clean off and reuse the plastic applicators.</li>
            <li> I want to just add that you can (and you need to) clean off&lt;br /&gt;the applicators so you can reuse them.</li>
            <li> its really painless.&lt;br /&gt;You can also buy more wax cheaply and reuse the tub!!w to do it.</li>
            <li> Evective, clean and painless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy-to-use, smelt pleasant and totally worked.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I listened to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in early may and have gone more than a month without visible nose hairs!  </li>
            <li> wax itself is nothing special.</li>
            <li> Right, yeeeouch!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely excellent product, hard wax that will yank that nose hair out by the fistful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tweezers, manual/powered nose trimmers, even shaving the nostrils externally (which is good in a pinch, but can cut the skin on your nose)</li>
            <li> Not painful either, just dip the applicator in the wax and shove up your nose.</li>
            <li> The wax is good and different from the one at the salons.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;This was great for getting rid of pesky nose hair quickly and easily; however I think the company could have come up with a less wasteful design.  </li>
            <li> the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inserted the Q-tip with the cotton removed into the warmed wax, swirled it about, stuck it up my nose and then let it cool for about 75 seconds.</li>
            <li> it to let the wax cool a bit and be evenly distributed on the applicator</li>
            <li> I will also say now I am really noticing more then ever</li>
            <li> They really should provide more applicators though.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I did it right the first time, I tried again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;After 40 the hair that stopped growing on other places on my body started coming out of my nose</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wax does break off the applicators pretty easily to reuse them.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does as promised it removes nose hairs quickly and without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a mustache and there is a convenient protector that is mildly adhesive and protects the mustache .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started looking for a trimmer because my nose hair is getting more an more dominant as I am headed solidly into my 4th decade on this planet.</li>
            <li> Waited 90-100 seconds and then pulled quickly with one switch motion.</li>
            <li> The package arrived quick.</li>
            <li> I grabbed ahold of the stick and prepared to quickly pull it out and thought nothing</li>
            <li> One quick yank and I had miniature furry popsicle of wax and hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than trimming and is more effective at getting to the harder to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until using this, I&#x27;d gently try my razor or electric nose trimmer with OK success.  </li>
            <li> wax really does break off cleanly!</li>
            <li> but it works good as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Accomplished the job quickly and easily</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good is simple to do and after your first time pulls alot easier each time,,not</li>
            <li> But it was well-worth it to get a funny video (taken by my daughter!)</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time tonight and was amazed!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back again, I breathe much better now!</li>
            <li> Wear gloves as it will be hot!  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, there are very few waxing products tailored for men and while male waxing is still taboo for the most part, what guy wouldn&#x27;t want to look his best?</li>
            <li> Application was fairly easy but the wax turns to concrete fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> only highly intelligent people can grasp the concept of a baby skin smooth inner nostril,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great because I was so apprehensive to use it on such a sensitive</li>
            <li> I’ve had marginal success using the product on nose hair.</li>
            <li> Was the amount of pain worth the desired results?  </li>
            <li> this product is worth your time.</li>
            <li> One of the fun places it tends to sprout is in my nose.  </li>
            <li> But it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> And it worked so awesome that I am recommending it to every guy I know who is annoyed with nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> this is kind of gross</li>
            <li> they work well for ears...  not that useful for a nose blackhead remover- use nasal strips for that.  </li>
            <li> its ok otherwise, just expected more after those raving reviews.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of work to get the wax heated up just right and do all the prep work, but the result is so worth it.</li>
            <li> True, there are NOT enough applicators, but this product works effectively and most critically, painlessly.</li>
            <li> + times if you do it right.</li>
            <li> It will take some practice to heat the wax to the correct consistency and to get the timing right of it setting in your nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this as there is no other product like this on the market and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, nothing will make your significant other laugh more than you walking around the house with a plastic handle dangling from your nose while you feel super self-conscious about wax-related hair</li>
            <li> Works great for men&#x27;s nostril hair, which is usually thicker.</li>
            <li> I might try the wooden popsicle sticks next time - I suspect the wood will do a better job of gathering and holding the warm wax.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and dark hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, just give it a nice hard tug, and be satisfied when you see how it got even the smallest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works, and is not very painful at all.</li>
            <li> directions are clear and the product is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have been going to get it done professionally, but this works better and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I fixed this problem by using q-tips to apply the wax to the easy to each places of the nose.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t hurt if  you pull quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very much</li>
            <li> used as directed on surface of nose to clean pores and remove a single follicle , also easy and great , just follow directions and use a stopwatch or stopwatch app on a smart phone dip little ball on end of applicator into warmed wax</li>
            <li> Best to clean the tools as they don&#x27;t provide enough to empty the wax, but that&#x27;s not a big chore.  </li>
            <li> It removes massive amounts of nose hair, safely.  </li>
            <li> But it hurts like nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt before the first time you try it.  </li>
            <li> same price or better here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!  </li>
            <li> Waxing your upper lip hurts more so if you can stand that you are all set.</li>
            <li> So, I did it again in each nostril, and it pulled even more hairs, which at that point I felt a completely different sensation in my nose...</li>
            <li> But it worked really well, and is worth every funny/painful moment.</li>
            <li> Just got this and tried it for the first time....</li>
            <li> First off, pros</li>
            <li> This thing worked, and the first time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not difficult; you just have to do it right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I heated it again for one more minute and did it a second time.  </li>
            <li> ;) Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy(31) and was interested in using this after I saw it on a website .  </li>
            <li> As a married man I have a wife always commenting on things that need addressing, nose hair being one of them.</li>
            <li> there was that much in there!</li>
            <li> Two things to keep in mind - be SURE to give this wax enough time to harden - like 90+ seconds.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t throw away the used sticks, wash them off with hot water or freeze em&#x27; to get the wax off.</li>
            <li> We use popsicle sticks, coated well and then just up the nose, not too deep then twist to make sure you get all the hair around the opening of your nostril.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be getting more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> my first attempt).</li>
            <li> Well enough to be completely satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li> Sure, it worked well enough.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was pretty grossed out by the used applicators, so I just thew them out.</li>
            <li> applications unless you have only one or more than 2 nasal passages!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough wax in the tub for a hundred or more applications!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> the first time I used it I had a lot of hair and it hurt anyway.</li>
            <li> 3 times the first day to get rid of all the hair.</li>
            <li> This likely forces some customers to buy more kits before they are out of wax, but Nads disguises this as &amp;#34;helping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> and my business is suddenly booking more clients than ever before</li>
            <li> Sure, none of that is necessarily connected to the nose waxing, but it did all happen AFTER I started waxing.</li>
            <li> Only wish there were more applicators or</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted to use on my husband</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> You have to follow the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> Then I use that hot knife to take chunks of GiGi wax out of its container and put it into the Nad&#x27;s container.  </li>
            <li> That is 9 times more wax for only $11.50 vs $18 for another Nad&#x27;s kit.  </li>
            <li> But pretty painless.</li>
            <li> first you nuke the wax.  </li>
            <li> Well this product really helped with that!</li>
            <li> Had to apply few times to get the result, good if you like pain...</li>
            <li> Easy, mess free, and quick.</li>
            <li> I had good results when using it on my nose, really helps remove black heads.  </li>
            <li> A life without the extremely long nose hair is definitely one that&#x27;s more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> tonight!!!&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with 8 insert stocks, if you use the flat end of the sticks to treat the surface of your nose you will be able use all the wax at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pretty scared to use this product but my desire to not have long nose hairs itching my nose was much greater.</li>
            <li> Does the job right because really who wants a hairy nose?</li>
            <li> works good and very little pain.</li>
            <li> As this is my first time waxing nose hairs, I am very content with the results after immediate use.</li>
            <li> Removed 90% of my nose hair which I am not sure is a good thing</li>
            <li> but it is easy and gets lots of tiny hairs out.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t trim my nose hairs first (and I am a VERY hairy guy, with way too much hair in places you do not need hair)</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, with certain death on the line</li>
            <li> Fast and easy and relatively painless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully next time will be easier since the key seems to be to make sure you heat it up much longer than the directions say and if you have stubborn hairs, leave it in your nostrils a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> , my wife and I just got approved for a new home (much larger, much more modern than where we&#x27;ve been), and wife is hotter than ever.</li>
            <li> I held a paper towel over my upper lip and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Have a blob of warm wax grab virtually every tender, little nose hair and</li>
            <li> with a little trial and error, was able to achieve mission success.</li>
            <li> The instructions and cautions are clear (it even includes pictures), the supplies are plentiful for more than a one time use, it is quick, and other than the anticipation</li>
            <li> Works very well, just ish</li>
            <li> Ive gone my whole life plucking the strays</li>
            <li> the glory that follows is only known to the people that posses this product and are intelligent enough to use it properly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and Im much happier with the Nads results.</li>
            <li> However, my nose was very tender for about two days afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the real jewel is the applicators.</li>
            <li> I have way too much nose hair.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think it would.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really hurt either, just feels like all the blood rushes to my hose at once.</li>
            <li> I really dislike nose hair.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have much wax to use them with.</li>
            <li> Used this on my boyfriend and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real PITA to scrub it out.  </li>
            <li> I got this product, and it really works.</li>
            <li> Absolutely painless.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Nads!</li>
            <li> It really changed my life (n-n)</li>
            <li> We are so fascinated with this that the whole family used it.</li>
            <li> thanks PRIME) and</li>
            <li> If you pluck your nose hairs, try this as you will be amazed at how painless it really is.  </li>
            <li> This was absolutely painless....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than waxing at a salon every month.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think it would.  </li>
            <li> I then pulled it out as fast as I could.  </li>
            <li> Run the whole thing in microwave for 2.5 minutes.</li>
            <li> wax is absolutely tenacious when fully hardened and it will yank out any hair</li>
            <li> I got two sinus infections after using this product because I removed so much hair from my nostrils.</li>
            <li> I have a really hairy nose</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, but the wax takes much longer then prescribed to melt to a somewhat workable consistency.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as you&#x27;d think.  </li>
            <li> it really works..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> also need to push it up until its snug and hold it there, not let it dangle.&lt;br /&gt;You need to yank it out as fast as you can for it to be painless, believe it or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You would have never thought that much hair is up your honker and I will say ever since I have done this</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I thought I knew how much hair was up there.</li>
            <li> the point: this product works very well.</li>
            <li> And the hair stays away much much longer than plucking or clipping.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t get it for the pore cleaning as I did not think much of that.</li>
            <li> (however, there IS a ton of wax provided and it will most likely last me a year or more, even with multiple applications per use).&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so fast-</li>
            <li> Hardens a bit too fast.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> The wax stuck to the more sensitive edges of my nostrils, causing some pain later when I had to scrap it off.  </li>
            <li> In a matter of a few minutes, it was effective.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> It works as expected for nostrils and despite my imagination pulling it fast and in one motion works :-)  </li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re just only so effective), for a total of four applicators per use.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many trimming devices and none has worked as good as this not to mention that one would need to repeat less frequently compared to typical trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that more sticks should be included</li>
            <li> The other mystery to me is why the wax container does not have a screw on top.</li>
            <li> New as could be!  </li>
            <li> On more than half of the occasions I’ve used it, I was left with most of the wax stuck inside my nose, which then had to be peeled out bit by bit, all the while plucking individual hairs out in the process.</li>
            <li> but now I do it more regularly, less cost and on my schedule.  </li>
            <li> Super simple!  </li>
            <li> from my experience it did not hurt - I also had to use it twice to do a decent job.</li>
            <li> I have tweezed, pulled, cut and tried all kinds of things with the results being a super sore nose or ingrown hairs that totally suck.</li>
            <li> you could buy extra since there is enough  for more waxings.  </li>
            <li> mainly because each nostril will require two times.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all your nose hair removal needs.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to someone seeking a long-term alternative to trimming.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions, although I may have put applied a bit more wax than the pictures illustrate (a little would come out of my nostril when I inserted.</li>
            <li> said jungle, it leaves behind a lot of the little fine hairs that only show up in bright light, which is what I was hoping to eliminate.</li>
            <li> I much prefer using the waxing pot with sticks at home that NAD&#x27;s device, which does not give you professional results.</li>
            <li> The ball on the end of the applicator is much tinier than it appears and it barely goes into your nostril, so it doesn&#x27;t remove much hair at all.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised the first time I had my nose hair waxed professionally that there is no pain at all...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or leaves residue like normal wax.</li>
            <li> It gums up quickly if the consistency is just right (just a little thicker than honey).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite possible to heat the wax to a burning temperature if you don&#x27;t do it right.  </li>
            <li> I put the white nose things in the freezer for about 10 minutes if that then tapped on them which a butter knife and the wax and hair come right off in the garbage can.  </li>
            <li> will have to trim more frequently, but it&#x27;s easier, less painful, and more effective.</li>
            <li> Rather than try to find a new pro, I tried Amazon.  </li>
            <li> But you&#x27;ll live</li>
            <li> But after two tries per nostril my nose was clean.  </li>
            <li> directions sound more complicated than it needs to be, though.  </li>
            <li> wait for it to dry then yank quickly.  </li>
            <li> Works well, not hard to apply, very gentle with skin, easy to clean residue from skin but hard from other places like tile or counters</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the wax container doesn&#x27;t have a lid that fits securely over the jar after you first open it, but once the wax hardens back up</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive nose and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> lowered the price from $19.99 to $13.99 - far more realistic for the small amount of wax supplied&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> but if you put the applicator in the freezer (in a plastic baggie) you can easily remove the wax from the applicator and reuse it as long as you have wax left.  </li>
            <li> easy to use, have thick nose hair and this thing better than any other trimmer</li>
            <li> Directions are simple, and the product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> Have to due many times to get the proper job.  </li>
            <li> Used this product and for first the time my nose is not itching me constantly!  </li>
            <li> It removed way more hair than I do when plucking, and without all the watery eyes / sinus explosion that I usually experience with plucking.</li>
            <li> That was only after I did it the first time after heating for around 6 minutes</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> This got virtually every hair and was completely painless!  </li>
            <li> Initially I was worried about getting burned but the wax never seems to get that hot.</li>
            <li> It was the first time I had ever waxed my nose hair, and it will not be my last.</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive nosehairs (it hurts to tweeze!)</li>
            <li> This actually worked really well!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the wax can drip on your facial hair causing clean up to be difficult--and possibly painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleaned one nostril quite well, the other it didn&#x27;t clean even after two attempts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> worked exactly as described, little pain but worth the result</li>
            <li> All the other reviews can pretty much fill you in on it</li>
            <li> After my wax ran out I decided to order GiGi Brazilian Body Hard Wax, 14 Ounce  instead of reordering Nad&#x27;s because you get a lot more wax.  </li>
            <li> and it is really hard to find someone who does it right or is even willing to do it at all!</li>
            <li> no wonder trimming and pulling didn&#x27;t work - way too many to get using tweezers - this product pulls out dozens of hairs at a time - I was shocked by how many).  </li>
            <li> The step process is clear to read and</li>
            <li> The product has clear instructions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparison to my old method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have my nose waxed professionally, but after moving, I let it slide.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the wax in too far with these.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the aggravation and just get it done by a professional</li>
            <li> it is nearly painless</li>
            <li> Maybe I put too much wax on my applicator, but I&#x27;d say there is enough wax for about 10 applications.</li>
            <li> and it is the price of having it done once professionally.  </li>
            <li> All of the hair in my nose near the opening were just plucked in one yank.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the container plastic started to melt, but it still did not feel like &amp;#34;hard honey,&amp;#34; or at least I wasn&#x27;t sure if it did.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old kit</li>
            <li> Surprised how painless this was and how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> It was so simple to use and very thorough in the nose hair removal.  </li>
            <li> He will thank you, from a professional standpoint of course.</li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t all that precise about heating up the wax, or even coating the applicator, and while I did time the thing I don&#x27;t think letting it go outside of the 90-120 second window they state would be a big problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it only comes with a few applicators so you have to be creative.  </li>
            <li> But let it sit for about 3 minutes after to cool down</li>
            <li> I should mention that I&#x27;ve never waxed anything on my body before, so waxing in general was a new experience.</li>
            <li> a word of caution, be careful about waxing again right away if you notice that you missed some nose hair, it can tear the tender flesh (which hurts, and takes a while to heal).</li>
            <li> Again, left behind so many hairs that I waited a couple hours to give my nose a break and heated up the jar again for around 7 minutes and left it in a full two minutes each nostril.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sensitive about the monkey fist of hair that grows in my nose, and thought that yanking on a plastic stick that has been melded to said monkey fist with melted wax would be my last experience before death, having ripped the brain right out of my skull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe you could scrap the wax off the flat service into the trash without too much trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> little tricky at first but easy to use and honestly didnt hurt nearly as bad as the eyebrows and it last much longer than using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I saw this posted on a celebrity gossip blog as one of the most ridiculous products ever, but nose hair is one of my biggest pet peeves.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;, stick it in nostril , time to a minimum 90 seconds maximum 120 seconds , pull quickly and clean with provided anti-bacterial wipe , repeat on other nostril , then I used spatula on other end to apply to each side of surface of nose , wait 30 seconds and peel one corner and pull quickly to deep clean skin , I recommend disposing of applicators due to the possibility of transmitting bacteria , and there are plenty of extra applicators and mustache protectors to last a long time , and at this price , I anticipate it will last a year , before I need another kit, super product.</li>
            <li> a little but not bad</li>
            <li> It works, but dries very fast, be careful you do not go beyond time they say on the package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old guy with very hairy nostrils, they got all the hair in the front of my nose (the stuff the is unsightly and irritates), and left the helpful hair in the far back.</li>
            <li> I had a small cheap electric trimmer that broke to I came on Amazon looking for one</li>
            <li> Once you jury rig the Q-tips by removing the cotton and figure out how long to heat the wax, the wax works really.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a small plastic tub filled with wax that you melt in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;One minute</li>
            <li> they probably forgot long ago air is supposed to go through there, hahahahaha.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gross and my wife was disgusted but it worked a lot better than the applicators supplied by NAD&#x27;s (love that name!).</li>
            <li> I tried 4x overall on different occasions and it was to much hassle.</li>
            <li> agree with previous comments, you almost have to reuse the applicators to make this purchase even close to worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li> It appears that leaving the product in place too long is better than leaving it in to briefly, but it’s all a little too inexact for me.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to mess around with clippers, this is a simple way to clean things up.</li>
            <li> Do be aware that unlike shaving off your mustache people may notice the naked look above you lip but it is not likely they will mention it, nor will they pay you a compliment.</li>
            <li> Many other reviewers comment that there was little or no pain</li>
            <li> I got ahold of him, got the wax properly warmed and dipped the applicator twice to give it a nice thick blob, then stuffed it up his nose and twisted a bit to make sure all the ickies were coated.</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I was skeptical, but after reading several positive reviews, I decided to go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your nose stinging for a little after, but definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Works great for nose hair, I gave four stars cause it missed a few hairs down low and also because it didn&#x27;t work well for black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was relatively painless!</li>
            <li> But it barely hurt at all.</li>
            <li> It requires that you direct the insert into different angles to get into some areas.</li>
            <li> It sounded weird, but I liked the idea of removing, rather than trimming the hair, so I thought I&#x27;d try</li>
            <li> and I was looking for better, but this product is way worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might work if you I first spent a half hour first removing every last hair (like with the electric nose hair trimmer)</li>
            <li> of me laughing hysterically - first because standing there holding a stick inside of my nose for almost a minute looked ridiculous, and secondly because after the first yank I knew I was absolutely stuck &amp; committed to another HARDER yank.  </li>
            <li> Used only once so far and only purchased for nose hair.  </li>
            <li> and it left behind so many hairs</li>
            <li> A little timid at first, but read some helpful reviews.  </li>
            <li> Took a little nerve to pull the first time.  </li>
            <li> but the wax did take heating for around 7 full minutes before it finally got to the consistency of thick honey.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer mean&#x27;t by three applications--it comes with several applicators and enough wax for at least that many uses.  </li>
            <li> They could easily cut them in half and have provided twice the nose applicators with the same amount of plastic, but they wanted to screw us over my adding the flat side to all of them (could have just done a couple and doubled up on round ends on the rest).  </li>
            <li> Did not clean up the area around the entrance to the nostrils very well.  </li>
            <li> But the price is a little too much.</li>
            <li> I only wish you got a few more applicators in the pack since it seems to be impossible to clean and reuse them.</li>
            <li> So you are encasing all those tiny little nose hairs in concrete, then ripping them out in one fell swoop.  </li>
            <li> These work really well, although it is a pretty complex and messy process.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve done is cleaned off the nose applicators afterwards and used them with other sensitive area waxes if I&#x27;m in between buying these kits.</li>
            <li> very carefully followed the instructions, and was pleasantly surprised how NON-PAINFUL this product is to use.  </li>
            <li> it was all the little hairs inside tickling it constantly with every breath, especially the hairs near the nose openings.  </li>
            <li> Now this may not apply to the flat applicator for use in spreading wax on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Still had to trim some of the inner hairs not near the nostrils.  </li>
            <li> you use it once every two weeks then it will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The kit comes with enough wax to take care of my entire family tree, but only enough applicators for me and two other sturdy Norsemen.</li>
            <li> It takes about 10 minutes of prep, followed by half a second of minor pain (very minor, and then it&#x27;s over), and, wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old black man</li>
            <li> Scary as it may seem, its easy to use and painless.  </li>
            <li> As for pain, as long as you heat the wax for 1 1/2 minutes or so and leave cool off(till a little thick, but kinda runny) and place in nose and TIME it for just under 2 minutes it actually is quite painless.  </li>
            <li> Obviously there is plenty of wax for several uses but there are only six sticks, which I received only 5 sticks, missing one from the packaging.  </li>
            <li> My husband has always complained about how fast his nose hair grows so I decided to get this for him to try.</li>
            <li> I credit using 2-3 inserts per nostril to having a big nose and above average hair count.</li>
            <li> I mean sure the first yank can be a little scary but</li>
            <li> made my cry too long.</li>
            <li> -&lt;br /&gt;Learning curve for how long to heat the wax</li>
            <li> every 3-4 weeks...could be stretched longer.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> but you ran out of nose plugs long before you ran out of wax.  </li>
            <li> I have my 2nd half of the set left.</li>
            <li> Nose hair trimmers left me with sharp hairs that irritated my nose.</li>
            <li> - - i&#x27;m going back to by little teeny tiny scissors</li>
            <li> which was a big turn off for other products.  </li>
            <li> a star due to not enough applicators (but then again they&#x27;d probably just jack the price up a bit).  </li>
            <li> For the price of this kit, you can buy about a pound of decent hard wax at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the wax dry in your nose</li>
            <li> Without nose hair the mucus tends to dry on the insides of the nostrils, on the skin itself.  </li>
            <li> goodbye single serving tweezers.</li>
            <li> negative thing I have to say is it really doesn&#x27;t seem like it comes with enough of the tools for nose hair removal as you use so little wax in the process.  </li>
            <li> Usually have my sister, a salon professional, wax my nostrils.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is they it doesn&#x27;t come with enough of the applicators, because you can really only use one per nostril.</li>
            <li> Over time, less hair grows back.</li>
            <li> A slight shock/mild sting during the initial tug</li>
            <li> For the uninitiated, it will sting and be uncomfortable but the feeling resides quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a total mess</li>
            <li> I guarantee not matter what you do, you will be left with a mess, blocked nostrils and flecks of wax all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it to reach a little further into the nose though.  </li>
            <li> All you feel is a &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and all those gross little things are out of your nose.</li>
            <li> Especially with products like this where detailed instruction is critical, I found it very disappointing.</li>
            <li> how many dudes I know need this badly with their fu-man-choo forest coming out of their nostrils</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that pulling all your nose hairs out at once would be dozens of times more painful than tweezing just one</li>
            <li> I think it would be much more painful and ticklish to pluck.</li>
            <li> As I said, I&#x27;m hairy everywhere, and removing even a bandaid from my arms or legs involves a lot of hair removal that is WAY more painful than this.  </li>
            <li> The wax actually wasn&#x27;t really that uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> I guess as a woman with somewhat finer nose hairs, they are harder to grip with the wax.</li>
            <li> , believe me, it works like a charm and only takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> As I have aged it has gotten</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this varies widely across users.</li>
            <li> I always end up missing one or two, and it&#x27;s such a hassle.</li>
            <li> You only get a few sticks in the package and when you are done you toss them out.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not really what I&#x27;m after.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not much of an issue of it leaking.</li>
            <li> I think I should have left it a few seconds longer.</li>
            <li> I had my nose done at a wax center</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as I expected and too pricy for 3 applications.</li>
            <li> My nose was sore for a few days after, but only noticeable when I touched it.</li>
            <li> only need the round ends.  </li>
            <li> that I cut the dowels with a Craftsman razor shear to about an inch and half long for nasal use.</li>
            <li> After two minutes in my normal microwave, the wax was very hard.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, my quest to make my nostrils a little less gross continues...</li>
            <li> waxing may sound a little scary, and while a bit messy</li>
            <li> Mucus typically is drawn to the tips of your nose hair where is dries and forms solid substances that can be removed without too much trouble.  </li>
            <li> One sharp pull, and it worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely made my life easier, but if I weren&#x27;t so lazy</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time plucking it with tweezers, which is a pretty uncomfortable process.</li>
            <li> It took 2 inserts in one nostril and 3 in the other.</li>
            <li> I usually use a nose trimmer and that does the job for a while, but the jungle of hair grows back!  </li>
            <li> I have used other Nads products before, so I didn&#x27;t hesitate purchasing this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a small chunk of the wax adhere to one nasal hair that escaped being yanked out and it looks like a giant booger suspended in your nose.</li>
            <li> Excessive use of alcohol prior to using this product is NOT recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> find that I usually have a lot of wax left over after running out of the plastic applicators</li>
            <li> The pain from pulling out the applicator stick was minor, and subsided within a few seconds.</li>
            <li> A sharp one will cut or nick</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for it&#x27;s other purposes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now waxing once every other week</li>
            <li> I usually have to use two applicators per nostril (I&#x27;m not especially hairy</li>
            <li> Kinda scary at first</li>
            <li> I was careful with the insertion of the wax covered applicator and held the mustache down as I inserted the applicator.  </li>
            <li> You will want to follow the instructions VERY carefully.</li>
            <li> Next time I plan on applying a thin layer of hand lotion to the edges of my nostrils to prevent that from happening next time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my nostrils at a salon as well as using hard wax with a warming pot and wooden waxing sticks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having long, thick, and over abundant hair in your nose sucks really bad.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll end up with at least 1/2 tub of wax but no applicators left.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, time, or effort.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, getting wax stuck in your mustache is NOT a fun experience.</li>
            <li> At that price point it should be at least double the size.</li>
            <li> The wax can be messy if you aren&#x27;t careful so take some</li>
            <li> wasteful of money and more crap in the dump that is never fully used.</li>
            <li> and I wish I could just buy a larger can of the wax alone without all the stupid &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; extras..ER room laughing in the back of my head as I envisioned my inevitable emergency room visit looking for medical care for a scorched nostril because I overheated</li>
            <li> The ONLY complaint I have is that I I wish it was a little but cheaper</li>
            <li> Having found myself with persistent nose hair problems at far too young of an age, and plucking being a never-ending, painful regimen, I decided to give this</li>
            <li> I thought it would be horrifically painful, but honestly, I find waxing my eyebrows to hurt much worse.</li>
            <li> Broke one in half and placed in the wax and put in my nose.  </li>
            <li> It does look odd when you have to yank, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t watch yourself in the mirror...</li>
            <li> microwave it for about two and half minutes</li>
            <li> wish I could just buy the wax itself and skip the kit with all the applicators, wipes and the odd &amp;#34;moustache covers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking at this product for the advertised black head removal</li>
            <li> Less chance to hesitate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am now just hoping that I will need the waxing less often than alternative measures</li>
            <li> Also with less hair</li>
            <li> Also with less hair</li>
            <li> I closely followed the directions, but it did not work, was painful, and I ended up with a nose full of wax.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes makes my nose run a little bit and be slightly sore.  </li>
            <li> I would give it five stars if the applicator was a little longer so hairs slightly deeper in the nose could also be removed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the words to adequately describe how painful the removal process is.  </li>
            <li> Had to use it 3 times to get all the little hairs out (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man in my 20s, and my nose hair gets a little out of control already.</li>
            <li> For 20 bucks, I feel that is just a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it for my nose, eyebrows and other small areas.</li>
            <li> It did hurt a bit and burned for a little bit afterward.</li>
            <li> Just remember to let the wax harden in your nostril for a little while before you pull.  </li>
            <li> Can be a little messy.  </li>
            <li> It is as hard as hard plastic when you open it from the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, finding time in our busy schedules was at times difficult.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, nothing gets the majority except the old fashioned tweezer method.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m freezing my applicators for future use, but alas</li>
            <li> Tried product twice with same poor results.</li>
            <li> A waste of my time, energy and money.</li>
            <li> I peeled the wax off the applicators and will reuse as there&#x27;s a lot of wax for the few applicators they put in the kit.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions fully, this product will get 95% of the hair out in one go, with a few plucks getting the rest.</li>
            <li> I firmly believe the lack of hair caused my allergies to increase resulting in sinus infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who hates dealing with nose hairs every few days.</li>
            <li> wax peels and is messy</li>
            <li> A bit messy to work with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 and always get a few visible hairs</li>
            <li> The applicators have a round end (for nose hair) and a spatula end (for skin applications).  </li>
            <li> Nor is it messy.</li>
            <li> Instructions manual was missing.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> It seemed like every few days they would grow out again.</li>
            <li> it pulled off a few off my mustache.</li>
            <li> Holy forest of black hair!</li>
            <li> This is easy to prepare &amp; insert, but I was shocked at how hard it was to yank out of my face!  </li>
            <li> The wax takes a little work to get off if you get it on any part of your body during the process but that my only real complaint.</li>
            <li> did buy some small wooded waxing sticks online to help get into all the little crevices that the included wand can miss.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> I  gave up on the supplied applicators, they are useless, especially with the little &amp;#34;shield&amp;#34; under the applicator ball.</li>
            <li> There was almost zero pain, hardly even a slight irritation.  </li>
            <li> Lately some wax has been left behind up there</li>
            <li> And I got to watch him squirm a little!</li>
            <li> is a relative thing, but this wasn&#x27;t even slightly painful to me, just a bit scary the first time you go to pull (because you don&#x27;t know what to expect).  </li>
            <li> :  The wax gets cold by the time you do the other nostril or outside the nose.  </li>
            <li> Very little result for the money, time and effort.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this small box kit.</li>
            <li> you have excessive nose hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pass this one up if you have been struggling in the past.  </li>
            <li> No more tweezers, this takes care of it in 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have had my eye brows waxed, my back waxed, and unfortunately my chest waxed.  </li>
            <li> And the amount of hair it pulled out was unbelievable</li>
            <li> - I have been unable to find it in a larger size.</li>
            <li> no more hair.</li>
            <li> Put the applicators in the freezer after you use them and the dried wax will crack/peel off, allowing you to use them again!</li>
            <li> I used nose hair trimers in the past, but they felt weird and the nose hair just grew back.</li>
            <li> I cleaned mine off and will use it again--the wax is hard as plastic when you are finished, so its not easy.  </li>
            <li> and it melts very uneven.</li>
            <li> I bought this being a little skeptical, but wanted to try something other than the nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> It is actually less painful than waxing my upper lip!  </li>
            <li> It is just a hard wax.</li>
            <li> Another 30 secs, still hard.  </li>
            <li> was in my nostrils without knowing if it wasn&#x27;t going to be too hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get %100 of the hairs out</li>
            <li> Waited 90 seconds, gripped hard and yanked.</li>
            <li> Always wait 90 seconds, then grip hard, hold the forehead and yank.</li>
            <li> I scrape off the wax into the trash with a dull knife.</li>
            <li> hard to use without a microwave.</li>
            <li> I was scared to use it, but it really hardly hurt at all.</li>
            <li> However, I think you can get at least 6 uses out of this kit</li>
            <li> but when you have to TUG IT OUT with a &amp;#34;strong yank&amp;#34;, i&#x27;m afraid my nose is going to rip open - - -</li>
            <li> and wow was it painful.</li>
            <li> I am a man, Ive got thick hair, and Ive always been self-conscious about a nose hair hanging out of my nostril.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately naps doesn&#x27;t sell the hard wax separately, because I don&#x27;t need the other stuff...</li>
            <li> It will still hurt (I mean, the product rips hair out of your nose), but if you prefer to do this sort of thing at home - this is the stuff you need.</li>
            <li> No more trimming for me!</li>
            <li> No more looking like a caveman!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less painful to pull all the hair out at once than pulling a single hair.</li>
            <li> It is a VERY small container.</li>
            <li> Might be TMI but seriously, gets rid of those creeping nose hair that protrude from my nostrils.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t try using this as a &amp;#34;blackhead remover.&amp;#34; I think that is a ridiculous thing to use a wax for.</li>
            <li> if you follow the directions is painless (seriously).  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with the included stick, and it just looked scary to stick that weird</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not a good</li>
            <li> but after a few times you&#x27;ll want to get drunk beforehand, feels like you are ripping all the skin out of your nostrils (but you aren&#x27;t,</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be shocked at all the gross nose hair that you have up there.  </li>
            <li> so it is essentially one time use &amp; the attempt to reuse failed failed failed.</li>
            <li> it is expensive product considering the small amount of wax. .</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s going to hurt even worse.  </li>
            <li> I am also confused as to why they put fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> The secret: freeze the applicators after use.</li>
            <li> My nose felt numb for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have gotten no more in grown hairs or sore spots from cutting etc.</li>
            <li> Sooo much less painful than plucking with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Burning the nose hairs with acid would probably be less painful.  </li>
            <li> The safetip is genius and is much less painful than how they do it at the salon.</li>
            <li> This was easier, less painful and a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> A little painful</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a T and was a little scared to pull out the wax, but once I did, I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> Painful, messy and did not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> you go slow because you are chicken</li>
            <li> So there, dumb eyebrow waxing lady!  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this!!!!</li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>
            <li> instructions are wrong.  </li>
            <li> are just wrong.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Supplied applicators were useless for me</li>
            <li> ; are useless, they kept falling off and you look like a tool with it stuck to your face.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about nose waxing but read an article about it in the huffpo and had to try.</li>
            <li> - prolifically!&lt;br /&gt;Regular waxing at the salon was expensive and time consuming and plucking is well...</li>
            <li> If you think you&#x27;re borderline disgusting and maybe possibly you&#x27;d benefit from nose waxing</li>
            <li> It was difficult to position it to work.</li>
            <li> I will try again and if my opinion changes, ill post again.</li>
            <li> its too expensive too</li>
            <li> Honestly, it is less painful that getting eye brows waxed!  </li>
            <li> Nose hair drives me crazy,</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve just been cutting the cotton tip off of Q-tips and dipping the stick into the wax to make use of the leftover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh well, hate the game.</li>
            <li> I hate trimming, I hate plucking, and I hate having long hair pop out of my nose anyway,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive :(</li>
            <li> you will be sorry!</li>
            <li> This kit is very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical in buying this product.</li>
            <li> I knew that nose hair trimmers were not addressing my problem, bit never realized how bad</li>
            <li> but this is going to hurt so bad....</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> this didnt hurt at all, i was shocked.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim one night after painfully plucking my nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> This product works 50% of the time and is painful 100% of the time.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find it painful at all</li>
            <li> (I never found salon waxing painful</li>
            <li> And not too painful.</li>
            <li> it looks painful but it is not.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I hate it tickling the inside of my nose, and eluding my attempts to retrieve it.  </li>
            <li> It is annoying, you are sticking this in your nose after all.</li>
            <li> I bought it anyway thinking it would pull the hairs, but also thinking I was going to get a bloody nose.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Forest\\&quot; was gone, and the annoying hair tickles were gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man, and I hate having to clip my nose hairs all the time.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on annoying, protruding and unsightly nose hair for men and women.</li>
            <li> as a matter of fact, they are listed in order from painful to excruciatingly painful.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Sounds painful doesn&#x27;t it, it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> yet my wife told me it&#x27;s very painful.  </li>
            <li> The result looks like nasty porcupines!</li>
            <li> Slightly painful, but would rather do that than have nose hair!!</li>
            <li> I reuse the applicators by sticking them in the freezer and popping off the used wax (a horrific find for my husband one afternoon).</li>
            <li> The sensation is shocking when you pull the waxing tool out of your nose, but I was amazed with the results.  </li>
            <li> I waxed both nostrils twice and was amazed and a bit disgusted by all of the hair that was removed.</li>
            <li> you probably are definitely completely disgusting.</li>
            <li> Within an hour you can clamp a Leatherman on the wax, twist the handle, and all of the wax will fall off, along with your nasty nose hair clump.</li>
            <li> Hated it!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t do a terribly thorough job...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Work&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I had never used a wax for removing hair before anywhere on my body.  And BTW, this is not wax, but some kind of plastic that melts.  It is as hard as hard plastic when you open it from the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison to my old method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Pain: I literally teared up every time I used tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;  With this Nad&#x27;s Nose Wax, I would not say it goes to the level of pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;  That&#x27;s great because I was so apprehensive to use it on such a sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Efficacy:  With tweezers I could only do one or two hairs at a time.&lt;br /&gt;  Since you have to see the individual hairs to pluck them, I could not get all the individual hairs.&lt;br /&gt;  With tweezers,  the final job was never completed properly.&lt;br /&gt;  With Nad&#x27;s Nose Wax I pulled numerous hairs at one time by area.&lt;br /&gt;  The final results were the perfection that I had only dreamed of previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely it will take longer for hairs to grow back and possibly some won&#x27;t grow back at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I’ve had marginal success using the product on nose hair. On more than half of the occasions I’ve used it, I was left with most of the wax stuck inside my nose, which then had to be peeled out bit by bit, all the while plucking individual hairs out in the process. It appears that leaving the product in place too long is better than leaving it in to briefly, but it’s all a little too inexact for me.</li>
            <li> After spending time plucking, I was a bit nervous about trying this product, but it was fairly painless and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works very well, just ish they sold the plastic parts separelty because you run out of those way before you run outed wax...</li>
            <li> Used only once so far and only purchased for nose hair.  It cleaned one nostril quite well, the other it didn&#x27;t clean even after two attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Problem:  Obviously there is plenty of wax for several uses but there are only six sticks, which I received only 5 sticks, missing one from the packaging.  What do you use after these sticks are used up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is anyone going to contact me to discuss this review?</li>
            <li> We were hesitant...that would be my boyfriend and I. We work on camera a lot and I felt it was time.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy-to-use, smelt pleasant and totally worked.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only I can encourage our parents to try it!</li>
            <li> I am a man, Ive got thick hair, and Ive always been self-conscious about a nose hair hanging out of my nostril. I hate it tickling the inside of my nose, and eluding my attempts to retrieve it.  You can say its just nature, I say its gross.  Ive gone my whole life plucking the strays, I looked online one day to see if there was any type of waxing product for nostrils, and behold... the perfect solution.  Directions are simple, and the product does exactly what it says.  It removes massive amounts of nose hair, safely.  Did it hurt?  Yes.  Was the amount of pain worth the desired results?  Definitely.  I will be using this product from now on... goodbye single serving tweezers.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely amazing.  It wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Sooo much less painful than plucking with tweezers. Nose hair trimmers left me with sharp hairs that irritated my nose. The wax actually wasn&#x27;t really that uncomfortable at all. Saves me A LOT of nose scratching throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Can cause infection. Have to due many times to get the proper job.  Not recommended</li>
            <li> Usually have my sister, a salon professional, wax my nostrils. However, finding time in our busy schedules was at times difficult. Decided to try this small box kit. I&#x27;m a big fan!! Easy and fairly pain free if done correctly. Would recommend to anyone. As others have said, there is plenty of wax for more applications. Save the applicators.</li>
            <li> One sharp pull, and it worked like a charm.  Will not use tweezers or trimmers again.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly effective!  Put the used wands in the freezer to remove the wax.  I laid on my back, inserted the waxed wand in to let the wax drips in deeper.  I even tried to suck air in.  The result looks like nasty porcupines!</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully. It will still hurt (I mean, the product rips hair out of your nose), but if you prefer to do this sort of thing at home - this is the stuff you need. I prefer the privacy over the pain. I needed to contact Nads with a question and they answered immediately.</li>
            <li> This only got about 20% of my nose hairs.  Unfortunately, nothing gets the majority except the old fashioned tweezer method.  This may work better for men though.  I guess as a woman with somewhat finer nose hairs, they are harder to grip with the wax.</li>
            <li> Does the job right because really who wants a hairy nose?</li>
            <li> Nose hair drives me crazy, even if people can&#x27;t see it, it drives me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers, manual/powered nose trimmers, even shaving the nostrils externally (which is good in a pinch, but can cut the skin on your nose) - I&#x27;ve tried them all, and they just don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nose waxing may sound a little scary, and while a bit messy, believe me, it works like a charm and only takes a few minutes. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, just give it a nice hard tug, and be satisfied when you see how it got even the smallest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still leaves the hair deeper in your nose, which have important health function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a guy, don&#x27;t hesitate for a moment to buy this thinking its a women&#x27;s product - we are the people who need it most, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Since learning to nasal wax, I can finally breath and feel well groomed also</li>
            <li> 5 stars means this product would be perfect and it is not perfect but it is quite good so 4 stars is what it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does as promised it removes nose hairs quickly and without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it remove all the hairs? No&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was I happy it got most of the hairs? Very much so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I but this product again after I finish this package? Yes.</li>
            <li> Works well, not hard to apply, very gentle with skin, easy to clean residue from skin but hard from other places like tile or counters</li>
            <li> only highly intelligent people can grasp the concept of a baby skin smooth inner nostril, I mean sure the first yank can be a little scary but the glory that follows is only known to the people that posses this product and are intelligent enough to use it properly. Say goodbye to your nose forest and hello to glory</li>
            <li> It works great, removes all unwanted hair, easy to use, I find it extremely useful compared to nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> worked great and is very easy , and at 52 of age beats trimming constantly , also it is easy and pain free. I have a mustache and there is a convenient protector that is mildly adhesive and protects the mustache .&lt;br /&gt;also used as directed on surface of nose to clean pores and remove a single follicle , also easy and great , just follow directions and use a stopwatch or stopwatch app on a smart phone dip little ball on end of applicator into warmed wax&lt;br /&gt;, stick it in nostril , time to a minimum 90 seconds maximum 120 seconds , pull quickly and clean with provided anti-bacterial wipe , repeat on other nostril , then I used spatula on other end to apply to each side of surface of nose , wait 30 seconds and peel one corner and pull quickly to deep clean skin , I recommend disposing of applicators due to the possibility of transmitting bacteria , and there are plenty of extra applicators and mustache protectors to last a long time , and at this price , I anticipate it will last a year , before I need another kit, super product.</li>
            <li> I bought Nads nose wax kit for the first time based on the great reviews, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I used to have my nose waxed professionally, but after moving, I let it slide.  Rather than try to find a new pro, I tried Amazon.  The kit is simple, instructions are great, and they give you everything you need.  I used this for my nostrils, and as a pore strip on the outside of my nose. I also used this to wax my ears and it worked great.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Having found myself with persistent nose hair problems at far too young of an age, and plucking being a never-ending, painful regimen, I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very carefully followed the instructions, and was pleasantly surprised how NON-PAINFUL this product is to use.  It effectively cleared out all unwanted nose hairs for 4-6 weeks.  In the process of doing so, I realized just how much obstruction the hair causes in my nostrils, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed easier, and more efficient breathing recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip---I recommend leaving the wax in close to the full 2 minutes, as the wax will adhere more securely to more hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally did not use the product for exterior nose cleaning, so I cannot comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, if you run out of the nose applicators, just use wooden wax applicators the kind with the angled end... Unfortunately naps doesn&#x27;t sell the hard wax separately, because I don&#x27;t need the other stuff...</li>
            <li> I saw this posted on a celebrity gossip blog as one of the most ridiculous products ever, but nose hair is one of my biggest pet peeves.  I hate trimming, I hate plucking, and I hate having long hair pop out of my nose anyway, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  In short-- it works.  Really works.  But it hurts like nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt before the first time you try it.  Don&#x27;t let the wax dry in your nose or it&#x27;s going to hurt even worse.  After some trial and error it&#x27;s definitely made my life easier, but if I weren&#x27;t so lazy I&#x27;d probably use another method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old black man and I received it on 4/1/2015 and I had to use it up to 3 times and it got a lot of my nose hair out. I do plan on use it again since my nose hair has grown back. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I had no problems. It worked as expected.  Looked like a cactus when it came out. I should get 15 uses out of this one jar.</li>
            <li> Works great for nose hair, I gave four stars cause it missed a few hairs down low and also because it didn&#x27;t work well for black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li> Oh Nads!!!! Might be TMI but seriously, gets rid of those creeping nose hair that protrude from my nostrils.  Does it hurt? Yes, just enough to make your eyes water... BUT IT WORKS!  I use it once every 4-6 weeks.  Super simple!  Great product.</li>
            <li> this didnt hurt at all, i was shocked. Have recommended to many of my friends. No more trimming for me!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this, I gave it a try and it ended up being great! Slightly painful, but would rather do that than have nose hair!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!! taking off a star because 1) it&#x27;s expensive :( and 2) there are not enough applicators in there.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as I had envisioned but it definitely gets the job done. I use the wax on nose and ear hairs. I was surprised that it was relatively painless! Keeping the wax at the desired temp is a bit of hassle and the whole affair is a bit messy. However, it beats paying to have it done!</li>
            <li> So, my husband loves this stuff and says there is no pain involved. Very cool product!</li>
            <li> I can promise you, this does NOT cause the excruciating, eye-watering pain I was expecting.  It is actually less painful than waxing my upper lip!  I have to use it twice to sort of &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; but it comes with enough applicators.  I reuse the applicators by sticking them in the freezer and popping off the used wax (a horrific find for my husband one afternoon).</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product works excellent. I have had this procedure done in a spa and Im much happier with the Nads results.</li>
            <li> Was always bothered by my itchy nose to NO END!  Turns out it was all the little hairs inside tickling it constantly with every breath, especially the hairs near the nose openings.  For years, I tried trimming, then pulling hairs with tweezers but no relief.  Used this product and for first the time my nose is not itching me constantly!  I absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  Had to use it 3 times to get all the little hairs out (no wonder trimming and pulling didn&#x27;t work - way too many to get using tweezers - this product pulls out dozens of hairs at a time - I was shocked by how many).  Make sure to follow the directions fully.  Seemed expensive but this kind of relief is priceless.  Could not find in local pharmacies...but same price or better here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!  Me and my sister had a great time taking selfies with the moustache protectors;D. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this as there is no other product like this on the market and my eyebrow waxing lady insisted that there is no such thing as waxing nose hair!  So there, dumb eyebrow waxing lady!  Now you will have a hairy, whistling booger nose whilst my nose will be hair-free and attractive!  Ha!</li>
            <li> I bought this and was hesitant to use it. I thought it would be horrifically painful, but honestly, I find waxing my eyebrows to hurt much worse. However, my nose was very tender for about two days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself is nothing special. It is just a hard wax. It is a VERY small container. For the price of this kit, you can buy about a pound of decent hard wax at a beauty supply store. I am also confused as to why they put fragrance in it. It is annoying, you are sticking this in your nose after all. Another thing is there is no lid for the wax. I used some foil to cover it, but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real jewel is the applicators. These things are great. You don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the wax in too far with these. (you should never wax your inner hairs. Not only are they there for a reason, but you could cause injury doing so). If they would sell just these applicators by themselves, they would be a five star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try using this as a &amp;#34;blackhead remover.&amp;#34; I think that is a ridiculous thing to use a wax for.</li>
            <li> I have way too much nose hair.  I have tried trimmers for many years and they didn&#x27;t do the job.  As I have aged it has gotten worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review of this product on a blog and decided to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are clear and the product is easy to use.  The wax can be messy if you aren&#x27;t careful so take some precautions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prepped the was and placed the \\&quot;tool\\&quot; in my nose for two minutes.  The sensation is shocking when you pull the waxing tool out of your nose, but I was amazed with the results.  I waxed both nostrils twice and was amazed and a bit disgusted by all of the hair that was removed. I knew that nose hair trimmers were not addressing my problem, bit never realized how bad it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have excessive nose hair this product is worth your time.</li>
            <li> I decided to order more and give them out to my enemies.  I closely followed the directions, but it did not work, was painful, and I ended up with a nose full of wax.  I wasted my money on this!!!!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have known about this sooner!  It really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think it would.  Waxing your upper lip hurts more so if you can stand that you are all set.</li>
            <li> Useless.  If you have a forest up there, this isn&#x27;t for you. Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42, and never waxed my nose hairs before. I&#x27;ve been trimming for years using an electric trimmer, with much success I might add, but my nose hairs just kept getting thicker and causing me more discomfort. I read the reviews on how painless this was, and quite frankly didn&#x27;t believe them. I bought it anyway thinking it would pull the hairs, but also thinking I was going to get a bloody nose. I should mention that I&#x27;ve never waxed anything on my body before, so waxing in general was a new experience. I followed the directions to the LETTER, again not having any experience, I figured I&#x27;d better not screw this up. Well, it pulled the hairs, didn&#x27;t cause me any pain, no blood, no fuss... I was shocked! So, I did it again in each nostril, and it pulled even more hairs, which at that point I felt a completely different sensation in my nose...NOTHING! The \\&quot;Forest\\&quot; was gone, and the annoying hair tickles were gone. My only wish was that they sold a bigger size, but I&#x27;ll be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use, good product.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the aggravation and just get it done by a professional</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It works great.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-works great&lt;br /&gt;-much better then electric nose hair trimmers&lt;br /&gt;-Hurts a little but not bad&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- No cover on the Wax.  The wax is reusable, but they do not supply a cover.&lt;br /&gt;-Microwave instructions are wrong.  Took me much longer to heat up my wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> Read the instructions and follow them closely and it works.  What else can I say, it yanks the excess hair from you nostrils.  And it smarts when you do it.  But you&#x27;ll live</li>
            <li> My husband no longer has nose hair... And I got to watch him squirm a little!</li>
            <li> Works great to wax nose hair and eyebrows. I&#x27;m a man in my 20s, and my nose hair gets a little out of control already. I have been going to get it done professionally, but this works better and is much cheaper. Doesn&#x27;t really hurt either, just feels like all the blood rushes to my hose at once. I have to do it several times to get the results I want, but so did the professionals at the salon.</li>
            <li> This nose wax is perfect for removing unwanted nose hair, the applicators are unique. Don&#x27;t pass this one up if you have been struggling in the past.  This product is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> How one goes about reviewing a product that rips hair out of your nose I&#x27;m unsure, but here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nads Nose Wax rips hair out of your nose… and it does it well. The instructions and cautions are clear (it even includes pictures), the supplies are plentiful for more than a one time use, it is quick, and other than the anticipation it is nearly painless (If you&#x27;ve tweezed nose hairs before, this is NOTHING like it). Do be aware that unlike shaving off your mustache people may notice the naked look above you lip but it is not likely they will mention it, nor will they pay you a compliment. I for one was a bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the container that holds the wax has a tear away seal. This requires storing it using cellophane to cover it.</li>
            <li> I really dislike nose hair. I spend a lot of time plucking it with tweezers, which is a pretty uncomfortable process. I started looking for a trimmer because my nose hair is getting more an more dominant as I am headed solidly into my 4th decade on this planet. Then I ran into this. It sounded weird, but I liked the idea of removing, rather than trimming the hair, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was amazing! It&#x27;s a bit of work to get the wax heated up just right and do all the prep work, but the result is so worth it. It removed way more hair than I do when plucking, and without all the watery eyes / sinus explosion that I usually experience with plucking. It&#x27;s like I just held a miniature spa day for my nostrils, they have never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> Oh baby!  I had to have my nose rebuilt several years ago, and my nose hairs show in areas they shouldn&#x27;t!  This is easy to prepare &amp; insert, but I was shocked at how hard it was to yank out of my face!  But it was well-worth it to get a funny video (taken by my daughter!) of me laughing hysterically - first because standing there holding a stick inside of my nose for almost a minute looked ridiculous, and secondly because after the first yank I knew I was absolutely stuck &amp; committed to another HARDER yank.  But it worked really well, and is worth every funny/painful moment.</li>
            <li> Can be a little messy.  Sometimes makes my nose run a little bit and be slightly sore.  That said, it truly works as promised and if you follow the directions is painless (seriously).  **Disclaimer*** if you do not follow the directions it will hurt a bit :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good product and I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the words to adequately describe how painful the removal process is.  Application was fairly easy but the wax turns to concrete fairly quickly.  So you are encasing all those tiny little nose hairs in concrete, then ripping them out in one fell swoop.  OMG. Burning the nose hairs with acid would probably be less painful.  I cannot comprehend all the good reviews.  I did keep the product in case I ever happen to come across my ex-husband in his sleep.</li>
            <li> Good product works well and everything i wished they was more so i don&#x27;t have to keep ordering. you should get this</li>
            <li> This is the only wax that works for my husband.  If you have nose hair that grows like a weed, this will keep it at bay for months.</li>
            <li> If you actually have hair in your nose don&#x27;t use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively short hair in my nose (I use a nose hair trimmer).  I tried this product and it&#x27;s the equivalent of shoving epoxy up your nose and ripping it out.  I figured this product looses the hair, but nope this is a brute force approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work if you I first spent a half hour first removing every last hair (like with the electric nose hair trimmer) then use the wax...but what would be the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was a try once and throw in the trash.  I&#x27;ll write it off as temporary insanity.</li>
            <li> Just got this and tried it for the first time....well I just paid over $8 to have this done in a salon and after leaving thought I could surely do that. I did it and it was really easy.</li>
            <li> Still stuff is amaze balls. Super easy to use, virtually painless and very effective. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> It hurts ...lets just get that out there. I personally would rather just use a trimmer than use it again. My partner however was okay with it and prefers it. You will want to follow the instructions VERY carefully.</li>
            <li> I did not trim my hairs to the 2-3mm it recommends in the instructions. My hairs were probably 3-5mm. It comes with 6 nose inserts. Although they CAN be re-used, I decided to use the sticks until I got the desired results. It took 2 inserts in one nostril and 3 in the other. Followed the instructions, although I may have put applied a bit more wax than the pictures illustrate (a little would come out of my nostril when I inserted. It gums up quickly if the consistency is just right (just a little thicker than honey). Waited 90-100 seconds and then pulled quickly with one switch motion. Voila, hairs removed. I credit using 2-3 inserts per nostril to having a big nose and above average hair count. Works like a charm. There was about 1/2 a tub of wax left over and one remaining unused nostril insert. As this is my first time waxing nose hairs, I am very content with the results after immediate use. Time will tell whether there are any undesirable side effects or how often I would need to do this treatment. I&#x27;m guessing this varies widely across users. I give it an A.</li>
            <li> The ball on the end of the applicator is much tinier than it appears and it barely goes into your nostril, so it doesn&#x27;t remove much hair at all. I&#x27;ve waxed my nostrils at a salon as well as using hard wax with a warming pot and wooden waxing sticks. I much prefer using the waxing pot with sticks at home that NAD&#x27;s device, which does not give you professional results.</li>
            <li> Pros:  The product came with more applicators and wipes than stated on the box!  The wax work well for both inside and outside of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The wax gets cold by the time you do the other nostril or outside the nose.  Also it seems wasteful that the applicators are not reusable; the remnant wax won&#x27;t clean off.  You&#x27;ll end up with at least 1/2 tub of wax but no applicators left.</li>
            <li> Had to apply few times to get the result, good if you like pain...</li>
            <li> First off, pros:  the wax works well. I was worried it would hurt, it didn&#x27;t. More like a strong pull feeling (I imagine its what velcro would feel like being pulled apart).  I&#x27;ve had my eyebrows waxed a few times, and this is much milder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the cons:  All the reviews here on Amazon said there was tons of wax. Things like &amp;#34;50 applications at least&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;there&#x27;s enough for 100 applications&amp;#34; are just wrong. Maybe I put too much wax on my applicator, but I&#x27;d say there is enough wax for about 10 applications. Since both of my nostrils took about three applications each, I&#x27;d say this is a two time usage set.  For 20 bucks, I feel that is just a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m freezing my applicators for future use, but alas I won&#x27;t have much wax to use them with. Still, I will likely buy again. It works.</li>
            <li> Used this on my boyfriend and it worked really well.  Leaves your nose stinging for a little after, but definitely worth it</li>
            <li> No more tweezers, this takes care of it in 90 seconds. Not painful either, just dip the applicator in the wax and shove up your nose. Then grip and rip baby! No more looking like a caveman!</li>
            <li> This...product...works. I cannot tell you WHY it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it is nothing like you are thinking. Follow the directions and make sure it doesn&#x27;t cool off before applying. I highly recommend this product. Again, follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I team to have been blessed (not cursed) with a body covered mostly by hair.  One of the fun places it tends to sprout is in my nose.  I have regrettably used nose hair trimmers and tweezers to try to groom myself but have found that waxing is by far, the best solution.  I have had my eye brows waxed, my back waxed, and unfortunately my chest waxed.  All of those have come with pain... as a matter of fact, they are listed in order from painful to excruciatingly painful.  I was pleasantly surprised the first time I had my nose hair waxed professionally that there is no pain at all... just pressure.  I bought this kit and will use it again, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t do as good as job as the professionals... it doesn&#x27;t get as m any hairs, and takes a bit longer.  However, I think you can get at least 6 uses out of this kit and it is the price of having it done once professionally.  Hopefully in time, my practice will lead to perfection and I will be able to get more hairs out at a time.  Over and out.</li>
            <li> works well. Direction were easy to understand and my nose looks great!</li>
            <li> I like how this works, it&#x27;s great. The wax is good and different from the one at the salons. The safetip is genius and is much less painful than how they do it at the salon. But the price is a little too much.</li>
            <li> A little painful but it works good as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a better alternative. Highly recommend for all your nose hair removal needs. It&#x27;s as painless as waxing ever can be.</li>
            <li> Works good.  I wish it had more plastic applicators and would like to know where to order more of them.</li>
            <li> I am amazed.  Nearing 50, I have struggled with staying on top of my grooming.  This thing worked, and the first time.  All of the hair in my nose near the opening were just plucked in one yank.  If you have been working your nose hairs, you know it hurts to pluck.  This was relatively painless as it was in one yank.  If you have nose hair this is the simplest and faster way to clean-up them up.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Gives me a big throbbing movement to yank out my nose hair&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> The package arrived quick. I do not like the product. It&#x27;s too messy and doesn&#x27;t work very well. It&#x27;s easier to use a razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this applicator to help relieve my nose of the forest growing inside of it.  Traditionally I pull or shave the hairs.  This time I wanted something more thorough.  This was certainly more thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Some thoughts***&lt;br /&gt;1) Read the notes on heating the wax thoroughly.  It&#x27;s quite possible to heat the wax to a burning temperature if you don&#x27;t do it right.  It&#x27;s not difficult; you just have to do it right.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have a beard with mustache.  I did not make use of the included wax sheet protectors to prevent the wax from sticking to the hair I wanted to keep.  I was careful with the insertion of the wax covered applicator and held the mustache down as I inserted the applicator.  However some wax did leak out and got in my mustache.  This took some doing to clean it out.  I now plan on using the wax protector sheets and I recommend it as well.&lt;br /&gt;3) There isn&#x27;t a lid for the wax once you heat it.  I recommend covering it with either tape or cellophane once it cools for use later.&lt;br /&gt;4)  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT attempt to wash off an applicator for re-use.  The wax sticks to everything including your sink and drain pipes.  It&#x27;s a real PITA to scrub it out.  Now this may not apply to the flat applicator for use in spreading wax on the skin.  I believe you could scrap the wax off the flat service into the trash without too much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;5) The wax stuck to the more sensitive edges of my nostrils, causing some pain later when I had to scrap it off.  Next time I plan on applying a thin layer of hand lotion to the edges of my nostrils to prevent that from happening next time.&lt;br /&gt;6) Another person mentioned this but I can confirm it.  Mucus typically is drawn to the tips of your nose hair where is dries and forms solid substances that can be removed without too much trouble.  Without nose hair the mucus tends to dry on the insides of the nostrils, on the skin itself.  This can be a problem if you don&#x27;t get it off in time.</li>
            <li> It works, but dries very fast, be careful you do not go beyond time they say on the package.  It is nice to have this product instead of pulling or trimming nose hairs.  I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> from my experience it did not hurt - I also had to use it twice to do a decent job.</li>
            <li> hurts like an SOB but it works.</li>
            <li> The only difference by following the instructions is that i needed to heat the wax in the microwave for 4 minutes, not for 2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man, and I hate having to clip my nose hairs all the time. I always end up missing one or two, and it&#x27;s such a hassle. I got this product, and it really works. The wax doesn&#x27;t seem like normal wax, it seems kind of like a plastic, and it smells good. The directions were really easy to follow and it works great! It really didn&#x27;t hurt, which was surprising. It&#x27;s less painful to pull all the hair out at once than pulling a single hair. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this, do it!</li>
            <li> works good and very little pain.</li>
            <li> The instructions call for microwaving the was for 2 minutes.  After two minutes in my normal microwave, the wax was very hard.  Another 30 secs, still hard.  Anyway, the container plastic started to melt, but it still did not feel like &amp;#34;hard honey,&amp;#34; or at least I wasn&#x27;t sure if it did.  I mixed it with the included stick, and it just looked scary to stick that weird was in my nostrils without knowing if it wasn&#x27;t going to be too hard to remove.  I threw it all in the garbage!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how to use it for inside the nose&lt;br /&gt;But i used it above the nose and for mu cheek&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic result ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> It does a great job in removing the nose hair from your lower nostrils. It does cause some &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; pain, similar to removing a bandage. My only complaint is they it doesn&#x27;t come with enough of the applicators, because you can really only use one per nostril. But I contacted the company and they were kind enough to send me more, free of charge.</li>
            <li> It is a pain in the you know what to use.  Not worth the money, time, or effort.  Buy anything but this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the nose part works well at all.  I used it and I only pulled out one hair for both nostrils!  I had good results when using it on my nose, really helps remove black heads.  I would recommend using it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old kit but the wax did take heating for around 7 full minutes before it finally got to the consistency of thick honey.  That was only after I did it the first time after heating for around 6 minutes and it left behind so many hairs, I heated it again for one more minute and did it a second time.  Both times, left it in the recommended 90 seconds.  Again, left behind so many hairs that I waited a couple hours to give my nose a break and heated up the jar again for around 7 minutes and left it in a full two minutes each nostril.  I guess three times the charm because it worked after the third time.  For me I think it had to be heated up longer and left in the nostril the 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it seems to start cooling off the second you remove it from the microwave which then makes me reheat it or it gets stringy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax does break off the applicators pretty easily to reuse them.  I did receive 8 applicators with my kit and 4 popsicle sticks as stirrers.  4 antibacterial wipes, 4 calming oil wipes and a pack of mustache protectors to protect the mustache hairs from getting caught in the wax if you&#x27;re male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully next time will be easier since the key seems to be to make sure you heat it up much longer than the directions say and if you have stubborn hairs, leave it in your nostrils a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely painless.  This product WORKS !  The applicators can be reused. I just wait until the wax hardens and it comes off easily then clean it with alcohol and you are good to go.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Was nervous buying, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described! I followed the instructions precisely, and am very pleased with the results. I highly recommend Nads!</li>
            <li> this is a great product _ i did end up using qtips instead of the plastic tool provided _ and in my opinion it worked better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they sold the wax separately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I bought like 5 of these! It really changed my life (n-n)</li>
            <li> Surprised how painless this was and how well it worked.  I agree with other reviewers that more sticks should be included but one reviewer said you can easily clean them by freezing them.  Hope it works!</li>
            <li> It works!  Initially, I thought this product could be involved and time consuming...It is neither..In a matter of a few minutes, it was effective.</li>
            <li> but hurts like hell!!  I don&#x27;t get it.  Many other reviewers comment that there was little or no pain but this was not my experience.  Just think it through.  Have a blob of warm wax grab virtually every tender, little nose hair and then... tug &#x27;em out all at once!!  What do you think that might feel like?  Right, yeeeouch!  Otherwise, works well and as advertised.  I liked the results but I am dreading using it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works perfectly. I have been looking for a product like this for years. Great Product!</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;• Accomplished the job quickly and easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;• Wasteful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;This was great for getting rid of pesky nose hair quickly and easily; however I think the company could have come up with a less wasteful design.  You only get a few sticks in the package and when you are done you toss them out.  I would have liked to see them be reusable in some way instead of tossing out lots of plastic.</li>
            <li> It works, and is not very painful at all. We are so fascinated with this that the whole family used it. Easy, mess free, and quick. Removed 90% of my nose hair which I am not sure is a good thing but it feels clean ;) Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Painful, messy and did not perform as advertised. Tried product twice with same poor results. A waste of my time, energy and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy(31) and was interested in using this after I saw it on a website .  I usually use a nose trimmer and that does the job for a while, but the jungle of hair grows back!  This arrived quickly(2 days..thanks PRIME) and upon inspection, I thought the same thing as everyone else that reviewed this, there are not enough nose things.  FOLLOW the instructions and it works GREAT!!!  I used the white nose things at first, but they seemed to be too small for my nose???  So after a couple days (today) I use it again to get the rest(clean-up) of the hairs.  I put the white nose things in the freezer for about 10 minutes if that then tapped on them which a butter knife and the wax and hair come right off in the garbage can.  New as could be!  Today I used just the popsicle sticks that come with the kit.  Broke one in half and placed in the wax and put in my nose.  Seems these give more or a precision approach.  It worked great!!!  As for pain, as long as you heat the wax for 1 1/2 minutes or so and leave cool off(till a little thick, but kinda runny) and place in nose and TIME it for just under 2 minutes it actually is quite painless.  I am still kinda in shock as to how pain free it was.  If you pluck your nose hairs, try this as you will be amazed at how painless it really is.  Honestly, it is less painful that getting eye brows waxed!  Still amazed...</li>
            <li> This works great for waxing my nose hairs.  I&#x27;ve had no problem using it since I go strictly by the instructions.  When I&#x27;m done I put the used applicators in the freezer for a while and then break the wax off of them and reuse them.  It&#x27;s hard to get %100 of the hairs out but that&#x27;s not really what I&#x27;m after.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!  I bought this on a whim one night after painfully plucking my nose hairs.  I used it for the first time tonight and was amazed!  I will never go back to plucking, ever.  This was absolutely painless.... Seriously.  I followed the instructions to a T and was a little scared to pull out the wax, but once I did, I was shocked.  This got virtually every hair and was completely painless!  No watery eyes or sneezing like with plucking.</li>
            <li> This product works 50% of the time and is painful 100% of the time.  I had to try it since pulling each hair out one at a time made my cry too long. I will not buy this again but I had to give it a try. The electric clipper type nose trimmer does not work for me either.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say it did work but when I warmed up the wax and I went to go use it I accidentally got some wax on my finger and when it wouldn&#x27;t come off of my finger literally I wasn&#x27;t even going to begin to stick that in my nose so would I recommend this no.I got scared to even attempt so....I hope this helps future buyers.</li>
            <li> This kit is very difficult to use. There is no seal for the wax so it is essentially one time use &amp; the attempt to reuse failed failed failed.</li>
            <li> I used to pay upwards or $25 plus tip for nostril waxing in LA.  This was easier, less painful and a fraction of the cost.  I will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I listened to the positive reviews. It was very easy to use and works well. It does look odd when you have to yank, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t watch yourself in the mirror... lol. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I giving 4 jus bcz it is expensive product considering the small amount of wax. . It works though</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Most incredible part? It doesn&#x27;t hurt. You&#x27;d think that pulling all your nose hairs out at once would be dozens of times more painful than tweezing just one but--nope--it actually just kinda tingles when you yank &#x27;em all out at once. It can also be used for deep-pore cleansing on the outside of your nose.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s much cheaper than waxing at a salon every month. I use it for my nose, eyebrows and other small areas. This wax comes out easily, too, which is a huge plus. And it lasts me months!</li>
            <li> This wax set is great and this is already the 3rd set i bought!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as you think it would.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> great! works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for nose hair removal.</li>
            <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t hurt (I swear). I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year. Over time, less hair grows back.</li>
            <li> This stuff pulls the nose hair out for sure.  I peeled the wax off the applicators and will reuse as there&#x27;s a lot of wax for the few applicators they put in the kit.  Probably enough wax to pass on to my kids when I pass into the hereafter.</li>
            <li> this does an EXCELLENT job removing all your nose hairs......but when you have to TUG IT OUT with a &amp;#34;strong yank&amp;#34;, i&#x27;m afraid my nose is going to rip open - - - and then your eyes tear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do i like it? - - - if you need a clean nose, you cannot beat this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me? - - i&#x27;m going back to by little teeny tiny scissors</li>
            <li> I have used other Nads products before, so I didn&#x27;t hesitate purchasing this.  It was so simple to use and very thorough in the nose hair removal.  I only wish you got a few more applicators in the pack since it seems to be impossible to clean and reuse them.</li>
            <li> Great item,  last longer than plucking, and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I will be buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> This works great and they have mustache/beard guards in the box for men who use it. Trust me, getting wax stuck in your mustache is NOT a fun experience. Works great and if you break the wax off the applicators and wash them, you can reuse them. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the wax container doesn&#x27;t have a lid that fits securely over the jar after you first open it, but once the wax hardens back up it&#x27;s not much of an issue of it leaking.</li>
            <li> As a married man I have a wife always commenting on things that need addressing, nose hair being one of them. I had a small cheap electric trimmer that broke to I came on Amazon looking for one yet I seen this in the related items after clicking on it and reading a couple reviews I decided to give it a try.  I have never had anything waxed on my body yet my wife told me it&#x27;s very painful.  I got the kit, prepared the wax according to the directions, applied it into the stick and placed the tip inside my nostril and waited the 90 seconds.  I grabbed ahold of the stick and prepared to quickly pull it out and thought nothing but this is going to hurt so bad.... I then pulled it out as fast as I could.  There was almost zero pain, hardly even a slight irritation.  And the amount of hair it pulled out was unbelievable, I had no idea there was that much in there! I will keep using this kit and will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on annoying, protruding and unsightly nose hair for men and women. Works great for men&#x27;s nostril hair, which is usually thicker. Let&#x27;s face it, there are very few waxing products tailored for men and while male waxing is still taboo for the most part, what guy wouldn&#x27;t want to look his best? If you&#x27;ve battled with coarse nose hair and tried trimming and plucking, give this a shot. If you follow the instructions fully, this product will get 95% of the hair out in one go, with a few plucks getting the rest. I won&#x27;t lie... For the uninitiated, it will sting and be uncomfortable but the feeling resides quickly. Just make sure to FULLY commit to &amp;#34;the pull&amp;#34;! If you have a moustache, don&#x27;t worry, there are adhesive protecting strips to avoid waxing that hair.</li>
            <li> True, there are NOT enough applicators, but this product works effectively and most critically, painlessly. Following instructions helps. I have VERY sensitive nose and eyebrows. Threading my eyebrows had lead to days of red marks and swelling. to give you an idea. I was not bothered by this at all. To clean the applicators for re-use, get as much wax off as you can then put them in a coffee cup you don&#x27;t care about filled most of the way with water. Run the whole thing in microwave for 2.5 minutes. Use a paper towel to twist the wax traces off and run the towel inside the cup to grab any stray wax threads.</li>
            <li> Did the job.  Once you wax the nose hairs away, you&#x27;ll never go back to trimming or plucking.  The product smells great and the fragrance is very mild which was a big turn off for other products.  I only wish it were made in a larger size.</li>
            <li> 2/28/16 update - I still use this wax and it works great once you figure out the &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; and get creative with home made applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I microwave it for about two and half minutes (all microwaves are different!). Initially I was worried about getting burned but the wax never seems to get that hot. I  gave up on the supplied applicators, they are useless, especially with the little &amp;#34;shield&amp;#34; under the applicator ball. I switched to  wooden dowels (7/16&amp;#34; and 1/2&amp;#34; diameter) that I cut the dowels with a Craftsman razor shear to about an inch and half long for nasal use. That way I get all the nostril hair with one application and one &amp;#34;yank&amp;#34;. Two things to keep in mind - be SURE to give this wax enough time to harden - like 90+ seconds. If you don&#x27;t let it fully harden it&#x27;s a total mess and you&#x27;ll be picking chunks out for 15 minutes. Do the &amp;#34;mirror test&amp;#34; after each use. I&#x27;ve had a small chunk of the wax adhere to one nasal hair that escaped being yanked out and it looks like a giant booger suspended in your nose. Definitely not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;The wax is absolutely tenacious when fully hardened and it will yank out any hair it touches.&lt;br /&gt;They lowered the price from $19.99 to $13.99 - far more realistic for the small amount of wax supplied&lt;br /&gt;Best product out there for the intended purpose - I have been unable to find it in a larger size. If anyone knows where to get a larger size, let me know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;Learning curve for how long to heat the wax&lt;br /&gt;Supplied applicators were useless for me&lt;br /&gt;No cover on the wax container&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;moustache covers&amp;#34; are useless, they kept falling off and you look like a tool with it stuck to your face. I use paper medical tape over my moustache. It works better.&lt;br /&gt;Small amount of wax even at the lowered price and I wish I could just buy a larger can of the wax alone without all the stupid &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; extras..ER room laughing in the back of my head as I envisioned my inevitable emergency room visit looking for medical care for a scorched nostril because I overheated the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inserted the Q-tip with the cotton removed into the warmed wax, swirled it about, stuck it up my nose and then let it cool for about 75 seconds. One quick yank and I had miniature furry popsicle of wax and hair. It&#x27;s pretty gross and my wife was disgusted but it worked a lot better than the applicators supplied by NAD&#x27;s (love that name!). The other mystery to me is why the wax container does not have a screw on top. It has a paper pull off top and once you remove that, there is no cover for the wax. Excessive use of alcohol prior to using this product is NOT recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could just buy the wax itself and skip the kit with all the applicators, wipes and the odd &amp;#34;moustache covers&amp;#34;. I held a paper towel over my upper lip and it worked fine. Once you jury rig the Q-tips by removing the cotton and figure out how long to heat the wax, the wax works really. If anyone can recommend a bulk wax product that would work like this wax works, it would sure be helpful. I might try the wooden popsicle sticks next time - I suspect the wood will do a better job of gathering and holding the warm wax.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but this product is superb. Easy to use, virtually painless</li>
            <li> worked exactly as described, little pain but worth the result</li>
            <li> works--hurts like a &amp;#(*#</li>
            <li> This product works well and is easy to use. I was skeptical at first but once I used it I changed my mind and am pleased I bought it.</li>
            <li> Worked well.  I think 90 seconds was not enough though, because when I pulled it off it stuck inside. I think I should have left it a few seconds longer.</li>
            <li> I had my nose done at a wax center then I realized I wanted to keep my nose clean all the time, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the pro to do it.  This kit is super simple and works great.  I&#x27;ll never go back again, I breathe much better now!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about nose waxing but read an article about it in the huffpo and had to try. I sometimes tweeze and it&#x27;ll make me tear up so I was expecting to try it once and then throw it away. But it barely hurt at all. A slight shock/mild sting during the initial tug and then it&#x27;s like nothing ever happened. It lasts longer than trimming and is more effective at getting to the harder to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I usually have a lot of wax left over after running out of the plastic applicators so I&#x27;ve just been cutting the cotton tip off of Q-tips and dipping the stick into the wax to make use of the leftover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at this product for the advertised black head removal, look elsewhere. I tried it and it did nothing for my pores.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, you may need to down each nostril twice to get all the hair. Don&#x27;t throw away the used sticks, wash them off with hot water or freeze em&#x27; to get the wax off. I&#x27;m a 26 year old guy with very hairy nostrils, they got all the hair in the front of my nose (the stuff the is unsightly and irritates), and left the helpful hair in the far back.</li>
            <li> I got two sinus infections after using this product because I removed so much hair from my nostrils. I did not jam it up my nose - simply followed the instructions. I have a really hairy nose so a lot of hairs were pulled out. I firmly believe the lack of hair caused my allergies to increase resulting in sinus infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a web search for trimming nose hair and sinus infection/allergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it removes hair after two applications per nostril so it&#x27;s not as effective as I wanted on the first try. But after two tries per nostril my nose was clean.  I was mostly happy until the allergies kicked up. It did hurt a bit and burned for a little bit afterward. I also got tiny pimples in my nose after the extraction - pulling out hair creates wounds that lead to tiny bits of pus/pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having long, thick, and over abundant hair in your nose sucks really bad. But sinus infections are worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty satisfied but I cannot compromise my health.</li>
            <li> Does a really  good job with the hairs it does reach.  I&#x27;d like it to reach a little further into the nose though.  Still had to trim some of the inner hairs not near the nostrils.  I recommend this product for anyone who hates dealing with nose hairs every few days.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for better results. I followed the instructions, but the wax takes much longer then prescribed to melt to a somewhat workable consistency. Up to 10 minutes in the microwave and it melts very uneven. Using the spoon to stir before the actual application doesn&#x27;t do much good either, because the wax dries very quickly. *When* I was able to get the wax to a good, usable consistency I had to work very fast to place the applicator in the nostril. One time it worked like a charm and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. But I&#x27;ve not been able to replicate the results. I tried 4x overall on different occasions and it was to much hassle. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Can get many uses from one box. I went and bought popsicle sticks from walmart and can get many uses from the one thing of wax. 20+ times if you do it right.</li>
            <li> with a little trial and error, was able to achieve mission success. so, yeah.  works as described.</li>
            <li> Works really well but after a few times you&#x27;ll want to get drunk beforehand, feels like you are ripping all the skin out of your nostrils (but you aren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s safe) Lately some wax has been left behind up there so be sure to have some tweezers handy.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as I expected and too pricy for 3 applications. At that price point it should be at least double the size.</li>
            <li> Truly, you have no idea how hairy the inside of your nose is until you clean it out.  This kit is great.  I have fair skin and dark hair so I get the visible nose hairs and this stuff is easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as you&#x27;d think.  I think it would be much more painful and ticklish to pluck.</li>
            <li> Goodbye nose hairs..it really works..</li>
            <li> Works great! I bought this being a little skeptical, but wanted to try something other than the nose hair trimmers. I was surprised and very delighted with the results.</li>
            <li> How about instead of paying someone 15 dollars every couple of weeks, you buy this instead! Absolutely excellent product, hard wax that will yank that nose hair out by the fistful. Sounds painful doesn&#x27;t it, it&#x27;s not! All you feel is a &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and all those gross little things are out of your nose. My husband has what I call tarantulas coming out of his nose, or he did. I got ahold of him, got the wax properly warmed and dipped the applicator twice to give it a nice thick blob, then stuffed it up his nose and twisted a bit to make sure all the ickies were coated. Waited 90 seconds, gripped hard and yanked. Holy forest of black hair! He&#x27;s good to go for a couple weeks. My daughter and I used to have this done at the salon, not any more. We use popsicle sticks, coated well and then just up the nose, not too deep then twist to make sure you get all the hair around the opening of your nostril. Always wait 90 seconds, then grip hard, hold the forehead and yank. It&#x27;s easier if you allow someone else to pull the stick out for you. Less chance to hesitate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then went after my son, he has a unibrow, not any more. I like the wax that does not require strips. We are looking at getting a wax warmer a larger jar of wax. Will review that when it comes. But for now, if you have had this done at the salon, you already know how to do the job, if you have a husband whose nose hair has it&#x27;s own lifestyle, get this and get that stuff out. He will thank you, from a professional standpoint of course.</li>
            <li> I was pretty scared to use this product but my desire to not have long nose hairs itching my nose was much greater. To my surprise the procedure was almost painless (a 1 on a scale from 1-10). It worked great, removed about 90-95% of my nose hair and it stayed mostly gone for over a month. The wax takes a little work to get off if you get it on any part of your body during the process but that my only real complaint. I will definitely be getting more of this stuff. A life without the extremely long nose hair is definitely one that&#x27;s more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Arrived in perfect condition, with everything included in description.&lt;br /&gt;It worked well, not perfect(for my first attempt). Well enough to be completely satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions, and it all went according to plan. The pain from pulling out the applicator stick was minor, and subsided within a few seconds. Everything cleaned up nicely. My nose was sore for a few days after, but only noticeable when I touched it. It was the first time I had ever waxed my nose hair, and it will not be my last. I plan on continued use of this product.</li>
            <li> It works as expected for nostrils and despite my imagination pulling it fast and in one motion works :-)  I have tried many trimming devices and none has worked as good as this not to mention that one would need to repeat less frequently compared to typical trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not giving it a five because they do not provide enough applicators.  I used the method described by another reviewers (i.e. freeze the applicator and the wax is easily removed) to reuse them.</li>
            <li> A little timid at first, but read some helpful reviews.  Product worked as advertised.  I am now just hoping that I will need the waxing less often than alternative measures</li>
            <li> This is junk. wax peels and is messy</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;After 40 the hair that stopped growing on other places on my body started coming out of my nose - prolifically!&lt;br /&gt;Regular waxing at the salon was expensive and time consuming and plucking is well... you already know if you&#x27;re looking at this product.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;This wax is so easy to use and I don&#x27;t find it painful at all (I never found salon waxing painful either).&lt;br /&gt;I did buy some small wooded waxing sticks online to help get into all the little crevices that the included wand can miss.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could buy just a replacement pot or two since I&#x27;m accumulating the white wands and I&#x27;d actually prefer to use wood just for recycling purposes.</li>
            <li> This is not the easiest thing to try to use.</li>
            <li> It really works!  And not too painful. Recommend shaving prior to using--especially the upper lip/mustache area.  Otherwise, the wax can drip on your facial hair causing clean up to be difficult--and possibly painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving five stars even though I think more of the plastic applicators should be included. Great product. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great product! Does the job&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, have thick nose hair and this thing better than any other trimmer</li>
            <li> Item works good and does the job.  If you don&#x27;t want to mess around with clippers, this is a simple way to clean things up.</li>
            <li> I have no idea who thinks this is pain free. I followed the directions exactly and wow was it painful. Sure, it worked well enough. Like everyone else I had to use it twice per nostril.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions, it works pretty well. I would give it five stars if the applicator was a little longer so hairs slightly deeper in the nose could also be removed.</li>
            <li> As a moderately hairy guy, it was a pain-in-the-nostrils to keep plucking stray hairs every couple of days. It was pretty nice to be able to rip them all out in two good yanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package comes with 6 &amp;#34;SafeTip applicators&amp;#34; one per nostril per use, 3 wooden sticks to stir the wax, and of course the container of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it only has enough equipment for 3 uses. Though some people have stated they could clean off and reuse the plastic applicators. My girlfriend was pretty grossed out by the used applicators, so I just thew them out.</li>
            <li> I used to pay for this to be done, but now I can do it better myself</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Works well instead of going to a salon to get nose hair waxed!</li>
            <li> A bit messy to work with but it does the trick. Follow the reviews regarding freezing the inserts. .the wax really does break off cleanly!</li>
            <li> It works. All the other reviews can pretty much fill you in on it&lt;br /&gt;but I want to just add that you can (and you need to) clean off&lt;br /&gt;the applicators so you can reuse them. They give you six and&lt;br /&gt;imply that&#x27;s all you can get from this product. Well 6 applicators is only&lt;br /&gt;3 applications unless you have only one or more than 2 nasal passages!!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a small plastic tub filled with wax that you melt in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;One minute is all you need. But let it sit for about 3 minutes after to cool down&lt;br /&gt;a bit. There&#x27;s enough wax in the tub for a hundred or more applications!&lt;br /&gt;If you use it once every two weeks then it will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I found that its best for me to dip the applicator in the wax then hold it and&lt;br /&gt;twist it to let the wax cool a bit and be evenly distributed on the applicator then&lt;br /&gt;I dip it a second time to build up a larger glob of wax. I think the applicator is for&lt;br /&gt;people who must have tiny noses. Or maybe for children??&lt;br /&gt;I do what another reviewer said to do. Put the applicators in the freezer overnight&lt;br /&gt;then I scrape off the wax into the trash with a dull knife. A sharp one will cut or nick&lt;br /&gt;the applicator. OH DO NOT scrape the wax off into your sink. the wax will stick and&lt;br /&gt;build up in the drain and you will have trouble!&lt;br /&gt;Umm, maybe I should mention that I insert the applicator and wait 2 minutes as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;You also need to push it up until its snug and hold it there, not let it dangle.&lt;br /&gt;You need to yank it out as fast as you can for it to be painless, believe it or not.&lt;br /&gt;If you go slow because you are chicken you will be sorry! It will hurt!&lt;br /&gt;Also the first time I used it I had a lot of hair and it hurt anyway. Also it pulled out&lt;br /&gt;a clump by the roots and I had a tiny bit of bleeding. Actually I had to apply the&lt;br /&gt;wax 3 times the first day to get rid of all the hair. But it was worth it. After that it gets easier&lt;br /&gt;as you learn by experience how to do it. Also with less hair its really painless.&lt;br /&gt;You can also buy more wax cheaply and reuse the tub!!w to do it. Also with less hair its really painless.&lt;br /&gt;You can also buy more wax cheaply and reuse the tub!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic !!  just follow the instructions and poof........ no more hair. I&#x27;l tell ya I have tweezed, pulled, cut and tried all kinds of things with the results being a super sore nose or ingrown hairs that totally suck. I wish I would have found this 15-20 years ago it would have saved alot of pain.This stuff smells good is simple to do and after your first time pulls alot easier each time,,not saying it hurts it&#x27;s just kinda a wierd feeling, which is literally working out to be about 1 a month or more between waxings. Also holy cr#%^#@, can I breathe now or what ! You would have never thought that much hair is up your honker and I will say ever since I have done this I have gotten no more in grown hairs or sore spots from cutting etc. just BLISS I will also say now I am really noticing more then ever how many dudes I know need this badly with their fu-man-choo forest coming out of their nostrils they probably forgot long ago air is supposed to go through there, hahahahaha.  signing off, great breathing to you all</li>
            <li> These work really well, although it is a pretty complex and messy process. Put the applicators in the freezer after you use them and the dried wax will crack/peel off, allowing you to use them again!</li>
            <li> Works well for clearing out visible nose hair.  Best to clean the tools as they don&#x27;t provide enough to empty the wax, but that&#x27;s not a big chore.  I&#x27;m 30 and always get a few visible hairs (thank you grandpa for the hairy nose gene) I&#x27;d prefer to not show.  Until using this, I&#x27;d gently try my razor or electric nose trimmer with OK success.  This is much easier and much more effective.  Very pleased.  Probably do it once every 3-4 weeks...could be stretched longer.  Haven&#x27;t used it for it&#x27;s other purposes (like clearing nose pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knocked a star due to not enough applicators (but then again they&#x27;d probably just jack the price up a bit).  The applicators have a round end (for nose hair) and a spatula end (for skin applications).  They could easily cut them in half and have provided twice the nose applicators with the same amount of plastic, but they wanted to screw us over my adding the flat side to all of them (could have just done a couple and doubled up on round ends on the rest).  This likely forces some customers to buy more kits before they are out of wax, but Nads disguises this as &amp;#34;helping&amp;#34; the customer by making each stick dual-use, knowing this is marketed for nose hair removal and I&#x27;m guessing a huge majority only need the round ends.  Oh well, hate the game.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do if you follow the instructions. Would have been nice to have more applicators in the pack, so all of the product can be used without throwing out the unused portion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sensitive about the monkey fist of hair that grows in my nose, and thought that yanking on a plastic stick that has been melded to said monkey fist with melted wax would be my last experience before death, having ripped the brain right out of my skull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with certain death on the line I did what any manly, heroic, &#x27;Merrrrrican man would do: I did it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the mini ginger porcupine at the end of the applicator--furs that used to be rooted deep within the caverns of my skull holes--I was blown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I thought I knew how much hair was up there. I wasn&#x27;t even close. If you think you&#x27;re borderline disgusting and maybe possibly you&#x27;d benefit from nose waxing you probably are definitely completely disgusting. Wax your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, nothing will make your significant other laugh more than you walking around the house with a plastic handle dangling from your nose while you feel super self-conscious about wax-related hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the point: this product works very well. I can breathe through my nose again, which represents a huge leap forward in the evolutionary timeline of my/our species. The kit comes with enough wax to take care of my entire family tree, but only enough applicators for me and two other sturdy Norsemen. The secret: freeze the applicators after use. Within an hour you can clamp a Leatherman on the wax, twist the handle, and all of the wax will fall off, along with your nasty nose hair clump. Totally reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now waxing once every other week and my business is suddenly booking more clients than ever before, my wife and I just got approved for a new home (much larger, much more modern than where we&#x27;ve been), and wife is hotter than ever. Sure, none of that is necessarily connected to the nose waxing, but it did all happen AFTER I started waxing. Boom.</li>
            <li> Applicators fit the nostril OK but easy to use, good results.</li>
            <li> great product.  little tricky at first but easy to use and honestly didnt hurt nearly as bad as the eyebrows and it last much longer than using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 2 years and I have never regretted it. This is a must for everyone who trims the inside of their noses. I used nose hair trimers in the past, but they felt weird and the nose hair just grew back. This works much better. I have to used it every 3 weeks to keep my nose presentable. The only downside is there aren&#x27;t enough wax applicators in there. I fixed this problem by using q-tips to apply the wax to the easy to each places of the nose.</li>
            <li> Evective, clean and painless.</li>
            <li> The safety applicator is HUGE for my nose. It was difficult to position it to work. The wax worked great. I have my 2nd half of the set left. I will try again and if my opinion changes, ill post again.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Very easy to use . Worth every penny. I was looking for something like this for a long time. This product delivers what it promised.</li>
            <li> I use this product once a week now.  I was going to the salon to have this done but now I do it more regularly, less cost and on my schedule.  Thought I might be scared but it is easy and gets lots of tiny hairs out.  Only wish there were more applicators or you could buy extra since there is enough  for more waxings.  Will improvise with popsicle sticks.</li>
            <li> Great product and company!</li>
            <li> And it worked so awesome that I am recommending it to every guy I know who is annoyed with nose hairs.  Fast and easy and relatively painless.  And the hair stays away much much longer than plucking or clipping.  I purchased this in early may and have gone more than a month without visible nose hairs!  I will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative thing I have to say is it really doesn&#x27;t seem like it comes with enough of the tools for nose hair removal as you use so little wax in the process.  However, with as awesome as the results are I would and will buy this product in the future without thinking twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a word of caution, be careful about waxing again right away if you notice that you missed some nose hair, it can tear the tender flesh (which hurts, and takes a while to heal). Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product! It does a perfect job of removing even the tiniest of hairs. It&#x27;s not sticky or leaves residue like normal wax. Nor is it messy. I wouldn&#x27;t get it for the pore cleaning as I did not think much of that.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted to use on my husband but he is being a wimp so we haven&#x27;t tried it yet :) Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> messy and and perfect</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its supposed to. Watch videos online to see how others do it, super easy and fulfilling to get rid of those offending you-know-whats.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical in buying this product. I received it today and tried it as soon as I could. The step process is clear to read and understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared to pull out the tube for fear of pain. I pulled in one swift motion (just as it says in the instructions) and it worked! I had NO pain, NO teary-eyes, and a hairless nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to insert the wax twice in each nostril just to make sure that I got all the hairs out. It pulled about the same amount of hairs each time so I would recommend doing it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only comes with 6-8 nose tubes so I would recommend washing off the plastic tubes for reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I imaged this product and line behold it exists.  This is great. Quick easy and rather painless considering alternatives. My nose looks very clean and no stubble. The was doesn&#x27;t burn and aside from the initial &amp;#34;yank&amp;#34; there is no pain. My nose felt numb for a few hours. Great results!</li>
            <li> It WORKS.  Simple to use.</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive nosehairs (it hurts to tweeze!), this wax set is surprisingly painless!  The directions are easy to follow.  I usually have to use two applicators per nostril (I&#x27;m not especially hairy, they&#x27;re just only so effective), for a total of four applicators per use.  The kit only provides 8 applicators (2 uses), but plenty of wax, and the applicators can&#x27;t be bought separately!  So the prices isn&#x27;t great for only two uses, but it is a good kit.</li>
            <li> As with most here, it worked fine for me and I will definitely get it again when I need it (however, there IS a ton of wax provided and it will most likely last me a year or more, even with multiple applications per use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions sound more complicated than it needs to be, though.  I didn&#x27;t trim my nose hairs first (and I am a VERY hairy guy, with way too much hair in places you do not need hair), I wasn&#x27;t all that precise about heating up the wax, or even coating the applicator, and while I did time the thing I don&#x27;t think letting it go outside of the 90-120 second window they state would be a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some folks recommended freezing the applicators for reuse, but I just reheated them (for about 3 1/2 minutes) and then used paper towels to remove the wax/hair and it was easy (I would recommend putting them on a paper plate while you reheat as the wax will drip off).  With that you have enough applicators for even a couple of people (if you are finicky you can keep them separate from each other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain is a relative thing, but this wasn&#x27;t even slightly painful to me, just a bit scary the first time you go to pull (because you don&#x27;t know what to expect).  As I said, I&#x27;m hairy everywhere, and removing even a bandaid from my arms or legs involves a lot of hair removal that is WAY more painful than this.  If you&#x27;ve ever been concerned about nose hair this is the solution.</li>
            <li> This nose hair removal waxing kit is amazing. My husband has always complained about how fast his nose hair grows so I decided to get this for him to try. After two applications for each nostril he was nose hair free. It was truly amazing to see the amount of hair that came out. Wow!!! It works great!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great wax kit that lasts for a decent while.  What I&#x27;ve done is cleaned off the nose applicators afterwards and used them with other sensitive area waxes if I&#x27;m in between buying these kits.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this item! I&#x27;ve been waxing my nose hairs forever and it is really hard to find someone who does it right or is even willing to do it at all! This product is sooooo easy to use and is so painless (I know it looks like it should hurt but it&#x27;s so fast-it doesn&#x27;t). I am so happy I found this product Bc it has saved me a lot of $$ on waxing!!  The ONLY complaint I have is that I I wish it was a little but cheaper and I wish it came with more sticks and nose sticks..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! So expect my future service. You have to follow the instructions exactly and it will work!! best part it doesnt hurt like you would think and its cool to see the hair on the was lol!</li>
            <li> SUMMARY: Works great, but instructions are misleading as to the re-usability of applicator.  Overall, I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAIL:  It will take some practice to heat the wax to the correct consistency and to get the timing right of it setting in your nose.  Kit comes with only 8 applicators, so if you follow the instructions, you can only use it 8 times.  There is enough wax for 50 applications.  The trick is to heat the applicator in a microwave for 5 minutes or so and to remove the melting wax and hair off the applicator, then it becomes perfectly good for reusing.  Wear gloves as it will be hot!  Instructions tell you to throw it away.  Don&#x27;t listen to that.  They just want you to buy more kits, 8 uses instead of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 02/04/2016&lt;br /&gt;Still using and results are very good.  After my wax ran out I decided to order GiGi Brazilian Body Hard Wax, 14 Ounce  instead of reordering Nad&#x27;s because you get a lot more wax.  I heat up a kitchen knife using a flame on my gas stove.  Then I use that hot knife to take chunks of GiGi wax out of its container and put it into the Nad&#x27;s container.  This wax is more aggressive and stings more as you rip your noise hair out, but you get a whole lot more wax 14oz vs 1.6oz  That is 9 times more wax for only $11.50 vs $18 for another Nad&#x27;s kit.  Try it my way to save a lot of $.  Reheat the used applicator sticks to melt the wax off,  they are perfectly reusable.  This company is BS-ing telling you to dump them out and buy more.  BS Dude!  Buy Gigi wax to use when Nad&#x27;s runs out.  The $11.50 GiGi wax will probably last you 5-10 years.</li>
            <li> Hardens a bit too fast. But pretty painless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely not a nose waxing expert, but this worked great for me. Don&#x27;t expect to get the hair all in one pull, especially if you have a sasquatch nose like me. Follow the directions and redo the same nose hole a couple times if needed. I strongly recommend cleaning and reusing the applicators or you&#x27;ll run out way before you run out of wax</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I was skeptical, but after reading several positive reviews, I decided to go ahead and try it. I&#x27;m glad I did. It takes about 10 minutes of prep, followed by half a second of minor pain (very minor, and then it&#x27;s over), and, wow! I&#x27;d say it got about 99%, certainly more than I thought was up there.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to someone seeking a long-term alternative to trimming.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...Scary as it may seem, its easy to use and painless.  Felt like &amp;#34;Damn why didn&#x27;t I try this soon!?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> An amazing product, simple and VERY effective.... I have been placed by bothersome nose hairs for decades. I so happy to have discovered this. IT WORKS SO WELL !!  I actually did it three times per nostril and got a lot of hair every time. It requires that you direct the insert into different angles to get into some areas. Painless and easy. My nose feels SO GOOD NOW !!!  I went on and bought 10 more. I am going to do this all the time as needed. Doing my ears tonight!!!&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with 8 insert stocks, if you use the flat end of the sticks to treat the surface of your nose you will be able use all the wax at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try this, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Instructions manual was missing. Especially with products like this where detailed instruction is critical, I found it very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Hated it! What a mess! I wasn&#x27;t sure I did it right the first time, I tried again. Very little result for the money, time and effort. I guarantee not matter what you do, you will be left with a mess, blocked nostrils and flecks of wax all over the place.  And still have the hairs you wanted gone, left over. Waste of money</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Kinda scary at first but it is a must have for most of us.  first you nuke the wax.  You put it on the applicator.  Jam the thing up  your nose.  wait for it to dry then yank quickly.  You&#x27;ll be shocked at all the gross nose hair that you have up there.  Really doesn&#x27;t hurt if  you pull quickly.  Also- this is kind of gross but if you put the applicator in the freezer (in a plastic baggie) you can easily remove the wax from the applicator and reuse it as long as you have wax left.  it only comes with a few applicators so you have to be creative.  Oh yeah, while you are at it put them into your ears too.  they work well for ears...  not that useful for a nose blackhead remover- use nasal strips for that.  Your wife will appreciate it if you do this...</li>
            <li> works great, no pain. it looks painful but it is not. it works great. I highly recomend this product. its  about time</li>
            <li> hard to use without a microwave. its ok otherwise, just expected more after those raving reviews. its too expensive too</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! I will never pluck my nosehairs out one by one again!  We all know that plucking nose hairs is sheer torture.  To pull them all out at once is such a relief!  If you follow the instructions carefully it is super easy.  Just remember to let the wax harden in your nostril for a little while before you pull.  But yes this product works great.  My nose has never been so hairless in my life.</li>
            <li> agree with previous comments, you almost have to reuse the applicators to make this purchase even close to worth purchasing.  mainly because each nostril will require two times.  even after two i still had some hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my recommendation, purchase a nose hair trimmer.  will have to trim more frequently, but it&#x27;s easier, less painful, and more effective.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t worth it. I used the strips before and I was looking for better, but this product is way worse. Simple way, I doesn&#x27;t feed the purpose at all.</li>
            <li> awesome, Awesome...AWESOME! just takes a lil practice...then-PerfectioN!</li>
            <li> Shipped on time.  The product has clear instructions.  Took a little nerve to pull the first time.  Hair removal lasted about two months.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this. I have purchased it twice now and love it. Excellent product and very thorough for nose waxing if used correctly. They really should provide more applicators though.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;know a guy&amp;#34; who grows such great amounts of nostril hair he has to grow a mustache just to match. He likes this product. Now I don&#x27;t have to pull these out one by one at traffic lights as give the thousand yard stare to passers by. I am my own hero.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product.  Did not clean up the area around the entrance to the nostrils very well.  Visible nose hair remains.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on two different occasions using different timing for the wax (90 seconds vs 2 minutes) and got the same result. Some nose hair was removed but not enough to continue use of this product.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband. I was always on him to keep his nose hairs trimmed. It seemed like every few days they would grow out again. Well this product really helped with that! He no longer has to trim ever three days!</li>
            <li> It did the job it was supposed to do but you ran out of nose plugs long before you ran out of wax.  I did not see a way to buy more plugs so you through out the wax after you have used the plugs and buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very wasteful of money and more crap in the dump that is never fully used.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as going to the salon.</li>
            <li> This actually worked really well! I was scared to use it, but it really hardly hurt at all.</li>
            <li> While it does remove hair, if your timing is off by even a hair (har har), you&#x27;ll end up with gobbets of wax in your nose. It also doesn&#x27;t do a terribly thorough job...while I do admittedly have a gnarly jungle of follicles up there and this fells the mightiest trees in said jungle, it leaves behind a lot of the little fine hairs that only show up in bright light, which is what I was hoping to eliminate. Oh well, my quest to make my nostrils a little less gross continues...</li>
            <li> I never thought to wax nose hairs... Now I&#x27;m hooked. Buy this to use on yourself and your men, ladies! It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. You can also use it similarly to a Biore strip for the blackheads on your nose.</li>
            <li> Tried it last night.  I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer mean&#x27;t by three applications--it comes with several applicators and enough wax for at least that many uses.  I cleaned mine off and will use it again--the wax is hard as plastic when you are finished, so its not easy.  Do yourself a favor and keep the wax off your mustache and follow the instructions--there&#x27;s a video on their website--about how to load the applicator.  Yanked 80-90 percent of the visible hair in my nose with no bleeding--except from were it pulled off a few off my mustache. Worked good on the blackheads on my nose too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great, thank you</li>
            <li> Very Good Product. Works very well. I&#x27;m very happy and would recommend to anyone who wants to Wax the Nose Hair...!</li>
