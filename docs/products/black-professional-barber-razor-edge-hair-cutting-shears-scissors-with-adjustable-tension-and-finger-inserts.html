            <li>...of writing the first review (at the request of the vendor), the scissors arrived.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous at first</li>
            <li>great for cutting my husband&#x27;s fine hair!</li>
            <li>I feel like the blade sharpness is very good quality and also that they give me a sense of control with the shorter cutting edge (which is nice, because I have a wiggly child, and am in constant fear of clipping a knuckle).  </li>
            <li>Scissors cut straight line which was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Comfortable fit, sharp blades.</li>
            <li>although it does make these scissors a bit hazardous to the person using them - you can&#x27;t run your fingers along them as you would a typical pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li>The black case that they come in is nice to have.</li>
            <li>I have large hands</li>
            <li>but doubt they hold up much longer and am more convinced than ever that this is not a high quality item.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I expected love them and the delivery time was fast very pleased!very sharp and cute</li>
            <li>I really like these scissors, comfortable in the hand, super sharp.</li>
            <li>Pink is my favorite color</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay really close attention to the length in the product description.  </li>
            <li>While I did unscrew the tip and take out the finger inserts, they cut very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say for a beautician.</li>
            <li>I have been cutting hair for 20 years and these are the best I&#x27;ve owned!!</li>
            <li>very sharp...like them</li>
            <li>They fit comfortably in my hand and are very sharp!  </li>
            <li>I bought these based on the other reviews and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Both of my DD&#x27;s (Darling Daughters) have long hair and these sheers make it so easy to trim just a tiny bit off the bottom of their lovely blonde locks!</li>
            <li>They are by far the best hair cutting scissors I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.......</li>
            <li>Easy to use, sharp, do the jo</li>
            <li>That is, when fully closed, I can still fit my finger nail between the two tips.</li>
            <li>the finger holes are just like normal scissors..nbd for $10</li>
            <li>The scissors have two sharp edges - like finely honed knives.  </li>
            <li>these are really sharp and fit my fingers like a glove, once the finger inserts were removed.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and comfortable</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These scissors are very sharp and cut great, but they were smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>and it was difficult to cut hair with them - the hair folded and was able to fit between the two blades.</li>
            <li>very professional</li>
            <li>but the cut was crisp and simple.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these as shears for our family for the last few months and am overall very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get these shears because they were all black.</li>
            <li>I did expect them to be somewhat longer, but they do a great job of cutting and I am getting used to the shorter size.  </li>
            <li>Completely my fault.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the two blades never close completely.</li>
            <li>i cut hair and am used to my professional</li>
            <li>Sharp and seem perfect for my novice cutting skills.</li>
            <li>They are so sharp and excellent at cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>Normally I purchase with the reviews of others as a starting point.</li>
            <li>They are replacing a old generic pair of hair scissors.</li>
            <li>Good cutting scissors for the price.</li>
            <li>razor sharp very comf...</li>
            <li>They are VERY sharp and are made very well.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new pair of hair cutting scissors, as my favorite PIbbs scissors were finally giving out after 20+ years of use.</li>
            <li>I really dislike these shears they are not sharp they bend the hair and are too small who uses shears</li>

            <li> These scissors are very sharp and cut great, but they were smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> and it was difficult to cut hair with them - the hair folded and was able to fit between the two blades.</li>
            <li> very professional</li>
            <li> but the cut was crisp and simple.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these as shears for our family for the last few months and am overall very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get these shears because they were all black.</li>
            <li> I did expect them to be somewhat longer, but they do a great job of cutting and I am getting used to the shorter size.  </li>
            <li> Completely my fault.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the two blades never close completely.</li>
            <li> i cut hair and am used to my professional</li>
            <li> Sharp and seem perfect for my novice cutting skills.</li>

            <li> They are replacing a old generic pair of hair scissors.</li>
            <li> Good cutting scissors for the price.</li>
            <li> razor sharp very comf...</li>
            <li> They are VERY sharp and are made very well.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new pair of hair cutting scissors, as my favorite PIbbs scissors were finally giving out after 20+ years of use.</li>
            <li> I really dislike these shears they are not sharp they bend the hair and are too small who uses shears</li>
            <li> Not bad and not good.</li>
            <li> I would recommend saving your money for a higher end pair or at least looking for a pair that is adjustable.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these overall; but I am not a licensed professional, just a person who has been cutting their own hair for the last 15 years - and trust me, I&#x27;ve seen bad shears.  </li>
            <li> There is no point in cutting your hair with these since they only create more split ends or they will not cut the hair at all.</li>
            <li> Razor sharp cut and having a black pair is just plain cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is ok for like cutting dogs hair or wigs.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t go back to using any other scissors.</li>

            <li> Very smooth cutting and sharp!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and cuts relatively coarse hair with precision, even at the tip of the sheers.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times for trimming my husband&#x27;s hair-</li>
            <li> Shears kept falling apart after using them for only a few days.</li>
            <li> They must have been made for a very small male and female.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are balanced and sharp, though I could do without the pink crystal-like adornment on the screw head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect these to stay sharp very long, I bought them to replace a pair of Solingen made scissors I&#x27;ve had for 30 years that only went dull from abuse.</li>
            <li> So sharp.</li>
            <li> They are scissors, and they are sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to get in where I needed and they are really sharp.</li>
            <li> I used these scissors the other week to trim my hair.  </li>
            <li> sharp, but not too sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, not for the  little ones - sharp points, sharp blades and sharp appearance.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical, but for the price I thought I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t have much to lose.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that I use them to trim my beard, and its hard to see what I&#x27;m doing since they are black.</li>

            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> I have couple of pairs of them and the 6 and a half inch too</li>
            <li> Cutting is so much easier with these shears!  </li>
            <li> These are the first pair of hair cutting scizzors i&#x27;ve ever used and OMG.</li>
            <li> That is, the two blades didn&#x27;t close firmly</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t used them because the were too small for me.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a small pair of shears and came across these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> As a professional stylist I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for the cutting floor..</li>
            <li> The finger holes are a bit small, but they work well.</li>
            <li> These shears should not be bought unless you have small fingers and thumb.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use these and the holes are way too small.  </li>
            <li> Recommended, but is is a bit small.</li>
            <li> The shears finger opening are to small for a mens fingers-gave them to my wife to use.</li>
            <li> What a change to use these for cutting hair in comparison to my old dull scissors!</li>
            <li> I used to cut out the mats that get tight to the skin behind my dogs ears.</li>
            <li> how dull my existing hair scissors were.  </li>
            <li> Every pair of cutting shears I have ever seen, makes the thumb hole larger than the finger hole.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to stop!</li>
            <li> Didnt stay sharp and cutting was very difficult.</li>
            <li> and they are completely useless in the condition in which they arrived.</li>
            <li> But I will see maybe try using for cutting around the ear of maybe kids haircut.</li>
            <li> I use them for giving myself a haircut and cutting my moustache.</li>
            <li> Ill being purchasing another pair but longer!</li>

            <li> Good cutting scissors for the price.</li>
            <li> these are really sharp and fit my fingers like a glove, once the finger inserts were removed.  Great scissors for the price...</li>
            <li> These scissors were amazing because they cut so well, and quietly, and they don&#x27;t hurt my fingers.  Never had scissors like this!</li>
            <li> Sharp and seem perfect for my novice cutting skills.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, sharp, do the jo</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and cut great, but they were smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> So sharp. Cute really, really well. Won&#x27;t go back to using any other scissors.</li>
            <li> These shears work great.  Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> They are scissors, and they are sharp.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Super pleased with the purchase of this pair of barber sheers!!!! I use them to cut my husbands hair and they do a fantastic job! Both of my DD&#x27;s (Darling Daughters) have long hair and these sheers make it so easy to trim just a tiny bit off the bottom of their lovely blonde locks! They are VERY sharp and are made very well.  Pink is my favorite color so the pink stone on them just made them all the more a perfect fit for me!!! I would purchase this item again as well as recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I expected love them and the delivery time was fast very pleased!very sharp and cute I will definitely buy them again when needed</li>
            <li> Great reviews from others... Didnt stay sharp and cutting was very difficult.</li>
            <li> Love my scissors!!  So easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic shears for the price.</li>
            <li> I picked up these and the 6.5&amp;#34;. They are replacing a old generic pair of hair scissors. We are not hair professionals so have nothing to compare with, but they have been working great for our needs. The are comfortable in the hand and cut cleanly. The cases are a nice perk, and one case can hold both pairs for storage.</li>
            <li> This product fits very comfortably in my hand. Very high quality for the price and the case it comes with is such a great bonus! Definitely recommend buying these!</li>
            <li> These are great scissors.  I did expect them to be somewhat longer, but they do a great job of cutting and I am getting used to the shorter size.  I didn&#x27;t pay really close attention to the length in the product description.  I am really glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like these scissors, comfortable in the hand, super sharp. My only gripe is that I use them to trim my beard, and its hard to see what I&#x27;m doing since they are black. Completely my fault. They do come in crome if that is something you might worry about.</li>
            <li> I love these shears. They work great.</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe how well these shears work for the low price they are! I plan on buying the larger size as well.  Very smooth cutting and sharp!</li>
            <li> The scissors have two sharp edges - like finely honed knives.  I like that although it does make these scissors a bit hazardous to the person using them - you can&#x27;t run your fingers along them as you would a typical pair of scissors.  The scissors are also nice to look at.  However, for me, the good stopped there.  My pair was &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34;. That is, the two blades didn&#x27;t close firmly and it was difficult to cut hair with them - the hair folded and was able to fit between the two blades. Additionally, the two blades never close completely. That is, when fully closed, I can still fit my finger nail between the two tips. I also noticed that the screw holding them together just didn&#x27;t look like a quality item.  After fewer than 25 (low intensity) uses, the scissors exploded as the nut came off the screw.  I have them back together but doubt they hold up much longer and am more convinced than ever that this is not a high quality item.</li>
            <li> Love these scissors. Very precise. Use them to cut my hair. Ordered another pair today. :)</li>
            <li> I actually physically injured myself while attempting to tighten these scissors. I do not think there is any possible way to tighten these and they are completely useless in the condition in which they arrived. They do not slice hair, but rather mash it. There is no point in cutting your hair with these since they only create more split ends or they will not cut the hair at all. I would recommend saving your money for a higher end pair or at least looking for a pair that is adjustable.</li>
            <li> I love the scissors!  They are so sharp and excellent at cutting hair.  Thank you for providing an excellent scissor.  I would recommend to anyone looking for quality scissors.</li>
            <li> Great for touch ups, not for professional use in my opinion. Maybe I&#x27;m imagining this, but they could be sharper and they don&#x27;t seem to cut like a razor.</li>
            <li> I bought these shears to s&amp;d/trim my own hair at home. They are very nice and super sharp, make a clean cut, and come in a nice black leather case. Good quality at a good price. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Its a really sharp scissor great for getting a haircut</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these shears because they were all black. I still haven&#x27;t used them because the were too small for me. I&#x27;m a guy and it would be better use for a woman&#x27;s hand. But I will see maybe try using for cutting around the ear of maybe kids haircut.</li>
            <li> Great buy and very good quality scissors.</li>
            <li> I returned these because the blades did not align properly.  They were also in a case that had been opened.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the other reviews and I am glad I did.  While I did unscrew the tip and take out the finger inserts, they cut very well.  The price was definitely right, and the red bling on the screw was a nice surprise.  I will be back for another pair when these wear out.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist I use these for when I travel and they work great. I am very impressed. Ill being purchasing another pair but longer!</li>
            <li> Scissors work great. Exactly as pictured. Fit well in my hand. Sharp. The black case that they come in is nice to have.</li>
            <li> Great price. Great size. Very sharp. Tidy case. Perfect small  trimming scissors. Think that I will get a larger pair soon.</li>
            <li> Got these for my brother &amp; he is very impressed with these scissors!</li>
            <li> These are great little scissors and at at decent price. Very sharp, not for the  little ones - sharp points, sharp blades and sharp appearance.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a small pair of shears and came across these on Amazon.  I am very pleased with them!!  They fit comfortably in my hand and are very sharp!  Cutting is so much easier with these shears!  I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Good scissors, cut great! No complaints here!</li>
            <li> This is one of the sharpest scissors I have had. Easy to use. I have large hands and I did not have any problems using them. Good price and excellent product. I use them for giving myself a haircut and cutting my moustache.</li>
            <li> exellent scissors  and exellent price thank you... razor sharp very comf... balance great tip not havy .over all price exellent.</li>
            <li> Scissors cut straight line which was exactly what I needed. These are for home use so I can&#x27;t really say for a beautician.</li>
            <li> great product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Not bad and not good. As a professional stylist I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for the cutting floor..fine for maniquinns..the finger holes are just like normal scissors..nbd for $10</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best!!!  I was so skeptical, but for the price I thought I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t have much to lose.  The scissors surpassed my expectations! I have been cutting hair for 20 years and these are the best I&#x27;ve owned!!</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times for trimming my husband&#x27;s hair- but has worked great so far. Comfortable fit, sharp blades. Comes in a nice case. Good price.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Sharp,  compact,  fits perfectly to your hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these as shears for our family for the last few months and am overall very satisfied.  I feel like the blade sharpness is very good quality and also that they give me a sense of control with the shorter cutting edge (which is nice, because I have a wiggly child, and am in constant fear of clipping a knuckle).  I really enjoy using these overall; but I am not a licensed professional, just a person who has been cutting their own hair for the last 15 years - and trust me, I&#x27;ve seen bad shears.  These are overall really nice.</li>
            <li> Bought these scissors for my daughter, so I don&#x27;t know how well they have worked. They were on her wish list, so I got them for her.L.p.</li>
            <li> Sharp and comfortable</li>
            <li> Terrible! Shears kept falling apart after using them for only a few days. Don&#x27;t waste your money, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I really dislike these shears they are not sharp they bend the hair and are too small who uses shears this tiny wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I used to cut out the mats that get tight to the skin behind my dogs ears. They are small enough to get in where I needed and they are really sharp. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> ...of writing the first review (at the request of the vendor), the scissors arrived.  They have a nice case.  And a jewel on the pivot that I didn&#x27;t remember.  The finger holes are a bit small, but they work well.</li>
            <li> Amazing! very professional</li>
            <li> Great scissors.  Excellent value and price.  Comes in a nice case and scissors are very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Compared to my 450 bucks Shark Shears they are a good stand in. Very sharp, good start shears for beginners, light in weight, and stylist.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect these to stay sharp very long, I bought them to replace a pair of Solingen made scissors I&#x27;ve had for 30 years that only went dull from abuse. I use them to trim my beard and moustache so the tip has to cut well,  these do not perform that function well. Pay the extra stick with Solingen.</li>
            <li> These scissors are a delight to use.  I had no idea how dull my existing hair scissors were.  The downside is, I keep trimming my own hair with them. It&#x27;s hard to stop!</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose. It&#x27;s a fair price.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with these scissors! Razor sharp cut and having a black pair is just plain cool.</li>
            <li> I have couple of pairs of them and the 6 and a half inch too I use them on people and my yorkies</li>
            <li> I use these to trim my beard and mustache. Very sharp and cuts relatively coarse hair with precision, even at the tip of the sheers.</li>
            <li> These are quite simply the smoothest, sharpest, easiest to hold scissors I have ever used. As a beard owner I have use many scissors over the years to tame the beast but these are by far the best.</li>
            <li> These shears should not be bought unless you have small fingers and thumb.  Every pair of cutting shears I have ever seen, makes the thumb hole larger than the finger hole.  I can&#x27;t use these and the holes are way too small.  They must have been made for a very small male and female.  I recommend not purchasing them as I&#x27;m very unhappy that I did.</li>
            <li> im a licensed cosmetologist i cut hair and am used to my professional shears.&lt;br /&gt;this is ok for like cutting dogs hair or wigs. its wobbly and you cant adjust it.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use. great for cutting my husband&#x27;s fine hair!</li>
            <li> very sharp...like them</li>
            <li> I used these scissors the other week to trim my hair.  I was nervous at first but the cut was crisp and simple.  Would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love these scissors! They&#x27;re light and comfortable to use and they cut cleanly.  They are by far the best hair cutting scissors I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> i ordered these for my wife to cut my hair and she loves them.  Great fit for her hands and stylish looks.</li>
            <li> What a find!  Beautiful scissors, attractive case, and they cut my curly hair like a dream!  Highly recommend.......</li>
            <li> great quality and price</li>
            <li> very clean cut, and feels good in the hands. I just wish they had added a simple plastic comb in the case.</li>
            <li> Incredibly SHARP! These are the first pair of hair cutting scizzors i&#x27;ve ever used and OMG. I had no idea cutting hair could make a different sound. It sounds sooo clean when it gets &amp;#34;Chopped&amp;#34;! Recommended, but is is a bit small. I should&#x27;ve gone atleast 6.5.</li>
            <li> Excellent sharp scissors that arrived speedily--they are everything they were advertized to be and more! What a change to use these for cutting hair in comparison to my old dull scissors! When I removed the soft circles since my fingers are large, my fingers fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> scissor cut the hair like butter. I paid forty dollars for a less superior air 15 years ago. Good buy, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I needed a new pair of hair cutting scissors, as my favorite PIbbs scissors were finally giving out after 20+ years of use. Normally I purchase with the reviews of others as a starting point. Since these scissors were inexpensive, I decided to take a chance and purchase without prior reviews as guidance. The scissors are balanced and sharp, though I could do without the pink crystal-like adornment on the screw head. I am not an expert on scissors but I was a licensed beautician.</li>
            <li> The shears finger opening are to small for a mens fingers-gave them to my wife to use.</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality. sharp, but not too sharp. Gets the job done. If you&#x27;re worried about fitting your fingers just remove finger inserts and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I think they very good scissors and perfect for my small hands, they are small scissors and come in a zipper protective bag so i find them perfect for my travels.</li>
