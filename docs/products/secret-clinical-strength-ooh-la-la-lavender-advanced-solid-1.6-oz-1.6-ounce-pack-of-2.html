            <li>Love this scent and the protection is amazing.</li>
            <li>Love Clinical strength</li>
            <li>Love it and the smell.</li>
            <li>But overall works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, my advise to you is spend a bit more but get a quality product</li>
            <li>Not even a worry about that problem any more.</li>
            <li>and I love the lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I sweat very easily, and even though the cheap stuff does mask odor, I was still getting unsightly sweat stains around my underarms.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is nice, not too overpowering, not too mild.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant  that works for me and plus it has a great benefit as an added bonus.</li>
            <li>I am happy I will be receiving it on a regular bases.</li>
            <li>Sure, it kept me free of B.O. and so dry, it was pretty incredible.</li>
            <li>It leaves no residue, goes on clean.</li>
            <li>The wife wanted to try this as she is always going to the gym and the previous non-clinical strength kind she had was not performing as well as she would have liked...</li>
            <li>No irritation or rash either, so even though this particular scented type is not hypoallergenic, it still worked fine for me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a fruity smell, but nothing remotely close to the herby scent of lavender (maybe more tropical like mango?).</li>
            <li>It has an amazing smell and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>I first bought this deodorant at Target thinking I&#x27;d give it a try</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this scent</li>
            <li>First, if you are looking for something that smells like lavender, forget it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fragrance kind of girl and generally go for unscented deodorants but as far as I can tell, they don&#x27;t make an unscented version (I really wish they would).</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant that works for me so good to know I have different scents to chose from.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days now and not only do I smell fresh and clean at all times</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blends in very well</li>
            <li>and I have not had too much residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a fast delivery, but the product is a waste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This antiperspirant &amp; deodorant really does the job.</li>
            <li>This particular version is no exception.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 yrs and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Only thing is the scent is a little strong at first.</li>
            <li>I got a little nauseous because it was so strong.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and smelling springtime fresh.  </li>
            <li>is the containers being half full of deodorant.</li>
            <li>One itchy rash nightmare was all it took to stick with the same old deodorant no matter how ineffective it was.</li>
            <li>This is about as far from lavender that anyone can get, in fact I am a perfume expert and I cannot detect one tiny note of anything that you can relate it to lavender in any way.</li>
            <li>I have tried the Dove clinical strength, and for me, Secret is much better.</li>
            <li>I have been using Secret for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love the Secret Clinical strength.  </li>
            <li>Regular Secret deodorant smells OK, but everything else</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really limited in the types and brands of skin products I can use because I have very sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> I like the Secret Clinical Strength deodorant, it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do not care for is the containers being half full of deodorant. This product is not cheap.  Shame on Secret for cutting corners and cheating their customers in such a way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and would definitely say that it works as advertised. I even apply at night and don&#x27;t reapply for at least 24 hours and I still feel that it&#x27;s working for me. I reduced a star because it smells nothing like lavender. It&#x27;s more of a fruity smell, but nothing remotely close to the herby scent of lavender (maybe more tropical like mango?). I&#x27;m not a fragrance kind of girl and generally go for unscented deodorants but as far as I can tell, they don&#x27;t make an unscented version (I really wish they would). For now, I&#x27;ll keep using this and deal with smelling like a fruity teenie-bopper in exchange for dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really limited in the types and brands of skin products I can use because I have very sensitive skin. One itchy rash nightmare was all it took to stick with the same old deodorant no matter how ineffective it was. I sweat very easily, and even though the cheap stuff does mask odor, I was still getting unsightly sweat stains around my underarms. I decided to take a gamble and try one of these expensive clinical antiperspirant. I don&#x27;t regret it! It works beautifully! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days now and not only do I smell fresh and clean at all times, I haven&#x27;t seen a drop of sweat on my shirts either. No irritation or rash either, so even though this particular scented type is not hypoallergenic, it still worked fine for me! Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and the protection is amazing. Love ordering through the amazon subscribe and save program, saves a lot of time and money!</li>
            <li> The lavender scent smells like my daughter&#x27;s spit-up. Horrible.  Love Clinical strength but this is the worse scent.</li>
            <li> If you find that regular  deordants/anti-persperants are not working. This will do the trick.  I happened to stumble across Secret Clinical Strength while searching for something else. This does work. A must have.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant  that works for me and plus it has a great benefit as an added bonus.</li>
            <li> this is a product I purchased for some one else who said it was great.  She has been using it for quite a while and is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love it and the smell. My only concern is the aluminum, but it is less aluminum then the previous brand I used to use. Just makes me nervous.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I like the scent too.  It blends in very well and I have not had too much residue on my clothes.  I have tried the Dove clinical strength, and for me, Secret is much better.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great! I have no b.o. even the next morning. It leaves no residue, goes on clean. Only thing is the scent is a little strong at first. But overall works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the other reviews. It leaves stains on all my jackets, at the point that I had to send all to dry cleaning_ended up costing me a lot of $$$$$.&lt;br /&gt;It was a fast delivery, but the product is a waste.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, my advise to you is spend a bit more but get a quality product</li>
            <li> I first bought this deodorant at Target thinking I&#x27;d give it a try and I absolutely loved it. It has an amazing smell and it lasts all day long. It&#x27;s also cheaper to buy it on Amazon. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant &amp; deodorant really does the job. I am happy I will be receiving it on a regular bases.</li>

Not even a worry about that problem any more. The lavender scent is nice, not too overpowering, not too mild.</li>
            <li> I like the smell on this one, doesn&#x27;t have that signature deodorant smell like the others.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 yrs and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the Secret Clinical strength.  It works great and I love the lavender scent.  It&#x27;s also great that I can use the subscribe and save.  No more of those mornings where you turn the bottom and nothing comes out and you don&#x27;t have a back up!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this scent and I absolutely love it!  It&#x27;s subtle and not over powering but yet fresh.  This is the only deodorant that works for me so good to know I have different scents to chose from.</li>
            <li> I wish I could love this deodorant. First, if you are looking for something that smells like lavender, forget it. This is about as far from lavender that anyone can get, in fact I am a perfume expert and I cannot detect one tiny note of anything that you can relate it to lavender in any way. The scent is stupid strong and overpowers you. I got a little nauseous because it was so strong. Don&#x27;t bother wearing perfume, btw. It will conflict with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I would&#x27;ve given this product one star ... if the stuff didn&#x27;t work so well! Sure, it kept me free of B.O. and so dry, it was pretty incredible. A little TOO dry, because I broke out in a rash! I hear there is a \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; version of this same product, but if it&#x27;s not unscented, I&#x27;m not sure I would bother. Regular Secret deodorant smells OK, but everything else but the original smells real bad, really strong.</li>
