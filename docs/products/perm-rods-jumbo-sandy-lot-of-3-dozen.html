    <ol>
            <li> Product is well made for required use.</li>
            <li> Great for my natural hair. Roll set and go</li>
            <li> I used these rods last night and wow I like the finish look. I never knew I could&lt;br /&gt;have used these rods on perm/relaxer hair.</li>
            <li> Received the wrong item</li>
            <li> Got these for my sister.  I use the gray rods and she was afraid those would make her hair too curly so I got these for her.  They didn&#x27;t do anything but put a little wrinkle in her hair.  My perm looked fabulous.  Looked totally natural.  She&#x27;s going to go with the gray ones next time.  I would not recommend these if you want any curl in your hair.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described. They&#x27;re simple and got the job done without any snagging or snapping. With the 3 pack, I found that I only needed to use 2, which is great in case I need some replaced in the future.</li>
            <li> Have used them countless times. Great curls on natural hair.</li>
            <li> Love them already seeing great results</li>
            <li> I gave this product two stars because the shipping was decent. The product on the other hand was poorly made what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like the larger curls for my perms; it has the more relaxed look.</li>
            <li> They were shipped so fast! Love the size :)</li>
            <li> Great Perm Rods for Natural or perm Hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these were jumbo., but they worked out .very good quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful curls! Thanks</li>
            <li> I have no complains about these perm rods, I have 3a-3c type hair and it gave me that bounce I have always looked for. It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They definitely do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. I ordered 2 packs of these but I believe you should only order 1 pack (since there are three dozen in each), unless you part your hair in tiny parts and want a lot of curls. They don&#x27;t snap to the hair snugly, but with more practice I&#x27;ve gotten them to fit more closely to my scalp. I love the way they make my hair look as opposed to rollers, which leave much bigger, less permanent curls.</li>
            <li> Cheap isn&#x27;t the word while applying one it snapped an it broke the rubber clamp is so cheap I think a rubber band has better quality than this . Waste of money .</li>
