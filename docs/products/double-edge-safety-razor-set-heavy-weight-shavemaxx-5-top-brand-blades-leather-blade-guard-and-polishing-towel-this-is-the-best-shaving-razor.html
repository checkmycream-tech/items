            <li>Clean, nice grip, great razor!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, high quality and Great price</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it and makes for a beautifully close and easy shave.  </li>
            <li>I ended up being too intimidated to use it, but I know someone who will love it!</li>
            <li>I was given a discount on this product in return for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s presented in a nice gift box as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get this one and pick up a nice brush as well as some soap.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best razor I ever used.  </li>
            <li>Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>He likes it, but it is kind of a pain to change the blades.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try it because S&#x27;HOME had a really nice deal for fathers day offering a father&#x27;s day gift box package.</li>
            <li>my razor kid arrived without a polishing cloth, what kind of cloth should be inclosed?</li>
            <li>Again, it is just my opinion, your own opinion might vary.</li>
            <li>Would have made a nice gift if it worked better.  </li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>I will start out by saying, this razor will give you a nice clean, close shave and holds the razor blade nice and even across the edge where it counts.</li>
            <li>The blades are easy to switch out and the razor is a nice weight.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor at a great price and I highly recommend it for everyone who has to shave and wants to save $s on blades!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way better than the Mach 3</li>
            <li>I love the look of the ebony as well.  </li>
            <li>This thing is infinitely better.  </li>
            <li>May just need better blades.</li>
            <li>Spend $7 more and get an Edwin Jaggar.</li>
            <li>Where the top opens up and you place the blade in it.</li>
            <li>I love this type of razor because it doesn&#x27;t get clogged up like the multi-blade ones.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is quite stylish.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic mild razor that is perfect for a first razor.  </li>
            <li>Packed in a very original gift box.</li>
            <li>Was good to see that the blades were a recognizable name (Gillette.)  </li>
            <li>He likes a good old fashioned razor , he found it worked amazingly</li>
            <li>After being a Gillette handle user all my adult life (Atra, Sensor, Mach 3, Fusion) and a Norelco electric razor user for 20 years, I just wasn&#x27;t happy with the shaves I got from these products.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as it appeared.  </li>
            <li>nice gift to male friend, brother,.... good product</li>
            <li>Using this razor is cost effective and I can save a whole lot on blades.  </li>
            <li>am I saying it is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I ordered on Sunday and got the packages on Thursday with the free shipping option.</li>
            <li>This one is very well balanced and therefore handles nicely, letting me easily&lt;br /&gt;shave</li>
            <li>The blade is secure, no shifting.</li>
            <li>received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>Cheap razor which epitomizs cheap.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone who has an average beard and takes their time to get a very good shave.   </li>
            <li>He ended up having to get his original razor to finish his shave.  </li>
            <li>Great product I love how much this saves me over regular gillette razors.</li>
            <li>The weight is just right to  feel like the razor can almost shave by itself!  </li>
            <li>The presentation in the box was top notch and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>[...] While it is true that many items are received at discounted rates or complimentary, my reviews are completely honest and are my personal experiences with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used just about every razor out there from mild to aggressive.  </li>
            <li>The razor looks very classy and it feels very comfortable in my hands.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice clean feeling and love the fact they include 5 extra blades and a nice little kit.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband wanted!</li>
            <li>Overall, the presentation of this was nice but the razor itself was not 5-star worthy.</li>
            <li>This arrived in a very nice black gift box, containing the razor, 5 Gillette blades, and a leather safety cover.</li>
            <li>He liked it enough to keep trying, though.</li>
            <li>so we were both excited when I was given the opportunity to purchase this Smart Home Razor at a discounted price during a promotional period to test for quality and review.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I got married and my husband moved in, and on our bathroom counter rested a razor, much like Grandfather&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>using this razor, we&#x27;d love to see a little more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the handle.</li>
            <li>Another good little razor.</li>
            <li>First time with a Safety razor, it took me a couple of times to get used to it</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but I like this thing so much I felt like writing!  </li>
            <li>Being a first time safety razor user I made all the rookie mistakes I read</li>
            <li>He did cut himself nine times the first time.</li>
            <li>I saw another, similar razor advertised on TV for much more.</li>
            <li>I wish the razor also had more weight to it, especially in the handle.</li>
            <li>The box I received had a lot of marks on it, making it not that pretty for gifting.</li>
            <li>This nondescript and low cost razor is better than all of my Parkers and Merkurs.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no knurling but even without its still pretty grippy.</li>
            <li>no big deal tho gets the job done and saves me so much money :).</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>It offers a cost effective alternative to those high dollar brand blades--not to mention, you don&#x27;t have to find someone at the big box stores to get blades for you out of the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The weight is just right, no sharp edges, just the right blade pressure and angle.</li>
            <li>and this company is ready.  </li>
            <li>The razor have textured chrome handles for a sure grip when your hands are wet or soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a cheap Chinese knock off.</li>
            <li>He said the shave was  really close.</li>
            <li>I got a very close shave from it with one of the Gillette 7&#x27;Oclock blades that came with it.</li>
            <li>I really like the smoothness of the blades and the razor not being overly aggressive .</li>
            <li>Replacement blades are a whole lot cheaper too.</li>
            <li>We really like that you can buy 10 replacement blades for this razor for $3.80 from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am saying it gives a nice close shave, holds the cutting edge of the blade nice and even.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy razor set for a close aggressive shave.  </li>
            <li>Feels really nice, not cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good and sharp and last for 5-6 shaves if you take the blade out and rinse it off after you finish your shave.  </li>
            <li>My razor came with 5 Gillette Yellow blades which are fantastic blades for the new shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic look for a razor</li>
            <li>I here some of the ones who used this razor complaining about the aggressiveness but to me it is mild enough for my beard.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>husband absolutely loves this razor , he is an old fashioned guy and isn&#x27;t a fan of the disposal razors.</li>
            <li>I agree completely, he felt so much softer when I kissed him.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my elder brother, who did not want to carry an entire set worth of shaving arsenal.</li>
            <li>He normally uses a Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
            <li>The black and silver look of the razor looks classy and is sure to impress whoever receives it.</li>
            <li>This is a complete set for someone interested in trying wet shaving for the first time, or someone that has been using this type of razor for a while.</li>
            <li>His skin is as soft as a babies butt!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>but that is what I do to every razor including the old gillette&#x27;s everytime I install a new blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this will effect the shave as I have just used the other side and had fair results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, and with a little water on the hand, it lessens the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said it&#x27;s like when his Dad taught him how to shave with a old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li>The double edge razor shaves as close as a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Was surprised on the quality on the product.</li>
            <li>I decided to give old school a try with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I would prefer the old style of blade holder.</li>
            <li>Have to take it completely off to change blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well constructed but is quite a bit smaller than the ProGlide (see picture).  </li>
            <li>To easy to cut yourself and very heavy</li>
            <li>I spent many morning, watching him lather up with his soap brush and then glide the sleek, silver razor down his face, &amp;#34;erasing&amp;#34; his whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade does not fit straight in a planar or edgewise way because of the large tolerances built into the shaver.  </li>
            <li>only thing i wish is that it hat butterfly opening (you have to unscrew to put in a new blade)</li>
            <li>You didn&#x27;t just throw the blade in and then go at it unless you didn&#x27;t care as to how much of your face you wanted to loose .</li>
            <li>The razor itself is very heavy and solid, and seems like it will last for many years.</li>
            <li>The Smart Home double edge head fits all standard double edge blades.</li>
            <li>Granted, no big deal (the cutting edge is held properly), works great and gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Get back to an old time tradition.  </li>
            <li>The rough finish causes the blade edges to bend when the head is screwed into the handle- very unsafe.  </li>
            <li>A little history first.</li>
            <li>For a safety razor, ended up cutting myself more than I do with a normal one.</li>
            <li>I work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item.</li>

            <li> This is a fantastic mild razor that is perfect for a first razor.  </li>
            <li> Packed in a very original gift box.</li>
            <li> Was good to see that the blades were a recognizable name (Gillette.)  </li>
            <li> He likes a good old fashioned razor , he found it worked amazingly</li>
            <li> After being a Gillette handle user all my adult life (Atra, Sensor, Mach 3, Fusion) and a Norelco electric razor user for 20 years, I just wasn&#x27;t happy with the shaves I got from these products.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as it appeared.  </li>
            <li> nice gift to male friend, brother,.... good product</li>
            <li> Using this razor is cost effective and I can save a whole lot on blades.  </li>
            <li> am I saying it is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I ordered on Sunday and got the packages on Thursday with the free shipping option.</li>
            <li> This one is very well balanced and therefore handles nicely, letting me easily&lt;br /&gt;shave</li>
            <li> The blade is secure, no shifting.</li>
            <li> received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> Cheap razor which epitomizs cheap.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone who has an average beard and takes their time to get a very good shave.   </li>
            <li> He ended up having to get his original razor to finish his shave.  </li>
            <li> Great product I love how much this saves me over regular gillette razors.</li>
            <li> The weight is just right to  feel like the razor can almost shave by itself!  </li>
            <li> The presentation in the box was top notch and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> [...] While it is true that many items are received at discounted rates or complimentary, my reviews are completely honest and are my personal experiences with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every razor out there from mild to aggressive.  </li>
            <li> The razor looks very classy and it feels very comfortable in my hands.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice clean feeling and love the fact they include 5 extra blades and a nice little kit.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband wanted!</li>
            <li> Overall, the presentation of this was nice but the razor itself was not 5-star worthy.</li>
            <li> This arrived in a very nice black gift box, containing the razor, 5 Gillette blades, and a leather safety cover.</li>
            <li> He liked it enough to keep trying, though.</li>
            <li> so we were both excited when I was given the opportunity to purchase this Smart Home Razor at a discounted price during a promotional period to test for quality and review.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I got married and my husband moved in, and on our bathroom counter rested a razor, much like Grandfather&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> using this razor, we&#x27;d love to see a little more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the handle.</li>
            <li> Another good little razor.</li>
            <li> First time with a Safety razor, it took me a couple of times to get used to it</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I like this thing so much I felt like writing!  </li>
            <li> Being a first time safety razor user I made all the rookie mistakes I read</li>
            <li> He did cut himself nine times the first time.</li>
            <li> I saw another, similar razor advertised on TV for much more.</li>
            <li> I wish the razor also had more weight to it, especially in the handle.</li>
            <li> The box I received had a lot of marks on it, making it not that pretty for gifting.</li>
            <li> This nondescript and low cost razor is better than all of my Parkers and Merkurs.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no knurling but even without its still pretty grippy.</li>
            <li> no big deal tho gets the job done and saves me so much money :).</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> It offers a cost effective alternative to those high dollar brand blades--not to mention, you don&#x27;t have to find someone at the big box stores to get blades for you out of the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The weight is just right, no sharp edges, just the right blade pressure and angle.</li>
            <li> and this company is ready.  </li>
            <li> The razor have textured chrome handles for a sure grip when your hands are wet or soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a cheap Chinese knock off.</li>
            <li> He said the shave was  really close.</li>
            <li> I got a very close shave from it with one of the Gillette 7&#x27;Oclock blades that came with it.</li>
            <li> I really like the smoothness of the blades and the razor not being overly aggressive .</li>
            <li> Replacement blades are a whole lot cheaper too.</li>
            <li> We really like that you can buy 10 replacement blades for this razor for $3.80 from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am saying it gives a nice close shave, holds the cutting edge of the blade nice and even.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy razor set for a close aggressive shave.  </li>
            <li> Feels really nice, not cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good and sharp and last for 5-6 shaves if you take the blade out and rinse it off after you finish your shave.  </li>
            <li> My razor came with 5 Gillette Yellow blades which are fantastic blades for the new shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic look for a razor</li>
            <li> I here some of the ones who used this razor complaining about the aggressiveness but to me it is mild enough for my beard.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> husband absolutely loves this razor , he is an old fashioned guy and isn&#x27;t a fan of the disposal razors.</li>
            <li> I agree completely, he felt so much softer when I kissed him.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my elder brother, who did not want to carry an entire set worth of shaving arsenal.</li>
            <li> He normally uses a Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
            <li> The black and silver look of the razor looks classy and is sure to impress whoever receives it.</li>
            <li> This is a complete set for someone interested in trying wet shaving for the first time, or someone that has been using this type of razor for a while.</li>
            <li> His skin is as soft as a babies butt!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> but that is what I do to every razor including the old gillette&#x27;s everytime I install a new blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this will effect the shave as I have just used the other side and had fair results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, and with a little water on the hand, it lessens the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said it&#x27;s like when his Dad taught him how to shave with a old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> The double edge razor shaves as close as a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Was surprised on the quality on the product.</li>
            <li> I decided to give old school a try with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I would prefer the old style of blade holder.</li>
            <li> Have to take it completely off to change blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well constructed but is quite a bit smaller than the ProGlide (see picture).  </li>
            <li> To easy to cut yourself and very heavy</li>
            <li> I spent many morning, watching him lather up with his soap brush and then glide the sleek, silver razor down his face, &amp;#34;erasing&amp;#34; his whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade does not fit straight in a planar or edgewise way because of the large tolerances built into the shaver.  </li>
            <li> only thing i wish is that it hat butterfly opening (you have to unscrew to put in a new blade)</li>
            <li> You didn&#x27;t just throw the blade in and then go at it unless you didn&#x27;t care as to how much of your face you wanted to loose .</li>
            <li> The razor itself is very heavy and solid, and seems like it will last for many years.</li>
            <li> The Smart Home double edge head fits all standard double edge blades.</li>
            <li> Granted, no big deal (the cutting edge is held properly), works great and gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Get back to an old time tradition.  </li>
            <li> The rough finish causes the blade edges to bend when the head is screwed into the handle- very unsafe.  </li>
            <li> A little history first.</li>
            <li> For a safety razor, ended up cutting myself more than I do with a normal one.</li>
            <li> I work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item.</li>
            <li> I bought 100 blades for the same price I would have spent for only 5 of the triple edge blades.</li>
            <li> Not enough protection around this single blade razor.</li>
            <li> Razor is much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I used a safety razor like this one.  </li>
            <li> long vs. 5 1/2&amp;#34; on the ProGlide.    </li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a learning curve to learn how to shave with a double edge razor but it is no big deal</li>
            <li> I pressed down on the razor as if it was a plastic handle, I went over the same spot repeatedly</li>
            <li> The only thing that I had to do was align the blade a little</li>
            <li> product is a SmartHome heavy weight double edge safety razor, plus bonuses which are 5 replacement blades, 1 leather blade guard, 1 polishing towel.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it had a longer handle and not a smooth handle</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I have only had this for a few days</li>
            <li> The results were predictable; I ended up looking like an extra in a horror movie.</li>
            <li> Sharp.</li>
            <li> 12 ProGlide replacement blades are $40 with one blade lasting no more than 5 shaves.  </li>
            <li> Once he got used to it though, he got at extremely close shave and did not knick himself.  </li>
            <li> This would make the perfect gift for Father&#x27;s Day, birthday, Christmas or from anyone who is tired of paying outrageous prices for blades.</li>
            <li> That was common knowledge when I started shaving back in the 60&#x27;s .</li>
            <li> The finish on this razor looks as if the manufacturer ran out of chrome - or surface impurities were not cleaned prior to chroming - or the finish is just shoddy.  </li>
            <li> It is chrome with a black handle and has some heft to it.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give it less stars</li>
            <li> Get a bowl, mix up some lather and make a mess in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than maybe what you might be used to  </li>
            <li> Would like to see a little longer handle</li>
            <li> Includes blades and a little &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; to cover the head when not in use.</li>
            <li> I would not call this Heavy Weight</li>
            <li> This has a heavy feel to it.</li>
            <li> The razor was made well and heavy duty, but blades seemed dull.  </li>
            <li> that is not so slick to hold.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why but the weight and balance probably has a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li> it is hard to handle and control with tiis handle.</li>
            <li> The box, which looks sleek and expensive in black, includes the razor, a package of blades, a polishing cloth, and a razor cover.</li>
            <li> No good directions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously there was some rather poor quality control in its manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy another one.</li>
            <li> to change the blade is difficult, was not mentioned , in description, or I may have overlooked it</li>
            <li> My husband currently uses a Gillette ProGlide but the costs of replacement blades is OUTRAGEOUS</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to apply any pressure at all , just let the razor do the cutting.</li>
            <li> Downright dangerous.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great razor</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. First time with a Safety razor, it took me a couple of times to get used to it but it&#x27;s way better than the Mach 3 I was using. Size and weight is perfect.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it. He will not use another razor. He said it&#x27;s like when his Dad taught him how to shave with a old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> I was given a discount on this product in return for an honest review.  A little history first. I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for over 5 years.  I&#x27;ve used just about every razor out there from mild to aggressive.  This is a fantastic mild razor that is perfect for a first razor.  The blade gaps are even and it provides a good shave.  My razor came with 5 Gillette Yellow blades which are fantastic blades for the new shaver.  They&#x27;re good and sharp and last for 5-6 shaves if you take the blade out and rinse it off after you finish your shave.  Father&#x27;s Day is coming up soon and this company is ready.  You&#x27;ll get the razor, blades, an awesome polishing towel, and a blade guard and it&#x27;s presented in a nice gift box as well.  I love the look of the ebony as well.  It&#x27;s a classic look for a razor and I prefer it over the look of the metal handle.  Edwin Jagger makes an ebony handle razor thats about double the price of this one and looks and shaves about the same.  I&#x27;d get this one and pick up a nice brush as well as some soap.  Get back to an old time tradition.  Get a bowl, mix up some lather and make a mess in the bathroom.  Get away from the Billion Dollar Cartridge Gillette Industry and take care of your face the way your grandfather and great grandfather did.  I guarantee your face will thank you!!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I like this thing so much I felt like writing!  I can&#x27;t believe I had been using the disposable razors.  This thing is infinitely better.  Buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my elder brother, who did not want to carry an entire set worth of shaving arsenal. This safety razor is indeed beginner friendly and delightful. The weight is just right, no sharp edges, just the right blade pressure and angle.</li>
            <li> High quality product. Great deal.</li>
            <li> Razor is much smaller than expected. For a safety razor, ended up cutting myself more than I do with a normal one.</li>
            <li> to change the blade is difficult, was not mentioned , in description, or I may have overlooked it</li>
            <li> This is excellent!  I was worried about the quality, but it&#x27;s perfect.  It has a nice weight to it and makes for a beautifully close and easy shave.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful razor,this product arrived just as described . This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly , it arrived in excellent condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a SmartHome heavy weight double edge safety razor, plus bonuses which are 5 replacement blades, 1 leather blade guard, 1 polishing towel.The Smart Home double edge head fits all standard double edge blades.The double edge razor shaves as close as a straight razor.The razor have textured chrome handles for a sure grip when your hands are wet or soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband absolutely loves this razor , he is an old fashioned guy and isn&#x27;t a fan of the disposal razors.He likes a good old fashioned razor , he found it worked amazingly , it is some and gives you a wonderful close shave .He loves the weight and feel of it, it is truly a superior made razor . The look of it is beautiful and the functionality of it is great , this is a razor every man would love to own and use.If you are looking for a product like this for yourself or as a gift look no further you have found it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor .</li>
            <li> This is the type razor I started shaving with and had a good idea of what to expect.Ido remember the close shaves and that is good with this one.The only thing I wish it had a longer handle and not a smooth handle it is hard to handle and control with tiis handle.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best razor I ever used.  It is a little heavier than maybe what you might be used to  but it feels real good in your hand.  Using this razor is cost effective and I can save a whole lot on blades.  I bought 100 blades for the same price I would have spent for only 5 of the triple edge blades. This is a great razor at a great price and I highly recommend it for everyone who has to shave and wants to save $s on blades! There is a little bit of a learning curve to learn how to shave with a double edge razor but it is no big deal</li>
            <li> Clean, nice grip, great razor!!!</li>
            <li> I will start out by saying, this razor will give you a nice clean, close shave and holds the razor blade nice and even across the edge where it counts. I would not call this Heavy Weight and I do not like the way the blade sticks out from the ends.  Granted, no big deal (the cutting edge is held properly), works great and gives a close shave.  Keep in mind, I have only had this for a few days so I am not saying this is well built nor am I saying it is cheaply made.  To me the only test of this is the test of time.  I am saying it gives a nice close shave, holds the cutting edge of the blade nice and even.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this safety razor set, which will be used as a gift. The box, which looks sleek and expensive in black, includes the razor, a package of blades, a polishing cloth, and a razor cover. This is a complete set for someone interested in trying wet shaving for the first time, or someone that has been using this type of razor for a while. The black and silver look of the razor looks classy and is sure to impress whoever receives it. The blades are easy to switch out and the razor is a nice weight. This will make a great gift! Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Packaging of product was very nice, looked sleek and would be great for a gift.  However my husband said that the shave itself wasn&#x27;t great.  The razor was made well and heavy duty, but blades seemed dull.  He ended up having to get his original razor to finish his shave.  Would have made a nice gift if it worked better.  May just need better blades.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Sharp. Was surprised on the quality on the product. Leaves a nice clean feeling and love the fact they include 5 extra blades and a nice little kit. Makes a wonderful gift for someone</li>
            <li> Nice heavy razor set for a close aggressive shave.  Was good to see that the blades were a recognizable name (Gillette.)  Would like to see a little longer handle that is not so slick to hold.  Discounted sample provided for a review.</li>
            <li> nice gift to male friend, brother,.... good product</li>
            <li> Great product I love how much this saves me over regular gillette razors. only thing i wish is that it hat butterfly opening (you have to unscrew to put in a new blade) no big deal tho gets the job done and saves me so much money :).</li>
            <li> He likes it, but it is kind of a pain to change the blades.  Otherwise, though, the shave  is awesome.  His skin is as soft as a babies butt!</li>
            <li> Another good little razor. Packed in a very original gift box. Includes blades and a little &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; to cover the head when not in use.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap Chinese knock off. Spend $7 more and get an Edwin Jaggar.</li>
            <li> Razor arrived on time and it gives a great shave! The weight is just right to  feel like the razor can almost shave by itself!  Could not beat the price either!</li>
            <li> Had to return it as the head and baseplate did not line up properly leaving the exposed blade at an angle on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously there was some rather poor quality control in its manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy another one.</li>
            <li> After being a Gillette handle user all my adult life (Atra, Sensor, Mach 3, Fusion) and a Norelco electric razor user for 20 years, I just wasn&#x27;t happy with the shaves I got from these products. I decided to give old school a try with a safety razor. I decided to try it because S&#x27;HOME had a really nice deal for fathers day offering a father&#x27;s day gift box package. I bought two sets, one for me and one for my father. Great service from S&#x27;HOME. I ordered on Sunday and got the packages on Thursday with the free shipping option. Wow! Now I see why this shaving method was the preferred way of shaving for almost a hundred years. The razor looks very classy and it feels very comfortable in my hands. Being a first time safety razor user I made all the rookie mistakes I read I would make. I pressed down on the razor as if it was a plastic handle, I went over the same spot repeatedly and I went against the beard growth. The results were predictable; I ended up looking like an extra in a horror movie. After that, I saw a couple of videos on Youtube and I read a couple of articles on how to properly use a safety razor and what a difference. Before, shaving was something I had to do it. Now it&#x27;s something I look forward to doing.</li>
            <li> This has a heavy feel to it. Feels really nice, not cheap and flimsy. My husband shaved his face and head with it. He did cut himself nine times the first time. There is a learning curve to using it if you are used to regular razors. He normally uses a Gillette Fusion razor. He liked it enough to keep trying, though. He said the shave was  really close. I agree completely, he felt so much softer when I kissed him. He has cut himself fewer times every shave. I think he is a convert. He has asked me to buy refills for this when he runs out. This one came with five and will last him a bit. I think this would make a great Father&#x27;s Day gift with some nice shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver even for the beginner.  Have had it now for almost 3 months and have to say it works great.  Buy a great badger brush to go with it and your shaving needs are set.</li>
            <li> I received this order quite rapidly.  The presentation in the box was top notch and very pleasing.  I have not used the razor yet, but the workmanship is excellent.  I predict that it will meet all my requirements.</li>
            <li> I saw another, similar razor advertised on TV for much more. This one is very well balanced and therefore handles nicely, letting me easily&lt;br /&gt;shave everywhere. The blade is secure, no shifting.</li>
            <li> This razor came in yesterday and I have used it 2 times already. I got a very close shave from it with one of the Gillette 7&#x27;Oclock blades that came with it. I really like the smoothness of the blades and the razor not being overly aggressive . I here some of the ones who used this razor complaining about the aggressiveness but to me it is mild enough for my beard. I didn&#x27;t have to apply any pressure at all , just let the razor do the cutting. I would recommend this razor to anyone who has an average beard and takes their time to get a very good shave.   The only thing that I had to do was align the blade a little but that is what I do to every razor including the old gillette&#x27;s everytime I install a new blade. That was common knowledge when I started shaving back in the 60&#x27;s . You didn&#x27;t just throw the blade in and then go at it unless you didn&#x27;t care as to how much of your face you wanted to loose . Anyhow, Thank&#x27;s For a Very Nice Product</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I used a safety razor like this one.  I found the blade doesn&#x27;t stay in place meaning the blade wasn&#x27;t squared to the end of the blade holder.  I would prefer the old style of blade holder. Where the top opens up and you place the blade in it.</li>
            <li> This arrived in a very nice black gift box, containing the razor, 5 Gillette blades, and a leather safety cover. The razor itself is very heavy and solid, and seems like it will last for many years. I ended up being too intimidated to use it, but I know someone who will love it! Just like the razors of yore, before the days of disposable heads. It has a solid, manly, retro look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> my razor kid arrived without a polishing cloth, what kind of cloth should be inclosed?</li>
            <li> This type of razor takes some practice...</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I love this type of razor because it doesn&#x27;t get clogged up like the multi-blade ones. Replacement blades are a whole lot cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband wanted!</li>
            <li> Downright dangerous. Not enough protection around this single blade razor. Any blemish on your skin will get cut with lots of bleeding. Going back to Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> Wish the head opened.  Have to take it completely off to change blade.</li>
            <li> To easy to cut yourself and very heavy</li>
            <li> On the counter, in my grandfather&#x27;s bathroom, I remember a razor. I spent many morning, watching him lather up with his soap brush and then glide the sleek, silver razor down his face, &amp;#34;erasing&amp;#34; his whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I got married and my husband moved in, and on our bathroom counter rested a razor, much like Grandfather&#x27;s. It&#x27;s the razor my husband learned to shave with and he tells me, &amp;#34;this razor is ALL man!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using this razor, we&#x27;d love to see a little more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the handle. It&#x27;s smooth, and with a little water on the hand, it lessens the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re shaving, this razor is ideal. It offers a cost effective alternative to those high dollar brand blades--not to mention, you don&#x27;t have to find someone at the big box stores to get blades for you out of the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great razor for your face and your wallet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

            <li> Not as easy to use as it appeared.  No good directions.</li>
            <li> My husband currently uses a Gillette ProGlide but the costs of replacement blades is OUTRAGEOUS so we were both excited when I was given the opportunity to purchase this Smart Home Razor at a discounted price during a promotional period to test for quality and review.  12 ProGlide replacement blades are $40 with one blade lasting no more than 5 shaves.  The razor comes beautifully boxed, perfect for gift giving.  Inside is the razor, 5 double-sided blades, a leather blade guard and a polishing cloth.  The razor itself is quite stylish.  It is chrome with a black handle and has some heft to it.  It&#x27;s very well constructed but is quite a bit smaller than the ProGlide (see picture).  The razor&#x27;s handle is about 3 1/2&amp;#34; long vs. 5 1/2&amp;#34; on the ProGlide.    My husband said it took some getting used to because of the shorter handle and only having one blade rather than 5 blades.  Once he got used to it though, he got at extremely close shave and did not knick himself.  We really like that you can buy 10 replacement blades for this razor for $3.80 from Amazon.  We&#x27;ll save a fortune!  This would make the perfect gift for Father&#x27;s Day, birthday, Christmas or from anyone who is tired of paying outrageous prices for blades.</li>
            <li> Overall, the presentation of this was nice but the razor itself was not 5-star worthy. One side of my razor has a &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34; in it. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it was actually damaged, but it was made that way rather. I&#x27;m not sure if this will effect the shave as I have just used the other side and had fair results. I wish the razor also had more weight to it, especially in the handle. The box I received had a lot of marks on it, making it not that pretty for gifting.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dad for Father&#x27;s Day.  He loves it.  Keep up the good work...</li>
            <li> Cheap razor which epitomizs cheap.  The finish on this razor looks as if the manufacturer ran out of chrome - or surface impurities were not cleaned prior to chroming - or the finish is just shoddy.  The blade does not fit straight in a planar or edgewise way because of the large tolerances built into the shaver.  The rough finish causes the blade edges to bend when the head is screwed into the handle- very unsafe.  Can&#x27;t give it less stars so I gave it one.</li>
            <li> This nondescript and low cost razor is better than all of my Parkers and Merkurs. Not sure why but the weight and balance probably has a lot to do with it. There&#x27;s no knurling but even without its still pretty grippy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, high quality and Great price</li>
