            <li>Good results, leaves your skin very clean.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean smell and is quite effective against bacteria and odors.  </li>
            <li>Loved how quick it came.</li>
            <li>Doctors washing their hands with carbolic soap reduced  operation induced surgical infection by more than 70%.</li>
            <li>While my eye and cheek redness are not 100% better, the eye is 90% better and the skin 50%.  </li>

            <li>No idea why this has worked so well but am just happy to be able to report significant success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, I can&#x27;t argue that this soap DOES make you feel clean, and has a nice carbolic &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>You honestly feel fresh and clean!  </li>
            <li>the smell was soooo strong.  </li>

            <li>This soap is fantastic for acne.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to find a cheap bar</li>

            <li>In addition no tracking was available.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll rather use fragrance free soap and use this on myself.</li>
            <li>Good price and the only place I was able to locate this item on the Internet.  </li>
            <li>their website, it is listed as an &amp;#34;anti-bacterial and mildly antiseptic soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>But its worth a try.</li>
            <li>Useful for the flu pandemic supply kit.</li>
            <li>It also really, really, really gets you clean.    </li>
            <li>But as you can see on the list of ingredients, it contains NO carbolic acid, which is one of the most important active ingredients in true carbolic soap.</li>
            <li>Got us nice and clean, though, and when we lost our dish soap, letting it sit in heated water for a few minutes resulted in nice suds that got the mess kit clean.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I wanted and the store deliver just on time    </li>
            <li>It took about a month for me to begin seeing results but with consistent usage my face started to get clearer and clearer.</li>
            <li>Although I love this Canadian company (or, I at least love the idea of them)</li>
            <li>and you are ready to lather it up on yourself.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>We have tons of mosquitoes in Maine and washing with this soap really helps prevent mosquitoes from biting.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I just use it because it is anti-bacterial on the flares, so that&#x27;s good at least.</li>
            <li>and it is better then other acne products out there.</li>
            <li>so I guess I will have to live with that.</li>
            <li>In addition to regular rosacea, primarily on one side of my face, I also have ocular rosacea on the same side.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and is just as I remembered the last bar of carbolic soap I used years ago!  </li>

            <li>Great Stuff, a bit harsh for delicate skin types though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve copied the list of ingredients directly from their website:&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:</li>
            <li>Seems like the old Lifebouy soap, which Dad loves.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin; this soap does not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>I immediately made an order for half a dozen more bars because of how long the shipping takes from this vendor (they ship it from Canada</li>
            <li>It does kind of smell weird when \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and not wet</li>
            <li>I wanted just the regular old white lifebuoy.</li>
            <li>It is extremely thick and hard to rinse off so make sure you really scrub.</li>
            <li>It has cleared my face up and has kept it clear for a long time now</li>
            <li>I bought this to see if it would help clear up or dry up my Hidradenitis Suppurtiva.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Soap Works Carbolic Soap arrived before the estimated date of arrival.  It was well-packed and arrived unscathed.  It is exactly as described and is just as I remembered the last bar of carbolic soap I used years ago!  The price is a fair price, too.  I will probably do business with this firm again some time.[[ASIN:B0002DTTKC Carbolic Soap (Red Colour) (110g) Brand: SoapWorks]]</li>
            <li> the smell was revolting!  it may be an excellent choice for an antibacterial soap, but you would have to wear a gas mask every time you washed your hands!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap with a great scent.  I remember using carbolic soap as a kid and I always remember the smell.  It also really, really, really gets you clean.    As for its ability to repel mosquitoes, I cannot say.  But its worth a try.</li>
            <li> Useful for the flu pandemic supply kit.</li>
            <li> Although I love this Canadian company (or, I at least love the idea of them), I am curious weather their carbolic soap truly has antiseptic properties?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On their website, it is listed as an &amp;#34;anti-bacterial and mildly antiseptic soap&amp;#34;. But as you can see on the list of ingredients, it contains NO carbolic acid, which is one of the most important active ingredients in true carbolic soap. If it&#x27;s not carbolic acid which makes this soap anti-bacterial and antiseptic, which ingredients do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve copied the list of ingredients directly from their website:&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Cocoate, Glycerin, Carbolic fragrance, FD&amp;C Red Colour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I can&#x27;t argue that this soap DOES make you feel clean, and has a nice carbolic &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see Carbolic acid on the list of ingredients for this soap from the company that actually makes it, but it still seems to get the job done.     I am using this to help sooth a skin condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa, and it seems to help a lot. I liked it so much after trying it I immediately made an order for half a dozen more bars because of how long the shipping takes from this vendor (they ship it from Canada it seems and I am in the US)and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.     Note: I will also be trying the Island Pride brand of carbolic soap to see what it does. If it works as well I may switch to that brand if they have faster shipping, if not, then I will just have to make bulk orders through this one.</li>
            <li> Good price and the only place I was able to locate this item on the Internet.  Quick delivery.  Will definately purchase again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> in&#x27;t din&#x27;t work on my seasonal ichi rushes skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic for acne. It does kind of smell weird when \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and not wet but you can&#x27;t smell a thing once it is all wet and you are ready to lather it up on yourself. It has cleared my face up and has kept it clear for a long time now and it is better then other acne products out there. It is extremely thick and hard to rinse off so make sure you really scrub. I work as a mechanic and between all the grease I get on me (which clogs my pores) to getting it off of my hands carbolic soap is the best thing to use. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the shipping costs but I have yet to find a cheap bar anywhere yet so I guess I will have to live with that.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff, a bit harsh for delicate skin types though. Pretty hard to find the soap that changed though course of surgical history. Doctors washing their hands with carbolic soap reduced  operation induced surgical infection by more than 70%. Became the smell of the colonies, never mind all that, it is a very effective antibacterial and deodorant soap.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I got a fair value for the price that I paid. It does a good job cleaning, helps control my acne, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Carbolic Soap help me clear up a bad cut on my leg and heal it. I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend this soap to anyone who has cuts or bacterial infections on&lt;br /&gt;their skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it would help clear up or dry up my Hidradenitis Suppurtiva. I use it on my flare up areas, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or anything. But I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement. I just use it because it is anti-bacterial on the flares, so that&#x27;s good at least.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I wanted and the store deliver just on time    thank you,</li>
            <li> Seems like the old Lifebouy soap, which Dad loves.  Pricey, though.</li>
            <li> I heard that carbolic soap is an old-fashioned way of treating rosacea.  In addition to regular rosacea, primarily on one side of my face, I also have ocular rosacea on the same side.  After washing twice daily with this soap, and rubbing it in well around the eye and eyebrow area, I seem to have achieved a breakthrough in the ocular rosacea.  While my eye and cheek redness are not 100% better, the eye is 90% better and the skin 50%.  No idea why this has worked so well but am just happy to be able to report significant success.</li>
            <li> This soap is good for cleanliness and preventing skin irritations.  I have used it for light laundering of lingerie as well.  It has a very clean smell and is quite effective against bacteria and odors.  It lathers white.  I wish the bars were larger is size so that they might last longer.  A great soap!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for acne. as an acne treatment it, it cleared my skin up really good and some of my acne marks started to disappear. I use it about every other day becasuse it does dry out my skin. On the other days i use a less harsh acne treatment such as a facial scrub.As for the dry skin i use a small amount of nonsented lotion and that fixes the problem.</li>
            <li> Soap was fine the shippng by the US post office was not. Twice the cost of the soap and twelve days to receive. In addition no tracking was available.</li>
            <li> Arrived within the scheduled date. The smell is a little strong for me but I like it. Wanted to use it on by baby for eczema but I&#x27;ll rather use fragrance free soap and use this on myself.</li>
            <li> Loved how quick it came. I just had to throw it out b/c the smell was soooo strong.  I&#x27;m sure it works great with a smell like that.  I could not bare it though.</li>
            <li> I got this soap from my grandmother in Jamaica. It has worked wonders for my acne and i&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skin. It took about a month for me to begin seeing results but with consistent usage my face started to get clearer and clearer. The only time I would have pimples on my face would be around that time of the month and that&#x27;s just genetics. Recommend for anyone who has tried SEVERAL acne products out there including the prescription ones. This really works.</li>
            <li> I used it for a rash and it made it far worse.I wanted just the regular old white lifebuoy.That formula was great.Know where I can get  ?????&lt;br /&gt;  maris boyd</li>
            <li> We tried this on a recent Minnesota canoe trip. The mosquitos were bad this year, among the worst I&#x27;ve ever encountered. The soap did seem to help some, but short of liquefying it and spraying it on yourself every 15 minutes, it can&#x27;t work miracles. Got us nice and clean, though, and when we lost our dish soap, letting it sit in heated water for a few minutes resulted in nice suds that got the mess kit clean.</li>
            <li> My father was a pharmacist and he recommended the Carbolic soap to me, I use it to wash my hands,when I come home or when I&#x27;m finish working in the backyard or patio.Takes care of germs.Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Carbolic soap is really hard to find in our area.  We have tons of mosquitoes in Maine and washing with this soap really helps prevent mosquitoes from biting.  It smells strong when you take it out from the package and it&#x27;s not yet used.  BUT, when you wash with it, there is no smell left on your skin.  You honestly feel fresh and clean!  I have sensitive skin; this soap does not bother me at all.  It also arrived quickly, especially being sent from Canada.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good results, leaves your skin very clean. Smell is strong.</li>
