            <li>I like this color more than I thought I would.</li>

            <li>I am well pleased with the CND Vinylux line of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>this is a deep mauve, perfect for fall.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok color.</li>
            <li>It protects nails well and using the top coat weekly</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE the color</li>
            <li>but it chipped within a day after applying as instructed and using the top coat.  </li>
            <li>the color es more darker than the pic, and don&#x27;t stay for 7 days as they promise.</li>
            <li>I did use this with the VinylLux top coat.</li>
            <li>but I do love the color.</li>
            <li>I love the nail polish</li>
            <li>And I used the top coat as recommended.</li>
            <li>I love the color, and I bought it to match a gel color I have.  </li>
            <li>but probably will increase as the polish becomes more well</li>
            <li>It wore off even faster than most.  </li>
            <li>Was wearing off at the tips after one day, even with the application of the top coat.</li>
            <li>Easily removes with acetone remover or with more elbow grease using non-acetone remover.</li>
            <li>This polish is a great product so far.</li>
            <li>Product easily lasts a week without the damage you get from gel nails.</li>
            <li>keeps nails strong.  </li>
            <li>the top coat is worth it</li>
            <li>While this is a good nail polish it will not last a week or more as others have stated.</li>
            <li>I think that Married to the Mauve is a great shade for business and/or professional wear.</li>
            <li>The color was pretty, but did not even stay on for 7 days even with the top coat.  </li>
            <li>great long wearing product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, long wearing.</li>
            <li>So excited that I found Vinylux and this color.</li>
            <li>Many pretty colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>More brown than the deep rose color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using Sally Hanson diamond Polish, and it always lasts a full week.</li>
            <li>However, it probably would not look good with a red or orange  outfit.</li>
            <li>Do t love the color too much</li>
            <li>I type all day &amp; was hoping the nail polish would last longer but that being said, it does look good but does require touch after 3 days.</li>
            <li>While I agree, it would be better for your nails possibly, it will stay on, at most, two days without chipping.</li>
            <li>A very pretty rosy mauve color.</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast!!  </li>
            <li>Love this nail polish - last a long time and covers great.  </li>
            <li>Great long lasting polish that doesn&#x27;t require a light for curing!</li>
            <li>No base coat and use the same brand for top coat.</li>
            <li>If I used my other polish (china glaze) with the 7 day top coat, my polish lasted for more than 7 days.  </li>
            <li>but honestly doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as shellac.</li>
            <li>Really pretty color.</li>
            <li>The color was great, but did not last as long as I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li>Applied exactly as directed and it was coming off within an hour.</li>
            <li>Used it only once, but sure do like it.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be buying more of this line.</li>
            <li>However it is better than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>Long wearing polish when used with vinylux top coat.  </li>
            <li>and truly does last a full week!</li>
            <li>And, unlike gel polish, it is easy to take off with regular remover and doesn&#x27;t thrash your nails.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this polish.</li>
            <li>The color&#x27;s name is cute, but not much Mauve color to it.  </li>
            <li>It looks more like purple than pink.</li>
            <li>Much darker than picture shows.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>This polish chipped just as fast as any drug store polish would.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does stay on longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick shipping from this seller and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Lovely color, especially for old hands.  </li>
            <li>Love this color, really soft deep mauve.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a subtle purple and looks really good.</li>
            <li>Seems to really last and look nice for a long time.</li>
            <li>I will not be able to give feedback on this color for my fingernails, because it is much too dark.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the expensive gel polishes without the acetone soak.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Follow up with two coats of clear.</li>
            <li>I use it with the topcoat recommended and it stays on your fingers for nearly a week with no chipping.</li>
            <li>The color, mauve, is soft and creamy looking.</li>
            <li>I love Vinylux nailpolish - it is the only brand I use because I usually get a week out of a manicure.</li>
            <li>As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li>I am VERY hard on my nail polish and never get more than a day before it starts to chip.  </li>
            <li>Has lasted very well on toenails, but toenails always do last a long time for me.</li>
            <li>I really believed that this would not chip or wear off as quickly as other polishes.  </li>
            <li>I feel that it works so long as you do not do average chores and do not wet your hands too much.</li>

            <li> I am VERY hard on my nail polish and never get more than a day before it starts to chip.  </li>
            <li> Has lasted very well on toenails, but toenails always do last a long time for me.</li>
            <li> I really believed that this would not chip or wear off as quickly as other polishes.  </li>
            <li> I feel that it works so long as you do not do average chores and do not wet your hands too much.</li>
            <li> Would have just touched it up and kept going but wanted to see how far it would go between my every other week manicures</li>
            <li> I wish I could say it is long lasting but tried it several times</li>
            <li> I realize colors on a computer screen vary, but this was no where near what is pictured, I threw it out way too dark for me</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as OPI.  </li>
            <li> Still only comes in a limited (maybe 20?)</li>
            <li> I can wear Vinylux for 4-5 days before minor wear/chips start.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a long time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped - darker than expected</li>
            <li> I get manicures to help my dry cuticles but the polish never lasts long.</li>
            <li> The color lasts longer than other polishes, but it does not last for a week.</li>
            <li> like the fact that I can change my polish weekly without dedicating an hour to allow my polish to fully dry or exposing my skin to UV rays.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but disappointed with how long it last.</li>
            <li> Application is the same as any other nail polish, the drying time is less than 10 minutes and the polish survives just under a week for me</li>
            <li> Yes, I have even made 7 days with only a few chips.  </li>
            <li> The color of this polish is a bit off from what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not what i expected</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would last a few days</li>
            <li> Color was not what I expected - not as pink as shown.  </li>
            <li> The color was way too dark to be a Mauve and it didn&#x27;t dry- even after half an hour it was still wet.</li>
            <li> Other reviews talk about an nightly applications of oil, which I am not doing so</li>
            <li> Would not buy any other colors or brand.</li>
            <li> Kinda dark, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is it is a little hard to get off</li>
            <li> THIS COLOR GOES WITH BLACK, NAVY OR BROWN</li>
            <li> Lasts for at least 6 days before minor chips.  </li>
            <li> It is a step up from neutral, a little subdued - but not over-powering.</li>
            <li> I probably will try another color at some point, but a little gun-shy to trust pics.</li>
            <li> Not much better than any other polish line on the market</li>
            <li> I did nothing that day but lunch and a little shopping.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Polish was not smooth.</li>
            <li> my nails usually chip within mere hours of applying regular polish.  </li>
            <li> It does indeed stay on at least a week - usually longer and may be taken off with an ordinary remover.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to remove.</li>
            <li> (I am VERY hard on my nails).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hard on my hands.</li>
            <li> like the color but not the formula....streaks and very thick to apply.</li>
            <li> Silly me.  </li>
            <li> this polish stays on for at least 5 days!!!</li>
            <li> Too bad, eh?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lovely color, especially for old hands.  It softens the look of my age spots.  As with the Clay, it lasts several days, but not the week stated.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> No surprises was as advertised.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this color does not go on evenly, even after two coats. I have tried this several times, same problem.</li>
            <li> Love, Love this product. Really pretty color.</li>
            <li> Gel will ruin your nails this will help you move forward and will last 6-7 days and simply remove with regular remover is seconds and start again- Waiting for the salons in my area to start using!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using Sally Hanson diamond Polish, and it always lasts a full week. At a recent pedicure, the stylist recommended the Vinylux. It&#x27;s also hard to remove. Won&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
            <li> Saw this brand profiled in magazines, had to try it.  If you don&#x27;t want to put gels or shellac on your nails, this is the way to go.  After 12 days finally had chips and wear on the tips.  Would have just touched it up and kept going but wanted to see how far it would go between my every other week manicures</li>
            <li> This is much more of a purple/grey color than what you see in the picture. It&#x27;s perfect fall color! I enjoyed it and had it on for about a week.</li>
            <li> The color was pretty, but did not even stay on for 7 days even with the top coat.  If I used my other polish (china glaze) with the 7 day top coat, my polish lasted for more than 7 days.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this color more than I thought I would. It&#x27;s a subtle purple and looks really good. A nice addition to my Vinylux colors.</li>
            <li> I love Vinylux nailpolish - it is the only brand I use because I usually get a week out of a manicure. This color, Glacial Mist, is beautiful - sparkly and amazing staying power.  As you&#x27;ll see in the picture, no chips or wear showing after 6 days!  The color is great because it goes with any color outfit.</li>
            <li> The color was great, but did not last as long as I had hoped it would. Still would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the color, get many compliments, stays on for days...  I will order again.  THIS COLOR GOES WITH BLACK, NAVY OR BROWN VERY NICE Mary JO</li>
            <li> Applied exactly as directed and it was coming off within an hour. I am quite experienced with all types of nail enamel, including gels. Don&#x27;t buy this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this color, really soft deep mauve.  Can&#x27;t speak highly enough about the CND Vinylux line.  Great alternative to the expensive gel polishes without the acetone soak.  Easily removes with acetone remover or with more elbow grease using non-acetone remover.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with the CND Vinylux line of nail polish.  It does indeed stay on at least a week - usually longer and may be taken off with an ordinary remover.  I think that Married to the Mauve is a great shade for business and/or professional wear. It is a step up from neutral, a little subdued - but not over-powering. However, it probably would not look good with a red or orange  outfit. I would certainly recommend this polish.</li>
            <li> Application is the same as any other nail polish, the drying time is less than 10 minutes and the polish survives just under a week for me (I am VERY hard on my nails). Other reviews talk about an nightly applications of oil, which I am not doing so maybe the polish would last longer if I did?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I can change my polish weekly without dedicating an hour to allow my polish to fully dry or exposing my skin to UV rays. The color selection is fairly vast with this product. I have recommended it to several friends and will continue to do so as well as continue to purchase and use the product myself.</li>
            <li> great long wearing product.  this is a deep mauve, perfect for fall.  I am impressed by how well this product line wears.  my nails usually chip within mere hours of applying regular polish.  I can wear Vinylux for 4-5 days before minor wear/chips start.  Yes, I have even made 7 days with only a few chips.  can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped - darker than expected</li>
            <li> Used it only once, but sure do like it. Seems to really last and look nice for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the second color I have of cnd and my fav!  It does have a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The color of this polish is a bit off from what I expected.  The color&#x27;s name is cute, but not much Mauve color to it.  Darker and perhaps a bit to orange for me.  The polish itself is great!  I use it with the topcoat recommended and it stays on your fingers for nearly a week with no chipping.</li>
            <li> Vinylux is great brand. Color is nice and with the top coat has a nice shine. I do pottery and this polish stays on for at least 5 days!!!</li>
            <li> This polish was supposed to last for seven days. The color lasts longer than other polishes, but it does not last for a week.</li>
            <li> Kinda dark, but I like it.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as brownish as in the picture. It looks more like purple than pink. Not what i expected but it&#x27;s ok color.</li>
            <li> Much darker than picture shows. Has lasted very well on toenails, but toenails always do last a long time for me. I will not be able to give feedback on this color for my fingernails, because it is much too dark. I probably will try another color at some point, but a little gun-shy to trust pics. Ordering a gel kit anyway.</li>
            <li> This polish is a great product so far. NO CHIPPING!! Dries super fast!!  A very pretty rosy mauve color. Good shine to it too.</li>
            <li> I started using CND vinylux and have found it cheaper on amazon.  It protects nails well and using the top coat weekly keeps nails strong.  The color, mauve, is soft and creamy looking.</li>
            <li> Great color!.I love CND!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE the color but I wish CND made the Shellac to match. Great product, long wearing.</li>
            <li> good color...blends with everything</li>
            <li> I am VERY hard on my nail polish and never get more than a day before it starts to chip.  I had hoped this would last a few days but it chipped within a day after applying as instructed and using the top coat.  The color is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Do t love the color too much</li>
            <li> The color was way too dark to be a Mauve and it didn&#x27;t dry- even after half an hour it was still wet.</li>
            <li> Not much better than any other polish line on the market</li>
            <li> I type all day &amp; was hoping the nail polish would last longer but that being said, it does look good but does require touch after 3 days.</li>
            <li> the color es more darker than the pic, and don&#x27;t stay for 7 days as they promise. i don&#x27;t even want to buy another one.</li>
            <li> While this is a good nail polish it will not last a week or more as others have stated. While I agree, it would be better for your nails possibly, it will stay on, at most, two days without chipping. I wish I could say it is long lasting but tried it several times and it just doesn&#x27;t. I did use this with the VinylLux top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish - last a long time and covers great.  Follow up with two coats of clear.</li>
            <li> Color was not what I expected - not as pink as shown.  Wore for over a week, but stained my nails.</li>
            <li> a bit darker on the nail than it appears in the bottle</li>
            <li> This color is great and it lasts forever!! So excited that I found Vinylux and this color. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> This product works SO well. As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li> Love the color, but disappointed with how long it last. I feel that it works so long as you do not do average chores and do not wet your hands too much. but I do love the color.</li>
            <li> Amazing fall color.  Chic muave - taupe.  Lasts for at least 6 days before minor chips.  Definitely will be buying more of this line.</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish the only thing is it is a little hard to get off you need to use acetate</li>
            <li> Nice color but honestly doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as shellac. However it is better than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> More brown than the deep rose color it appeared to be when viewed on line.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as OPI.  And I used the top coat as recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the color, and I bought it to match a gel color I have.  I prefer to use gel polish on my nails and regular polish on my toes because removing gel polish myself is much more difficult on my feet.  This polish chipped just as fast as any drug store polish would.</li>
            <li> This was touted to last 7 to 10 days.  I did my nails in the evening and by the next afternoon they were all chipped, the polish had to be removed.  I did nothing that day but lunch and a little shopping.</li>
            <li> I drink iced coffee daily!</li>
            <li> I realize colors on a computer screen vary, but this was no where near what is pictured, I threw it out way too dark for me</li>
            <li> Used with topcoat and it lasted almost 6 days before I felt I had to take it off.  I&#x27;m very hard on my hands.</li>
            <li> Great color. Product easily lasts a week without the damage you get from gel nails. Many pretty colors to choose from. I have been using this product a long time. It never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I have short nails and use my hands a lot. I get manicures to help my dry cuticles but the polish never lasts long. This stuff really does stay on longer. They say a week, but five days for me though I chip regular polish in just two. It is a bit thinner than regular polish and I like that. No base coat and use the same brand for top coat. I still use regular polish on my toes but am switching permanently to this for my hands. And, unlike gel polish, it is easy to take off with regular remover and doesn&#x27;t thrash your nails. Still only comes in a limited (maybe 20?) range but probably will increase as the polish becomes more well known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping from this seller and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really believed that this would not chip or wear off as quickly as other polishes.  Silly me.  It wore off even faster than most.  What a waste of money.  Would not buy any other colors or brand.</li>
            <li> Long wearing polish when used with vinylux top coat.  Shop where i have nails done has ordered for shop use.</li>
            <li> Was wearing off at the tips after one day, even with the application of the top coat. Too bad, eh?</li>
            <li> Did not last but two days</li>
            <li> Great long lasting polish that doesn&#x27;t require a light for curing!</li>
            <li> Great color and truly does last a full week! Best polish ever!</li>
            <li> like the color but not the formula....streaks and very thick to apply. the top coat is worth it tho&#x27; which will work w/any nail enamel. plan to stay w/esse products.</li>
            <li> Polish was not smooth. It formed ridges. Color is nice.</li>
