            <li>Priced great if you divide the # of tubes you get.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
            <li>that being said, I still think they are great and would recommend them to</li>
            <li>They keep my lips moisturizer and tastes great.</li>
            <li>Candid Essentials lip balm comes in a 5 pack with the wonderful flavors of Vivacious Vanilla, Minty Madness, Passion Punch, Mystic Mint and Tantalizing Tangerine.</li>
            <li>Very nice 5 pack.</li>
            <li>These lip balms are AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>but this is a really nice product!</li>
            <li>They feel good on my lips.</li>

            <li>feels good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Loved the name of the balms too -  Vivacious Vanilla, Minty Madness, Passion Punch, Mystic Mint, &amp; Tantalizing</li>
            <li>Lip Balm was a good deal for the amount ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to test this product!!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is organic!  </li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t have too many!</li>
            <li>Love these lip balms!  </li>
            <li>ok - I got the vanilla!  </li>
            <li>This lip balm is amazing.  </li>
            <li>They go on smoothly, smell great and protect!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it feels amazing on your lips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping was fast, the service was excellent.</li>
            <li>Each of the three girls picked one they liked but thats</li>
            <li>So my rule of thumb has become; if a company prioritizes their use of Shea Butter to boost sales revenue versus creating an effective product - I don&#x27;t trust the company, I don&#x27;t give them my $.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is the most successful skin and hair softener I&#x27;ve found, and as these lip balms are far more convenient than a bottle of oil to tote around, they&#x27;re great to keep on hand while I&#x27;m out of the house!</li>
            <li>This lip balm is so awesome it leaves your lips feeling so soft and nice.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the very best lip balm on the market.</li>
            <li>I was a Chapstick lip moisturizer fan for years because I assumed they were the best, but I would have to reapply frequently.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely an awesome value for organic and all natural ingredients in 5 tubes of chapstick.</li>
            <li>excited I was able to try these - definitively worth the money and great stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li>At first it makes your lips feel great</li>
            <li>Each of them go on very smooth and the do leave your lips moisturized.</li>
            <li>The are very smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with my new Liplocks balm from Candid Essentials.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth &amp; refreshing.  </li>
            <li>They are smooth and pleasant and give your breath a nice fresh kick as well.</li>
            <li>I love all the scents.</li>
            <li>That said, I do think they are a healthier option than most.</li>
            <li>I do love the Vanilla flavor and will probably continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>but then dries them out more.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>and I love the taste.</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>These taste amazing and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I received these lip balms in exchange of my unbiased opinion and I am so glad for it.</li>
            <li>and I am glad.</li>
            <li>I then tried EOS, which is even better, and provided around three hours of moisture before I had to reapply.  </li>
            <li>These are definitely top quality lip balms, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>So glad this lip balm came as a 5 pack because my kids are fighting over them.  </li>
            <li>I was offered a chance to try and review this product at a reduced price and I am so glad.  </li>
            <li>I feel better about my kids using them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We were able to test and try these during a  promotional period.</li>
            <li>Many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and/or organic lip balms still contain chemical toxins.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found these</li>
            <li>My fiance is huge into chapsticks and has already claimed one as his own (fruit punch)</li>
            <li>I love both the peppermint ones</li>
            <li>We love these</li>
            <li>They all smelled fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It was her favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love the way they smell.</li>
            <li>I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion...</li>
            <li>My favorite is the passion punch.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the competition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This lip balm does exactly as it claims !!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that my husband bought these during a promotion for me as a gift because now I have smooth lips to kiss him with ;-).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that Candid Essentials LipLoks product has proven to be a winner on numerous levels.</li>
            <li>Very cool product.</li>
            <li>They really moisturize and I am super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love all the flavors they are fun!</li>
            <li>I love it and am excited to replace my Chapstick brand for an organic brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a 5-pack for the price I normally pay for 2 of the Karite lip balms, and the flavors are nice, not over the top.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite smell!  </li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Such a great product ~~ Vivacious Vanilla, Minty Madness, Passion Punch, Mystic Mint and Tantalizing Tangerine</li>
            <li>Plus with 5 of them, I always have one available (purse, briefcase, makeup case, etc.)  </li>
            <li>light flavor/scent and stays on.</li>
            <li>so smooth...</li>
            <li>All around, this is such a great product.</li>
            <li>These helped with the chapped lips and made our lips moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>However, it seems to be the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; ingredient right now and more often than not when I find a product that boasts of having Shea Butter</li>
            <li>The balm is pretty good, at times a bit grainy, most probably because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite lip balm!  </li>
            <li>My kids were excited about the fruity flavors, and neither of them like it either, the smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase and found a great alternative for less $!</li>
            <li>Just recieved my lip balms yesterday so far I am pleased!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been the only balm I&#x27;ve consistently used and been happy with.</li>
            <li>However, it is a good enough product that you don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about texture and scent, and I don&#x27;t like an overpowering sweet flavor.</li>
            <li>The texture is just as smooth as the others, I&#x27;m just not crazy about the flavor/scent.</li>
            <li>The flavors are mild so that has presented no problem.</li>
            <li>It nourishes and heals quickly.  </li>
            <li>Really love these lip balms and Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Feels smooth and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Bought these for my nieces because they are chemical free and organic and loved them so much I went back and ordered for myself.</li>
            <li>I am in love with lip products, and use quite a few different ones, but was very impressed with these.</li>
            <li>My boy gets raw lips from drooling so much, and they are perfect to use on him.</li>
            <li>and I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>The best part is that they are natural and not full of a bunch of junk.</li>
            <li>My little son always want lip balm on his lips when he sees me applying a lip balm so this is great for him.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>I can relax when my two year old snatches these from my bag to put on &#x27;makeup&#x27; like mommy as the ingredients are edible and safe.</li>
            <li>love that these are 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li>Even better they leave your lips soft not sticky.</li>
            <li>I am using Minty one right now</li>
            <li>I will coat the entire inflamed area and it really helps to make them more comfortable and places a barrier from their tongues.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm is great, but I really don&#x27;t see the difference in the different flavors; however it is really smooth on the lips and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>The price for this set of balms is also a very good value when compared to the prices of other similar products.  </li>
            <li>everything is as shown and I like this product very much</li>
            <li>These are fantastic 100% natural lip balms.  </li>
            <li>They come in 5 different flavors that my kids love.  </li>
            <li>Such a cute idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>~~ the lip balm is Organic, it doesn&#x27;t have parabens, GMO&#x27;s, or a chemical scent, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals; pretty much exactly what I was looking for ~~ Thanks</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips feeling soft and I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>The flavors are natural and soft, I have tried them all and each one is a favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many lip balms and look for all natural ones as my lips are sensitive to non-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I claims to be flavored naturally, but the vanilla tastes like cake mix, and it is sweet.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, soothing and most important</li>
            <li>The packaging holding 5 different white colored scented lip balms are super cute.</li>
            <li>I really like these balms because thy certainly moisturize my lips</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my lips very moist for hours</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I really like the lip balm.</li>
            <li>I really really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>The two different mint flavors included in this box are fabulous.</li>
            <li>Let me just start off by saying that each lip balm really does smell like the scent described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i really like the vanilla</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very selective regarding lip balm.</li>
            <li>A few months ago I came across this Candid Essentials product;</li>
            <li>The only point I want to bring up is that they melt pretty darned quick.</li>
            <li>rose hip seed oil among other natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>A lot of natural lip balms (and normal ones too) are not very moisturizing and don&#x27;t feel nice when applying.</li>
            <li>These lip balm&#x27;s are really smooth and have healed my dry lips.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s all-natural, and the slightly glossy effect.  </li>
            <li>Ordered three different types of lip balm as I&#x27;m super picky with my lip balm.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly reccomend and purchase again.</li>
            <li>Did I mention they are also organic and 100% natural?!!</li>
            <li>But, if you do use more of the chapstick on your lips, they get a little bit of a waxy feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not normally a huge fan of vanilla as I prefer more herbal flavors, but this vanilla???</li>
            <li>Instead of pulling the cracks open it smooths over them giving comfort right away.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and lush even on my very dry cracked lips.</li>
            <li>One of the nieces has severe allergies to new things - she had no problem with the Passion Punch.</li>
            <li>Of the three types, this is by far the winner!</li>
            <li>I have tried many lip balms in the past.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give these a try on a whim and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I usually use a few layers to get a good coating on my lips, but these did not use much product at all.</li>
            <li>I have really dry lips in the morning and this cures it right away.  </li>
            <li>You can tell it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>The fruit punch is my least favorite of the 5.</li>
            <li>I am a chapstick addict, so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase this Lip Balm pack at a promotional price, I couldn&#x27;t say yes fast enough.</li>
            <li>ingredients in my opinion is what makes the balm soft, so if you leave&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>I was very dehydrated inside and out when I recieved the  lip balm and in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Loved the fact that these are all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>The only downside that I found was that waxy feel from too much product, but that can be avoided.</li>
            <li>I would recommend highly if your looking for something similar to Burts Bees.</li>
            <li>This lip balm doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and has a strange sweet taste.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve spent too much money on new products only to throw them out after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>I have at least one tube stashed pretty much every everywhere.</li>
            <li>As a chapstick addict who wanted to find something organic to constantly wear on my lips, I wish that these were completely organic (they are not).  </li>
            <li>I have lips that are constantly dry,and using your product often,has helped them considerably</li>
            <li>that is looking for a natural lip balm that actually works.</li>
            <li>I will only use natural products on my children.  </li>
            <li>I especially like it because I don&#x27;t have to worry about what I&#x27;m using on his lips since they are an all natural product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have it slightly grainy and natural than all smooth and full of weird stuff.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s the last or near to last ingredient listed.</li>
            <li>The only other brand of lip balm I like as much as these is the</li>

            <li> Each of the three girls picked one they liked but thats</li>
            <li> So my rule of thumb has become; if a company prioritizes their use of Shea Butter to boost sales revenue versus creating an effective product - I don&#x27;t trust the company, I don&#x27;t give them my $.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is the most successful skin and hair softener I&#x27;ve found, and as these lip balms are far more convenient than a bottle of oil to tote around, they&#x27;re great to keep on hand while I&#x27;m out of the house!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is so awesome it leaves your lips feeling so soft and nice.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the very best lip balm on the market.</li>
            <li> I was a Chapstick lip moisturizer fan for years because I assumed they were the best, but I would have to reapply frequently.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely an awesome value for organic and all natural ingredients in 5 tubes of chapstick.</li>
            <li> excited I was able to try these - definitively worth the money and great stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> At first it makes your lips feel great</li>
            <li> Each of them go on very smooth and the do leave your lips moisturized.</li>
            <li> The are very smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my new Liplocks balm from Candid Essentials.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth &amp; refreshing.  </li>
            <li> They are smooth and pleasant and give your breath a nice fresh kick as well.</li>
            <li> I love all the scents.</li>
            <li> That said, I do think they are a healthier option than most.</li>
            <li> I do love the Vanilla flavor and will probably continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> but then dries them out more.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> and I love the taste.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> These taste amazing and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I received these lip balms in exchange of my unbiased opinion and I am so glad for it.</li>
            <li> and I am glad.</li>
            <li> I then tried EOS, which is even better, and provided around three hours of moisture before I had to reapply.  </li>
            <li> These are definitely top quality lip balms, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> So glad this lip balm came as a 5 pack because my kids are fighting over them.  </li>
            <li> I was offered a chance to try and review this product at a reduced price and I am so glad.  </li>
            <li> I feel better about my kids using them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We were able to test and try these during a  promotional period.</li>
            <li> Many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and/or organic lip balms still contain chemical toxins.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found these</li>
            <li> My fiance is huge into chapsticks and has already claimed one as his own (fruit punch)</li>
            <li> I love both the peppermint ones</li>
            <li> We love these</li>
            <li> They all smelled fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It was her favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love the way they smell.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion...</li>
            <li> My favorite is the passion punch.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the competition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This lip balm does exactly as it claims !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that my husband bought these during a promotion for me as a gift because now I have smooth lips to kiss him with ;-).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that Candid Essentials LipLoks product has proven to be a winner on numerous levels.</li>
            <li> Very cool product.</li>
            <li> They really moisturize and I am super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love all the flavors they are fun!</li>
            <li> I love it and am excited to replace my Chapstick brand for an organic brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a 5-pack for the price I normally pay for 2 of the Karite lip balms, and the flavors are nice, not over the top.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite smell!  </li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Such a great product ~~ Vivacious Vanilla, Minty Madness, Passion Punch, Mystic Mint and Tantalizing Tangerine</li>
            <li> Plus with 5 of them, I always have one available (purse, briefcase, makeup case, etc.)  </li>
            <li> light flavor/scent and stays on.</li>
            <li> so smooth...</li>
            <li> All around, this is such a great product.</li>
            <li> These helped with the chapped lips and made our lips moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> However, it seems to be the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; ingredient right now and more often than not when I find a product that boasts of having Shea Butter</li>
            <li> The balm is pretty good, at times a bit grainy, most probably because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lip balm!  </li>
            <li> My kids were excited about the fruity flavors, and neither of them like it either, the smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase and found a great alternative for less $!</li>
            <li> Just recieved my lip balms yesterday so far I am pleased!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been the only balm I&#x27;ve consistently used and been happy with.</li>
            <li> However, it is a good enough product that you don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about texture and scent, and I don&#x27;t like an overpowering sweet flavor.</li>
            <li> The texture is just as smooth as the others, I&#x27;m just not crazy about the flavor/scent.</li>
            <li> The flavors are mild so that has presented no problem.</li>
            <li> It nourishes and heals quickly.  </li>
            <li> Really love these lip balms and Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Feels smooth and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my nieces because they are chemical free and organic and loved them so much I went back and ordered for myself.</li>
            <li> I am in love with lip products, and use quite a few different ones, but was very impressed with these.</li>
            <li> My boy gets raw lips from drooling so much, and they are perfect to use on him.</li>
            <li> and I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> The best part is that they are natural and not full of a bunch of junk.</li>
            <li> My little son always want lip balm on his lips when he sees me applying a lip balm so this is great for him.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> I can relax when my two year old snatches these from my bag to put on &#x27;makeup&#x27; like mommy as the ingredients are edible and safe.</li>
            <li> love that these are 100% natural and organic.</li>
            <li> Even better they leave your lips soft not sticky.</li>
            <li> I am using Minty one right now</li>
            <li> I will coat the entire inflamed area and it really helps to make them more comfortable and places a barrier from their tongues.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm is great, but I really don&#x27;t see the difference in the different flavors; however it is really smooth on the lips and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> The price for this set of balms is also a very good value when compared to the prices of other similar products.  </li>
            <li> everything is as shown and I like this product very much</li>
            <li> These are fantastic 100% natural lip balms.  </li>
            <li> They come in 5 different flavors that my kids love.  </li>
            <li> Such a cute idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ~~ the lip balm is Organic, it doesn&#x27;t have parabens, GMO&#x27;s, or a chemical scent, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals; pretty much exactly what I was looking for ~~ Thanks</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips feeling soft and I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> The flavors are natural and soft, I have tried them all and each one is a favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many lip balms and look for all natural ones as my lips are sensitive to non-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I claims to be flavored naturally, but the vanilla tastes like cake mix, and it is sweet.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, soothing and most important</li>
            <li> The packaging holding 5 different white colored scented lip balms are super cute.</li>
            <li> I really like these balms because thy certainly moisturize my lips</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my lips very moist for hours</li>
            <li> Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I really like the lip balm.</li>
            <li> I really really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li> The two different mint flavors included in this box are fabulous.</li>
            <li> Let me just start off by saying that each lip balm really does smell like the scent described.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i really like the vanilla</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very selective regarding lip balm.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I came across this Candid Essentials product;</li>
            <li> The only point I want to bring up is that they melt pretty darned quick.</li>
            <li> rose hip seed oil among other natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> A lot of natural lip balms (and normal ones too) are not very moisturizing and don&#x27;t feel nice when applying.</li>
            <li> These lip balm&#x27;s are really smooth and have healed my dry lips.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s all-natural, and the slightly glossy effect.  </li>
            <li> Ordered three different types of lip balm as I&#x27;m super picky with my lip balm.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly reccomend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Did I mention they are also organic and 100% natural?!!</li>
            <li> But, if you do use more of the chapstick on your lips, they get a little bit of a waxy feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally a huge fan of vanilla as I prefer more herbal flavors, but this vanilla???</li>
            <li> Instead of pulling the cracks open it smooths over them giving comfort right away.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and lush even on my very dry cracked lips.</li>
            <li> One of the nieces has severe allergies to new things - she had no problem with the Passion Punch.</li>
            <li> Of the three types, this is by far the winner!</li>
            <li> I have tried many lip balms in the past.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give these a try on a whim and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I usually use a few layers to get a good coating on my lips, but these did not use much product at all.</li>
            <li> I have really dry lips in the morning and this cures it right away.  </li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> The fruit punch is my least favorite of the 5.</li>
            <li> I am a chapstick addict, so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase this Lip Balm pack at a promotional price, I couldn&#x27;t say yes fast enough.</li>
            <li> ingredients in my opinion is what makes the balm soft, so if you leave&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li> I was very dehydrated inside and out when I recieved the  lip balm and in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loved the fact that these are all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li> The only downside that I found was that waxy feel from too much product, but that can be avoided.</li>
            <li> I would recommend highly if your looking for something similar to Burts Bees.</li>
            <li> This lip balm doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and has a strange sweet taste.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve spent too much money on new products only to throw them out after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I have at least one tube stashed pretty much every everywhere.</li>
            <li> As a chapstick addict who wanted to find something organic to constantly wear on my lips, I wish that these were completely organic (they are not).  </li>
            <li> I have lips that are constantly dry,and using your product often,has helped them considerably</li>
            <li> that is looking for a natural lip balm that actually works.</li>
            <li> I will only use natural products on my children.  </li>
            <li> I especially like it because I don&#x27;t have to worry about what I&#x27;m using on his lips since they are an all natural product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have it slightly grainy and natural than all smooth and full of weird stuff.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s the last or near to last ingredient listed.</li>
            <li> The only other brand of lip balm I like as much as these is the</li>
            <li> I have dry lips all year round and this balm really helped keep them from cracking!</li>
            <li> The only beef I have with this product is that the package itself was crushed and open.  </li>
            <li> My dry lips were soft and moisturized in less than a day.</li>
            <li> Like that I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of chemicals on my lips, and it&#x27;s not dry like other &amp;#34;chapsticks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Works well so far - a little  waxy but it hasn&#x27;t caused my lips to peel like other similar products.</li>
            <li> My lips are always dry.</li>
            <li> When you open the little box you see little phrases in different languages describing the word Kiss Me in and through out the package from Spanish to Chinese.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and they tend to get very dry.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> products with minimal ingredients...</li>
            <li> in your car or in your pocket the heat may melt it faster than other balms.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Consumers need to look carefully at the ingredients on the labels!  </li>
            <li> I began researching other products again given the cost and difficulty with locating the Karite product.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that they can be a little soft and will probably melt in the summer.  </li>
            <li> One of them was a little &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; too.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with cold sores erupting if I use certain types of lip balms.</li>
            <li> Every few hours they will ask me to reapply and after a few days it heals.  </li>
            <li> I HATE vanilla reproduced in a product usually, but your vanilla is so spot on to what REAL  vanilla is, BRAVO!!</li>
            <li> As a nurse I usually keep lip balm in my pocket and cannot do that with this product</li>
            <li> I find that other chapsticks leave a waxy coating and do nothing to hydrate so the lips end up getting worse in the ling run.  </li>
            <li> Not too greasy or hard - absorbs great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm sucker.</li>
            <li> I can apply it and not have to reapply for at least four hours, even through eating and drinking.  </li>
            <li> This lip balm gives thick coverage for severely chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> Now in winters my lips get worst and It keeps my lips soft and moist longer than the other lip balms.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t live in a cold state, I have the bad habit of always licking my lips</li>
            <li> No more cracked lips in the cold Michigan winters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been a brutal winter for us here in the Northeast and we use lip balm constantly.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product and great price. I can relax when my two year old snatches these from my bag to put on &#x27;makeup&#x27; like mommy as the ingredients are edible and safe. I love all the scents.</li>
            <li> Such a great product ~~ Vivacious Vanilla, Minty Madness, Passion Punch, Mystic Mint and Tantalizing Tangerine ~~ the lip balm is Organic, it doesn&#x27;t have parabens, GMO&#x27;s, or a chemical scent, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals; pretty much exactly what I was looking for ~~ Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm.  I have really dry lips in the morning and this cures it right away.  Plus with 5 of them, I always have one available (purse, briefcase, makeup case, etc.)  I would highly recommend this product.  Linda</li>
            <li> Works well so far - a little  waxy but it hasn&#x27;t caused my lips to peel like other similar products. The flavors are mild so that has presented no problem.</li>
            <li> If there were 10 stars you would get it! This is by far the very best lip balm on the market. I HATE vanilla reproduced in a product usually, but your vanilla is so spot on to what REAL  vanilla is, BRAVO!! Long lasting, soothing and most important HEALING!&lt;br /&gt;WELL DONE!!</li>
            <li> As a chapstick addict who wanted to find something organic to constantly wear on my lips, I wish that these were completely organic (they are not).  That said, I do think they are a healthier option than most. My only real complaint is that they can be a little soft and will probably melt in the summer.  One of them was a little &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; too.  I do love the Vanilla flavor and will probably continue to purchase. However, if you want a truly organic lip balm, I would recommend Certified Organic Lip Balm by Sacred Earth Botanicals on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have lips that are constantly dry,and using your product often,has helped them considerably</li>
            <li> At first it makes your lips feel great but then dries them out more.</li>
            <li> Okay. Basic lip balm.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my new Liplocks balm from Candid Essentials. It keeps my lips very moist for hours and I love the taste. I will keep buying this lip balm from now on.</li>
            <li> This lip balm does exactly as it claims !!! My dry lips were soft and moisturized in less than a day.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.  Feels smooth and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.  Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps my lips feeling soft and I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is great, but I really don&#x27;t see the difference in the different flavors; however it is really smooth on the lips and stays on for a long time. Love the fact that it is organic!  The only beef I have with this product is that the package itself was crushed and open.  The individual lip balms all had the seals intact, otherwise I would have returned them. Don&#x27;t understand how you can ship a package like that.</li>
            <li> Very nice 5 pack. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is the most successful skin and hair softener I&#x27;ve found, and as these lip balms are far more convenient than a bottle of oil to tote around, they&#x27;re great to keep on hand while I&#x27;m out of the house! The flavors are very pleasant, not overpowering or candy-like.</li>
            <li> Ordered three different types of lip balm as I&#x27;m super picky with my lip balm. Of the three types, this is by far the winner! Love it. Coverage is great. light flavor/scent and stays on. Will definitely by again.</li>
            <li> Give them to my sister, she likes them.</li>
            <li> I really like the lip balm. You can tell it&#x27;s all natural. It doesn&#x27;t bother my lips like some.</li>
            <li> Our friend taking chemo said the lib balm is awesome!</li>
            <li> The balm is pretty good, at times a bit grainy, most probably because it&#x27;s all natural. I&#x27;d rather have it slightly grainy and natural than all smooth and full of weird stuff.</li>
            <li> These taste amazing and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have problems with cold sores erupting if I use certain types of lip balms. Thankfully, these do not fall into that category. They feel good on my lips. I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth &amp; refreshing.  Like that I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of chemicals on my lips, and it&#x27;s not dry like other &amp;#34;chapsticks&amp;#34;.  Priced great if you divide the # of tubes you get.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lip balm!  It&#x27;s wonderfully moisturizing, smells great, and healthier for my lips than Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Great flavors; good company!</li>
            <li> My lips are always dry. I am a lip balm sucker. I need lip balm through out the year. and I keep 3-4 in use at once. I have tried many lip balms in the past. I really really like this lip balm. Now in winters my lips get worst and It keeps my lips soft and moist longer than the other lip balms. It has no smell and no color but it has flavors. My little son always want lip balm on his lips when he sees me applying a lip balm so this is great for him.&lt;br /&gt;These come in 5 1 pack. each one has different flavor. I am using Minty one right now and it feels tingly on the lips. Really love these lip balms and Highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received these lip balms in exchange of my unbiased opinion and I am so glad for it.</li>
            <li> I was leery about the price, but the reviews lured me in... and I am glad. The only point I want to bring up is that they melt pretty darned quick. As a nurse I usually keep lip balm in my pocket and cannot do that with this product or it melts and gets into my clothing. However, it is a good enough product that you don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> These lip balm&#x27;s are really smooth and have healed my dry lips. Even though I don&#x27;t live in a cold state, I have the bad habit of always licking my lips and they tend to get very dry.  I&#x27;m so happy that my husband bought these during a promotion for me as a gift because now I have smooth lips to kiss him with ;-).</li>
            <li> so smooth... i&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
            <li> This lip balm is amazing.  I was a Chapstick lip moisturizer fan for years because I assumed they were the best, but I would have to reapply frequently.  I then tried EOS, which is even better, and provided around three hours of moisture before I had to reapply.  Liploks is the best of them all.  I can apply it and not have to reapply for at least four hours, even through eating and drinking.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s all-natural, and the slightly glossy effect.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These lip balms are AMAZING! I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie. I have at least one tube stashed pretty much every everywhere. I&#x27;m picky about texture and scent, and I don&#x27;t like an overpowering sweet flavor. The two different mint flavors included in this box are fabulous. They are smooth and pleasant and give your breath a nice fresh kick as well. The fruit punch is my least favorite of the 5. The texture is just as smooth as the others, I&#x27;m just not crazy about the flavor/scent. The mandarin orange? YUMMO. It&#x27;s moisturizing, smooth, and smells soooo wonderful. And finally the vanilla. I&#x27;m not normally a huge fan of vanilla as I prefer more herbal flavors, but this vanilla??? DELISH!!! These are definitely top quality lip balms, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Did I mention they are also organic and 100% natural?!! YES PLEASE!!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast, the service was excellent. You won&#x27;t regret purchasing these babies!!!</li>
            <li> I am a chapstick addict, so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase this Lip Balm pack at a promotional price, I couldn&#x27;t say yes fast enough. Let me just start off by saying that each lip balm really does smell like the scent described. Each of them go on very smooth and the do leave your lips moisturized. Having&lt;br /&gt;natural ingredients in my opinion is what makes the balm soft, so if you leave&lt;br /&gt;one in your car or in your pocket the heat may melt it faster than other balms.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I still think they are great and would recommend them to&lt;br /&gt;anyone that is looking for a natural lip balm that actually works.</li>
            <li> This lip balm doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and has a strange sweet taste. I claims to be flavored naturally, but the vanilla tastes like cake mix, and it is sweet. Not what I expected. My kids were excited about the fruity flavors, and neither of them like it either, the smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> So glad this lip balm came as a 5 pack because my kids are fighting over them.  These are fantastic 100% natural lip balms.  They come in 5 different flavors that my kids love.  This lip balm gives thick coverage for severely chapped lips.  It nourishes and heals quickly.  I will only use natural products on my children.  I find that other chapsticks leave a waxy coating and do nothing to hydrate so the lips end up getting worse in the ling run.  This stuff will actually heal your lips while soothing the burning.  My kids lick their lips and end up chapped halfway to their chins.  I will coat the entire inflamed area and it really helps to make them more comfortable and places a barrier from their tongues.  Every few hours they will ask me to reapply and after a few days it heals.  I was offered a chance to try and review this product at a reduced price and I am so glad.  It has healed our winter lips.  I will be purchasing this pack again for next winter.</li>
            <li> What a great value for a set! We have lip balms in every corner of our home..in drawers..in coat pockets. We can&#x27;t have too many! This is a great collection to please everyone! My son took the Minty Madness and Majestic Mint, I grabbed the Vivacious Vanilla, and my daughter opted for the Tantalizing Tangerine and Passion Punch!&lt;br /&gt;I love that these are 100% natural and organic. I feel better about my kids using them. They go on smoothly, smell great and protect!&lt;br /&gt;It has been a brutal winter for us here in the Northeast and we use lip balm constantly.&lt;br /&gt;We were able to test and try these during a  promotional period. My family gives these lip balms 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> These balms are everything I have been looking for and is coconut oil based.  The are very smooth and creamy.  Many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and/or organic lip balms still contain chemical toxins.  Consumers need to look carefully at the ingredients on the labels!  The price for this set of balms is also a very good value when compared to the prices of other similar products.  The flavors are natural and soft, I have tried them all and each one is a favorite.  So glad I found these and I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I received this lip balm set for reviewing purposes and the name of the brand suits it perfectly lip locks. The packaging holding 5 different white colored scented lip balms are super cute. When you open the little box you see little phrases in different languages describing the word Kiss Me in and through out the package from Spanish to Chinese.&lt;br /&gt;The lipbalm themselves come in different scents like Tantalizing Tangerine, Vivacious Vanilla, Passion Punch, mystic Mint and Minty Madness. I really like these balms because thy certainly moisturize my lips and it&#x27;s made with she butter, coconut oil, rose hip seed oil among other natural and organic ingredients. I wish the scent would last longer after being applied to the lips but the moisture lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my lip balms yesterday so far I am pleased! I love all the flavors they are fun! My fiance is huge into chapsticks and has already claimed one as his own (fruit punch) I love both the peppermint ones anything minty is me all theu way! It moisturizes and helps renew my lips , like I said I got it yesterday and I wore it all day and night and I could tell a difference! I am so glad I was able to test this product!! Higly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I have tried many lip balms and look for all natural ones as my lips are sensitive to non-natural ingredients. Thought I&#x27;d give these a try on a whim and was pleasantly surprised! Moisturizing, hydrating and no sensitivities! Would highly reccomend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love these lip balms!  Bought these for my nieces because they are chemical free and organic and loved them so much I went back and ordered for myself. They keep my lips moisturizer and tastes great. Even better they leave your lips soft not sticky.</li>
            <li> feels good&lt;br /&gt;i really like the vanilla</li>
            <li> I was very dehydrated inside and out when I recieved the  lip balm and in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it. I can tell a huge difference. It goes on smooth and lush even on my very dry cracked lips. Instead of pulling the cracks open it smooths over them giving comfort right away.</li>
            <li> Good product. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> exce;;went product. We love these</li>
            <li> I made a mistake of opening these when my nieces were here.  They took each one and smelled them.  They all smelled fantastic!  Each of the three girls picked one they liked but thats ok - I got the vanilla!  My absolute favorite smell!  And it feels amazing on your lips.  Not too greasy or hard - absorbs great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came in the cutest box and on the inside was the kiss me in different languages!  Such a cute idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved the fact that these are all natural and organic.  One of the nieces has severe allergies to new things - she had no problem with the Passion Punch. It was her favorite.  Loved the name of the balms too -  Vivacious Vanilla, Minty Madness, Passion Punch, Mystic Mint, &amp; Tantalizing Tangerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So excited I was able to try these - definitively worth the money and great stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> Nice product! I love the way they smell. I still have chapped lips but this is a really nice product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very selective regarding lip balm. Over the years I&#x27;ve spent too much money on new products only to throw them out after a couple of uses. I found Karite Lips product over a decade ago and it&#x27;s been the only balm I&#x27;ve consistently used and been happy with. I began researching other products again given the cost and difficulty with locating the Karite product. A few months ago I came across this Candid Essentials product; LipLoks. One of the ingredients I&#x27;ve found that works best for me and why I used the Karite balm is Shea butter. However, it seems to be the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; ingredient right now and more often than not when I find a product that boasts of having Shea Butter - it&#x27;s the last or near to last ingredient listed. These products have not worked for me. So my rule of thumb has become; if a company prioritizes their use of Shea Butter to boost sales revenue versus creating an effective product - I don&#x27;t trust the company, I don&#x27;t give them my $. I&#x27;m happy to say that Candid Essentials LipLoks product has proven to be a winner on numerous levels. I&#x27;m getting a 5-pack for the price I normally pay for 2 of the Karite lip balms, and the flavors are nice, not over the top. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase and found a great alternative for less $! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> everything is as shown and I like this product very much</li>
            <li> I love these!!!! The best part is that they are natural and not full of a bunch of junk. A lot of natural lip balms (and normal ones too) are not very moisturizing and don&#x27;t feel nice when applying. I have tried TONS of different brands as I am a lip gloss/balm junkie. These ones smell and feel so amazing!!!!! They really moisturize and I am super happy with my purchase. The only other brand of lip balm I like as much as these is the Yes To Coconut lip balm (sold at target for 2.99).</li>
            <li> I love it and am excited to replace my Chapstick brand for an organic brand.</li>
            <li> I received this package of lipbalms as a trial product from this company. The scents of these chapsticks were great! I especially loved the two mint ones. I am in love with lip products, and use quite a few different ones, but was very impressed with these. I usually use a few layers to get a good coating on my lips, but these did not use much product at all. But, if you do use more of the chapstick on your lips, they get a little bit of a waxy feel. The ingredients in them are a great! My boy gets raw lips from drooling so much, and they are perfect to use on him. I especially like it because I don&#x27;t have to worry about what I&#x27;m using on his lips since they are an all natural product. It is definitely an awesome value for organic and all natural ingredients in 5 tubes of chapstick. All around, this is such a great product. The only downside that I found was that waxy feel from too much product, but that can be avoided.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is so awesome it leaves your lips feeling so soft and nice.  I have dry lips all year round and this balm really helped keep them from cracking!</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion... Candid Essentials lip balm comes in a 5 pack with the wonderful flavors of Vivacious Vanilla, Minty Madness, Passion Punch, Mystic Mint and Tantalizing Tangerine. My favorite is the passion punch. In the winter me and my family lips get chapped. These helped with the chapped lips and made our lips moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very cool product. It is much better than the competition. It stays on longer, I don&#x27;t have to reapply constantly.</li>
            <li> Lip Balm was a good deal for the amount ordered. I&#x27;m trying to use more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products with minimal ingredients...I would recommend highly if your looking for something similar to Burts Bees. No more cracked lips in the cold Michigan winters.</li>
