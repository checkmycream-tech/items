    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>With all of its emollients, it is an excellent moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It came to me blended perfectly and has never seperated.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out the sunscreens on the Environmental Working Group best rated sunscreens list, and between this and the Burn Out</li>
            <li>and it stays on great!  </li>
            <li>This came up on a list of one of the best.  </li>
            <li>As he also has fair skin, this is perfect for him.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a great \\&quot;two-fer\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li>The ingredients in it are great.</li>
            <li>hope you have a good lufa.</li>
            <li>I loved all the moisturizers in it.</li>
            <li>But now that I know how good it is</li>
            <li>which is the best rating available.  </li>
            <li>I applied this product once in the morning and was good for the day.</li>
            <li>Gave me good protection but made me look \\&quot;white.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very fair and burn easily.   </li>
            <li>And my skin always feels so good at the end of the day, warm from the sun, moisturized from the sunscreen.    </li>
            <li>As there are no chemicals to keep the product from separating, it does separate in warm weather.  </li>
            <li>I then read that it may separate in warm weather (over 80).  </li>
            <li>Great, safe product that works and at a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>It takes 5 seconds and is better than having a bunch of additives.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love that</li>
            <li>That reminds me of my favorite food, chocolate...</li>
            <li>I kept my hara sport in the top shelf of the cooler</li>
            <li>, I like this one much better.</li>
            <li>Definitely best price for low toxicity sunscreen.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>I found it through EWG rankings and it deserves its top billing.</li>
            <li>Another plus with this solution is that was a nice and cool sensation rubbing it onto my skin.    </li>
            <li>This product is safe with no dangerous chemicals, effective and does not sting my eyes even after prolonged dives in the water.  </li>
            <li>and I love this basically scent free sunscreen.     </li>
            <li>Compared to 5 or higher for the more popular sunscreens like bullfrog etc.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s designed not to easily wash off.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really easy to keep track of where it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li>It needs to be rubbed in hands for a good 30 seconds to get it warm to apply and even then it leaves a white mask wherever applied.  </li>
            <li>BUT it is by far the most inexpensive and gets really good reviews on ewg.org.  </li>
            <li>I just kneaded the tube for about 30 seconds and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, lasts, and works.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t yet tried it out while swimming or sweating out in the sun, but it felt good and didn&#x27;t seem to run or sweat off just running around town doing errands during the early summer in Austin, TX.</li>
            <li>Realizing that I specifically bought it because it was a clean product without all the toxic ingredients that keep everything in suspension</li>
            <li>and you probably only wind up using 1/4 of the amount of the more popular sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>In comparison with other EWG-listed sunscreens, I found it slightly easier to apply than \\&quot;Badger SPF30\\&quot;, but for me the best I tried was \\&quot;Alba Botanical SPF30\\&quot; (good protection and the easiest to apply).</li>
            <li>I walked around with bright white streaks of sunscreen on me because it would not blend in...also washing it off</li>
            <li>We tried Hara along with Blue Lizard and Burnout (all good recommendations from EWG 2010 sunscreen toxicity report).</li>
            <li>It also has a mild olive oil scent (one of the components is olive oil).</li>
            <li>I was super excited for this more natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>After coming in from a day of sun I have had nothing but a slightly golden glow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how other have given this product a good review and claimed that it works.</li>
            <li>I saw other good reviews as well as positive ranking on EWG site.</li>
            <li>It seemed quite good at protecting me from the sun on my beach vacation and the only occasion I got mildly red on my back was when snorkeling for one hour at about 12 noon, which I guess would be expected even with the best sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It gets a great effectiveness/health safety rating from EWG Sunscreen data base and it tested out great on our beach vacation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural which I really like since most sunscreens can&#x27;t claim this.  </li>
            <li>and it is a small company nearly local to me, so I am more than happy to support them.    </li>
            <li>It may be a little oily, but if you want a moisturizer, this is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It is a little greasy when applied, but it does give good protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>Plus, it has way fewer chemicals than most commercial brands.</li>
            <li>It was hot from the mail when I received it and when I tried to squirt some out, I just got what looked like olive oil out.  </li>
            <li>and I used this and all of us ended up sunburned after the first day.</li>
            <li>All the ingredients are safe and there are only 7 of them-</li>
            <li>whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>and I have been constantly reapplying to prevent make sure none of us got burned.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s plenty more left.  </li>
            <li>Yes, you&#x27;ll get a handful of oil at the first use.  </li>
            <li>I read a review on baby sunscreens and how many are actually quiet toxic to baby.  </li>
            <li>After waaaaaay too much time looking at the EWG ratings database, and comparing product reviews, I finally decided to give Hara a try and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Then the skin is shiny pretty much all day wherever applied.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a natural toxin-free sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make you turn white, and that spreads nicely on your skin, but this product just wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>I tried Hara Sport as it got the best rating in the Environmental Working Group ratings and it was much less expensive than most of the others in that category.    </li>
            <li>And because it&#x27;s got that kind of \\&quot;body\\&quot; and requires  a little rubbing</li>
            <li>My daughter (3 1/2 yrs old) got sunburned for the first time!  </li>
            <li>As a tennis player and coach, it&#x27;s important to find protection that stays on through the constant sweat and toweling off.</li>
            <li>And it would sometimes separate into two phases, so you really should shake the tube before using.</li>
            <li>I was not swimming or sweating too much either time.  </li>
            <li>It is really clumpy</li>
            <li>I really DREAD putting this on.  </li>
            <li>Pros - it does not sting eyes, it has minimal ingredients, this 30 spf works better</li>
            <li>45 spfs we&#x27;ve used, don&#x27;t need much to cover well</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve to how much to put on.</li>
            <li>This product was really stinky, and didn&#x27;t spread on my skin.  </li>
            <li>unless you put it on and leave it on like you are Casper, it doesn&#x27;t seem to really work.</li>
            <li>I am a very white person and this is not typical for me with most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Because of this, it&#x27;s probably not the sunscreen that I would choose to put in my backpack for a long hike in the sun and heat, but it would work fine as the one I put on my face every the morning under makeup.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I didn&#x27;t have the separation issue that some people had, even when I left it in my bike bag the whole day.</li>
            <li>It is less greasy than Badger, but more so than california baby.</li>
            <li>Like all mineral sunscreen, you need to rub it in a little to minimize the white face look, but I find it to be smooth and easy to rub in even on my squirmy kids;-</li>
            <li>It is less white than Think Baby or Loving Naturals, but it is also greasy, although the greasiness didn&#x27;t bother me as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>The price for this was far better than any of the other bests.  </li>
            <li>Yes, you have to shake a new tube vigorously to get the ingredients to mix a bit.  </li>
            <li>With being both all natural and highly rated by the EWG.  </li>
            <li>As long as I spread it evenly, I rarely burn anywhere.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m sitting here with a lobster-red shoulder and upper back thanks to the lack of protection this sunscreen provided.  </li>
            <li>Cons - you have to rub in a little more than other sunscreens, comes in a bottle half the size of most sunscreens</li>
            <li>I applied this product thickly, so much so that my skin was slightly white.  </li>
            <li>As far as sun protection, I would rate it a 2.5 as now</li>
            <li>This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found in this category by far.  </li>
            <li>Two of the tubes had gone far beyond their expiration dates (stamped on a flap at the bottom of the tube).  </li>
            <li>You really need to rub it in for a while to get the white away or</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen that i have found with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Like all zinc sunscreens it can appear white when applied, however kneeding the tube to mix the oil and zinc (which naturally separate) helps.</li>
            <li>The product uses only natural ingredients and you will recognize every item in the list of ingredients, no strange sounding chemicals.  </li>
            <li>it is so much cheaper than other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens that we have purchased and it is rated well as a \\&quot;1\\&quot; by EWG.</li>
            <li>Hara has an olive oil scent to it and is much thicker than the other two.</li>
            <li>It goes on thick, and takes a little work to rub it all in and avoid the chalky white look, but compared to the Burn Out, it has a nice feel once it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>so this saves on using sunscreen, but if you don&#x27;t usually cover up it might not be worth it)  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I only use this sunscreen now. As a tennis player and coach, it&#x27;s important to find protection that stays on through the constant sweat and toweling off. Hara is thick (a little goes a long way), but really seems to soak into your skin. As long as I spread it evenly, I rarely burn anywhere. Plus, it has way fewer chemicals than most commercial brands.</li>
            <li> I tried Hara Sport as it got the best rating in the Environmental Working Group ratings and it was much less expensive than most of the others in that category.    The pros:    1. The product uses only natural ingredients and you will recognize every item in the list of ingredients, no strange sounding chemicals.  2. With all of its emollients, it is an excellent moisturizer.  It may be a little oily, but if you want a moisturizer, this is a good thing.  My two-year-old grandson has dry skin and his doctor says to try to prevent bouts of eczema by liberal use of moisturizers.  As he also has fair skin, this is perfect for him.  3. This product is less expensive, often as much as half or more less expensive than other sunscreens in this category.    The cons:    1.  As there are no chemicals to keep the product from separating, it does separate in warm weather.  It was hot from the mail when I received it and when I tried to squirt some out, I just got what looked like olive oil out.  I then read that it may separate in warm weather (over 80).  I just kneaded the tube for about 30 seconds and it was fine.  It is cooler in our house, and it has not separated again.  Because of this, it&#x27;s probably not the sunscreen that I would choose to put in my backpack for a long hike in the sun and heat, but it would work fine as the one I put on my face every the morning under makeup.  2.  It is a little greasy, but whether that is a pro or con depends on whether you need a moisturizer or not.  3.  As with all the zinc sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, you do need to rub it in a little bit to avoid the \\&quot;white face\\&quot;, but it didn&#x27;t seem any better or worse than others in this regard.    This sunscreen will be my everyday one, but I&#x27;ll probably go with one that doesn&#x27;t separate to use for long days in the heat and sun.</li>
            <li> Although I was attracted to this product because of its lack of harmful ingredients, I found it to be very thick and nearly impossible to absorb into my skin. I walked around with bright white streaks of sunscreen on me because it would not blend in...also washing it off is a nightmare...hope you have a good lufa.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen on Amazon after I saw it on EWG&#x27;s list of safest sunscreens. It seemed quite good at protecting me from the sun on my beach vacation and the only occasion I got mildly red on my back was when snorkeling for one hour at about 12 noon, which I guess would be expected even with the best sunscreens. The major disadvantage is the fact that it is not very easy to spread on your skin and it turns you whitish even with quite a lot of rubbing. It also has a mild olive oil scent (one of the components is olive oil). And it would sometimes separate into two phases, so you really should shake the tube before using. In comparison with other EWG-listed sunscreens, I found it slightly easier to apply than \\&quot;Badger SPF30\\&quot;, but for me the best I tried was \\&quot;Alba Botanical SPF30\\&quot; (good protection and the easiest to apply).</li>
            <li> After using this product twice, I can tell you that this product does not prevent you from getting sunburned.  I applied this product thickly, so much so that my skin was slightly white.  I was not swimming or sweating too much either time.  AND I was only out in the sun 1-2 hours.  Right now I&#x27;m sitting here with a lobster-red shoulder and upper back thanks to the lack of protection this sunscreen provided.  I will not be buying this product again.  I don&#x27;t understand how other have given this product a good review and claimed that it works.</li>
            <li> Like this product.  It is a little greasy when applied, but it does give good protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> Too white for me.  With a lot of rubbing I can get it to almost an acceptable level.  It is less white than Think Baby or Loving Naturals, but it is also greasy, although the greasiness didn&#x27;t bother me as much as I thought it would.  I don&#x27;t plan to buy it again though.</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen when I go scuba diving.  I&#x27;m on a boat and in the water all day long.  This product is safe with no dangerous chemicals, effective and does not sting my eyes even after prolonged dives in the water.  Yes, you have to knead the tube just a little to mix the ingredients, but so what.  It takes 5 seconds and is better than having a bunch of additives. You do have to rub it in some, however, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s designed not to easily wash off.  Great, safe product that works and at a cheap price.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a camping trip this Memorial Day weekend. My wife, my 2 kids and I used this and all of us ended up sunburned after the first day. I don&#x27;t mind having to rub it in a bit so it&#x27;s not as white and even kneading the container so it mixes well...but this product just does not work. I saw other good reviews as well as positive ranking on EWG site. So I&#x27;m not sure how this failed so badly. We re-applied and even over-applied on the initial application - still ended up sunburned. If anyone at Hara is reading these, how is it that your product fails to protect against sunburns!?</li>
            <li> I really hope this is good for me because it is absolutely terrible to apply.  It is really clumpy so you have to be in front of a mirror to get the clumps off.  It needs to be rubbed in hands for a good 30 seconds to get it warm to apply and even then it leaves a white mask wherever applied.  It takes about 10 minutes to not be sticky.  Then the skin is shiny pretty much all day wherever applied.  I really DREAD putting this on.  BUT it is by far the most inexpensive and gets really good reviews on ewg.org.  I think I may try a slightly more expensive product because I so dread using it that I find myself not putting it on, which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> Like several other reviewers I bought this product after seeing the EWG/Skin Deep ratings. Rated a one (1!), that&#x27;s almost no risk. I love that and I love this basically scent free sunscreen.     It does take a little rubbing, accent on \\&quot;a little\\&quot;. Come on people! And because it&#x27;s got that kind of \\&quot;body\\&quot; and requires  a little rubbing it&#x27;s really easy to keep track of where it&#x27;s been applied. To me that&#x27;s a plus.     I read the reviewer that said it smelled like olive oil. The only aroma I get is of the cocoa butter. That reminds me of my favorite food, chocolate...another plus. Unfortunately once applied that aroma doesn&#x27;t stick around too long. Just like chocolate again!    I loved all the moisturizers in it. All the ingredients are safe and there are only 7 of them- another plus. And five of the seven moisturize! Hurrah! That I was moisturizing my skin while also protecting it from harmful rays? That&#x27;s a great \\&quot;two-fer\\&quot;.     I had no problem with separation. Realizing that I specifically bought it because it was a clean product without all the toxic ingredients that keep everything in suspension I kept my hara sport in the top shelf of the cooler I always take to the beach. That solved any problem that might have come up. Another plus with this solution is that was a nice and cool sensation rubbing it onto my skin.    After coming in from a day of sun I have had nothing but a slightly golden glow. But then I&#x27;m religious about re-applying after extended body surfing or every few hours - whichever comes first. And my skin always feels so good at the end of the day, warm from the sun, moisturized from the sunscreen.    The only negative about this sunscreen I can vaguely cough up is that it&#x27;s not yet readily available so there are shipping costs involved. But now that I know how good it is I&#x27;m buying several tubes on the next go round.</li>
            <li> After waaaaaay too much time looking at the EWG ratings database, and comparing product reviews, I finally decided to give Hara a try and I am so glad I did. It gets a great effectiveness/health safety rating from EWG Sunscreen data base and it tested out great on our beach vacation. Like all mineral sunscreen, you need to rub it in a little to minimize the white face look, but I find it to be smooth and easy to rub in even on my squirmy kids;-&gt;    Bonuses are that as others have pointed out, this is the one of the least expensive in it&#x27;s class and it is a small company nearly local to me, so I am more than happy to support them.    Just ordered a larger supply and will be using it from now on.</li>
            <li> We were so pumped when we found this sunscreen b/c it is so much cheaper than other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens that we have purchased and it is rated well as a \\&quot;1\\&quot; by EWG. We have been at the beach for 4 days now and I have been constantly reapplying to prevent make sure none of us got burned. If you put on enough then no amount of rubbing will make you look less like a vampire. Especially if you have ANY hair on the areas that you are applying like arms and chests on men. I think with this type of sunscreen that is just to be expected. It is less greasy than Badger, but more so than california baby. As far as sun protection, I would rate it a 2.5 as now I sure do have a tan line. :(</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any seperation since I bought this several months ago.  I don&#x27;t know why other reviews seemed to claim this.  But I&#x27;ve never had to knead this or anthing.  It came to me blended perfectly and has never seperated.   Rated a 1 (on 1 to 10 scale) by the EWG (Environmental Working Group) which is the best rating available.  Compared to 5 or higher for the more popular sunscreens like bullfrog etc.  This product though small goes a long way.  It goes on thick, but just rub it in well and you probably only wind up using 1/4 of the amount of the more popular sunscreens.  I&#x27;ve already gotten about 30 to 40 applications out of this in the 6 months I&#x27;ve had this and there&#x27;s plenty more left.  It&#x27;s all natural which I really like since most sunscreens can&#x27;t claim this.  This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found in this category by far.  With being both all natural and highly rated by the EWG.  It also holds up well to lots of sweating.  I run 10 to 13 miles in the heat and it&#x27;s never let me down and I&#x27;m very fair and burn easily.   I&#x27;ll be buying this for now on... as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out the sunscreens on the Environmental Working Group best rated sunscreens list, and between this and the Burn Out, I like this one much better. It goes on thick, and takes a little work to rub it all in and avoid the chalky white look, but compared to the Burn Out, it has a nice feel once it&#x27;s on (the Burn Out felt sticky, like I was trying to use hair gel for a lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet tried it out while swimming or sweating out in the sun, but it felt good and didn&#x27;t seem to run or sweat off just running around town doing errands during the early summer in Austin, TX.</li>
            <li> Pros - it does not sting eyes, it has minimal ingredients, this 30 spf works better 45 spfs we&#x27;ve used, don&#x27;t need much to cover well and it stays on great!  Cons - you have to rub in a little more than other sunscreens, comes in a bottle half the size of most sunscreens (we wear swim shirts all the time so this saves on using sunscreen, but if you don&#x27;t usually cover up it might not be worth it)  I am buying another tube and tossing my other sunscreens!</li>
            <li> We tried Hara along with Blue Lizard and Burnout (all good recommendations from EWG 2010 sunscreen toxicity report). Hara has an olive oil scent to it and is much thicker than the other two. We found if you use a tiny bit and dot it over a small area first, it is easier to spread. Definitely best price for low toxicity sunscreen. No reapplication necessary, water beads up on your skin. We never burned when using Hara but did not love the white face look.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that i have found with all natural ingredients. There is a learning curve to how much to put on. I used it last year and not only did I not burn, I also noticed that I had no new freckles. I applied this product once in the morning and was good for the day.</li>
            <li> My daughter (3 1/2 yrs old) got sunburned for the first time!  I did reapply Hara several times while she was outside at the park.  I agree that it leaves the skin white, but that wouldn&#x27;t bother me if it actually protected her skin!  I definitely will not be bringing this sunscreen to the beach.  Time to try something different~!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s thick and clumpy.  Yes, you have to shake a new tube vigorously to get the ingredients to mix a bit.  Yes, you&#x27;ll get a handful of oil at the first use.  Yes, it&#x27;s hard to apply and, until you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll look like Bozo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, there&#x27;s something else you should know about Hara.  I purchased five tubes, twice.  My friend, who sells Epicuren skin care products clued me in to what was happening when I got my second shipment.  Two of the tubes had gone far beyond their expiration dates (stamped on a flap at the bottom of the tube).  The other three had had the flaps trimmed off with a razor.  The oil was rancid in all five tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a reasonably priced sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it.  I got this for the lack of chemicals and the &#x27;sport&#x27; description.  It lives up to its name - I still had some on me after a day of biking.  Only issue I had was that it is really white upon application.  You really need to rub it in for a while to get the white away or just leave it be like I did and look pasty. Luckily I didn&#x27;t have the separation issue that some people had, even when I left it in my bike bag the whole day.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen during my week long honeymoon in Disney. Put in on once in the morning each day and didn&#x27;t get sun burned all week. I am a very white person and this is not typical for me with most sunscreens. Has also been used at the beach. I do re apply at least once at the beach though.</li>
            <li> This product did protect me from sunburn.  It was a little hard to put on.  Your skin also looked white after applying.</li>
            <li> This product was really stinky, and didn&#x27;t spread on my skin.  It&#x27;s hard to find a natural toxin-free sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make you turn white, and that spreads nicely on your skin, but this product just wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> I read a review on baby sunscreens and how many are actually quiet toxic to baby.  This came up on a list of one of the best.  The price for this was far better than any of the other bests.  a little teeny tiny dab will do you, so this will last a long time.  I bought this for my baby but use it for myself as well.</li>
            <li> Like all zinc sunscreens it can appear white when applied, however kneeding the tube to mix the oil and zinc (which naturally separate) helps. This is explained on the package I believe. It&#x27;s a small step considering the results. It goes on smoothly, lasts, and works. What more could you want? I found it through EWG rankings and it deserves its top billing.</li>
            <li> I was super excited for this more natural sunscreen. The ingredients in it are great. I have a few problems with it though. 1) unless you put it on and leave it on like you are Casper, it doesn&#x27;t seem to really work. I hate to say it but id rather take my chances with the extra carcinogenic chemicals of Coopertone than end up burnt at the end of the day (also carcinogenic). 2) It doesnt rub on well so use sparingly or you will inevitably look like Casper (perhaps that is necessary though). In the end, I gave my 2 bottles away. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Gave me good protection but made me look \\&quot;white.\\&quot;  Also if you are wearing something dark, it flakes off and looks like you have white dandruff all over!</li>
