            <li>I received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>In the picture the color for teal with it is bright blue and pretty.</li>
            <li>The bright teal is not realistic.</li>
            <li>but these weren&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>good thing i like dark teal as well</li>
            <li>I love these nail strips and have used them multiple times...</li>
            <li>It is more like a darker blue.</li>
            <li>Color is more of a darker blue..</li>
            <li>Wow when these strips first came out, they were fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more blue than the photo and has a shine/shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a royal blue.</li>
            <li>The first one was faded (from sunlight???)</li>
            <li>but I would call it more of an electric blue.</li>
            <li>First--</li>
            <li>on, the polish held up better than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>The first package seemed ok other than the color.  </li>
            <li>well.&lt;br /&gt;Disregard older reviews!  </li>
            <li>This item did ship fast and came as described, but the color was way off.</li>
            <li>I was really upset.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and everything</li>
            <li>I ordered these to go with a dress for a wedding I was attending and when they came in the mail they were MUCH darker than the picture.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The largest piece is narrower than my thumb nail, so it didn&#x27;t cover the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the color is a darker teal in real life than in this picture.</li>
            <li>The seemingly aqua blue is not the actual color - it&#x27;s more teal</li>
            <li>What I received was a lot more blue and sparkly than the greenish blue on the picture.  </li>
            <li>All though the blue is still pretty and I will still use them, they just aren&#x27;t what I ordered.</li>

            <li>it is more of a dark blue.</li>
            <li>but when I received the package it was a more glittery dark blue with a gold undertone.</li>
            <li>I blame this on the seller giving me old strips.</li>
            <li>and I like to set with a clear coat for extra protection!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They thinned the strips down so much that they are worthless.&lt;br /&gt;The strips crease, rip and no longer stick</li>

            <li> I love these nail strips and have used them multiple times...but these weren&#x27;t right. I have been wanting this &amp;#34;Teal With It&amp;#34; color for a long time and they have always been sold out so when I saw these available I snatched them up. I almost ordered two or three while they had them and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. The color is nothing like pictured. It is more like a darker blue. All though the blue is still pretty and I will still use them, they just aren&#x27;t what I ordered. Shipping was grea because they were supposed to get to me between the 2nd (today) and the 7th. They came in perfect condition with no fading. The shipping and condition is the only reason this got two stars.</li>
            <li> This item did ship fast and came as described, but the color was way off. Instead of a bright teal it is more of a dark blue.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product. I am a big fan of the Sally Hansen Salon Effects. They go on very easily. Keep in mind when you put them on they do smell like nail polish. Good tip if you are putting them on in public. Make sure to use the tools that come with the product. You press the polish on your nails and push down hard at the end to take off excess. You will need the file it comes with to smooth it out if it&#x27;s rigid.</li>
            <li> first foremost I chose the color because I love teal but when I received the package it was a more glittery dark blue with a gold undertone. I was really upset. that&#x27;s why it only getting one star</li>
            <li> Nail Polish was as expected but the color in picture is not acurate... Color is more of a darker blue.. Overall good transaction..</li>
            <li> I love these!!  I get 2 uses out of them by using one of the inserted packs on all 10 nails by carefully filing off excess and using that for opposite nail ( short to med nais this works for) and I like to set with a clear coat for extra protection!</li>
            <li> In the picture the color for teal with it is bright blue and pretty. What I received is grayish blue. Disappointing! They need to have the colors match, they are way off! Orange (squeezed)is very bright, love it!</li>
            <li> Wow when these strips first came out, they were fantastic.  But the product now stinks!&lt;br /&gt;They thinned the strips down so much that they are worthless.&lt;br /&gt;The strips crease, rip and no longer stick well.&lt;br /&gt;Disregard older reviews!  They are reviewing an entirely different product.  A HUGH disappointment.</li>
            <li> The color is not really teal. It&#x27;s much more blue than the photo and has a shine/shimmer to it. The color is beautiful, but not as depicted. The stickers work great though and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Salon effects are one of my beauty must haves. This Olof however, didn&#x27;t work for me. It seemed thicker. Chunks peeled off almost immediately. It wasn&#x27;t user error. I use this type of polish almost exclusively. Color was also faded on top nail. I think that fault is use to light exposure in packaging. I will use this type of polish, but not this color again.</li>
            <li> The seemingly aqua blue is not the actual color - it&#x27;s more teal</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and everything but the teal is a dark teal. no where near the bright teal pictured. :( good thing i like dark teal as well</li>
            <li> Not the same color that I picked it was totally off and didn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> i was so excited for this product to arrive.when it did it was the wrong color i wanted this due to the fact that i love the color posted on the webside but it is the total wrong ugly blue color.would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The picture is so different than what I got. It&#x27;s more of a royal blue. The bright teal is not realistic.</li>
            <li> The first one was faded (from sunlight???) and also these are are darker than pictured</li>
            <li> I love these nail stickers because my nails come out great each time (I don&#x27;t have a steady hand for normal polish). But, the &amp;#34;teal&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t anything like the picture. I love the color but I would call it more of an electric blue. That being said I like the color well enough I would buy it again. And one tip: if you have short nails, cut the strips in half and use one half for your right hand and one for your left. That way you only use one 8-pack at a time.</li>
            <li> Ordered this specifically because I was looking for a bright teal nail polish and was disappointed when I received a completely different color. Instead of the teal in the picture, I received some awkward medium blue shade that I hate! Would not order again.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of polish strips but this was a disappointment.  I ordered these to go with a dress for a wedding I was attending and when they came in the mail they were MUCH darker than the picture.  I decided to go with it anyway and when I tried to apply them they were dried up, brittle and wouldn&#x27;t even adhere to my nail.  Fail.  I have used a ton of Sally strips and never had a problem.  I blame this on the seller giving me old strips.</li>
            <li> First-- the product was quite a different color than it appeared on my computer or my phone-- not really what I would call teal, but still a very nice blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The largest piece is narrower than my thumb nail, so it didn&#x27;t cover the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews detailing how to use these. At first, I tried to apply them directly to my nails, but all the ridges I have in my nails showed right through and looked bad. So I started again with the extras, and put them on over a base coat. Much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on, the polish held up better than regular nail polish. I&#x27;m a jeweler, and my polish never looks good for more than 2-3 days, but this lasted a couple extra days. It was hard to get it on neatly, though.</li>
            <li> They were dried out, I could not even use them. They cracked</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried these yet but the cheetah print ones went on easy and were awesome. just a note - the color is a darker teal in real life than in this picture. this is good for me because i prefer the darker teal but just an FYI</li>
            <li> this color isnt electric blue its just blue which im sad i paid more for this one cuz i thought it was electric blue.&lt;br /&gt;im very disappointed</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly.  That&#x27;s about the only good thing.  First of all, the picture for \\&quot;teal with it\\&quot; does not match what I actually received.  What I received was a lot more blue and sparkly than the greenish blue on the picture.  The product comes with 2 sets of nail polish.  The first package seemed ok other than the color.  Putting it on was not as easy as it seems.  I had a hard time getting the polish to adhere at the corners. I opened the 2nd package as I made some mistakes and needed to finish my manicure.  The second package was completely dry and kept cracking.  I could not even get them to adhere to any part of my nail.  Waste of money!  I&#x27;m sticking to my gel nail polishes.</li>
