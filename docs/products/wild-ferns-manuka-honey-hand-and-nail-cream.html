            <li>It is VERY strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted to discover they&#x27;re now available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I found the fragrance a bit overwhelming for something on my hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best hand cream I&#x27;ve every tried; my hands immediately become softer after using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to just \\&quot;order it online\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>The texture is light and good.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product, smells good too :)</li>
            <li>I have never seen anything like it, it is the most effective treatment for this skin disorder that I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>Smells good, feels good - this is my absolute favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>And scent is fine!</li>
            <li>Same excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Soften and cares for my hands, and my nails and cuticles look better too.</li>
            <li>So glad I can get it online...</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>What I like the most is that is doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy.</li>
            <li>You will love the way in smooths on your skin and how it hydrates.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re glad to find we could finds it here.  </li>
            <li>ain&#x27;t life grand?  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love all they products.  </li>
            <li>and I love all the Manuka Honey products I have ordered from this company.</li>
            <li>My hands and even my nails feel so much better after each use.  </li>
            <li>but I do have to say that their hand cream was much more soothing to my hands than this was.</li>
            <li>this fit the bill!</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so hooked on it, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but still moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I am going to reorder it as well as their Lanolin Face Cream - I love both products.  </li>
            <li>Love all products which contain Manuka</li>
            <li>This lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
            <li>This best thing about it, you only need to put it on once a day.  </li>
            <li>I really love this cream.</li>
            <li>smells very good and leaves hands smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry hands.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I ordered 2 more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>When I saw a more natural option that seemed as promising, I thought it&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
            <li>The manuka honey is thought to have healing properties, the cream feels good, smells good and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Besides feeling good, it really works for clearing up rashes, sores, scaly skin, etc.</li>
            <li>I love honey-based products and was excited to try these.  </li>
            <li>the return was easy.</li>
            <li>I do not detect a strong odor.</li>
            <li>It smells floral/honey, which makes sense of course, but I was not expecting the smell to be quite so strong.</li>
            <li>this product contain perfume which is too strong for me when I applied it to my skin.</li>
            <li>I would keep it if the perfume wasn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>And the chemically perfume smell was so strong, I had to close the items immediately upon opening.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it enough to be able to tell if it helps my cuticles, but I sure love it as a Hand Cream!</li>
            <li>How fortunate.</li>
            <li>It is also fantastic for softening cuticles.  </li>
            <li>It is a fabulous product line and</li>
            <li>My hands feel silky smooth</li>
            <li>Leaves hands smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making this special hand cream available.</li>
            <li>I like the smell (a bit tropical, but not too strong) and it absorbs nicely, leaving my hands feeling soft and moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li>stick  original.</li>
            <li>Hope you guys love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>First purchased this in New Zealand and loved it.</li>
            <li>Got it from a friend who visited New Zealand, was hooked and am so glad it&#x27;s available to order.</li>
            <li>i met this product while traveling in New Zealand-it is mild, smells great and is all natural.  </li>
            <li>This scent is mildly pleasing.</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping...</li>
            <li>While hiking in New Zealand I was introduced to this magic wonder.</li>
            <li>It has a nice and soft feeling with a pleasant smell that is not strong.</li>
            <li>Love the soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love all of manuka products they leave my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>Works well, non-greasy, smells fresh but not overly perfumy.  </li>
            <li>loved it for my feet works Great in the Winter and a little to heavy for the summer.</li>
            <li>My boss and other co-workers, however, did not find the scent to be too overwhelming at all--they said it was really light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I am not to keen on the packaging since you don&#x27;t get to use every last drop unless you cut it open, but otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll live it !!!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sensitive to strong perfume.</li>
            <li>They are great, but hard to import, the cost of transportation, all that.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was the first product of this line that I tried.</li>
            <li>Will most definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I first bought this lotion when visiting NZ in March.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this in NZ and reordered here.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time while Vacationing in Telluride, CO.</li>
            <li>the honey scent is subtle and the packaging is great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many hand creams over the last year and am very hopeful this will solve my nail/cuticle problem.</li>
            <li>I became familiar with this particular when I was in New Zealand and brought it home for myself as well as for gifts.</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs quickly and leaves your hands soft for hours, without being greasy.</li>
            <li>My hands and cuticles feels smooth and are not dry.</li>
            <li>but it only smells strong when you are rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>It certainly moisturizes winter-dry skin.</li>
            <li>And it does not take a large amount.</li>
            <li>Really like this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I really like how it goes on, and absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and dryes fast.</li>
            <li>It disappears into nails and skin, and is so very softening and non greasy.</li>
            <li>very earthy/natural cosmetic smells.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>but I really like the healing powers of honey</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the everyday use kind of thing just like how I am with my Burt&#x27;s Bee chap</li>
            <li>We first tried this in New Zealand this winter--bought it there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product line since 2007 when I first encountered it while vacationing in New Zealand.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Wild Ferns!  </li>
            <li>with the good, I DO notice that my nails are not chipping, and they do seem stronger, even though the keratin extract is quite far down the list of ingredients (which means low percentage).</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these manuka honey products ever since I visited New Zealand some time ago.  </li>
            <li>while in New Zealand</li>
            <li>I discovered it while vacationing in New Zealand and was SO RELIEVED to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I discovered this product when I was visiting New Zealand.  </li>
            <li>While I was purchasing other Wild Ferns products, primarily skin care items, I came across the Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Hand and Nail Cream.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this hand cream after searching the Internet for a substitute for a previously ordered lanolin product which was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a tube of Wild Ferns Manuka Honey hand and nail cream</li>
            <li>This product is a chemical laden item disguised as a natural product.  </li>
            <li>It does make my hands feel and look soft and radiant</li>
            <li>I buy everything natural</li>
            <li>My hands are moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>Gave them away to friends whose skin is not as sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am on a regimen buying this cream, because with repeated use my moderate-severe eczema on my face, arms, and neck is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>My hands are soft, my cuticles are healed and my nails seems stronger.  </li>
            <li>The wild ferns manuka honey hand &amp; nail cream is working wonders on my hands.</li>
            <li>Fixed his problem in three days....</li>
            <li>I maintain two big guns on my ship and constantly have my hands in some fun stuff.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this in the past and will DEFINITELY be ordering more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the second time I purchase it, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>not usually a fan of Aveda (find them too expensive and not always that effective)</li>
            <li>First discovered this product in New Zealand and was afraid I would not be able to find it without making another trip over there.</li>
            <li>It took only about 24 hours to heal the first cracks, and my hands have so far not been dry, peeling, or cracked since then.</li>
            <li>This was given to me by a New Zealand visiting relative.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is quite far down the ingredient list on this one, but it still smells pretty strong to me, and NOT good at all.</li>
            <li>Like I have said before Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Products are all I will use in the future.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li>All natural and keeps my hands from being old, dry and chapped!  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little strange but not bad.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I also purchased Wild Ferns New Zealand Manuka Honey Conditioning Hand Cream while visiting the South Island.  </li>
            <li>I suddenly have developed really dry skin.</li>

            <li> Smells good, feels good - this is my absolute favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> And scent is fine!</li>
            <li> Same excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Soften and cares for my hands, and my nails and cuticles look better too.</li>
            <li> So glad I can get it online...</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> What I like the most is that is doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy.</li>
            <li> You will love the way in smooths on your skin and how it hydrates.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re glad to find we could finds it here.  </li>
            <li> ain&#x27;t life grand?  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love all they products.  </li>
            <li> and I love all the Manuka Honey products I have ordered from this company.</li>
            <li> My hands and even my nails feel so much better after each use.  </li>
            <li> but I do have to say that their hand cream was much more soothing to my hands than this was.</li>
            <li> this fit the bill!</li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so hooked on it, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but still moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I am going to reorder it as well as their Lanolin Face Cream - I love both products.  </li>
            <li> Love all products which contain Manuka</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
            <li> This best thing about it, you only need to put it on once a day.  </li>
            <li> I really love this cream.</li>
            <li> smells very good and leaves hands smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I ordered 2 more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I saw a more natural option that seemed as promising, I thought it&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
            <li> The manuka honey is thought to have healing properties, the cream feels good, smells good and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Besides feeling good, it really works for clearing up rashes, sores, scaly skin, etc.</li>
            <li> I love honey-based products and was excited to try these.  </li>
            <li> the return was easy.</li>
            <li> I do not detect a strong odor.</li>
            <li> It smells floral/honey, which makes sense of course, but I was not expecting the smell to be quite so strong.</li>
            <li> this product contain perfume which is too strong for me when I applied it to my skin.</li>
            <li> I would keep it if the perfume wasn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li> And the chemically perfume smell was so strong, I had to close the items immediately upon opening.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it enough to be able to tell if it helps my cuticles, but I sure love it as a Hand Cream!</li>
            <li> How fortunate.</li>
            <li> It is also fantastic for softening cuticles.  </li>
            <li> It is a fabulous product line and</li>
            <li> My hands feel silky smooth</li>
            <li> Leaves hands smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for making this special hand cream available.</li>
            <li> I like the smell (a bit tropical, but not too strong) and it absorbs nicely, leaving my hands feeling soft and moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li> stick  original.</li>
            <li> Hope you guys love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> First purchased this in New Zealand and loved it.</li>
            <li> Got it from a friend who visited New Zealand, was hooked and am so glad it&#x27;s available to order.</li>
            <li> i met this product while traveling in New Zealand-it is mild, smells great and is all natural.  </li>
            <li> This scent is mildly pleasing.</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping...</li>
            <li> While hiking in New Zealand I was introduced to this magic wonder.</li>
            <li> It has a nice and soft feeling with a pleasant smell that is not strong.</li>
            <li> Love the soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love all of manuka products they leave my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> Works well, non-greasy, smells fresh but not overly perfumy.  </li>
            <li> loved it for my feet works Great in the Winter and a little to heavy for the summer.</li>
            <li> My boss and other co-workers, however, did not find the scent to be too overwhelming at all--they said it was really light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I am not to keen on the packaging since you don&#x27;t get to use every last drop unless you cut it open, but otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll live it !!!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sensitive to strong perfume.</li>
            <li> They are great, but hard to import, the cost of transportation, all that.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was the first product of this line that I tried.</li>
            <li> Will most definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I first bought this lotion when visiting NZ in March.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this in NZ and reordered here.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time while Vacationing in Telluride, CO.</li>
            <li> the honey scent is subtle and the packaging is great.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many hand creams over the last year and am very hopeful this will solve my nail/cuticle problem.</li>
            <li> I became familiar with this particular when I was in New Zealand and brought it home for myself as well as for gifts.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs quickly and leaves your hands soft for hours, without being greasy.</li>
            <li> My hands and cuticles feels smooth and are not dry.</li>
            <li> but it only smells strong when you are rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> It certainly moisturizes winter-dry skin.</li>
            <li> And it does not take a large amount.</li>
            <li> Really like this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I really like how it goes on, and absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and dryes fast.</li>
            <li> It disappears into nails and skin, and is so very softening and non greasy.</li>
            <li> very earthy/natural cosmetic smells.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> but I really like the healing powers of honey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the everyday use kind of thing just like how I am with my Burt&#x27;s Bee chap</li>
            <li> We first tried this in New Zealand this winter--bought it there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product line since 2007 when I first encountered it while vacationing in New Zealand.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Wild Ferns!  </li>
            <li> with the good, I DO notice that my nails are not chipping, and they do seem stronger, even though the keratin extract is quite far down the list of ingredients (which means low percentage).</li>
            <li> so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these manuka honey products ever since I visited New Zealand some time ago.  </li>
            <li> while in New Zealand</li>
            <li> I discovered it while vacationing in New Zealand and was SO RELIEVED to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product when I was visiting New Zealand.  </li>
            <li> While I was purchasing other Wild Ferns products, primarily skin care items, I came across the Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Hand and Nail Cream.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this hand cream after searching the Internet for a substitute for a previously ordered lanolin product which was no longer available.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a tube of Wild Ferns Manuka Honey hand and nail cream</li>
            <li> This product is a chemical laden item disguised as a natural product.  </li>
            <li> It does make my hands feel and look soft and radiant</li>
            <li> I buy everything natural</li>
            <li> My hands are moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> Gave them away to friends whose skin is not as sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am on a regimen buying this cream, because with repeated use my moderate-severe eczema on my face, arms, and neck is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> My hands are soft, my cuticles are healed and my nails seems stronger.  </li>
            <li> The wild ferns manuka honey hand &amp; nail cream is working wonders on my hands.</li>
            <li> Fixed his problem in three days....</li>
            <li> I maintain two big guns on my ship and constantly have my hands in some fun stuff.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this in the past and will DEFINITELY be ordering more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second time I purchase it, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> not usually a fan of Aveda (find them too expensive and not always that effective)</li>
            <li> First discovered this product in New Zealand and was afraid I would not be able to find it without making another trip over there.</li>
            <li> It took only about 24 hours to heal the first cracks, and my hands have so far not been dry, peeling, or cracked since then.</li>
            <li> This was given to me by a New Zealand visiting relative.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is quite far down the ingredient list on this one, but it still smells pretty strong to me, and NOT good at all.</li>
            <li> Like I have said before Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Products are all I will use in the future.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> All natural and keeps my hands from being old, dry and chapped!  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little strange but not bad.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I also purchased Wild Ferns New Zealand Manuka Honey Conditioning Hand Cream while visiting the South Island.  </li>
            <li> I suddenly have developed really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works on skin that is really irritated, but it seems to be working for my hands that are subjected to hospital grade hand soaps.</li>
            <li> It also seems to have a slight barrier cream function as my hands remain soft after washing my hands.</li>
            <li> By trade, I&#x27;m a grease monkey.</li>
            <li> I put this on every night before going to sleep, as I usually did with the Vaseline lotion (and that was when I lived in Canada - now I live in Texas -</li>
            <li> Soothing way to condition dry hands and cuticles overnight.</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this may be the cream for your dry, injured skin.</li>
            <li> What was once an arid, dry, and cracking desert is now a veritable oasis of softness.</li>
            <li> (my skin is not even dry by nature).</li>
            <li> It is so moist it works wonders on my dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I brought some back from Australia and was starting to despair that I&#x27;d have trouble finding in states.</li>
            <li> Small enough to put in my back pocket.  </li>
            <li> My feet were very dry and peeling.  </li>
            <li> Wish it were a little larger for the price</li>
            <li> I still use this and the other products I reviewed.</li>
            <li> This lotion also does not leave my hands feelings greasey like some of the other \\&quot;healing\\&quot; creams/lotions do.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used other products with the Honey and aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I have apparently inherited her dry skin, which gets worse in the winter.</li>
            <li> After using this product at least once, sometimes twice, per day for over two weeks, I can say it definitely soothes and heals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite winter yet, but we have had several days that are cold and dry enough to cause my hands to peel, crack, and bleed.</li>
            <li> I needed a cream that was creamy but not rich.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little sticky</li>
            <li> My cuticles are, and always have been, so dry, cracked and UGLY that I was always self conscious and tried to hide my hands.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on my nails (gardening, etc.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the extraction process would hurt the animal in any way, but it&#x27;s always hard to know.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> The cold was making my hands very dry and somewhat ashy!</li>
            <li> but I hate that it contains mineral oil which is bad for the environment and the human body in general.</li>
            <li> I am a kiwi and have lived in America for approximately 25 years but still order this lotion from home.  </li>
            <li> other bad thing is the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my hands have been cracking really bad, and I still get little cuts all over my hands, and they do start bleeding</li>
            <li> I do wash my hands a lot as an acupuncturist, so there is that factor, but I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how horrifying it is to start seeing little spots on the patient&#x27;s chart because your fingers are so  cracked they&#x27;ve started seeping</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the products have artificial coloring.</li>
            <li> It has artificial perfumes and dyes.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these manuka honey products ever since I visited New Zealand some time ago.  They are great, but hard to import, the cost of transportation, all that. I&#x27;m delighted to discover they&#x27;re now available through Amazon. Same excellent quality. How fortunate.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference with the appearance of my hands the moment I placed this product on them.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really like this hand cream. Soften and cares for my hands, and my nails and cuticles look better too. Love the soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> I purchased a tube of Wild Ferns Manuka Honey hand and nail cream while in New Zealand. I started using it a month ago and can not believe what a great product it is.  I have used every type of nail and hand cream and oil and this beats them all by 100%. I was so happy to google it today and find it on line to purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about every cream there is--this is the BEST.  I brought some back from Australia and was starting to despair that I&#x27;d have trouble finding in states. SO happy to find it here on Amazon!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first product of this line that I tried. To be honest, I found the fragrance a bit overwhelming for something on my hands. My boss and other co-workers, however, did not find the scent to be too overwhelming at all--they said it was really light and fresh. I still use this and the other products I reviewed. I believe they are high-quality products.</li>
            <li> I sampled this hand cream at the Aukland airport and was delighted to find it on Amazon.  The manuka honey is thought to have healing properties, the cream feels good, smells good and lasts a long time.  It certainly moisturizes winter-dry skin.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I also purchased Wild Ferns New Zealand Manuka Honey Conditioning Hand Cream while visiting the South Island.  I have been using this cream sparingly because I didn&#x27;t want to be without it...and then I found it on Amazon&#x27;s website.  So glad I can get it online...or I&#x27;d be contacting my friends in NZ to send some my way.  Great cream!  Soothing way to condition dry hands and cuticles overnight. And scent is fine!</li>
            <li> This product is a chemical laden item disguised as a natural product.  It has artificial perfumes and dyes.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling on my hands and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It has a nice and soft feeling with a pleasant smell that is not strong.</li>
            <li> I have looked all over for this product, after buying a tube at the airport in Auckland on the way home from Oz.  It&#x27;s by far the best hand cream I&#x27;ve every tried; my hands immediately become softer after using it.  It is also fantastic for softening cuticles.  Thank you, Koru, for carrying it.</li>
            <li> I love all of manuka products they leave my skin feeling so soft.  Will most definitely buy again. nice purchase</li>
            <li> I have used this item for 9 years for my hands for the psoriac issue and it does help</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel and does seem to moisturize well without the need to wipe your hands on a paper towel to remove the excess.</li>
            <li> I suddenly have developed really dry skin. I&#x27;ve been trying different products and this is one I&#x27;ve been using for about a month. I really like how it goes on, and absorbs into my skin. It also seems to have a slight barrier cream function as my hands remain soft after washing my hands. I do not detect a strong odor. I like how my nails feel after I use this cream throughout the day. I&#x27;m not sure how it works on skin that is really irritated, but it seems to be working for my hands that are subjected to hospital grade hand soaps.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion. It truly helps the nails grow and improves the way your hands look. What I like the most is that is doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy.</li>
            <li> i met this product while traveling in New Zealand-it is mild, smells great and is all natural.  You will love the way in smooths on your skin and how it hydrates.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hand cream on the recommendation of my mother. I have apparently inherited her dry skin, which gets worse in the winter. It&#x27;s not quite winter yet, but we have had several days that are cold and dry enough to cause my hands to peel, crack, and bleed. After using this product at least once, sometimes twice, per day for over two weeks, I can say it definitely soothes and heals. It took only about 24 hours to heal the first cracks, and my hands have so far not been dry, peeling, or cracked since then. The cream absorbs quickly and leaves your hands soft for hours, without being greasy. And it does not take a large amount. The only downside for me is the smell. It is VERY strong. It smells floral/honey, which makes sense of course, but I was not expecting the smell to be quite so strong. If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this may be the cream for your dry, injured skin.</li>
            <li> I first bought this lotion when visiting NZ in March.  It is wonderful for hands and nails and has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third tube of this stuff.  My nails and cuticles have never looked so good and I&#x27;ve tried everything out there.  I&#x27;m hard on my nails (gardening, etc.) and after using this, they are strong and look great.  Try it!</li>
            <li> It would be this one. It smells great, and it seems to have antiseptic properties on skin scrapes and irritations. I discovered it while vacationing in New Zealand and was SO RELIEVED to find it on Amazon. It makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I became familiar with this particular when I was in New Zealand and brought it home for myself as well as for gifts. Manuka honey is the best!  I am thrilled to find Wild Ferns again and Parrs Products Ltd did an awesome job of packaging and shipping this product.</li>
            <li> We first tried this in New Zealand this winter--bought it there and we&#x27;re glad to find we could finds it here.  Excellent for dry hands.  Not greasy at all and the scent is wonderful.. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the skin and has a wonderful honey perfume. It&#x27;s not sticky and dryes fast. It&#x27;s the second time I purchase it, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product line since 2007 when I first encountered it while vacationing in New Zealand.  I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to just \\&quot;order it online\\&quot;...ain&#x27;t life grand?  It is a fabulous product line and the products work wonderfully.  I&#x27;ve given some as gifts and my gal pals all love it also!  Works well, non-greasy, smells fresh but not overly perfumy.  Just wonderful stuff.  TRY IT.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sensitive to strong perfume. this product contain perfume which is too strong for me when I applied it to my skin. It made me feel dizzy. The texture is light and good. It does make my hands feel and look soft and radiant I would keep it if the perfume wasn&#x27;t that strong. I gave it a four star b/c  the return was easy.</li>
            <li> This was given to me by a New Zealand visiting relative. I loved it so much, I ordered 2 more from Amazon. It disappears into nails and skin, and is so very softening and non greasy.</li>
            <li> Heals my torn cuticles and strengthens my nails.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. My hands feel silky smooth</li>
            <li> I first bought this in NZ and reordered here.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I love all they products.  All natural and keeps my hands from being old, dry and chapped!  Thanks for a great product, smells good too :)</li>
            <li> makes my hands feel great</li>
            <li> OMG. Smells delicious...the honey scent is subtle and the packaging is great.  Small enough to put in my back pocket.  By trade, I&#x27;m a grease monkey. I maintain two big guns on my ship and constantly have my hands in some fun stuff. ;)  With the constant use of Gojo, my hands have taken quite a beating.  My constant issues have been hang nails and my cuticles.  It&#x27;s only been a week since I started using this and I like what&#x27;s been taking place. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! This is my second order. I keep it by the kitchen sink for use after doing dishes. It is wonderful, smells nice, and really softens your hands. Wish it were a little larger for the price but you pay for what you get and I love all the Manuka Honey products I have ordered from this company.</li>
            <li> I am totally sold on this hand &amp; nail cream. It works excellently on my skin. What was once an arid, dry, and cracking desert is now a veritable oasis of softness. I have ordered this in the past and will DEFINITELY be ordering more. This scent is mildly pleasing.</li>
            <li> loved it for my feet works Great in the Winter and a little to heavy for the summer. I will be back to using it this fall. my friends all love it and it made a great gift.</li>
            <li> My hands and even my nails feel so much better after each use.  First discovered this product in New Zealand and was afraid I would not be able to find it without making another trip over there. Thank you Amazon for making this special hand cream available.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because in the winter my hands always crack, and the dryness makes my nails prone to breaking. I know I get great results with Vaseline Hand &amp; Nail lotion (the one specifically with Keratin), but I hate that it contains mineral oil which is bad for the environment and the human body in general. When I saw a more natural option that seemed as promising, I thought it&#x27;d be perfect. I also know that honey has skin healing properties so I had high hopes. I put this on every night before going to sleep, as I usually did with the Vaseline lotion (and that was when I lived in Canada - now I live in Texas - so I thought this would be sufficient).&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the good, I DO notice that my nails are not chipping, and they do seem stronger, even though the keratin extract is quite far down the list of ingredients (which means low percentage). So that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;However, my hands have been cracking really bad, and I still get little cuts all over my hands, and they do start bleeding (my skin is not even dry by nature). I do wash my hands a lot as an acupuncturist, so there is that factor, but I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how horrifying it is to start seeing little spots on the patient&#x27;s chart because your fingers are so  cracked they&#x27;ve started seeping blood!&lt;br /&gt;The other bad thing is the smell. I buy everything natural so I&#x27;m no stranger to very earthy/natural cosmetic smells. Fragrance is quite far down the ingredient list on this one, but it still smells pretty strong to me, and NOT good at all. Somewhat flowery, I&#x27;d almost say musky.&lt;br /&gt;And last thing is, if you are vegetarian or vegan, remember that the keratin extract comes from an animal. I don&#x27;t think the extraction process would hurt the animal in any way, but it&#x27;s always hard to know.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually a fan of Aveda (find them too expensive and not always that effective) but I do have to say that their hand cream was much more soothing to my hands than this was.</li>
            <li> with the work i do, my hands get washed and dried very often. I needed a cream that was creamy but not rich. this fit the bill! seller sent it nicely packaged and wrapped, i could have sent it as a gift even though i did not request a gift wrap. thanks.</li>
            <li> Like I have said before Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Products are all I will use in the future.  My nails and cuticles are absolutely beautiful.  My nails have a sheen to them without polish.  My hands are moisturized and soft.  These are the best bath and body products are the market today.</li>
            <li> I love honey-based products and was excited to try these.  Unfortunately, the products have artificial coloring. And the chemically perfume smell was so strong, I had to close the items immediately upon opening.  Gave them away to friends whose skin is not as sensitive.</li>
            <li> Excellent hand and nail cream. Highly recommend. And a wonderful scent to it. Don&#x27;t know what else to say but needed more words!</li>
            <li> I have been using it almost a week, several times a day. It feels great and seems to be helping my hands and cuticles which is why I bought it.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t my favorite but it only smells strong when you are rubbing it in. I have tried many hand creams over the last year and am very hopeful this will solve my nail/cuticle problem.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are, and always have been, so dry, cracked and UGLY that I was always self conscious and tried to hide my hands.  Literally after one night I could tell a difference.  After only one week, I&#x27;m painting my nails to show off my hands!  LOVE  - LOVE - LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product when I was visiting New Zealand.  I am very happy to be able to get it at home.&lt;br /&gt;Service is quick, too!</li>
            <li> This Hand Cream is lovely and smells very nice.  I have not used it enough to be able to tell if it helps my cuticles, but I sure love it as a Hand Cream!</li>
            <li> Leaves hands smooth and supple. Good stuff. I would by this lotion again and recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive, high-quality hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using their products for years. Besides feeling good, it really works for clearing up rashes, sores, scaly skin, etc.</li>
            <li> My feet were very dry and peeling.  I applied it after my shower daily and feet are repaired.  Highly recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Lives up to what it says in advertisement. My hands and cuticles feels smooth and are not dry. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time while Vacationing in Telluride, CO. The cold was making my hands very dry and somewhat ashy! This helped a tons, and i love it that it also helps with the cuticles that was just a plus for me! I reside in Miami, FL and still continue to use this product. I&#x27;m so hooked on it, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but still moisturized. Will continue to use this product in a daily basis. It&#x27;s one of the everyday use kind of thing just like how I am with my Burt&#x27;s Bee chap stick  original. Hope you guys love it as much as I do! Great product</li>
            <li> The Manuka Honey cream body butter is excellent. It is so moist it works wonders on my dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I am on a regimen buying this cream, because with repeated use my moderate-severe eczema on my face, arms, and neck is almost completely gone. I have never seen anything like it, it is the most effective treatment for this skin disorder that I&#x27;ve come across. Try it.</li>
            <li> this cream makes your hands feel so good and it soothes and softens around your nails. i recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> While hiking in New Zealand I was introduced to this magic wonder. My wife keeps stealing form me. Best hand cream ever but can use it all over.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hand cream after searching the Internet for a substitute for a previously ordered lanolin product which was no longer available.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s an excellent product and during this extreme Winter we have had, a very welcome product.  I am going to reorder it as well as their Lanolin Face Cream - I love both products.  Neither are sticky as a lot of lanolin products can be.</li>
            <li> smells very good and leaves hands smooth and soft. Will buy it again soon. Love all products which contain Manuka</li>
            <li> While I was purchasing other Wild Ferns products, primarily skin care items, I came across the Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Hand and Nail Cream.  As a nurse, constantly washing my hands, my hands take a beating.  This lotion is fantastic!  My hands are soft, my cuticles are healed and my nails seems stronger.  This lotion also does not leave my hands feelings greasey like some of the other \\&quot;healing\\&quot; creams/lotions do.  Thanks Wild Ferns!  Love this</li>
            <li> I take this to work with me.  The wild ferns manuka honey hand &amp; nail cream is working wonders on my hands.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome  I am a kiwi and have lived in America for approximately 25 years but still order this lotion from home.  Haven&#x27;t found anything better.  This best thing about it, you only need to put it on once a day.  If you are washing your hands or putting them in water all the time, then this lotion is for you........you&#x27;ll live it !!!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream. It makes my hands really smooth and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream! It smells like honey and works great on my hands. I usually use it at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good - this is my absolute favorite lotion. Got it from a friend who visited New Zealand, was hooked and am so glad it&#x27;s available to order.</li>
            <li> First purchased this in New Zealand and loved it. I like the smell (a bit tropical, but not too strong) and it absorbs nicely, leaving my hands feeling soft and moisturized but not greasy. I was very happy to find it available in the U.S.A. through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strange but not bad.  it&#x27;s a little sticky but I really like the healing powers of honey</li>
            <li> Wonderful hand cream that keeps nail and hands moist all day.  I am not to keen on the packaging since you don&#x27;t get to use every last drop unless you cut it open, but otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping...Great Product...A Nurse in a hospital  told me about Manuka Honey and I&#x27;ve used other products with the Honey and aloe vera. It works great.I even used it on my Cat...Fixed his problem in three days....Wonderful..!</li>
