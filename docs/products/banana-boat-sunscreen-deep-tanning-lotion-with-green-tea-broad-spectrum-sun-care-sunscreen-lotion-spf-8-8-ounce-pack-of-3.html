    <ol>
            <li>This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it works great!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all and smells great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a great degree of sunscreen</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy and find the smell pleasant and not overpowering at all.    </li>
            <li>and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>good deal and to boot</li>
            <li>While it does smell good, the moment you sweat, the sunblocks runs.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and smells great!</li>
            <li>Great product with refreshing scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.</li>
            <li>Love the smell too!  </li>
            <li>Even with fair skin, I never burn and I am able to develop a lovely tan.</li>
            <li>Checked many places...</li>
            <li>I love this non-greasy Banana Boat lotion and use it all summer.  </li>
            <li>I came across Banana Boat whilst out in Florida and believe it or not I never seem to be able to buy this product in the UK.</li>
            <li>Love the scent +</li>
            <li>More importantly, it creates a protective layer from the sun to avoid being burnt.</li>
            <li>I do wish it was more readily available.</li>
            <li>I feel this is adequate protection if your skin type does not burn very easily.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t burn too easily</li>
            <li>Glad I did, it arrived in no time at all and even though it was used in Corfu, it brought back happy memories of Florida.</li>
            <li>I order this stuff in bulk because I love it so much</li>
            <li>I have moderately tan complexion (part Asian) and find this is perfect for a couple hours surfing.</li>
            <li>After using this product as my sunscreen for a few years now, I&#x27;m happy to give it 5 stars.    </li>
            <li>but I still want a golden tan without a burn.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good, stays on for a decent amount of time during watersports, and is robust enough to keep me from burning -- yet still allows me to tan.</li>
            <li>Stay safe, definitely don&#x27;t sit in the sun without protection.</li>
            <li>Pretty golgen tan..</li>
            <li>As it is waterproof, I can enjoy a dip without worrying that the rays reflecting on the water are going to cause me pain or redness later.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather use this and not have everything sticking to me and getting oil all over my books, Kindle, etc.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Suddenly I was getting the nice golden tan I had always been trying to get, and in a dramatically less span of time.</li>
            <li>In the summer, it will actually leave the skin feeling cool as it bakes in the sun.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I live in FL and frequently dive / surf during the summer months.</li>
            <li>Actually found it on vacation in Fbut not available.lordia, had a very lite sunscreen in it</li>
            <li>SPF8 means that it has eight times your natural protection against a sunburn.</li>
            <li>It comes out like a body lotion which absorbs into the skin, leaving it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Other sunscreens would leave me with red bumps after a few hours and so I&#x27;m guessing I have an allergy to an ingredient found in many of the brands.</li>
            <li>Trouble with tanning lotions is finding the right one which suits your skin type.</li>

            <li> Dries quickly and smells great! I order this stuff in bulk because I love it so much and it&#x27;s not easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Actually found it on vacation in Fbut not available.lordia, had a very lite sunscreen in it and I have fair skin. I never burned and was out in the 92-103temps for 7 days.. Will continue to buy this product from Amazon. Could not find it in any store in my area. Checked many places...</li>
            <li> I live in FL and frequently dive / surf during the summer months.

            <li> SPF8 means that it has eight times your natural protection against a sunburn. I feel this is adequate protection if your skin type does not burn very easily. I&#x27;m half Mediterranean so I don&#x27;t burn too easily but I still wanted some protection on my skin as I don&#x27;t want any sunburns at all.    Other sunscreens would leave me with red bumps after a few hours and so I&#x27;m guessing I have an allergy to an ingredient found in many of the brands. I&#x27;m not allergic to anything in this one. It comes out like a body lotion which absorbs into the skin, leaving it feeling soft. More importantly, it creates a protective layer from the sun to avoid being burnt. As it is waterproof, I can enjoy a dip without worrying that the rays reflecting on the water are going to cause me pain or redness later.    I&#x27;m a guy and find the smell pleasant and not overpowering at all.    After using this product as my sunscreen for a few years now, I&#x27;m happy to give it 5 stars.    Stay safe, definitely don&#x27;t sit in the sun without protection. I wear this whenever I know I&#x27;ll be out for extended periods and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> only suntan lotion we use. it is very hard to find in stores. good deal and to boot I don&#x27;t have try and find it</li>
            <li> This was advertised as a tan enhancer but I don&#x27;t see anything on the tube that says it&#x27;s an enhancer. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used. Even with fair skin, I never burn and I am able to develop a lovely tan. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and smells great. I do wish it was more readily available. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a great degree of sunscreen but I still want a golden tan without a burn. This does it for me, white water rafting or laying in the sun for an hour reading a book.</li>
            <li> I love this non-greasy Banana Boat lotion and use it all summer.  I&#x27;m blonde and had a hard time tanning without burning until I started using Banana Boat products.  My husband uses the oil and looks all shiney and slick.  I&#x27;d much rather use this and not have everything sticking to me and getting oil all over my books, Kindle, etc.  Love the smell too!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I came across Banana Boat whilst out in Florida and believe it or not I never seem to be able to buy this product in the UK. When I checked out Amazon.com it was a similar price to other products in the UK including postage so I thought why not, lets go for it.  Glad I did, it arrived in no time at all and even though it was used in Corfu, it brought back happy memories of Florida. Would I buy from Amazon (USA) again. Absolutley!!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this after he shaves. It takes the burn off his neck. In the summer, it will actually leave the skin feeling cool as it bakes in the sun. It reflects the heat off. I like the smell. We use this year round and quite a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  This sunblock is awful.  While it does smell good, the moment you sweat, the sunblocks runs.  I used it at the beach over the summer and it ran into my eyes as soon as I got a drop of sweat on my forehead.  No lasting power whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and sadly it is getting very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Great product with refreshing scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm. Pretty golgen tan..</li>
            <li> Trouble with tanning lotions is finding the right one which suits your skin type. I have tried possibly every other competitive product over the past 10 years. It wasn&#x27;t until someone suggested this brand to me 2 years ago. Suddenly I was getting the nice golden tan I had always been trying to get, and in a dramatically less span of time. I didn&#x27;t change the location of where I was tanning, as I have a backyard pool. So the results I got, sunning in the same place I had been for years, amazed me. Now you could try this product and may not realize the same benefits that I did. But I will mention that I am of Irish descent, and thus my skin type is indicative of that heritage. As with any tanning lotion, it should be applied 15 minutes Before you go out, to give your skin time to absorb the lotion.</li>
            <li> Great value. Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere in my area for this product, your price beat them all. Love the scent + it works great!!</li>
