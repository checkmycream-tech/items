            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great service and value.</li>
            <li>It worked great.  </li>
            <li>I used the Alra therapeutic lotion during radiation treatments and had great results.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Fantastic deodorant!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s effective!</li>
            <li>My doctor said Alta is a good choice</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the alra deodorant and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I started using it just because I liked it and</li>
            <li>Better than products on the shelf of markets.</li>
            <li>I also think I perspired more using the product.</li>
            <li>( Many healing blessings going out to all patients and their families who are in the throes of treatments.)</li>
            <li>the idea of not putting more metal on my skin.</li>
            <li>then something else on top, but this is all I wear in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I prefer deodorant to anti-perspirant and don&#x27;t have many choices at the store, except for Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it, she can feel safe wearing it while undergoing radiation.</li>
            <li>Loved the packaging had an extra special touch with the purple paper band and sticky, very nicely done.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is fantastic - there is no odor to it, the product is easy to use and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Does not go on smoothly and does not protect me from body odor.  </li>
            <li>I previously was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine and really liked that deoderant, but Alra really has done a great job</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product if you want to go all natural.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and does not stain clothes and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li>I tried many many brands before and switching up quite a little bit, but most of them irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive but my wife tends to be more sweaty.</li>
            <li>I really like the light fragrance which does not have a pungent smell of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was always one who needed a strong anti-perspirant, and was very worried that this wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough, but it was.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping product would be.</li>
            <li>The last one I purchased (elsewhere and at a higher price) lasted me more than a year.  </li>
            <li>While treatments and skin healing are all done, I could not bring myself to go back to my old deodorant with all the chemicals, effective</li>
            <li>It also goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on clothing, doesn&#x27;t have any bad perfumy smell and best of all no bad ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get very smelly, so it works for me, but others may need to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li>Almost 1 year later, it is starting to run low, so I will re-order it since it works great and contains no chemicals to be concerned about.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a deodorant that is natural and fresh, and if you are suffering from itching, rashes and allergies, then just click the button.</li>
            <li>I work in an office and don&#x27;t sweat a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I have not had any trouble with underarm odor coming through, except on really warm days, and then I reapply or spritz on fragrance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for folks going through and completing radiation treatments.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural deodorant to use rather than than what is found on the stores&#x27; shelves.</li>
            <li>Unlike other deodorants, this NON-METALLIC is soothing, fresh and natural.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural deodorant with out chemicals and metals, that actually worked.</li>
            <li>So after sweating normally, not from playing sports or anything just normal perspiration, you do smell.</li>
            <li>If I know I&#x27;m going to be sweating in a social situation I wear it and</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural, and the effect is long</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clean and fresh, and not making the armpits stinks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product! It really does work. Better than products on the shelf of markets.</li>
            <li> My doctor said Alta is a good choice and I agree.</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple months I have to say that it 1) definitely does NOT prevent perspiration and 2) it does not hide smell. So after sweating normally, not from playing sports or anything just normal perspiration, you do smell. I also think I perspired more using the product. I would not recommend, I wish it worked and will be looking for an alternative product.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product if you want to go all natural. But don&#x27;t expect it to work as well as regular deodorant. I don&#x27;t get very smelly, so it works for me, but others may need to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it does not contain aluminum. The fragrance is pleasant and does not stain clothes and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> Needed a non metal and non toxic deodorant while going through radiation for breast cancer.  Read other reviews and decided to try. This worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Dr recommended this after a bout with breast cancer...I use no only this product now...no aluminum....</li>
            <li> Great product.  Sent immediately without freight charges.  Terrific! Product is perfect for those wanting non-metallic deodorant.  Great service and value.</li>
            <li> Had to use this while I was undergoing radiation for breast cancer, because it was non-metallic.  I previously was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine and really liked that deoderant, but Alra really has done a great job and I will continue to use it.  Almost 1 year later, it is starting to run low, so I will re-order it since it works great and contains no chemicals to be concerned about.</li>
            <li> I started using this when I began my radiation treatments for breast cancer, after surgery.  I was always one who needed a strong anti-perspirant, and was very worried that this wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough, but it was.  It worked great.  It also goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on clothing, doesn&#x27;t have any bad perfumy smell and best of all no bad ingredients.  I will be using Alra deodorant as my staple for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> ai would not purchase this product again.  It has a funky smell and did not work unless applied multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping product would be. I used the Alra therapeutic lotion during radiation treatments and had great results. During treatments I could not use any deodorant, had to stick with cornstarch. While treatments and skin healing are all done, I could not bring myself to go back to my old deodorant with all the chemicals, effective yes but not healthy. While cornstarch works well  it&#x27;s messy.  I wanted a natural deodorant to use rather than than what is found on the stores&#x27; shelves. I have been looking for a natural deodorant with out chemicals and metals, that actually worked. I tried Tom&#x27;s but it was a total waste of money and time, it was useless. I am very pleased with the alra deodorant and will buy it again. I highly recommend this product for folks going through and completing radiation treatments. Loved the packaging had an extra special touch with the purple paper band and sticky, very nicely done. Thank you. ( Many healing blessings going out to all patients and their families who are in the throes of treatments.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any comments for this product.</li>
            <li> Great product it&#x27;s effective!</li>
            <li> Fantastic deodorant!!! Even though I am not going through radiation treatment, my wife and I use this product on a daily basis. Unlike other deodorants, this NON-METALLIC is soothing, fresh and natural. It keeps my skin clean and fresh, and not making the armpits stinks. I really like the light fragrance which does not have a pungent smell of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive but my wife tends to be more sweaty. I tried many many brands before and switching up quite a little bit, but most of them irritate my skin. My friend, who is under radiation treatment, recommended this product to me, and since then I stopped searching for a different brand. The ingredients are natural, and the effect is long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a deodorant that is natural and fresh, and if you are suffering from itching, rashes and allergies, then just click the button. Try it! You will not regret.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best alternative to aluminum I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use it even after finishing chemo.</li>
            <li> The last one I purchased (elsewhere and at a higher price) lasted me more than a year.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, plus it&#x27;s non-metallic.  I had also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant but preferred this one. It arrived quickly and no shipping charges!!!!</li>
            <li> Mom went through chemo and radiation and this was the only thing that worked. I started using it just because I liked it and the idea of not putting more metal on my skin. I work in an office and don&#x27;t sweat a whole lot. If I know I&#x27;m going to be sweating in a social situation I wear it and then something else on top, but this is all I wear in the winter months.</li>
            <li> My sister is a breast cancer survivor and sent me one of these to try. I prefer deodorant to anti-perspirant and don&#x27;t have many choices at the store, except for Tom&#x27;s products. This deodorant is fantastic - there is no odor to it, the product is easy to use and goes on smoothly. I have not had any trouble with underarm odor coming through, except on really warm days, and then I reapply or spritz on fragrance. I will be using this as long as they continue to produce it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother since she is finishing up her chemo and about to start radiation. Since it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it, she can feel safe wearing it while undergoing radiation.</li>
            <li> Does not go on smoothly and does not protect me from body odor.  I am disappointed and will not order again.  :(</li>
