            <li> This smells amazing. I have worn Elizabeth Arden Mediterranean for years and wasn&#x27;t looking to change. I was intrigued by this scent through a fragrance insert in an Ulta catalog. I am glad that I decided to buy it. It just might become my signature fragrance. It is a little strong when it first goes on but the scent mellows into something beautiful. I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
