            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Been keeping my highlights nice and bright like the day I left the salon.</li>

            <li>Shampoo itself is fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly a loyal user!</li>
            <li>Great for toning (taking any brass tones out of dyed blonde hair).</li>
            <li>The bottle cap wasn&#x27;t secure.</li>
            <li>We buy this product continually, his grey hair looks great with thsi sampoo.</li>
            <li>I mix it with a clarifying shampoo to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair clean and shiny</li>
            <li>It does work, but not as quickly on my hair as some reported.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than 5 years and it is great if used in minimum daily applications for men with medium cut, white hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several grey hair shampoo products and this one gives my hair the best color!</li>
            <li>It keeps my professionally done blonde looking bright and clean.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo every other wash, and it keeps my hair a gorgeous platinum color.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is an exact replacement for the discontinued, Simply Silver, which I&#x27;ve used for many years.</li>
            <li>I only apply it once a week because I read that more than that can give you a bluish tone to the hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos for gray hair and always come back to this one...</li>
            <li>Results in very 1st use!</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy a shampoo for gray hair (Simply Silver) from my hairdresser, but they changed suppliers.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo so much this is my second order of this stuff</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny,  soft, and very pretty.</li>
            <li>Makes the silver really shine.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>makes it so much easier  </li>
            <li>THANKS, Amazon.</li>
            <li>Reasonable replacement for &amp;#34;Simply Silver&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I must be allergic to the product because when I  use it I get a really scaly scalp.  </li>
            <li>This was more than I expected, the product far exceed my needs.</li>
            <li>My hair color looked completely normal.</li>
            <li>I had noticed that my nice gray hair was getting a little yellow, so I ordered this after looking at a  lot of reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit perplexed when I couldn&#x27;t find \\&quot;simply silver\\&quot; anymore, but finally found this reissue as Aloxxi Platinum..</li>
            <li>May mix with a little shampoo because it strong.</li>
            <li>I decided to see if Amazon carried it and and first couldn&#x27;t find it, but then saw this product - different name, but luckily put Simply Silver at the end to let me know it was the same!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a dull pewter color.</li>
            <li>I started to notice my blonde locks were turning very gold and yellow-y,  </li>
            <li>I had it sent to some one else, an older individual who wasn&#x27;t in the position to return it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is back to normal.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a last resort to make my hair normal again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this at least once per week for many years or when ever my wife says &amp;#34;OMG, the yellow is back&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Not really a big deal, I swapped it out for an old one.</li>
            <li>I have used many other toning shampoos in the past, but I keep coming back to this one!</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and my hair is not purple...just pretty blonde.</li>

            <li> I use this everyday and my hair is not purple...just pretty blonde.</li>
            <li> So, I colored my hair a natural dark brown which is supposed to take away the red tones.</li>
            <li> The texture of this shampoo appears to be somewhat watered down compared to the the old Nexxus simply silver shampoo.</li>
            <li> Gives so much body, and has lots of suds with a small amount.  </li>
            <li> It does keep the yellow out of grey hair.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t make a difference in sparkle of my white &amp; silver hair, but it did make it extremely dry!</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo once (mixed it with other shampoo to lessen the impact) and left on for three minutes.</li>
            <li> It helps all hair colors not just grey hair.</li>
            <li> Than, I decided to dye my hair dark blonde two times.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with platinum highlights and low lights.</li>
            <li> The shampoo isn&#x27;t cheap so this was a disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> then trying to hold on to the  bottle with wet hands.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, not much needed, I just shampoo it in and leave it for a few minutes then rinse and condition.  </li>
            <li> This product was off the market a year ago, and I tried all the other recommended brands during that period, none of which were even close to this product.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is, Nexxus bottles have a tendency to have defective pumps.</li>
            <li> It comes out almost a glimmery black color.</li>
            <li> Recently we moved into a home with incredibly hard water, we do have a water softener but the water is still hard.  </li>
            <li> My hair always turns orange after a few weeks from the salon.</li>
            <li> I color my hair at home and it had that brassy color that I disliked  but couldn&#x27;t do anything about.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Upon delivery at least a quarter of the contents had leaked.</li>
            <li> it was too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I was</li>
            <li> /am not happy!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It comes out almost a glimmery black color. I have had blonde hair in just about every shade imaginable, and this keeps the gold/brassy tones at bay and keeps my hair the color I want it!  Recently we moved into a home with incredibly hard water, we do have a water softener but the water is still hard.  I started to notice my blonde locks were turning very gold and yellow-y,  so I started using this again and voila!  My hair is back to normal. I have used many other toning shampoos in the past, but I keep coming back to this one!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found since I&#x27;ve let my hair go naturally silver.  Gives so much body, and has lots of suds with a small amount.  The color of my hair has gotten so lovely since using this, and I&#x27;ve had even hair stylists ask where I get my color done!  Makes the silver really shine. I&#x27;m truly a loyal user!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Great for toning (taking any brass tones out of dyed blonde hair). It keeps my professionally done blonde looking bright and clean.</li>
            <li> This was more than I expected, the product far exceed my needs. This was a wonderful purchase and done just what it was intended, yes I will be back.    John R</li>
            <li> Been keeping my highlights nice and bright like the day I left the salon.</li>
            <li> My husband smells soooooooo good, when he wash his hair !!!!! And the color of his white hair is so beautiful !!!! I am a trained hair stylist and knows when a product is good. And that&#x27;s good !!!  I love it !!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last resort to make my hair normal again. I made the mistake of dying my roots blonde instead of going to the hair stylist. Than, I decided to dye my hair dark blonde two times. It faded both times and made my blonde roots turn orange/red. So, I colored my hair a natural dark brown which is supposed to take away the red tones. I read somewhere that a purple shampoo will help even out the hair color. I wish I could take a picture. I used the shampoo once (mixed it with other shampoo to lessen the impact) and left on for three minutes. My hair color looked completely normal. This hair product will fix any toning issues that you have. It helps all hair colors not just grey hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is an exact replacement for the discontinued, Simply Silver, which I&#x27;ve used for many years. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.It is good for my hear. I would recommend to people with gray hear. Nexxus Platinum is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with platinum highlights and low lights. My hair always turns orange after a few weeks from the salon. I use this everyday and my hair is not purple...just pretty blonde. The key is buying one that is platinum not just for blondes. Great price and very generous size bottle.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I buy. People are always carrying-on about how beautiful my hair is. I use it almost every day for several years now and my hair hasn&#x27;t turned blue yet.</li>
            <li> I have tried several grey hair shampoo products and this one gives my hair the best color! I have been asked if I used color on my hair when i have used this brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had noticed that my nice gray hair was getting a little yellow, so I ordered this after looking at a  lot of reviews.  I use Nexxus products, so I figured this would be quality also.  It does work, but not as quickly on my hair as some reported.  I do see a difference, so I will keep using it, I&#x27;m not getting any younger!</li>
            <li> This works perfect to use between coloring appointments. My stylist always compliments how good my color looks and that is hasn&#x27;t yellowed.</li>
            <li> Received the product I wanted on time at a good price.  I would definitely use in the future.  Good experience</li>
            <li> Took the bronze out of my hair perfectly and made it look platinum like it was supposed to look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at least once per week for many years or when ever my wife says &amp;#34;OMG, the yellow is back&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo for silver/gray/white hair.  It&#x27;s the only one I use.  I love the pump, too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works better than others I have tried at keeping my hair silvery and shiny, even my hairdresser commented on how shiny my hair looked!  Lasts a long time, not much needed, I just shampoo it in and leave it for a few minutes then rinse and condition.  Just what my hair needed.  I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Shampoo itself is fine. The problem is with whomever sent it initially. The bottle cap wasn&#x27;t secure. Upon delivery at least a quarter of the contents had leaked. I had it sent to some one else, an older individual who wasn&#x27;t in the position to return it.  The shampoo isn&#x27;t cheap so this was a disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years.  It does keep the yellow out of grey hair.  I receive a lot of compliments on my hair and I owe it to this product.  I mix it with a clarifying shampoo to clean my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for many years and always happy with the shine and sparkle in my hair.  Hard to find in stores but so easy to order.</li>
            <li> Product is the only one I can use and it does a wonderful job. I was glad to find it on Amazon as I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in the stores I went to.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing.  I color my hair at home and it had that brassy color that I disliked  but couldn&#x27;t do anything about.  Once I found out about the shampoo, bought it and applied it, the brassiness on my hair is gone.  It looks like I color it at a salon.  I only apply it once a week because I read that more than that can give you a bluish tone to the hair and I don&#x27;t want to risk it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo--helps keep the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; out of my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times since I received it. The texture of this shampoo appears to be somewhat watered down compared to the the old Nexxus simply silver shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for gray hair. Hair sparkles and body. I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos for gray hair and always come back to this one...</li>
            <li> Great price for this size bottle and it works great. Leaves my hair shiny,  soft, and very pretty. Has a nice scent to it at as well. I like that it has a pump on it makes it so much easier  then trying to hold on to the  bottle with wet hands.  Good product!</li>
            <li> When my hairdresser quit carrying this, I looked for another source. THANKS, Amazon. I don&#x27;t color my hair, nor does my friend, Anne. We both use this to keep the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; at bay on our (very) white hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo so much this is my second order of this stuff and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world. This is NOT for you if you don&#x27;t like white or silver blonde.</li>
            <li> I was a bit perplexed when I couldn&#x27;t find \\&quot;simply silver\\&quot; anymore, but finally found this reissue as Aloxxi Platinum.. I have never found anything to match the quality of this shampoo for my silver hair.</li>
            <li> Bleached my hair white &amp; this keeps it perfect! Results in very 1st use! May mix with a little shampoo because it strong.</li>
            <li> Reasonable replacement for &amp;#34;Simply Silver&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t make a difference in sparkle of my white &amp; silver hair, but it did make it extremely dry!</li>
            <li> I must be allergic to the product because when I  use it I get a really scaly scalp.  I only used it about once a week so by the time I realized what was causing the problem it was too late to return it.  Loved the concept and hope it works for others.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy a shampoo for gray hair (Simply Silver) from my hairdresser, but they changed suppliers. I decided to see if Amazon carried it and and first couldn&#x27;t find it, but then saw this product - different name, but luckily put Simply Silver at the end to let me know it was the same! I use twice a week and that&#x27;s plenty to keep my gray hair from getting any brassiness at all. Nice bonus is that it makes my hair feel great too - very silky/shiny. I will definitely order another one when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo every other wash, and it keeps my hair a gorgeous platinum color. It smells great and leaves my hair very clean and soft. My only complaint is, Nexxus bottles have a tendency to have defective pumps. Not really a big deal, I swapped it out for an old one.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. It keeps my hair clean and shiny</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked within 3 shampoos for me.  Like magic on hair yellowed by well water or cistern water.  Home remedies from online sources did not work.  I have naturally white hair and use no products but shampoo and cream rinse.  I use this now twice a week and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like a dull pewter color. Rather than brightening my gray hair and adding a &amp;#34;silvery&amp;#34; sheen, it just darkened it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 5 years and it is great if used in minimum daily applications for men with medium cut, white hair.  This product was off the market a year ago, and I tried all the other recommended brands during that period, none of which were even close to this product.  So I was happy when the product returned to the market place and I purchased a 1 to 2 year supply, the same as I had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;TTR</li>
            <li> We buy this product continually, his grey hair looks great with thsi sampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product. Last me about a year. Fits in my shower caddy. One push of shampoo works for me.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for covering brassiness or yellowing of white hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered one product...received another!  Needless to say I was/am not happy!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, smooth transaction, perfect product Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great happy with my product it&#x27;s done great to my hair!!</li>
