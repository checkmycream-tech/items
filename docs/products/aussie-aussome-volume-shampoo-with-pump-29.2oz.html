            <li>I love the odor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a lovely smell, cleans hair well</li>
            <li>and I have noticed about 20% more volume after using it for six months.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo it adds so much more volume to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>When I bought this product, my hair was shiny and healthy, but lacked volume.  </li>
            <li>This is also a pretty good deal on the package, but I&#x27;m not quite sure why this is an add on item.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell- but not perfume like or overbearing.</li>
            <li>This one is very good and my hair looks just as good as it did with the previous shampoo I was using.</li>

            <li>Works great, gives you major bounce.</li>
            <li>I recommend this shampoo to anyone with fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and lathers well, and I like the large bottle with the pump.</li>
            <li>It cleans well, has a great scent, and one bottle lasts several months.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>This could be a great alternate, as it clarifies.</li>
            <li>I actually think it&#x27;s great for oily hair.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo but the pump doesn&#x27;t work well and always quits working while there is a lot left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see that Amazon had these huge 2 pack pump bottles for $10</li>
            <li>This leaves your hair feeling really clean, but also really smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>review required more words than the first sentence so that is why I added this sentence.</li>
            <li>Ran out of Drama Clean,  so I tried this.  </li>
            <li>It bubbles up and the suds appeared to clean my face the times I tried it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t build up in your hair like a lot of shampoos do and it gets my oily hair clean.  </li>
            <li>That may be true, but when I rinse my hair, it becomes SUPER squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The pump works great from the first day to the last drop.</li>
            <li>We love this shampoo and can&#x27;t find it always where we live so we will order this through Amazon from now on and let our fingers do the walking!</li>
            <li>and I do appreciate the pump bottle very much!</li>
            <li>this worked out at a ridiculously low price on this offer and I got the two large shampoos in good time and with no problems.  </li>
            <li>If your hair feels a bit dry after, try a nice conditioner and serum.</li>
            <li>It is a great deal considering the big pump bottles at my local store cost about $7 a piece.</li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable, also.</li>
            <li>I love the big pump bottles, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different volume shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even use 1/4 of the first bottle.</li>
            <li>My fiance even asked what happened to my hair and noted that it was &amp;#34;so shiny and pretty around the holidays&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Many people who are used to thick shampoo will find this very different,  but for me, that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Great product for thin, and straight hair.</li>
            <li>The bottles are huge, I bought mine a month ago, and I&#x27;m a guy with short hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>So they don&#x27;t use too much at once.</li>
            <li>I expected more volume....</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t so big and clunky that they don&#x27;t fit in the shower, like some brands.</li>
            <li>and I recommend this shampoo for every one.&lt;br /&gt;many thanks.</li>
            <li>Once I used it for about a month straight</li>
            <li>I do recommend this along with the shampoo to anyone who wants some added volume to their hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>But it really dries out my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally thick and curly hair, but this gives me that extra boost to make my hair incredible.</li>
            <li>Needless to say finding a gentle yet effective shampoo has been a HUGE challenge for me...</li>
            <li>Thats the main reason I gave it 4-stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>I started using my Aussie again and my hair is visibly shinier, and smooth to the point where I can run my fingers through it and there isn&#x27;t a single tangle.</li>
            <li>My scalp reacts poorly to nearly every shampoo on the market, including baby shampoo!</li>
            <li>I bought a smaller bottle of this and the conditioner to try first and while it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker at adding volume, it does add volume and gives my hair a luxurious feel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make a lot of volume but the rest of the positive attributes make up for that.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews lead me to hope this would help my flat, thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Aussie Volume is s lightly-tinted, clear, seemingly nonconditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li>Also, the skin on my face is extremely sensitive to what shampoos I use.</li>
            <li>Only giving one star because I absolutely have to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a busy guy though</li>
            <li>Whole family uses it and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take some time to get my hair back to normal, which REALLY sucks since I am getting married in July!</li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t weight it down either.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair, but loads of strands.  </li>

            <li> but it certainly doesn&#x27;t weight it down either.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, but loads of strands.  </li>
            <li> One has very fine shoulder length hair and the other has hair almost down to her butt which is very thick</li>
            <li> Lots of good ingredients minus some bad</li>
            <li> and just don&#x27;t have the time to return such a low cost item, especially if I can still make it function by manually moving the pump up and down.</li>
            <li> A little history--I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also experience no skin problems on my forehead/face from this shampoo--no dry skin, no redness, nothing.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t have a problem with dry hair</li>
            <li> Some say it can dry your hair, she agrees.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair no volume at all, it makes my hair frizzy and dry, and even my hairline is recessing because of it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out</li>
            <li> It became dry and fly-away</li>
            <li> In fact, for the first time in a loooong time my hair shedding has decreased dramatically and my scalp has stopped itching altogether.</li>
            <li> Received what I expected, matches description on product page.</li>
            <li> the other thing I like is the ease in spreading.</li>
            <li> But it makes my hair extremely tangled to the point where my hair is in knots.</li>
            <li> I have used it for the past ten years.</li>
            <li> After going through dozens of other shampoos, this has become my go-to.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be a little dry</li>
            <li> My hair went from limp, but soft and shiny to limp and sticky and dull.  </li>
            <li> Not worth a dime.</li>
            <li> but I literally have to pull the pump up and down to get it to dispense shampoo.</li>
            <li> I feel like some shampoos leave my hair feeling oily or not completely clean.  </li>
            <li> The scent lingers a little but doesn&#x27;t cloy.</li>
            <li> Even in the harsh winter months, I can use this shampoo everyday without any skin or scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> Wife says to use conditioner every few times just in case.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight thickness, so it doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> clean - seriously!!!!  </li>
            <li> Makes it extremely tangled, unmanageable, and just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> After I began using this product, I slowly noticed the texture of my hair changing.  </li>
            <li> I have had horrible skin reactions to past shampoos including acne breakouts, rosacea flare-ups, and dry patchy skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ended up throwing this away after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the pump on the bottle broke 4 days in.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the remaining product is going where it belongs....</li>
            <li> both bottles were opened and so the shampoo was leaking all over the plastic package that they came in...so disappointing</li>
            <li> It makes it very difficult to comb my hair after showering and it causes a lot of damage to hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked considering</li>
            <li> I bought some shampoo from my hair dresser and was disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever bought, it makes my hair feel like rubber after rinsing.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years for good reason. It cleans well, has a great scent, and one bottle lasts several months. Will continue to order again and again!</li>
            <li> This was a pleasant surprise! I had been using salon quality shampoos for years and had to stop that, budget-wise. This one is very good and my hair looks just as good as it did with the previous shampoo I was using. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> A little history--I have extremely sensitive skin. My scalp reacts poorly to nearly every shampoo on the market, including baby shampoo! I&#x27;ve had issues with hair loss, scalp inflammation, dandruff, buildup, you name it.. Also, the skin on my face is extremely sensitive to what shampoos I use. I have had horrible skin reactions to past shampoos including acne breakouts, rosacea flare-ups, and dry patchy skin. Needless to say finding a gentle yet effective shampoo has been a HUGE challenge for me...that is...until I found this!! This has been the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause scalp inflammation or hair loss. In fact, for the first time in a loooong time my hair shedding has decreased dramatically and my scalp has stopped itching altogether. I also experience no skin problems on my forehead/face from this shampoo--no dry skin, no redness, nothing. Even in the harsh winter months, I can use this shampoo everyday without any skin or scalp irritation. This has become my go to shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with Aussie shampoo. I have been using it for 15+ years and didn&#x27;t realize what it did for my hair until I switched to salon brand. I bought some shampoo from my hair dresser and was disappointed with it. I started using my Aussie again and my hair is visibly shinier, and smooth to the point where I can run my fingers through it and there isn&#x27;t a single tangle. The best combination is the Aussome Volume shampoo with the Moist conditioner. This leaves your hair feeling really clean, but also really smooth and shiny. Sometimes you take the things you use every day for granted until you switch to something else. This is also a pretty good deal on the package, but I&#x27;m not quite sure why this is an add on item.</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo and can&#x27;t find it always where we live so we will order this through Amazon from now on and let our fingers do the walking!</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair price was great got 2 bottles for price of one if I bought this at drug or grocery store. Love the fresh smell. Whole family uses it and lasts a long time. Love the pump bottle</li>
            <li> The positive reviews lead me to hope this would help my flat, thinning hair.  Unfortunately, I ended up throwing this away after a couple of weeks.  My hair went from limp, but soft and shiny to limp and sticky and dull.  Instead of boosting volume,  this made my hair heavier and  flatter than before</li>
            <li> Packaged well, and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Ran out of Drama Clean,  so I tried this.  It smells nice,  lathers well and rinses easily. This could be a great alternate, as it clarifies. I pair it with similarly fragrant products: HE body envy conditioner, HE smoothing serum, pantene overnight miracle and aussie leave-in hair insurance. All are somewhat fruity. Aussie Volume is s lightly-tinted, clear, seemingly nonconditioning shampoo. It spreads nicely. It doesn&#x27;t leave a slimy feeling on my skin. It has a very slight thickness, so it doesn&#x27;t run. It bubbles up and the suds appeared to clean my face the times I tried it.  The scent lingers a little but doesn&#x27;t cloy. This is another shampoo that I will rely upon instead if creamier formulas, which tend to build up. If your hair feels a bit dry after, try a nice conditioner and serum. Many people who are used to thick shampoo will find this very different,  but for me, that&#x27;s a good thing. Edit: the other thing I like is the ease in spreading. And you can use it for leg shaving. It matches the aforementioned Hair Insurance well because of the smell. I actually think it&#x27;s great for oily hair.</li>
            <li> Loves how it works, very well for my hair axially works best for me on my baby fine hair gives it lots of volume and style I like how it smells and rinses out good.  Some don&#x27;t.  Make it feel thicker as well.</li>
            <li> I love this deal. They lasted me months at a very good price. Excellent shampoo - kept my hair nice</li>
            <li> I always use this brand of shampoo, and it costs around $6+ at Walmart.  this worked out at a ridiculously low price on this offer and I got the two large shampoos in good time and with no problems.  I almost wish I had bought a double load.</li>
            <li> both bottles were opened and so the shampoo was leaking all over the plastic package that they came in...so disappointing</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but good for the price has a nice fragrance and leaves your hair feeling clean and soft.  My hair tends to be a little dry so I prefer Aussie Moist over this one but if you don&#x27;t have a problem with dry hair then this one is definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> My pre-teen daughters both use this shampoo. One has very fine shoulder length hair and the other has hair almost down to her butt which is very thick and she likes it too. It smells great. Amazon had a great price on their subscribe and save so I definitely added it to my monthly list for savings. The pump feature is the best! So they don&#x27;t use too much at once.</li>
            <li> Accidentally picked the wrong type of shampoo but it smells ok.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever bought, it makes my hair feel like rubber after rinsing. Makes it extremely tangled, unmanageable, and just ridiculous. Wish I would&#x27;ve never bought this crappy product, my hair falls out in handfuls now. Save yourself the headache. Only giving one star because I absolutely have to.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this shampoo. It smells nice and lathers well, and I like the large bottle with the pump. But it makes my hair extremely tangled to the point where my hair is in knots. It makes it very difficult to comb my hair after showering and it causes a lot of damage to hair.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo. I have used it for the past ten years.</li>
            <li> That´s Ok. I expected more volume....</li>
            <li> Great shampoo but the pump doesn&#x27;t work well and always quits working while there is a lot left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Shampoo has worked great for me.  I feel like some shampoos leave my hair feeling oily or not completely clean.  Not a problem with this shampoo.  My wife says it is because it is a volumizing shampoo.  Some say it can dry your hair, she agrees.  She has 30 years experience as a beautician. That may be true, but when I rinse my hair, it becomes SUPER squeaky clean. That is a good thing for me.  Wife says to use conditioner every few times just in case. Great value, seems concentrated, scent is good.  Unless my hair falls out, will order again.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It gives my hair no volume at all, it makes my hair frizzy and dry, and even my hairline is recessing because of it. Not worth a dime. DO NOT BUY THIS SHAMPOO!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t build up in your hair like a lot of shampoos do and it gets my oily hair clean.  I would recommend this shampoo to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great product for thin, and straight hair. Price was very reasonable, also. I will duy this product again, also recommend to friends</li>
            <li> I was traveling to the US and this was the firs request to bring home. Family girls are very happy!</li>
            <li> Works great, gives you major bounce. I have naturally thick and curly hair, but this gives me that extra boost to make my hair incredible. I love the big pump bottles, too. They aren&#x27;t so big and clunky that they don&#x27;t fit in the shower, like some brands. The pump works great from the first day to the last drop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different volume shampoos.  Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo is awesome and the best of any of the others that I&#x27;ve tried.  I love the odor.  And, it does not take a lot of the shampoo on my longer hair.  Great lathering and easily rinsed leaving my hair squeaky clean - seriously!!!!  I will always use this product.  Now if only I could find an Aussie Aussome Volume Conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal! The bottles are huge, I bought mine a month ago, and I&#x27;m a guy with short hair and I can&#x27;t immagine I&#x27;ve even use 1/4 of the first bottle. It has a nice clean smell- but not perfume like or overbearing. It&#x27;s a unisex geared shampoo. Unfortunately the pump on the bottle broke 4 days in. It still works but I literally have to pull the pump up and down to get it to dispense shampoo. Thats the main reason I gave it 4-stars instead of 5. This however could have been damage from shipping, or a manufacturers defect- who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a busy guy though and just don&#x27;t have the time to return such a low cost item, especially if I can still make it function by manually moving the pump up and down. All and all I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I like this product it is excellent for my hair and I recommend this shampoo for every one.&lt;br /&gt;many thanks.</li>
            <li> After going through dozens of other shampoos, this has become my go-to. Does a good job with volume, hair feels/looks good.</li>
            <li> Good price, provides volume without adding weight.&lt;br /&gt;My review required more words than the first sentence so that is why I added this sentence.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see that Amazon had these huge 2 pack pump bottles for $10 so of course I ordered them. It is a great deal considering the big pump bottles at my local store cost about $7 a piece. I bought a smaller bottle of this and the conditioner to try first and while it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker at adding volume, it does add volume and gives my hair a luxurious feel. I&#x27;m shocked considering this is just a drug store brand. Once I used it for about a month straight that&#x27;s when I decided to order the two big pump bottles. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out but it certainly doesn&#x27;t weight it down either. I do recommend this along with the shampoo to anyone who wants some added volume to their hair.</li>
            <li> After washing with it, my hair has volume! I don&#x27;t use conditioner. Instead, after washing my hair with shampoo, i use a bit of oil, preferrably, amond oil!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a lovely smell, cleans hair well and I do appreciate the pump bottle very much! It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make a lot of volume but the rest of the positive attributes make up for that.</li>
            <li> Received what I expected, matches description on product page. Arrived in the allotted time; I would purchase from here again.</li>
            <li> Very good, nice smell, great price.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and I have noticed about 20% more volume after using it for six months. But it really dries out my hair. I have to use extra conditioner now.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the price was great!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo it adds so much more volume to my thinning hair. And the pump bottle is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, but loads of strands.  When I bought this product, my hair was shiny and healthy, but lacked volume.  After I began using this product, I slowly noticed the texture of my hair changing.  It became dry and fly-away and I now have a lot of breakage.  My fiance even asked what happened to my hair and noted that it was &amp;#34;so shiny and pretty around the holidays&amp;#34;.  Needless to say, the remaining product is going where it belongs....in the trash.  It&#x27;s going to take some time to get my hair back to normal, which REALLY sucks since I am getting married in July!</li>
