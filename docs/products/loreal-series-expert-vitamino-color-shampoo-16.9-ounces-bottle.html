            <li>Anyone who colors their hair would love this product.  </li>

            <li>Love this product and seller&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>It. :)</li>
            <li>I love Loreal Series Expert Vitamino Color Shampoo.</li>
            <li>there is another shampoo for color treated hair without sulfates that I love</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s course but that works for many hair styles.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>great product I would recommend this product for colored hair, it leaves your hair very soft and manageable, cleans well</li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo, no parabens, the first one of its kind that I used.  </li>
            <li>Great product, leaves hair untangled and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair shinny and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Came on time,only problem one of the bottles was open,which leaked out a little,but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Huge bottle.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years, it leaves my&lt;br /&gt;hair in fantastic shape, with great shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different color-treated hair shampoos, but L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Expert is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>When ordering the product everything went smooth and I received the product promptly.</li>
            <li>My straight hair is back to being silky, shiny and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>But worth every drop!  </li>
            <li>Rich suds despite the no parabens.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that the seller just put a cheap shampoo in the bottle and charged me the full price.</li>
            <li>Again, I have great long hair and a lot of it...</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a really clean feeling without stripping it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything special about this product.</li>
            <li>I have to have my hair tinted regularly and my hairdresser recommended Vitamino as a good shampoo that would retain the color between haircut and tint appointments.</li>
            <li>Smells good and works.. but didn&#x27;t know if it made my hair color last longer than when I used another brand.</li>
            <li>And if you color your hair, your color doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal Professional!</li>
            <li>but I would try the complete keratase line if you want something more wowing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a product to make it shiny and soft and I want to fall in love with a product.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Worth.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo... lovely scent, leaves my hair so fresh and clean, but only giving 3 stars due to high price.</li>
            <li>Love this line, great for long hair dry and normal hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my 70 year old hair feeling healthy, clean and vibrant and does not irritate my very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>My color seems to stay longer and my short hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy these products online than at a hair salon!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and none compare to this gentle but cleansing shampoo.</li>
            <li>It always highest quality products and pretty reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Hopefully not too much, but not what you want when you are paying for the whole bottle!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My long hair requires about 10 pumps, but feels very clean.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and soft, my hair feels soft and lovely after, and just remember, this size is a pump, so as it gets towards the end, it&#x27;ll be hard to pump that.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>This item worked very well</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to saturate very well into my hair.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this shampoo by my hairdresser and am very thankful it is sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used professional products for the last 20 years and love this shampoo more than any other.</li>
            <li>My sister in law is a stylist at a very high end salon in del mar, ca and highly recommends l&#x27;oreal products.</li>
            <li>I love it, it does not dry out my already dry hair</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very thick, works well!</li>
            <li>and it is very profitable to order in such a large size.</li>
            <li>It lathers well too and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Definitely noticed that it helps preserve color very well!  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It came early.</li>
            <li>It keeps the longevity of my glossings and adds softness to the hair in prep for the deep conditioning I do with Loreal Intense Repair Cream.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny.</li>
            <li>It is light and although I try other products, I continue to come back to this one.</li>
            <li>It never builds up and the smell is subtle and not over powering as it is in many professional series shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair, and it really works for me.</li>
            <li>I have hard water at my house and had been searching for a shampoo and conditioner that would leave my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Less than half the price as at my salon and its got SOOO much more content.  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo and trade off using different Loreal Professional Conditioners.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient in the pump bottle and it goes a long, long way..</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and easy to comb through, but not weighed down or dull.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the color soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s an above average product</li>
            <li> This came with no packing and the lid was loose, so I lost some of the liquid.  </li>
            <li> This item is different from the Loreal Vitamino Color Shampoo I purchased previously from my hair salon.</li>
            <li> The one from the salon is white and fluffy and you only have to use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I have course long dark hair.</li>

            <li> I feel pretty uncomfortable using this shampoo as there is no label.  </li>
            <li> The price was considerably less than at the beauty salon.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a bit odd as the seller added 5 or 6 knock off perfume samples in the box.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the product was not sealed tightly and there was some leakage.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Leaves my hair silky and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Have used for years.  Great line of products for colored hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use Purology but it was to expensive so I tried this on a recommendation from my sister.  I really like it and it works well for my hair even with the color I do every 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I will use on my colored hair. It keeps my hair hydrated and the color stays richer longer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything special about this product.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Professional! It always highest quality products and pretty reasonable price. I also bought Conditioner and now my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo came in a box with no padding or tissue, with scotch tape over the top of the bottle, that had ripped and there was shampoo everywhere. It was a huge mess and a lot of this expensive product was wasted. I would ask for a refund if I had any idea how to to do so. It was packaged so unprofesionally it was a joke!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, have used for over a decade and dread the day they decide to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it. It leaves my 70 year old hair feeling healthy, clean and vibrant and does not irritate my very sensitive scalp. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo... lovely scent, leaves my hair so fresh and clean, but only giving 3 stars due to high price. I&#x27;m not really sure what the hype is all about. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again unless I feeling good with my finances.</li>
            <li> This is great for colored hair.  I would recommend that the seller package their products better, however.  This came with no packing and the lid was loose, so I lost some of the liquid.  Other than that, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  I also send it to my daughter who loves it.  Her entire family uses it.  My hair stylist recommended it and I have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn F., Carlsbad, CA</li>
            <li> This item worked very well and I used it up, now my hairdresser has me on another color shampoo. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love it, it does not dry out my already dry hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different color-treated hair shampoos, but L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Expert is the best so far. Doesn&#x27;t strip the color from my hair like the others. Use with the L&#x27;Oreal Expert conditioner and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The beauty shop where I go introduced me to this product.  My color seems to stay longer and my short hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I use.  It is very convenient in the pump bottle and it goes a long, long way..</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product.  When ordering the product everything went smooth and I received the product promptly.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that came very quickly.  HOWEVER, the product was not sealed tightly and there was some leakage.  Hopefully not too much, but not what you want when you are paying for the whole bottle!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the products that my hair stylist continues to use. It is light and although I try other products, I continue to come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give this a bad rating necessarily, it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations according to other reviews. It&#x27;s an above average product but I would try the complete keratase line if you want something more wowing. It didn&#x27;t seem to saturate very well into my hair. I have course long dark hair. I&#x27;m always looking for a product to make it shiny and soft and I want to fall in love with a product. Unfortunately, I just haven&#x27;t found that. Maybe it&#x27;s a case of never being satisfied and looking for the next best thing. Sigh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy these products online than at a hair salon!  Item was received promptly and as described.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo, no parabens, the first one of its kind that I used.  And I love it,, love it.  The scent is nice and soft, my hair feels soft and lovely after, and just remember, this size is a pump, so as it gets towards the end, it&#x27;ll be hard to pump that.  But worth every drop!  Rich suds despite the no parabens.  And if you color your hair, your color doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this shampoo for years and love it what it does for our hair.  It never builds up and the smell is subtle and not over powering as it is in many professional series shampoos.  However, I don&#x27;t like that it has parabens in it and wish that Loreal would remove it.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous paraben free shampoos and keep coming back to this one, but it feels like a guilty pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loreal, please make a paraben free version!</li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo for years as I have color treated hair.  It does a great job of preserving the color and is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for my dry hair.  I use this shampoo and trade off using different Loreal Professional Conditioners.  As always, Amazon has the best prices and convenience.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this shampoo by my hairdresser and am very thankful it is sold on Amazon. I use it along with the Vitamino conditioner. I have hard water at my house and had been searching for a shampoo and conditioner that would leave my hair feeling clean and soft. I had tried several drugstore brands but this is the best.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo, it works great on my damaged colored hair. and it is very profitable to order in such a large size.</li>
            <li> This item is different from the Loreal Vitamino Color Shampoo I purchased previously from my hair salon. This item is gray and has a thinner consistency. The one from the salon is white and fluffy and you only have to use a little at a time. I tried to save money, but this does not seem like the same product. I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> What a difference this shampoo has made for my post menopausal hair!  My straight hair is back to being silky, shiny and smells wonderful.  Worth the price.  I have used professional products for the last 20 years and love this shampoo more than any other.</li>
            <li> Anyone who colors their hair would love this product.  The price was considerably less than at the beauty salon. It gives your hair a really clean feeling without stripping it.</li>
            <li> I have a long hair and this product helping me!&lt;br /&gt;I like this product!</li>
            <li> Good stuff for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it with the conditioner on my color treated, curly hair.  It leaves my hair soft and easy to comb through, but not weighed down or dull.  The price here is terrific as well.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using this line for years and love the products. It leaves your hair shinny and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> When I got it the lead was broken and the shampoo was leaking. I don&#x27;t know if it was the packaging or if they send it broken</li>
            <li> great product I would recommend this product for colored hair, it leaves your hair very soft and manageable, cleans well</li>
            <li> My hair seem healthy and with good color, however It&#x27;s been just one month.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is pretty good for colored hair and the smell is sooooo nice. It&#x27;s a really good shampoo i recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since my stylist started coloring my hair and told me this would be the best shampoo to use.  It keeps the color soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I have been using this for about 5 years now.  I did try a couple of others in between and have always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I orderd the conditioner not shampoo. What do I do if I already recieved the product and used it.  I know i orderd the conditioner and got the wrong thing</li>
            <li> Really nice shampoo!  Definitely noticed that it helps preserve color very well!  My long hair requires about 10 pumps, but feels very clean.  I do need to be sure to use conditioner in order to get a comb through my hair afterward.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, it keeps the color in my hair looking great for months. This is what my salon recommended I purchase.</li>
            <li> I started using this because it&#x27;s what my hairdresser recommended.  I think it smells lovely and does a great job on my hair!  It&#x27;s not very thick, works well!</li>
            <li> I have to have my hair tinted regularly and my hairdresser recommended Vitamino as a good shampoo that would retain the color between haircut and tint appointments. I ran out of the shampoo between appointments once, so used an off brand from a drugstore.  It did not hold my color; there is a noticeable difference in using Vitamino.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and none compare to this gentle but cleansing shampoo. I will never switch and it is great time after time.</li>
            <li> Came on time,only problem one of the bottles was open,which leaked out a little,but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Loved it. Less than half the price as at my salon and its got SOOO much more content.  Huge bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product and seller&lt;br /&gt;Great job&lt;br /&gt;It came early.</li>
            <li> All. I can say is I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo, work as we&#x27;ll. as this one...  Worth the extra money...I&#x27;m. Worth. It. :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great and doesn&#x27;t fade my haircolor at all. It lathers well too and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for that perfect shampool for dyed hair, this is the product for you!  I have been using this for over 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I have never been dissatisfied with it. I have used it for several years, it leaves my&lt;br /&gt;hair in fantastic shape, with great shine. I would recommend it to any one who colors their hair.&lt;br /&gt;I chose a 5 star rating because it deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;  Jan Cannady&lt;br /&gt;  Fort Walton Beach, FL</li>
            <li> I love Loreal Series Expert Vitamino Color Shampoo. I have fine thin hair, and it really works for me.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle without the label, several days after this item was supposed to arrive at my house.  The packaging was a bit odd as the seller added 5 or 6 knock off perfume samples in the box.  I feel pretty uncomfortable using this shampoo as there is no label.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that the seller just put a cheap shampoo in the bottle and charged me the full price.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I&#x27;ve found yet goes great with Loreal vitamin conditioner.  Love this line, great for long hair dry and normal hair.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Keeps preserve my color longer.  I would recommend this product if you have trouble with color fading.  A great product!</li>
            <li> it is the best product</li>
            <li> Horrible. This shampoo was waxy like the conditioner, it didn&#x27;t lather, it was just all around terrible.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> ordered wrong item. this shampoo has sulfates in it. there is another shampoo for color treated hair without sulfates that I love and I thought this was it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at my hair salon and I prefer it over all others.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious. Like raspberries.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Again, I have great long hair and a lot of it...it&#x27;s course but that works for many hair styles.  The problem is you can never find a shampoo you want to stay with.  This shampoo is excellent.  It keeps the longevity of my glossings and adds softness to the hair in prep for the deep conditioning I do with Loreal Intense Repair Cream.  In combo...these two work miracles and everytime I think I want to just try something else for kicks... I regret it!  A must have for long thick hair people!</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves hair untangled and soft. Not every time a conditioner is needed after using this shampoo..</li>
            <li> I love this product. Every time I use my hair restoration is not easy to handle. My hair is soft, shiny. It is excellent I recommend 100%</li>
            <li> I bought this since my hair salon sells it for twice the price. Smells good and works.. but didn&#x27;t know if it made my hair color last longer than when I used another brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It cleans without stripping the hair.  The scent is sweet but very subtle.  My sister in law is a stylist at a very high end salon in del mar, ca and highly recommends l&#x27;oreal products.</li>
