            <li>It is a good size for my bedroom.</li>
            <li>Best for a nite-light, my daughter loves that she can choose the color of the light.</li>
            <li>and if you need a good inhale, just put your head by the diffuser and breath in.  </li>
            <li>I purchased and really loved the AromaSens Ultrasonic Diffuser from Puritan on sale for $39, but after 6-8 months it sputtered water, so I had to put it on a towel, and sometimes did not turn off.</li>
            <li>The included lavender oil is nice and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is cute and worked great for about 2 weeks (purchased Nov. 18th).  </li>
            <li>Great product I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>So it is very safe and you don&#x27;t have to remember to switch it off every time you are using it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>But the pluses of this model for me are the night light feature, the sonic plate, and the price!!</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser!</li>
            <li>They are cute and don&#x27;t take up a ton of room!  </li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>Love the lights!</li>
            <li>I love my diffuser!  </li>
            <li>So that tells you how much I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, first time ever to use one, spouse advised me to get one.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>The smell from this unit is amazing too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing</li>
            <li>I bought some lavender oil and it smells absolutely amazing and puts me at ease.</li>
            <li>but it is a nice touch to see that the unit is on.</li>
            <li>They are also durable, and stay looking nice on the inside and out after months of use.  </li>
            <li>I liked the aromatherapy humidifier.</li>
            <li>it is so nice not to have to keep an eye on it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t match the warm colors of my decor.</li>
            <li>For the price I really think this is the best diffuser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The time settings are a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Nice diffuser and works well.</li>
            <li>I now own three.</li>
            <li>More affordable than comparable models and more attractive.</li>
            <li>It fills up my living room &amp; dining room nicely.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a diffuser that really &amp;#34;diffuses&amp;#34;, I think this is not the best product.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 of these units and they have been working nicely for a week.</li>
            <li>It  works great!I highly recommend this product!Thank you for this excellent product!</li>
            <li>The light makes for a great night light!</li>
            <li>but It arrived quickly and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It would easily fill a bedroom or kitchen with good fragrances.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, comes with a container for measuring/pouring water.</li>
            <li>This ultrasonic diffuser is very pretty and works great.</li>
            <li>You can add your own aromatherapy oils I love orange, tangerine and lime or lavander.</li>
            <li>It puts out a lot of steam and has a bright light as well.</li>
            <li>I had been using the old style filter type, and the filter in no way compares to this excellent diffuser.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very impressed with this diffuser.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the quality is great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, pleasant light.</li>
            <li>Also, this diffuser omits a very light stream, so having a fan on will disperse it and not concentrate it in one spot.  </li>
            <li>This works great and what I like most is that it is pretty and has color</li>
            <li>so it smells fresh and pleasant when guests enter our home.</li>
            <li>Great to turn your bedroom into pure bliss.</li>
            <li>Time will tell how well it holds up to our oils :)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I noticed that I LOVE is how my clothes and sheets smell in my room.</li>
            <li>, I love the mist and how it works.  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser is so much better.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love the timer with it.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t really be able to smell it.  </li>
            <li>Totally love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Sleeping and breathing much better at night.  </li>
            <li>but I love the look</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love the changing lights.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute</li>
            <li>and I love my humidifier</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>There are many choices for a mid-range priced diffuser, but I gave this one a try.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I also love the auto shut-off that&#x27;s built in.</li>
            <li>Another reason I chose this diffuser over some of the others was the fact that the use of oils was okay - some diffusers specifically state that oils cannot be used.  </li>
            <li>Been impressed with with the mist/steam used with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Love this for by my bed</li>
            <li>This diffuser is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 of these diffusers and LOVE THEM.  </li>
            <li>I love the option to change colors or just leave it off if I&#x27;m going to sleep.</li>
            <li>LOVE it, would like to buy 4 more.</li>
            <li>Light can be turned off which is nice if you plan on using at bedtime.</li>
            <li>The product not only adds moisture to the air but also adds a great aroma!!</li>
            <li>Purchased this lovely diffuser for my daughter&#x27;s bedroom to diffuse lavender at night.  </li>
            <li>We wanted something comparable but more affordable.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am going to get two more.</li>
            <li>It delivers great scent and is very calming.</li>
            <li>I really love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>thinking of getting one for each of my kids rooms this winter :)</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use citrus oils with this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Just got this item today and we are already enjoying the aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Second button is for the colored light, which has a bright and dim feature, great options, pleasant colors; I prefer to have the light off most of the time, so it&#x27;s great to have that option.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean, very pretty and does a great job at diffusing.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a timer, and it&#x27;s so easy to change the water and it looks cute as well.</li>
            <li>Does not do much as humidifier - for the room that is, but I used it successfully to mist my orchid.</li>
            <li>They are great little workers and keep my house smelling great.  </li>
            <li>This is especially nice when using in a bedroom and don&#x27;t want extra light at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used four different cool diffusers and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can use it as a accent light or night light.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>You turn it on and almost immediately, a light mist starts coming out of the top with the scent of whatever you put in it.</li>
            <li>feels a bit cheap, works ok</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s done a great job.</li>
            <li>works great so far.</li>

            <li>Love how the light changes.</li>
            <li>This is a cute little guy, perfect for work or at a desk.</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts a lot longer, but compared to other reviews I&#x27;ve been very happy with all of the functions.  </li>
            <li>Nicely made,  good quality, pretty and works very well.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to understand.</li>
            <li>It holds 100ml of water-based solution (drops of the oils are placed in the water bath), and the mist stream is easily visible.</li>
            <li>So easy and quit to run.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and refill.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to use.</li>

            <li>Easy to figure out how to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy instructions.</li>
            <li>Almost a week of use, and still going strong.</li>
            <li>and I had to turn the diffuser off because it was so strong</li>
            <li>Nice and pretty, effective as a diffuser (though changing from one essential oil to another requires good cleaning of water reservoir</li>
            <li>Quiet and puts out a nice fine mist with a good amount of scent.</li>
            <li>First of I would like to say that this an amazing product.</li>
            <li>But it works fine.</li>
            <li>received my Ultrasonic and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to operate, and works fine.</li>
            <li>My family and I love this diffuser very much!  </li>
            <li>It turns out that the aesthetic is actually very sweet, and this is the best darn little diffuser around, perhaps!  </li>
            <li>This little Diffuser is perfect!!</li>
            <li>This is little and perfect for aromatherapy and a humidifier.</li>
            <li>I saw a lot of them for over a hundred dollar it would be hard to image them working any better than this one I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>Works great to diffuse essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Great product, have used it constantly!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It was a lot smaller than I anticipated, but it does a great job filling the room with fragrance.</li>
            <li>They needed a night light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li>the timer works like a charm and it really does a nice job of diffusing the oils.</li>
            <li>Great diffuser, I&#x27;ve only had it a week</li>
            <li>My husband and my cat both enjoy it with me.</li>
            <li>Also, I like the variety of colors for the light.</li>
            <li>Each colored light dims too for a softer color</li>
            <li>Also there is a light setting that allows you to change the color of the humidifier to whatever color mood setting you want.</li>
            <li>I have to say I received this free to review it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves changing the light colors.</li>
            <li>has two buttons, one to turn on (and select time) and one for the light.</li>
            <li>Have had this for only 2 weeks but so far love it - great buy!</li>
            <li>You also have the option of leaving the light off.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery with nice and neat packaging.</li>
            <li>so I can use it for a night light, but the light goes off when the diffuser shuts off.  </li>
            <li>Hold the &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; button until it beeps on, press it to see the light move to the 30, 60, 120, or 180 min timer.</li>
            <li>This is a great addition to the use of my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Easy fill,easy clean.</li>
            <li>would have given this diffuser a 5-star rating, but it has started making a \\&quot;whirring\\&quot; sound when I turn it on</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I have had this for a couple of weeks and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, after a month of frequent use works great!</li>
            <li>A really good product so far.</li>
            <li>It doesnt create to strong of a scent perfect for small to medium rooms.</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely and the way the scent comes out is just right..</li>
            <li>I plugged it in, added water &amp; oils &amp; am enjoying it right now.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and I love that you can choose to dim each light color for a softer effect.</li>
            <li>it also lights up very nicely and changes to a lot of different colors</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Loved my first one so much bought one for a gift.</li>
            <li>Pretty lights though, I am using it more as a night light.</li>
            <li>He was excited about the 100ml container for adding the water.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this will get returned tonight.&lt;br /&gt;Photo attached for size comparison</li>
            <li>Great dispersed aroma, fun night light, and very quiet while working.</li>
            <li>I ordered this diffuser after my original (another brand) diffuser stopped working.  </li>
            <li>, I am pleased with the unit, and I&#x27;d probably purchase another one because it is so pretty</li>
            <li>Allergy season is upon us and we are looking for ways to clean and improve the air in our home.</li>
            <li>This emits the perfect amount of light for late night feedings.  </li>
            <li>The light is bright, cool, whitish blue color.  </li>
            <li>The price is more than fair compared to all the other diffusers out there.  </li>
            <li>It works well, does almost two full rounds of 180 minute runs without refilling.  </li>
            <li>Now when I walk in, it smells much better and with continued use, the place will really smell like me.</li>
            <li>I wrote a full review here:  </li>
            <li>Fun light colors.</li>
            <li>Makes using my oils simple and the entire house smells great!</li>
            <li>The scent fills the room quickly.</li>
            <li>The diffuser arrived earlier today &amp; although smaller than I imagined, it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>kids love the different color lighting choices, and I love the automatic shut</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t absolutely love is that you can&#x27;t run it for more than 3 hours at a time.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the diffuser very much.  </li>
            <li>The timer function is very nice and it is much safer than having a candle, especially with kids in the house.</li>
            <li>When I first plugged this one in the mist seemed so light</li>
            <li>My nearly 17 year old son is using the one I bought, and he would have liked something more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but it works</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty lamp.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and efficient.</li>
            <li>It feels like pretty cheap plastic</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts for a good long time.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use and very quite</li>
            <li>It really puts the scent in the air quickly and strong.</li>
            <li>Worked great - exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill and love the multiple times that can be selected.</li>
            <li>This is a great little unit and is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is great, amazing what such a little contraption can do.  </li>
            <li>Each color has a bright or dim setting so if you prefer low light, there is that option.</li>
            <li>If you buy cheap synthetic oil, don&#x27;t expect your room to smell much.</li>
            <li>My daugter loves the different color lights and can work the lights and timers on her own.</li>
            <li>so so glad I ventured out to give this one a try; it by far beats my friend&#x27;s diffuser.</li>
            <li>The different colored lights are a nice effect too.</li>
            <li>For the price it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I would say this diffuser is worth while.</li>
            <li>It works as well as described and is really fun to use.</li>
            <li>Love the timer settings as well as the settings for the different level of light output.</li>
            <li>Improved my sinus congestion in several days, now I use it every night,  breathing better since, also the night light is useful for my newborn baby</li>
            <li>The cord gets really warm when in use, so it&#x27;s been benched as a possible fire hazard.</li>
            <li>It outputs just enough mist to get a nice aroma without soaking the surrounding area.</li>
            <li>I use it in the living room, so it disperses throughout and I rarely get a whiff.</li>
            <li>Just buy some eucalyptus oil and diffuse/humidify the air to clear airways :)</li>
            <li>The timer and lights are great and it even has a little pitcher to fill it just right.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s priced a bit high but compared to the cheaper models or those priced slightly cheaper, this really was the best buy for me and my family.</li>
            <li>I have two other diffusers that I enjoy greatly that are much more stable and have lasted a long time with much use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all settings and it turns off at the right time.</li>
            <li>It sets the mood just right in my room</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quiet, easy to clean</li>
            <li>I use it for thieves oil mostly and will use it in the near future to make my house smell like Christmas :)  </li>
            <li>Great for a small 12x20 bedroom.</li>
            <li>This little diffuser works very well and is quite attractive.  </li>
            <li>And the color are nice if you want a little mood light.</li>
            <li>Other than that it does come with instructions in good English and works okay for the price.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the colored light feature, especially the choice of colors, and it doubles as her night light and diffuser.  </li>
            <li>My 18 year old son wants one for Christmas :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for diffusing the scent into one room, and if you&#x27;re trying to fill a big room or a house with an open layout, just put more drops of the essential oils.  </li>
            <li>But I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Other colors too bright and intense even on lower setting.</li>
            <li>Buttons are in back, and are super easy to use without even looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is quiet, the lights are very pretty and it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and they love the different lights.  </li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already sputtering water, DURING it&#x27;s first use.</li>
            <li>Cleaning and emptying water is a breeze, the unit is quiet and I love the lights.</li>
            <li>Better design would be a simple side plug in.</li>
            <li>It does seem to diffuse well...and it&#x27;s,a pretty design...</li>
            <li>so well he was willing to overlook the floral design.</li>
            <li>and I was able to add peppermint and keep it next to my bed</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty looks as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first for over a year with no problems.</li>
            <li>Purchased two more last month.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be larger and run for more than 3 hours at a time.  </li>
            <li>I am ready to order an additional one!</li>
            <li>The diffuser worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I like the lighting change options and 3 hours is ample time to diffuse my favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>I love mixing essential oils and having my room smell like lavender or peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>love the different colored lights feature.</li>
            <li>This is the first ultrasonic aroma diffuser that I have purchased after reading lots of review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing a couple more for different areas of the house.</li>
            <li>I have owned several types of diffusers and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>ADD scented oil,  you don&#x27;t need much!  </li>
            <li>I also love that when the water is running low, it doesn&#x27;t make noise like it&#x27;s dying out.  </li>
            <li>Looks pretty</li>
            <li>so you can fill the reservoir in the bottom and then screw the top part back on.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned in the title, this was my first diffuser.  </li>
            <li>But it does exactly what the description said.</li>
            <li>Love the choice of different colors.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the fact you can add essential oils.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>Pretty lights though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it does this because it was knocked off of my counter and the internal mechanisms were disrupted, so really it&#x27;s probably not the fault of the manufacturing.</li>
            <li>After reading many many reviews on different defusers, I was nervous about any of them lasting long, but I have used BriteLeafs for at least a hour every day since I received it and it has worked wonderfully every time.</li>
            <li>There are several different color settings and you can choose for them to bright or dimmer.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave the objects around it wet and works great with the essential oils I use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this a few days and so far it works great.</li>
            <li>I love the diffusers so much I decided to buy several for Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li>Really fills a room with the aroma of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>This works as good as my more expensive diffuser.  </li>
            <li>rarely use the light I bought it only for the diffuser</li>
            <li>The girls love the pale purple light.  </li>
            <li>These diffusers are so pretty and diffuse very proficiently.</li>
            <li>just a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li>I love this little Diffuser with the color options!I use it in my bedroom and it perfectly works as a humidifier by adding essential oil and also as a little lamp.</li>
            <li>Aesthetically, it is not my typical style, but I liked the specs and reviews.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used ours a ton over the last 4 months, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and is a great little aroma diffuser with multiple settings.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that something so small can put out so much steam, but it does great.</li>
            <li>I usually use this at night next to my bed, and rarely use the light feature, but it is nice that you can pick a color to suit your mood.</li>
            <li>I have only used my diffuser a couple of times but I am extremely pleased so far!  </li>
            <li>I REALLY like that you can set this diffuser to run for a certain length of time rather than it diffusing until it runs out of water.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for 2 years for something like this Very  Soothing and spa like&gt;</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Very cute and small.</li>
            <li>but I really like how compact it is</li>
            <li>I really like that I can turn on the light/colors or have them off.</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>The programmable run times, and light feature, and just extra bonuses.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect quite that much power</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser..</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
            <li>The lights are just an added plus to the whole package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very helpful with my allergies,</li>
            <li>Really makes for fool-proof use.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It puts out a good quantity of mist and has a pretty far reach considering how small it is.  </li>
            <li>It is a very compact size, but still is a powerhouse.</li>
            <li>It does so much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>My family absolutely loves the BriteLeafs Ultrasonic Aroma Diffuser</li>
            <li>The only thing I might like is for an option for the light to stay on after the timer runs out</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just perfect and overall, after few weeks, we are not using our regular humidifier anymore.</li>
            <li>I really like the color choices.</li>
            <li>Nice mist amount with several different time setting options.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and efficient and nicely handles a moderately sized room.</li>
            <li>can think only about one downside - there is one button that cycles light colors, which is OK for selecting the color itself, but to turn the light off you have to press the button several times (i.e. colors are bright white, low white, bright red, low red, bright green, low green and bright blue,</li>
            <li>Like the ability to shut the light off as that is not good for good deep sleep.</li>
            <li>it is very small but surprisingly puts out a lot of particles into the air</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much steam this little diffuser actually puts out and the aroma of the essential oils is great!</li>
            <li>This is the first defuser that I have used and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Love the different light colors and intensity as well as the option to have no light.  </li>
            <li>Still learning of new ways to use it!</li>
            <li>It works as advertised (although the product manual is kinda cute with all the odd translations).</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and asthetically pleasing to the eyes and the emotions.</li>
            <li>a steady stream  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and quiet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and cute enough to display in the living room soI&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing some additional scents to enjoy with y family</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Love this little diffuser for our bedroom.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite the little power house and puts out a lovely amount of mist.  </li>
            <li>Love this little powerhouse.</li>
            <li>I love this little item.  </li>
            <li>I think the pictures make it look a little cheapy, but it&#x27;s better when you see it in person.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this little thing.</li>
            <li>i bought this initially for a small room but decided to use it in a larger room and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Then it died, so it was a waste of money and now sells everywhere for more than the BriteLeafs.</li>
            <li>My only other concern is that the plastic will absorb the scents, so you won&#x27;t be able to get a clean scent when you switch to a different oil.</li>
            <li>You have to be right next to it.</li>
            <li>Chemical free:))Had it for a years still work like new.</li>
            <li>But I can live with</li>
            <li>It was good in the beginning but after a couple months it was hard to open and close.</li>
            <li>I use it almost daily and add essential oils to fit my mood.  </li>
            <li>it is nothing more than an expensive night light.</li>
            <li>When it was especially bad, I was breathing eucalyptus fumes directly from the opening (the vapor is slightly warm, pretty good for inhalation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is exactly what was discribed, and , since receiving, I have used it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>love adding different essential oils to create different aromas as well.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this diffuser and after buying it I have to say I totally agree with those customers who gave it a positive rating.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read directions first use is a little different then regular use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for a large open area though.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I also have one in my office and my living room near our entry way</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s just been something to look at and wonder when it will die...</li>
            <li>I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I received my product</li>
            <li>and you got a natural smell.</li>
            <li>Will be very helpful this winter with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Water levels are clearly marked on diffuser and pouring container.</li>
            <li>Though, I only use the blue and the regular light.</li>
            <li>and I can really smell my essential oils in my kitchen.  </li>
            <li>but it works very well with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>We purchased this diffuser as a replacement for my Young Living model which I ran into the ground after two years of use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for a small room, not sure how it would do in a bigger one.</li>
            <li>small note - since there is no water filter as on the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; humidifiers, it&#x27;s probably would be better to use distilled water from the local grocery store.</li>
            <li>One scents my entire living room even with high ceilings.  </li>
            <li>We have high ceiling and it still diffuse the EO through the entire room.</li>
            <li>low blue - so to turn off the light if you&#x27;re on the low white, you&#x27;ll have to press button 7 times).</li>
            <li>you can not go wrong with a product that has so many positive reviews</li>
            <li>This has worked exactly like I expected it to.</li>
            <li>One of the features that it has that isn&#x27;t found in some of the other diffusers is that you have the option to turn the light feature completely off (other than the power LED).  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s room in lieu of the $$$ Young Living branded diffusers to use with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I will probably be ordering a second one for my living room in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just started using this product, but the scent is barely detectable.  </li>
            <li>When it is plugged in I can smell the scent throughout my entire room as well as in near by rooms.  </li>
            <li>great for kids when sick.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed as I loved both the light and the scent of lavender that permeated the room until the day it stopped working.</li>
            <li>This is prettier then my other diffuser but doens&#x27;t put out as much.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re lucky if they last past a year</li>
            <li>It fills an average bedroom very well with your desired scent.  </li>
            <li>It works well just not long enouugh</li>
            <li>It barely put any type of scent in the room and after a short period of time stopped acting as a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>The directions were poorly translated but it&#x27;s easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>The only time I could smell anything is if I went right up to the small opening where the mist was coming out of.  </li>
            <li>This little machine works really well.  </li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Please Please Please get more in stock!!</li>
            <li> Colors are very nice.</li>
            <li> The timer works well - nice touch as well!</li>
            <li> Works great and looks good.</li>
            <li> and I love the colors and the design is perfect.</li>
            <li> The colors are pleasant and it&#x27;s lightweight to transport from room to room.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very happy with this.  </li>
            <li> It would be good if it was offered in a warmer tone as well.</li>
            <li> Good for desk or bedside use.</li>
            <li> Good directions.</li>
            <li> And it looks good too.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> It is a good size for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> Best for a nite-light, my daughter loves that she can choose the color of the light.</li>
            <li> and if you need a good inhale, just put your head by the diffuser and breath in.  </li>
            <li> I purchased and really loved the AromaSens Ultrasonic Diffuser from Puritan on sale for $39, but after 6-8 months it sputtered water, so I had to put it on a towel, and sometimes did not turn off.</li>
            <li> The included lavender oil is nice and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is cute and worked great for about 2 weeks (purchased Nov. 18th).  </li>
            <li> Great product I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> So it is very safe and you don&#x27;t have to remember to switch it off every time you are using it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> But the pluses of this model for me are the night light feature, the sonic plate, and the price!!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!</li>
            <li> They are cute and don&#x27;t take up a ton of room!  </li>
            <li> I love these!  </li>
            <li> Love the lights!</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser!  </li>
            <li> So that tells you how much I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, first time ever to use one, spouse advised me to get one.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> The smell from this unit is amazing too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just amazing</li>
            <li> I bought some lavender oil and it smells absolutely amazing and puts me at ease.</li>
            <li> but it is a nice touch to see that the unit is on.</li>
            <li> They are also durable, and stay looking nice on the inside and out after months of use.  </li>
            <li> I liked the aromatherapy humidifier.</li>
            <li> it is so nice not to have to keep an eye on it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t match the warm colors of my decor.</li>
            <li> For the price I really think this is the best diffuser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The time settings are a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser and works well.</li>
            <li> I now own three.</li>
            <li> More affordable than comparable models and more attractive.</li>
            <li> It fills up my living room &amp; dining room nicely.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a diffuser that really &amp;#34;diffuses&amp;#34;, I think this is not the best product.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these units and they have been working nicely for a week.</li>
            <li> It  works great!I highly recommend this product!Thank you for this excellent product!</li>
            <li> The light makes for a great night light!</li>
            <li> but It arrived quickly and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It would easily fill a bedroom or kitchen with good fragrances.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, comes with a container for measuring/pouring water.</li>
            <li> This ultrasonic diffuser is very pretty and works great.</li>
            <li> You can add your own aromatherapy oils I love orange, tangerine and lime or lavander.</li>
            <li> It puts out a lot of steam and has a bright light as well.</li>
            <li> I had been using the old style filter type, and the filter in no way compares to this excellent diffuser.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very impressed with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, pleasant light.</li>
            <li> Also, this diffuser omits a very light stream, so having a fan on will disperse it and not concentrate it in one spot.  </li>
            <li> This works great and what I like most is that it is pretty and has color</li>
            <li> so it smells fresh and pleasant when guests enter our home.</li>
            <li> Great to turn your bedroom into pure bliss.</li>
            <li> Time will tell how well it holds up to our oils :)</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I noticed that I LOVE is how my clothes and sheets smell in my room.</li>
            <li> , I love the mist and how it works.  </li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser is so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love the timer with it.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t really be able to smell it.  </li>
            <li> Totally love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Sleeping and breathing much better at night.  </li>
            <li> but I love the look</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love the changing lights.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute</li>
            <li> and I love my humidifier</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> There are many choices for a mid-range priced diffuser, but I gave this one a try.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so pleased.  </li>
            <li> I also love the auto shut-off that&#x27;s built in.</li>
            <li> Another reason I chose this diffuser over some of the others was the fact that the use of oils was okay - some diffusers specifically state that oils cannot be used.  </li>
            <li> Been impressed with with the mist/steam used with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Love this for by my bed</li>
            <li> This diffuser is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these diffusers and LOVE THEM.  </li>
            <li> I love the option to change colors or just leave it off if I&#x27;m going to sleep.</li>
            <li> LOVE it, would like to buy 4 more.</li>
            <li> Light can be turned off which is nice if you plan on using at bedtime.</li>
            <li> The product not only adds moisture to the air but also adds a great aroma!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this lovely diffuser for my daughter&#x27;s bedroom to diffuse lavender at night.  </li>
            <li> We wanted something comparable but more affordable.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am going to get two more.</li>
            <li> It delivers great scent and is very calming.</li>
            <li> I really love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> thinking of getting one for each of my kids rooms this winter :)</li>
            <li> I love using it.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use citrus oils with this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Just got this item today and we are already enjoying the aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Second button is for the colored light, which has a bright and dim feature, great options, pleasant colors; I prefer to have the light off most of the time, so it&#x27;s great to have that option.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean, very pretty and does a great job at diffusing.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has a timer, and it&#x27;s so easy to change the water and it looks cute as well.</li>
            <li> Does not do much as humidifier - for the room that is, but I used it successfully to mist my orchid.</li>
            <li> They are great little workers and keep my house smelling great.  </li>
            <li> This is especially nice when using in a bedroom and don&#x27;t want extra light at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four different cool diffusers and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> and I love that I can use it as a accent light or night light.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> You turn it on and almost immediately, a light mist starts coming out of the top with the scent of whatever you put in it.</li>
            <li> feels a bit cheap, works ok</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s done a great job.</li>
            <li> works great so far.</li>
            <li> Light function is pretty good too and we&#x27;re using the lamp as night stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love how the light changes.</li>
            <li> This is a cute little guy, perfect for work or at a desk.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a lot longer, but compared to other reviews I&#x27;ve been very happy with all of the functions.  </li>
            <li> Nicely made,  good quality, pretty and works very well.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to understand.</li>
            <li> It holds 100ml of water-based solution (drops of the oils are placed in the water bath), and the mist stream is easily visible.</li>
            <li> So easy and quit to run.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and refill.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The set up is easy with easy instructions on how to operated this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> And can easily be brought into the living room or kitchen.</li>
            <li> easy to use and efficient.  </li>
            <li> Easy to figure out how to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy instructions.</li>
            <li> Almost a week of use, and still going strong.</li>
            <li> and I had to turn the diffuser off because it was so strong</li>
            <li> Nice and pretty, effective as a diffuser (though changing from one essential oil to another requires good cleaning of water reservoir</li>
            <li> Quiet and puts out a nice fine mist with a good amount of scent.</li>
            <li> First of I would like to say that this an amazing product.</li>
            <li> But it works fine.</li>
            <li> received my Ultrasonic and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to operate, and works fine.</li>
            <li> My family and I love this diffuser very much!  </li>
            <li> It turns out that the aesthetic is actually very sweet, and this is the best darn little diffuser around, perhaps!  </li>
            <li> This little Diffuser is perfect!!</li>
            <li> This is little and perfect for aromatherapy and a humidifier.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of them for over a hundred dollar it would be hard to image them working any better than this one I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Works great to diffuse essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Great product, have used it constantly!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I anticipated, but it does a great job filling the room with fragrance.</li>
            <li> They needed a night light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> the timer works like a charm and it really does a nice job of diffusing the oils.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser, I&#x27;ve only had it a week</li>
            <li> My husband and my cat both enjoy it with me.</li>
            <li> Also, I like the variety of colors for the light.</li>
            <li> Each colored light dims too for a softer color</li>
            <li> Also there is a light setting that allows you to change the color of the humidifier to whatever color mood setting you want.</li>
            <li> I have to say I received this free to review it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves changing the light colors.</li>
            <li> has two buttons, one to turn on (and select time) and one for the light.</li>
            <li> Have had this for only 2 weeks but so far love it - great buy!</li>
            <li> You also have the option of leaving the light off.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery with nice and neat packaging.</li>
            <li> so I can use it for a night light, but the light goes off when the diffuser shuts off.  </li>
            <li> Hold the &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; button until it beeps on, press it to see the light move to the 30, 60, 120, or 180 min timer.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to the use of my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Easy fill,easy clean.</li>
            <li> would have given this diffuser a 5-star rating, but it has started making a \\&quot;whirring\\&quot; sound when I turn it on</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a couple of weeks and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, after a month of frequent use works great!</li>
            <li> A really good product so far.</li>
            <li> It doesnt create to strong of a scent perfect for small to medium rooms.</li>
            <li> The colors are lovely and the way the scent comes out is just right..</li>
            <li> I plugged it in, added water &amp; oils &amp; am enjoying it right now.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and I love that you can choose to dim each light color for a softer effect.</li>
            <li> it also lights up very nicely and changes to a lot of different colors</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Loved my first one so much bought one for a gift.</li>
            <li> Pretty lights though, I am using it more as a night light.</li>
            <li> He was excited about the 100ml container for adding the water.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this will get returned tonight.&lt;br /&gt;Photo attached for size comparison</li>
            <li> Great dispersed aroma, fun night light, and very quiet while working.</li>
            <li> I ordered this diffuser after my original (another brand) diffuser stopped working.  </li>
            <li> , I am pleased with the unit, and I&#x27;d probably purchase another one because it is so pretty</li>
            <li> Allergy season is upon us and we are looking for ways to clean and improve the air in our home.</li>
            <li> This emits the perfect amount of light for late night feedings.  </li>
            <li> The light is bright, cool, whitish blue color.  </li>
            <li> The price is more than fair compared to all the other diffusers out there.  </li>
            <li> It works well, does almost two full rounds of 180 minute runs without refilling.  </li>
            <li> Now when I walk in, it smells much better and with continued use, the place will really smell like me.</li>
            <li> I wrote a full review here:  </li>
            <li> Fun light colors.</li>
            <li> Makes using my oils simple and the entire house smells great!</li>
            <li> The scent fills the room quickly.</li>
            <li> The diffuser arrived earlier today &amp; although smaller than I imagined, it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> kids love the different color lighting choices, and I love the automatic shut</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t absolutely love is that you can&#x27;t run it for more than 3 hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the diffuser very much.  </li>
            <li> The timer function is very nice and it is much safer than having a candle, especially with kids in the house.</li>
            <li> When I first plugged this one in the mist seemed so light</li>
            <li> My nearly 17 year old son is using the one I bought, and he would have liked something more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but it works</li>
            <li> It is a very pretty lamp.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and efficient.</li>
            <li> It feels like pretty cheap plastic</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts for a good long time.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use and very quite</li>
            <li> It really puts the scent in the air quickly and strong.</li>
            <li> Worked great - exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fill and love the multiple times that can be selected.</li>
            <li> This is a great little unit and is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is great, amazing what such a little contraption can do.  </li>
            <li> Each color has a bright or dim setting so if you prefer low light, there is that option.</li>
            <li> If you buy cheap synthetic oil, don&#x27;t expect your room to smell much.</li>
            <li> My daugter loves the different color lights and can work the lights and timers on her own.</li>
            <li> so so glad I ventured out to give this one a try; it by far beats my friend&#x27;s diffuser.</li>
            <li> The different colored lights are a nice effect too.</li>
            <li> For the price it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I would say this diffuser is worth while.</li>
            <li> It works as well as described and is really fun to use.</li>
            <li> Love the timer settings as well as the settings for the different level of light output.</li>
            <li> Improved my sinus congestion in several days, now I use it every night,  breathing better since, also the night light is useful for my newborn baby</li>
            <li> The cord gets really warm when in use, so it&#x27;s been benched as a possible fire hazard.</li>
            <li> It outputs just enough mist to get a nice aroma without soaking the surrounding area.</li>
            <li> I use it in the living room, so it disperses throughout and I rarely get a whiff.</li>
            <li> Just buy some eucalyptus oil and diffuse/humidify the air to clear airways :)</li>
            <li> The timer and lights are great and it even has a little pitcher to fill it just right.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s priced a bit high but compared to the cheaper models or those priced slightly cheaper, this really was the best buy for me and my family.</li>
            <li> I have two other diffusers that I enjoy greatly that are much more stable and have lasted a long time with much use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all settings and it turns off at the right time.</li>
            <li> It sets the mood just right in my room</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quiet, easy to clean</li>
            <li> I use it for thieves oil mostly and will use it in the near future to make my house smell like Christmas :)  </li>
            <li> Great for a small 12x20 bedroom.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser works very well and is quite attractive.  </li>
            <li> And the color are nice if you want a little mood light.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does come with instructions in good English and works okay for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the colored light feature, especially the choice of colors, and it doubles as her night light and diffuser.  </li>
            <li> My 18 year old son wants one for Christmas :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for diffusing the scent into one room, and if you&#x27;re trying to fill a big room or a house with an open layout, just put more drops of the essential oils.  </li>
            <li> But I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Other colors too bright and intense even on lower setting.</li>
            <li> Buttons are in back, and are super easy to use without even looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is quiet, the lights are very pretty and it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and they love the different lights.  </li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already sputtering water, DURING it&#x27;s first use.</li>
            <li> Cleaning and emptying water is a breeze, the unit is quiet and I love the lights.</li>
            <li> Better design would be a simple side plug in.</li>
            <li> It does seem to diffuse well...and it&#x27;s,a pretty design...</li>
            <li> so well he was willing to overlook the floral design.</li>
            <li> and I was able to add peppermint and keep it next to my bed</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty looks as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first for over a year with no problems.</li>
            <li> Purchased two more last month.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be larger and run for more than 3 hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> I am ready to order an additional one!</li>
            <li> The diffuser worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like the lighting change options and 3 hours is ample time to diffuse my favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> I love mixing essential oils and having my room smell like lavender or peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> love the different colored lights feature.</li>
            <li> This is the first ultrasonic aroma diffuser that I have purchased after reading lots of review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing a couple more for different areas of the house.</li>
            <li> I have owned several types of diffusers and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> ADD scented oil,  you don&#x27;t need much!  </li>
            <li> I also love that when the water is running low, it doesn&#x27;t make noise like it&#x27;s dying out.  </li>
            <li> Looks pretty</li>
            <li> so you can fill the reservoir in the bottom and then screw the top part back on.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned in the title, this was my first diffuser.  </li>
            <li> But it does exactly what the description said.</li>
            <li> Love the choice of different colors.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the fact you can add essential oils.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> Pretty lights though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it does this because it was knocked off of my counter and the internal mechanisms were disrupted, so really it&#x27;s probably not the fault of the manufacturing.</li>
            <li> After reading many many reviews on different defusers, I was nervous about any of them lasting long, but I have used BriteLeafs for at least a hour every day since I received it and it has worked wonderfully every time.</li>
            <li> There are several different color settings and you can choose for them to bright or dimmer.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave the objects around it wet and works great with the essential oils I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few days and so far it works great.</li>
            <li> I love the diffusers so much I decided to buy several for Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li> Really fills a room with the aroma of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> This works as good as my more expensive diffuser.  </li>
            <li> rarely use the light I bought it only for the diffuser</li>
            <li> The girls love the pale purple light.  </li>
            <li> These diffusers are so pretty and diffuse very proficiently.</li>
            <li> just a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li> I love this little Diffuser with the color options!I use it in my bedroom and it perfectly works as a humidifier by adding essential oil and also as a little lamp.</li>
            <li> Aesthetically, it is not my typical style, but I liked the specs and reviews.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used ours a ton over the last 4 months, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described and is a great little aroma diffuser with multiple settings.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that something so small can put out so much steam, but it does great.</li>
            <li> I usually use this at night next to my bed, and rarely use the light feature, but it is nice that you can pick a color to suit your mood.</li>
            <li> I have only used my diffuser a couple of times but I am extremely pleased so far!  </li>
            <li> I REALLY like that you can set this diffuser to run for a certain length of time rather than it diffusing until it runs out of water.  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for 2 years for something like this Very  Soothing and spa like&gt;</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Very cute and small.</li>
            <li> but I really like how compact it is</li>
            <li> I really like that I can turn on the light/colors or have them off.</li>
            <li> I expected more.</li>
            <li> The programmable run times, and light feature, and just extra bonuses.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect quite that much power</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser..</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
            <li> The lights are just an added plus to the whole package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very helpful with my allergies,</li>
            <li> Really makes for fool-proof use.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It puts out a good quantity of mist and has a pretty far reach considering how small it is.  </li>
            <li> It is a very compact size, but still is a powerhouse.</li>
            <li> It does so much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> My family absolutely loves the BriteLeafs Ultrasonic Aroma Diffuser</li>
            <li> The only thing I might like is for an option for the light to stay on after the timer runs out</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just perfect and overall, after few weeks, we are not using our regular humidifier anymore.</li>
            <li> I really like the color choices.</li>
            <li> Nice mist amount with several different time setting options.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and efficient and nicely handles a moderately sized room.</li>
            <li> can think only about one downside - there is one button that cycles light colors, which is OK for selecting the color itself, but to turn the light off you have to press the button several times (i.e. colors are bright white, low white, bright red, low red, bright green, low green and bright blue,</li>
            <li> Like the ability to shut the light off as that is not good for good deep sleep.</li>
            <li> it is very small but surprisingly puts out a lot of particles into the air</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much steam this little diffuser actually puts out and the aroma of the essential oils is great!</li>
            <li> This is the first defuser that I have used and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Love the different light colors and intensity as well as the option to have no light.  </li>
            <li> Still learning of new ways to use it!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised (although the product manual is kinda cute with all the odd translations).</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and asthetically pleasing to the eyes and the emotions.</li>
            <li> a steady stream  </li>
            <li> Very pretty and quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and cute enough to display in the living room soI&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing some additional scents to enjoy with y family</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this little diffuser for our bedroom.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite the little power house and puts out a lovely amount of mist.  </li>
            <li> Love this little powerhouse.</li>
            <li> I love this little item.  </li>
            <li> I think the pictures make it look a little cheapy, but it&#x27;s better when you see it in person.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this little thing.</li>
            <li> i bought this initially for a small room but decided to use it in a larger room and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Then it died, so it was a waste of money and now sells everywhere for more than the BriteLeafs.</li>
            <li> My only other concern is that the plastic will absorb the scents, so you won&#x27;t be able to get a clean scent when you switch to a different oil.</li>
            <li> You have to be right next to it.</li>
            <li> Chemical free:))Had it for a years still work like new.</li>
            <li> But I can live with</li>
            <li> It was good in the beginning but after a couple months it was hard to open and close.</li>
            <li> I use it almost daily and add essential oils to fit my mood.  </li>
            <li> it is nothing more than an expensive night light.</li>
            <li> When it was especially bad, I was breathing eucalyptus fumes directly from the opening (the vapor is slightly warm, pretty good for inhalation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is exactly what was discribed, and , since receiving, I have used it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> love adding different essential oils to create different aromas as well.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this diffuser and after buying it I have to say I totally agree with those customers who gave it a positive rating.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read directions first use is a little different then regular use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for a large open area though.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I also have one in my office and my living room near our entry way</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s just been something to look at and wonder when it will die...</li>
            <li> I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I received my product</li>
            <li> and you got a natural smell.</li>
            <li> Will be very helpful this winter with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Water levels are clearly marked on diffuser and pouring container.</li>
            <li> Though, I only use the blue and the regular light.</li>
            <li> and I can really smell my essential oils in my kitchen.  </li>
            <li> but it works very well with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> We purchased this diffuser as a replacement for my Young Living model which I ran into the ground after two years of use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for a small room, not sure how it would do in a bigger one.</li>
            <li> small note - since there is no water filter as on the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; humidifiers, it&#x27;s probably would be better to use distilled water from the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> One scents my entire living room even with high ceilings.  </li>
            <li> We have high ceiling and it still diffuse the EO through the entire room.</li>
            <li> low blue - so to turn off the light if you&#x27;re on the low white, you&#x27;ll have to press button 7 times).</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong with a product that has so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> This has worked exactly like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> One of the features that it has that isn&#x27;t found in some of the other diffusers is that you have the option to turn the light feature completely off (other than the power LED).  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s room in lieu of the $$$ Young Living branded diffusers to use with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I will probably be ordering a second one for my living room in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but the scent is barely detectable.  </li>
            <li> When it is plugged in I can smell the scent throughout my entire room as well as in near by rooms.  </li>
            <li> great for kids when sick.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as I loved both the light and the scent of lavender that permeated the room until the day it stopped working.</li>
            <li> This is prettier then my other diffuser but doens&#x27;t put out as much.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re lucky if they last past a year</li>
            <li> It fills an average bedroom very well with your desired scent.  </li>
            <li> It works well just not long enouugh</li>
            <li> It barely put any type of scent in the room and after a short period of time stopped acting as a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> The directions were poorly translated but it&#x27;s easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> The only time I could smell anything is if I went right up to the small opening where the mist was coming out of.  </li>
            <li> This little machine works really well.  </li>
            <li> It took me awhile to figure out to hold down the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button to get to the longer diffuse times, and it still haven&#x27;t really figured out how long each one lasts.  </li>
            <li> Instructions were weird (translated from another language apparently) but the machine is easy to figure out and to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact, takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> The third night, after I filled it with the proper amounts of water and oil and attempted to turn it on, it failed to turn on.</li>
            <li> As long as there&#x27;s still water left in the reservoir it will run again.  </li>
            <li> The other one is larger and was more expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple times with different amounts of water and oil and it never really produced any scent.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> this diffuser is much smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> i expected something very different.</li>
            <li> My young living one died after just a few months.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s minor inconvenience</li>
            <li> The directions were a little too much for such a small thing.</li>
            <li> By adding your favorite essential oil you get both the relaxing effects of aromatherapy as well as humidified air which is extra beneficial for this cold winter!</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to remove the top to put the water in; maybe it will become easier as I use the unit.  </li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research into diffusers I noticed from comments that the lifespan on the diffusers aren&#x27;t very long.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wake up with dry nose</li>
            <li> The square footage is limited.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a small room diffuser that allows you to use Essential Oils, look no further!  </li>
            <li> It makes a very quiet hum and slight bubbling</li>
            <li> This little diffuser takes fewer drops of essential oil to get the aroma needed for therapeutic aromatherapy, and the water lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Its just a little smaller than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Too bad since it&#x27;s adorable.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to overfill it though</li>
            <li> it switches off when the water tank is empty....</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> it is not very well made for the price.</li>
            <li> Has worked well for a few months of daily night time usage.</li>
            <li> What a waste of essential</li>
            <li> The 100 mL container of water is enough for quite a few extended uses.</li>
            <li> This has even helped me feel better when sick.</li>
            <li> Other than the leakage</li>
            <li> Other than&lt;</li>
            <li> I would buy this product again, and still may, for other rooms in the house.</li>
            <li> and I put lemongrass in the other.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> We priced out several of these type of  products and for the value it performs satisfactory for a small bedroom (9 X 12 ft.)</li>
            <li> The mist is very minimal.</li>
            <li> I moved my massage business into an office that had been closed up for over a year and had previously been used for nails and hair.</li>
            <li> It has had round the clock action for the past few weeks, and it is holding up well to that challenge.  </li>
            <li> complaints about the water coming out when you tip it and other design issues are simply a matter of common sense.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s about as wide as the cans that beans or soup come in and a little taller.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is also a little weak - it doesn&#x27;t push the air very far upward.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure how long it will hold up once the oils get inside the transducer.</li>
            <li> To me, that is the only negative.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I just know it started leaking water from the base of the unit and wouldn&#x27;t blow diffused moist air out of the top any longer.</li>
            <li> and I needed them to settle down at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> When I turn it on in my living room I can smell it all the way down the hall and into a couple of our bedrooms.</li>
            <li> I use it in my office, which is a good-sized space, and I have people coming in from the hallway all the time because it spreads the oil fragrance all the way out the door and down the hall.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestions would be to indicate what the lights mean when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li> Quit working less than three weeks after purchasing.</li>
            <li> I expected it to diffuse the air in a small room in my place with the scent of eucalyptus oil.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a little less than 4oz.</li>
            <li> Make certain to use quality essential oils, and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle: the base clicks in</li>
            <li> This little diffuser/humidifier works like a champ.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy always fall asleep when the timer stop.</li>
            <li> Annoying to keep pressing the button to turn the light off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this diffuser after an issue with a cheaper Green Air brand diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday since I received it.</li>
            <li> We have been using it everyday for a month and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser now for a few weeks with no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I did carefully relocate it from one room to another, but if it&#x27;s that delicate that you can&#x27;t move it, then that&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The max time is 180 minutes, and it usually doesn&#x27;t use up all the water in the 100 ml tank.  </li>
            <li> My friend has an expensive diffuser from an essential oil company and I am so</li>
            <li> Then it started leaking from the bottom :/  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly small.</li>
            <li> No matter what I tried, it was useless; the device had simply died.</li>
            <li> It is small.</li>
            <li> Its small</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m hesitant to buy another, because honestly I&#x27;m not sure why this one died.</li>
            <li> I also usually use it a couple times during the day.  </li>
            <li> Also I like how it has a timer up to 180 minutes and turns itself off when no more water is present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s small as for &amp;#34;full-size&amp;#34; humidifier, but as aroma lamp</li>
            <li> and usually I&#x27;m just unplugging the lamp from the wall socket, when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lamp consumes small amount of water, so it won&#x27;t cost you a fortune.</li>
            <li> The smell does seem to linger on the water tank and cover, but I&#x27;ve been wiping them down after each use and so far it hasn&#x27;t been too bad.</li>
            <li> the instructions are written in very poor english.</li>
            <li> Should have believed all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is to noisy too keep close to you at night time at least for me.</li>
            <li> I also hope the negative Ions help to improve seasonal depression.</li>
            <li> Not good if you want it beside your bed for congestion</li>
            <li> Recently we (all the family) caught a quite nasty cold and this thing was really helpful.</li>
            <li> Directions with the Diffuser were very confusing.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I broke it after it tipped over and water went into the little exhaust</li>
            <li> I wish the lights would cycle randomly</li>
            <li> Needless to say, some odors remained.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving a negative review, but I was so disappointed when this diffuser died on me 5 weeks after purchasing.</li>
            <li> While I was there the children got a really bad cold.  </li>
            <li> I put in probably 10-12 drops and the smell is still very faint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived just as I got sick</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with the fragility of this item.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really disappointed that it is rubbing off...</li>
            <li> I hated to spend $50</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is very easy to use and I love that you can choose to dim each light color for a softer effect.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far. My daugter loves the different color lights and can work the lights and timers on her own. Time will tell how well it holds up to our oils :)</li>
            <li> Works well. Smaller than I expected. Annoying to keep pressing the button to turn the light off.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s room in lieu of the $$$ Young Living branded diffusers to use with essential oils.  My daughter loves the colored light feature, especially the choice of colors, and it doubles as her night light and diffuser.  Easy to use, very happy with this.  If you are looking for one that stays on all night or until the water level is depleted, this isn&#x27;t for you.  The max time is 180 minutes, and it usually doesn&#x27;t use up all the water in the 100 ml tank.  But the pluses of this model for me are the night light feature, the sonic plate, and the price!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. So far, so good. The instructions were easy to understand. He was excited about the 100ml container for adding the water.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the diffuser very much.  It is quiet, the lights are very pretty and it is easy to use.  I will buy the same one again for upstairs.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised (although the product manual is kinda cute with all the odd translations). I wish the lights would cycle randomly but it is a nice touch to see that the unit is on. The timer works well - nice touch as well! It holds 100ml of water-based solution (drops of the oils are placed in the water bath), and the mist stream is easily visible. Im not sure how long it will hold up once the oils get inside the transducer. The included lavender oil is nice and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Loved my first one so much bought one for a gift. So easy and quit to run. Love it</li>
            <li> This is my second diffuser from this company. I love the diffusers so much I decided to buy several for Christmas presents.  These diffusers are so pretty and diffuse very proficiently. One scents my entire living room even with high ceilings.  They are also durable, and stay looking nice on the inside and out after months of use.  One thing I noticed that I LOVE is how my clothes and sheets smell in my room. With this diffuser, I can smell the essentials in my clothes and sheets the second I walk in my room. This company has the best customer service I have ever experienced. I just keep coming back. My friend has an expensive diffuser from an essential oil company and I am so so so glad I ventured out to give this one a try; it by far beats my friend&#x27;s diffuser. The colors are vibrant and asthetically pleasing to the eyes and the emotions. Thank you for another amazing diffuser!!!</li>
            <li> Quit working less than three weeks after purchasing. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great price and product!  Works great to diffuse essential oils.  The different colored lights are a nice effect too.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. It works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is cute and worked great for about 2 weeks (purchased Nov. 18th).  Then it started leaking from the bottom :/  Other than the leakage, I love the mist and how it works.  Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used it constantly! Really fills a room with the aroma of your favorite essential oil. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with the fragility of this item. I have two other diffusers that I enjoy greatly that are much more stable and have lasted a long time with much use. This one stopped working the third time we used it. REALYY, do not tip it , at all!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  I have never had one to compare it to though.  It was a lot smaller than I anticipated, but it does a great job filling the room with fragrance.</li>
            <li> this is an awesome product, it works great and love the colors!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! I love that it has a timer, and it&#x27;s so easy to change the water and it looks cute as well.</li>
            <li> This little Diffuser is perfect!! Great for relaxation. You can add your own aromatherapy oils I love orange, tangerine and lime or lavander. It doesnt create to strong of a scent perfect for small to medium rooms. Great product I LOVE IT I have been looking for 2 years for something like this Very  Soothing and spa like&gt;Great to turn your bedroom into pure bliss.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these diffusers and also ordered one for my sister for her birthday.  They are cute and don&#x27;t take up a ton of room!  I keep one on my nightstand with a relaxing, sleepy blend.  I also have one in my office and my living room near our entry way so it smells fresh and pleasant when guests enter our home.</li>
            <li> I love these!  I purchased three and then a fourth.  It works well, does almost two full rounds of 180 minute runs without refilling.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an item similar to this.  My girls (twins) are in the same room so I use a slumber essential oil with the diffuser and they love the different lights.  They needed a night light and I needed them to settle down at bedtime.  Works well for both instances!</li>
            <li> I have bought 6 of these in the last year 2 for home and family gifts...love to diffuse lemongrass and lavender in mine....great product!!</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and I bought it based on reviews.  It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean, very pretty and does a great job at diffusing.  I&#x27;m surprised that something so small can put out so much steam, but it does great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly small. I&#x27;ve used it once with doTerra oils and it&#x27;s making my throat itch. Never had that happen before. Thought this was supposed to help but so far it&#x27;s just been something to look at and wonder when it will die... It&#x27;s already sputtering water, DURING it&#x27;s first use. Pretty sure this will get returned tonight.&lt;br /&gt;Photo attached for size comparison</li>
            <li> It was good in the beginning but after a couple months it was hard to open and close.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser this is the second one I bought so we don&#x27;t have to move the one we have around</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Great Purchase!</li>
            <li> I ordered this diffuser after an issue with a cheaper Green Air brand diffuser. This diffuser is so much better. Cleaning and emptying water is a breeze, the unit is quiet and I love the lights. The smell from this unit is amazing too. When I turn it on in my living room I can smell it all the way down the hall and into a couple of our bedrooms. When I first plugged this one in the mist seemed so light but it gets stronger after running for a bit. There are several different color settings and you can choose for them to bright or dimmer.  This emits the perfect amount of light for late night feedings.  I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Almost a week of use, and still going strong. For the price it is well worth it. Thinking of ordering another.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much steam this little diffuser actually puts out and the aroma of the essential oils is great!</li>
            <li> The colors are pleasant and it&#x27;s lightweight to transport from room to room. Also there is no way for the water or oil to get to the motor. Easy to use and refill.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. My daughter sent me oils for my birthday and this has been an excellent addition to use with them.</li>
            <li> I liked the aromatherapy humidifier.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser for my daughter.  While I was there the children got a really bad cold.  We got out the diffuser and began diffusing using  our essential oils.  We had it in the back bedroom and the aroma went all through the house.  This is a wonderful diffuser.  The girls love the pale purple light.  This works as good as my more expensive diffuser.  I am going to buy one to have a second diffuser for my bedroom.  Easy to fill and love the multiple times that can be selected.</li>
            <li> Nicely made,  good quality, pretty and works very well.  Would like lighter and softer lighting  by several shades and only use the periwinkle blue  on low setting because of this. Other colors too bright and intense even on lower setting. Fiddly cord that runs underneath and must be placed into a notch. Better design would be a simple side plug in.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday since I received it. Great dispersed aroma, fun night light, and very quiet while working. I will consider buying another one in the future!</li>
            <li> Great product! Very cute and small. Works great. I love the timer with it. Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this little diffuser for our bedroom.  My only suggestions would be to indicate what the lights mean when you turn it on.  It took me awhile to figure out to hold down the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button to get to the longer diffuse times, and it still haven&#x27;t really figured out how long each one lasts.  Also, this diffuser omits a very light stream, so having a fan on will disperse it and not concentrate it in one spot.  Not good if you want it beside your bed for congestion and you have your ceiling fan on...you won&#x27;t really be able to smell it.  Love the lights!</li>
            <li> Totally love this diffuser. it is so nice not to have to keep an eye on it. the timer works like a charm and it really does a nice job of diffusing the oils. i bought this initially for a small room but decided to use it in a larger room and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Directions with the Diffuser were very confusing.  Figured out how to use it after a day!  Other than&lt;br /&gt;this I would say this diffuser is worth while.</li>
            <li> It is great, amazing what such a little contraption can do.  Sleeping and breathing much better at night.  Giving these for Christmas presents this year!</li>
            <li> Great item, price, and looks good!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  I use it with lavender next to my bed at night.  I also do on guard during the day sometimes.  Still learning of new ways to use it!</li>
            <li> Nice and pretty, effective as a diffuser (though changing from one essential oil to another requires good cleaning of water reservoir and it&#x27;s a bit tricky since you can not submerge it in water). Does not do much as humidifier - for the room that is, but I used it successfully to mist my orchid.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Works great and looks good. Be careful not to overfill it though (there&#x27;s a max fill line). We&#x27;ve used ours a ton over the last 4 months, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser works very well and is quite attractive.  I plan to order a second one for a second bedroom.  I appreciate the company&#x27;s timely customer satisfaction follow-up!</li>
            <li> Great diffuser, I&#x27;ve only had it a week but I really like how compact it is, I can set it anywhere and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.  I really like that I can turn on the light/colors or have them off.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but I love the look and it does a great job for our bedroom.</li>
            <li> I used this diffuser for two nights. The third night, after I filled it with the proper amounts of water and oil and attempted to turn it on, it failed to turn on. No matter what I tried, it was useless; the device had simply died. I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this diffuser and after buying it I have to say I totally agree with those customers who gave it a positive rating. It works as well as described and is really fun to use. The colors are lovely and the way the scent comes out is just right.. My husband and my cat both enjoy it with me. The price is right and the quality is great. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it every night with my doterra oils.</li>
            <li> This is little and perfect for aromatherapy and a humidifier. Also, I like the variety of colors for the light. The directions were a little too much for such a small thing.</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser!  I use it almost daily and add essential oils to fit my mood.  It&#x27;s super quiet, easy to clean and I love the changing lights.  Each colored light dims too for a softer color</li>
            <li> great for the job I had in mind.  Need to buy a bigger one though for the living room.</li>
            <li> This has worked exactly like I expected it to. It fills an average bedroom very well with your desired scent.  It doesn&#x27;t work for a large open area though. The timer function is very nice and it is much safer than having a candle, especially with kids in the house.</li>
            <li> I never ever write reviews. So that tells you how much I love this thing! It&#x27;s so cute and it is easy to use. I&#x27;ve had it 2 or 3 weeks now and it works great. I&#x27;m thinking about buying an extra just to keep. We have high ceiling and it still diffuse the EO through the entire room. Love it!</li>
            <li> First of I would like to say that this an amazing product. The set up is easy with easy instructions on how to operated this product. I just fill the cup with the correct amount of water and, I pour in it the ultrasonic aromatherapy aroma diffuser humidifier  then I put a drop if whatever oil i want to relax with. Within a minute I can see vapor and smell my relaxing aroma fragrance. It also has a setting that allows you to control the time spans of the ultrasonic aromatherapy aroma diffuser humidifier. Also there is a light setting that allows you to change the color of the humidifier to whatever color mood setting you want. It&#x27;s just amazing and I love my humidifier I give it all stars.... It&#x27;s Great!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only had this for six hours. As soon as I used it...the design started rubbing off. The time indicators are rubbed off already,as well. It does seem to diffuse well...and it&#x27;s,a pretty design...but I&#x27;m really disappointed that it is rubbing off... I expected more.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. I also put one on my Christmas list. I love it! It humidifies the air in my bedroom and makes it smell wonderful! I will probably be ordering a second one for my living room in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. By adding your favorite essential oil you get both the relaxing effects of aromatherapy as well as humidified air which is extra beneficial for this cold winter!</li>
            <li> This little machine works really well.  I will definitely be buying another one soon. We have been using it everyday for a month and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser/humidifier works like a champ.  The programmable run times, and light feature, and just extra bonuses.  Wish it came in different styles.  My nearly 17 year old son is using the one I bought, and he would have liked something more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but it works so well he was willing to overlook the floral design.</li>
            <li> I have to say I received this free to review it.  It puts out a lot of steam and has a bright light as well. The light is bright, cool, whitish blue color.  It would be good if it was offered in a warmer tone as well. It doesn&#x27;t match the warm colors of my decor. But it works fine.</li>
            <li> I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I received my product it is very small but surprisingly puts out a lot of particles into the air a steady stream  it also lights up very nicely and changes to a lot of different colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely use the light I bought it only for the diffuser I saw a lot of them for over a hundred dollar it would be hard to image them working any better than this one I am very happy with my purchase you can not go wrong with a product that has so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> Love this product. Easy to use and clean up. Makes using my oils simple and the entire house smells great!</li>
            <li> This works great and what I like most is that it is pretty and has color options.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived just as I got sick and I was able to add peppermint and keep it next to my bed&lt;br /&gt;and help my sinuses.  I have gotten compliments on it in my livingroom for it&#x27;s pretty looks as well</li>
            <li> Definitely does not make a room smell. You have to be right next to it. Good for desk or bedside use.</li>
            <li> Doing what it&#x27;s supposed to!!Just add couple of drops of essential oil, and water and you got a natural smell.Chemical free:))Had it for a years still work like new.It&#x27;s a little noisy always fall asleep when the timer stop.And the color are nice if you want a little mood light.</li>
            <li> There are many choices for a mid-range priced diffuser, but I gave this one a try.  Aesthetically, it is not my typical style, but I liked the specs and reviews.  It turns out that the aesthetic is actually very sweet, and this is the best darn little diffuser around, perhaps!  It has had round the clock action for the past few weeks, and it is holding up well to that challenge.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like the unit a lot.  Quiet and puts out a nice fine mist with a good amount of scent.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> I have only used my diffuser a couple of times but I am extremely pleased so far!  It&#x27;s quite the little power house and puts out a lovely amount of mist.  I didn&#x27;t expect quite that much power but I&#x27;m so pleased.  The lights are an added bonus as is the ability to control the time for misting.  I also love the auto shut-off that&#x27;s built in.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and so do I. She has it running almost all the time. I like it while we sleep. It adds so healing moisture to the air as we sleep. Don&#x27;t wake up with dry nose and I can breath. Great product.</li>
            <li> this was a bit smaller then I thought it would.  However it still works great in the bedroom.  It does not leave the objects around it wet and works great with the essential oils I use.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up. Good directions. Nice mist amount with several different time setting options. I opened this as soon as it arrived and set it up. Make sure you read directions first use is a little different then regular use. Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four different cool diffusers and this one is the best. I&#x27;ve had my first for over a year with no problems. Purchased two more last month. Great product!  And it looks good too.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be larger and run for more than 3 hours at a time.  It works well just not long enouugh</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a small room diffuser that allows you to use Essential Oils, look no further!  This is a great little unit and is worth the price. One of the features that it has that isn&#x27;t found in some of the other diffusers is that you have the option to turn the light feature completely off (other than the power LED).  This is especially nice when using in a bedroom and don&#x27;t want extra light at night. Another reason I chose this diffuser over some of the others was the fact that the use of oils was okay - some diffusers specifically state that oils cannot be used.  It is quiet and efficient and nicely handles a moderately sized room. I am ready to order an additional one!</li>
            <li> Love the different light colors and intensity as well as the option to have no light.  Been impressed with with the mist/steam used with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Returned the item. The diffuser worked the first time I used it. Then it would not diffuse next day when I turned it on.</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfactory with this product, only the size is smaller than my expectation.</li>
            <li> Worked once, for about 15 minutes. There were some positives, so I took a chance. Should have believed all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser..it&#x27;s easy to use and I love the colors and the design is perfect.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected. The mist is very minimal. I am going to take it to my office for my desk.</li>
            <li> Love this for by my bed and I put some Lavender oil in it to help me sleep at night.  Like the ability to shut the light off as that is not good for good deep sleep.</li>
            <li> A prefect size for bedside table.  Works well, very quIet.  Great delivery time.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a couple of weeks and so far so good. I use it for thieves oil mostly and will use it in the near future to make my house smell like Christmas :)  My daughter loves changing the light colors. Good buy.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is fantastic! It is small. Quit and efficient. It works great for a room sized space.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these diffusers and LOVE THEM.  They are great little workers and keep my house smelling great.  The changing lights are great for use in the bedroom and they shut off way before the water is gone.  Will be very helpful this winter with my essential oils.  Please Please Please get more in stock!!</li>
            <li> It is a very pretty lamp. Colors are very nice. I like that it switches off when the water tank is empty.... So it is very safe and you don&#x27;t have to remember to switch it off every time you are using it.</li>
            <li> This is prettier then my other diffuser but doens&#x27;t put out as much.</li>
            <li> Excellent diffuser for my DoTerra oils. It is a good size for my bedroom. And can easily be brought into the living room or kitchen. I love the option to change colors or just leave it off if I&#x27;m going to sleep.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item.  It is exactly what was discribed, and , since receiving, I have used it on a daily basis.  I would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> For the price I really think this is the best diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room and I love that I can use it as a accent light or night light.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and efficient.  I would choose this diffuser over the bulky ones for the price and because it works just as well in my apartment.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is pretty small (100ml water max). That&#x27;s a little less than 4oz. or 1/4 cup.&lt;br /&gt;It is to noisy too keep close to you at night time at least for me. Other than that it does come with instructions in good English and works okay for the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE it, would like to buy 4 more. Very pretty and quiet. Love the timer settings as well as the settings for the different level of light output.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is exactly what I was looking for. It begins to mist immediately, once it is turned on. The time settings are a nice feature. I usually use this at night next to my bed, and rarely use the light feature, but it is nice that you can pick a color to suit your mood. Each color has a bright or dim setting so if you prefer low light, there is that option. It is simple to set up and begin diffusing within a minute. I would buy this product again, and still may, for other rooms in the house.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  Works great.  I like the lighting change options and 3 hours is ample time to diffuse my favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> Love this little powerhouse. Very pretty and efficient.</li>
            <li> I love this little item.  I have only used it a few times but It arrived quickly and it works great.  The lights are just an added plus to the whole package.</li>
            <li> This did not efficiently produce the steam I was expecting.  I purchased the 2 pack set and each one performed differently.  I would not recommend.  I am returning both.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this diffuser!!!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few days and so far it works great. You turn it on and almost immediately, a light mist starts coming out of the top with the scent of whatever you put in it. It&#x27;s pretty good for a small room, not sure how it would do in a bigger one. You can set it for a variety of times up to 180 minutes and it will turn off automatically. It makes a very quiet hum and slight bubbling sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about as wide as the cans that beans or soup come in and a little taller. It feels like pretty cheap plastic so we&#x27;ll see how it does for durability. My only other concern is that the plastic will absorb the scents, so you won&#x27;t be able to get a clean scent when you switch to a different oil. The smell does seem to linger on the water tank and cover, but I&#x27;ve been wiping them down after each use and so far it hasn&#x27;t been too bad.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser and works well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, first time ever to use one, spouse advised me to get one. Improved my sinus congestion in several days, now I use it every night,  breathing better since, also the night light is useful for my newborn baby</li>
            <li> I use this everynight! I love mixing essential oils and having my room smell like lavender or peppermint oil. I was afraid I broke it after it tipped over and water went into the little exhaust but it bounced back stronger than ever.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very helpful with my allergies,a nightly concoction of eucalyptus, peppermint and tea tree oil keeps me from getting sinus infections.</li>
            <li> feels a bit cheap, works ok</li>
            <li> this diffuser is much smaller than i expected. it is not very well made for the price. i expected something very different. the instructions are written in very poor english.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome diffuser. I now own three. It&#x27;s very compact, takes up very little space. Very easy to use, comes with a container for measuring/pouring water. Water levels are clearly marked on diffuser and pouring container. Really makes for fool-proof use.&lt;br /&gt;Only has two buttons, one to turn on (and select time) and one for the light. Buttons are in back, and are super easy to use without even looking.&lt;br /&gt;I love the different colored lights feature. Though, I only use the blue and the regular light. But each color has 2 settings, so lots to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use and very quite</li>
            <li> I received this today. Easy to figure out how to use. I have plenty of essential oils on hand. I purchased 2 different diffusers. The other one is larger and was more expensive. Both are working great. I put bergamot in one and I put lemongrass in the other.The scent fills the room quickly. Just what I was looking for. Allergy season is upon us and we are looking for ways to clean and improve the air in our home. I purchased these in addition to an air purifier. I also hope the negative Ions help to improve seasonal depression. I will provide an update in a couple of weeks and let you know if the are still working well.</li>
            <li> The cord gets really warm when in use, so it&#x27;s been benched as a possible fire hazard. Maybe it&#x27;s nothing, but I don&#x27;t dare use it. Too bad since it&#x27;s adorable.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but the scent is barely detectable.  I put in probably 10-12 drops and the smell is still very faint. I was hoping for something stronger.</li>
            <li> This is the first ultrasonic aroma diffuser that I have purchased after reading lots of review. It is exactly as described and is a great little aroma diffuser with multiple settings.  Light can be turned off which is nice if you plan on using at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser now for a few weeks with no problems at all.  The price is more than fair compared to all the other diffusers out there.  It&#x27;s great for diffusing the scent into one room, and if you&#x27;re trying to fill a big room or a house with an open layout, just put more drops of the essential oils.  I only have to use a couple drops and I can really smell my essential oils in my kitchen.  One time I put 3 or 4 drops and I had to turn the diffuser off because it was so strong so it definitely works!</li>
            <li> This ultrasonic diffuser is very pretty and works great. More affordable than comparable models and more attractive. The timer and lights are great and it even has a little pitcher to fill it just right. My 18 year old son wants one for Christmas :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this diffuser for about a month and use it every day. So far, it&#x27;s done a great job. I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing a couple more for different areas of the house.</li>
            <li> I ordered this diffuser after my original (another brand) diffuser stopped working.  I read reviews for days &amp; finally settled on the Britelieafs Ultrasonic Aroma Diffuser.  I use essential oils daily as part of my family&#x27;s health &amp; wellbeing, and also healing, processes.  The diffuser arrived earlier today &amp; although smaller than I imagined, it is perfect.  I plugged it in, added water &amp; oils &amp; am enjoying it right now.  It fills up my living room &amp; dining room nicely.  I would recommend this diffuser to anyone looking for an affordable ultrasonic diffuser!</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.  Its small but it works very well with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> A great buy! When it is plugged in I can smell the scent throughout my entire room as well as in near by rooms.  The light makes for a great night light! The timer is also a great benefit- I never have to worry if I turned it off and can fall asleep with it on! The product not only adds moisture to the air but also adds a great aroma!!</li>
            <li> Have had this for only 2 weeks but so far love it - great buy!</li>
            <li> Works great! I really like it. The only thing is some of the ink indicating the different time options has rubbed off.</li>
            <li> I moved my massage business into an office that had been closed up for over a year and had previously been used for nails and hair. Needless to say, some odors remained. This aromatherapy diffuser is just what I needed! It really puts the scent in the air quickly and strong. Now when I walk in, it smells much better and with continued use, the place will really smell like me. Instructions were weird (translated from another language apparently) but the machine is easy to figure out and to use. I&#x27;ve had it for only a month so I can&#x27;t attest to the longevity, but even though it&#x27;s just plastic, it seems to function well. Very powerful. I have high hopes it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Purchased this lovely diffuser for my daughter&#x27;s bedroom to diffuse lavender at night.  Looks and works as stated.  I have owned several types of diffusers and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.  Make certain to use quality essential oils, and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hello BriteLeafs,&lt;br /&gt;I received my Ultrasonic and it works fine. I alos received the product by the promised delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> ADD scented oil,  you don&#x27;t need much!  Very nice!</li>
            <li> A great diffuser for my bedroom!</li>
            <li> We purchased this diffuser as a replacement for my Young Living model which I ran into the ground after two years of use.  We wanted something comparable but more affordable.  I am pleased with this diffuser!  It puts out a good quantity of mist and has a pretty far reach considering how small it is.  I wrote a full review here:  http://mommylivesclean.com/2014/10/29/essential-oil-diffuser-review-briteleafs/</li>
            <li> My family and I love this diffuser very much!  After doing a lot of research into diffusers I noticed from comments that the lifespan on the diffusers aren&#x27;t very long.  You&#x27;re lucky if they last past a year so I didn&#x27;t want to chance buying one that cost over $100. But I didn&#x27;t want one that would break in just a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this one.  I use it in my kids room the help them sleep on school nights and this diffuser is very quiet.  You also have the option of leaving the light off.  I also love that when the water is running low, it doesn&#x27;t make noise like it&#x27;s dying out.  It just turns off. I&#x27;ve had others that make a dying noise and that would wake me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s priced a bit high but compared to the cheaper models or those priced slightly cheaper, this really was the best buy for me and my family.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Minty air goodness.  Looks pretty</li>
            <li> like it. works great so far.</li>
            <li> Great for a small 12x20 bedroom. Fun light colors. Has worked well for a few months of daily night time usage.</li>
            <li> The lights and various colors stopped working after about an hour.  There does not seem to be any way to replace bulb.  The actual diffuser continues to work.</li>
            <li> I have a small room, but I can only smell the essential oil for the first 5 minutes, after that it&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t exist. Pretty lights though, I am using it more as a night light. If you&#x27;re looking for a diffuser that really &amp;#34;diffuses&amp;#34;, I think this is not the best product.</li>
            <li> Excellent while it worked; stopped working after about two months. I was very disappointed as I loved both the light and the scent of lavender that permeated the room until the day it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I love this little Diffuser with the color options!I use it in my bedroom and it perfectly works as a humidifier by adding essential oil and also as a little lamp. It  works great!I highly recommend this product!Thank you for this excellent product!</li>
            <li> When I use this, I feel like I am at the spa. If I could give it 10 stars I would! Fast delivery with nice and neat packaging. This has even helped me feel better when sick. Would def. Recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a cute little guy, perfect for work or at a desk. Best for a nite-light, my daughter loves that she can choose the color of the light.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great.  It is a very compact size, but still is a powerhouse. I use it in my office, which is a good-sized space, and I have people coming in from the hallway all the time because it spreads the oil fragrance all the way out the door and down the hall.  It would easily fill a bedroom or kitchen with good fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is the first defuser that I have used and so far I really like it. It outputs just enough mist to get a nice aroma without soaking the surrounding area. I have used several different oils, including citrus, and I have not had any problems. After reading many many reviews on different defusers, I was nervous about any of them lasting long, but I have used BriteLeafs for at least a hour every day since I received it and it has worked wonderfully every time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it everyday. It does so much more than I expected. I am going to get two more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving a negative review, but I was so disappointed when this diffuser died on me 5 weeks after purchasing. I was just beyond the date of return. Up to that point, it worked beautifully! Now I&#x27;m hesitant to buy another, because honestly I&#x27;m not sure why this one died. I just know it started leaking water from the base of the unit and wouldn&#x27;t blow diffused moist air out of the top any longer. I did carefully relocate it from one room to another, but if it&#x27;s that delicate that you can&#x27;t move it, then that&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li> Works great!  It delivers great scent and is very calming.</li>
            <li> I really love this diffuser.  I had been using the old style filter type, and the filter in no way compares to this excellent diffuser.  It looks like steam coming out and if you need a good inhale, just put your head by the diffuser and breath in.  Do it. with lemon and peppermint.  It will.  wake you up.  Great seller and product.</li>
            <li> My family absolutely loves the BriteLeafs Ultrasonic Aroma Diffuser Humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;The kids love the different color lighting choices, and I love the automatic shut off.&lt;br /&gt;I love adding different essential oils to create different aromas as well.&lt;br /&gt;Im thinking of getting one for each of my kids rooms this winter :)</li>
            <li> I use this thing all the time.  I run it when we go to bed at night and set it for 3 hours and sometimes get up and re-set it in the middle of the night.  As long as there&#x27;s still water left in the reservoir it will run again.  I also usually use it a couple times during the day.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any of the functions from the day I opened the box and took it out.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, so for the price I hope it lasts a lot longer, but compared to other reviews I&#x27;ve been very happy with all of the functions.  The only thing I might like is for an option for the light to stay on after the timer runs out so I can use it for a night light, but the light goes off when the diffuser shuts off.  But I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complaints about the water coming out when you tip it and other design issues are simply a matter of common sense.  The unit comes apart into two separate parts so you can fill the reservoir in the bottom and then screw the top part back on.  There has to be an opening to pour the water in, so of course you cannot tip it or the water will come out.  I hope it lasts for a good long time.  I love using it.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in the title, this was my first diffuser.  So I&#x27;m no expert.  That said, it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  I expected it to diffuse the air in a small room in my place with the scent of eucalyptus oil.  I tried multiple times with different amounts of water and oil and it never really produced any scent.  The only time I could smell anything is if I went right up to the small opening where the mist was coming out of.  I think that&#x27;s unacceptable.  I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> So far, after a month of frequent use works great! I hated to spend $50+. I purchased and really loved the AromaSens Ultrasonic Diffuser from Puritan on sale for $39, but after 6-8 months it sputtered water, so I had to put it on a towel, and sometimes did not turn off. Then it died, so it was a waste of money and now sells everywhere for more than the BriteLeafs. This little diffuser takes fewer drops of essential oil to get the aroma needed for therapeutic aromatherapy, and the water lasts longer. It is easy to handle: the base clicks in so when you pick it up it doesn&#x27;t come apart and spill. The directions were poorly translated but it&#x27;s easy to figure out. Hold the &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; button until it beeps on, press it to see the light move to the 30, 60, 120, or 180 min timer. I&#x27;ve tried all settings and it turns off at the right time. Second button is for the colored light, which has a bright and dim feature, great options, pleasant colors; I prefer to have the light off most of the time, so it&#x27;s great to have that option. I don&#x27;t see it sold anywhere else. I think the pictures make it look a little cheapy, but it&#x27;s better when you see it in person. I&#x27;m buying a second for my massage therapy studio.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to the use of my essential oils.  It matches my decor well, and I am very happy with the timer since I use it for my office.</li>
            <li> Great compact diffuser. Easy fill,easy clean. Lights can be turned off.</li>
            <li> Great output, and I love that you can use citrus oils with this diffuser.  The only thing I don&#x27;t absolutely love is that you can&#x27;t run it for more than 3 hours at a time.  To me, that is the only negative.  A really good product so far.</li>
            <li> Worked great - exactly what I expected.  Only thing I would change is for the timer to expire after the water is gone.  The longest you can set it for is 180 minutes but there is usually enough water in the reservoir for another 180 minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to operate, and works fine. Just doesn&#x27;t put out the fragrance as strongly as more expensive ones. I use it in the living room, so it disperses throughout and I rarely get a whiff. But it does exactly what the description said. The square footage is limited.</li>
            <li> Just got this item today and we are already enjoying the aromatherapy.  It&#x27;s small and cute enough to display in the living room soI&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing some additional scents to enjoy with y family</li>
            <li> I love it. From the multiple lighting feature to the automatic shut off. It sets the mood just right in my room and it&#x27;s easy to use. I use it almost every night.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very impressed with this diffuser. My young living one died after just a few months. This one seems to be working wonderfully. Love the choice of different colors.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to remove the top to put the water in; maybe it will become easier as I use the unit.  The diffuser is also a little weak - it doesn&#x27;t push the air very far upward.  Other than that, I am pleased with the unit, and I&#x27;d probably purchase another one because it is so pretty and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Works well. I have had no problems. Happy with product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this little thing. It&#x27;s great for one room and I keep mine in the bedroom. I bought some lavender oil and it smells absolutely amazing and puts me at ease. Also I like how it has a timer up to 180 minutes and turns itself off when no more water is present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also great for kids when sick. Just buy some eucalyptus oil and diffuse/humidify the air to clear airways :)</li>
            <li> This product worked for about a week and then stopped functioning properly.  It barely put any type of scent in the room and after a short period of time stopped acting as a diffuser.  Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its just a little smaller than I thought it would be.  But I like it very much.  I love the colors and the fact you can add essential oils. I have it set up in my massage room.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our teenage daughter&#x27;s room and she loves it ( so do her friends via FaceTime) . The design with flowers and butterflies is beautiful. Lots of options with this one.</li>
            <li> Great product! Do you make a travel one?</li>
            <li> Recently we (all the family) caught a quite nasty cold and this thing was really helpful. When it was especially bad, I was breathing eucalyptus fumes directly from the opening (the vapor is slightly warm, pretty good for inhalation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small as for &amp;#34;full-size&amp;#34; humidifier, but as aroma lamp it&#x27;s just perfect and overall, after few weeks, we are not using our regular humidifier anymore. Light function is pretty good too and we&#x27;re using the lamp as night stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think only about one downside - there is one button that cycles light colors, which is OK for selecting the color itself, but to turn the light off you have to press the button several times (i.e. colors are bright white, low white, bright red, low red, bright green, low green and bright blue, low blue - so to turn off the light if you&#x27;re on the low white, you&#x27;ll have to press button 7 times). But it&#x27;s minor inconvenience and usually I&#x27;m just unplugging the lamp from the wall socket, when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And small note - since there is no water filter as on the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; humidifiers, it&#x27;s probably would be better to use distilled water from the local grocery store. The lamp consumes small amount of water, so it won&#x27;t cost you a fortune.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these units and they have been working nicely for a week. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I REALLY like that you can set this diffuser to run for a certain length of time rather than it diffusing until it runs out of water.  What a waste of essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this diffuser a 5-star rating, but it has started making a \\&quot;whirring\\&quot; sound when I turn it on and I have to bump it around to get it to stop.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it does this because it was knocked off of my counter and the internal mechanisms were disrupted, so really it&#x27;s probably not the fault of the manufacturing.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and I love it; it&#x27;s beautiful and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great product. I buy essential oil from Wholefoods or Sprouts to add to it and the scent fills my entire bedroom. If you buy cheap synthetic oil, don&#x27;t expect your room to smell much. Love how the light changes. Easy instructions. Also don&#x27;t use tap water.</li>
            <li> We priced out several of these type of  products and for the value it performs satisfactory for a small bedroom (9 X 12 ft.)</li>
            <li> Easy to use, pleasant light. I really like the color choices. The 100 mL container of water is enough for quite a few extended uses. My one wish would be that it had included some essential oil samples.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it to work. Plug it in, fill it with water and it never heard up to make steam. Pretty lights though. However, it doesn&#x27;t work it is nothing more than an expensive night light. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
