            <li>I get so many compliments all the time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUYERS BE AWARE!!!!</li>
            <li>Since its supposed to be used like shampoo to be effective  </li>
            <li>It provides nutrients to the roots of the hair and effectively prevents hair lost.  </li>
            <li>Although for me I just do the new growth and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Her scalp does not itch and its very easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>But it sounds too good to be true although I want to believe it.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love the product and&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many leading hair dye and henna&#x27;s, but this is the most convenient out there.  </li>
            <li>I had used twice already and ordered 4 more immediately.  </li>
            <li>notably \\&quot;PPD</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>A couple days ago I ordered five more packets, realizing that this is a winner for me.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I feel better about myself and more confident when seeing clients.</li>
            <li>I used so many versions of Henna before</li>
            <li>It is definitely the best products one can lay hands on.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it is all Organic</li>
            <li>This product is safe, healthy, and contains no hair dyes.  </li>
            <li>Your hair will not turn red, and the color will not fade; making it the best product for hair</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you protect your skin with petroleum jelly before hand to avoid staining.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say, it is easier to use than normal hair dye, since the process is shampooing the product into your hair and leaving it in for a while before rinsing out.</li>
            <li>It covers grey perfectly.</li>
            <li>is good hair dye no chemical natural color nice smell  </li>
            <li>Black Hair Magic Color Dye is the perfect hair dye for me.</li>
            <li>This product says it&#x27;s 100% natural, and I want to believe them because it&#x27;s very effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hair color shampoo; it is fairly easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Since my hair grows out very quickly, i will hair color with this product once a month.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use also.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>bottom line is if it is an 100% organic easy to use hair dye, I would compromise its volumn and its lacking of support.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind that wants more proof.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have the strong chemical smell and does not sting.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research, and this product seems to be very popular in Asia, and many Asian health experts recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>May take more package to do a head full of hair.</li>
            <li>were the reasons why I started to look for alternatives to the commercial brands and the reason why I was happy to pay the additional cost.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: to keep the hair color longer, use sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product claims to be organic and chemical free...</li>
            <li>I did a patch test and experienced no effects prior.</li>
            <li>I am overall happy with the dye and will use it again.  </li>
            <li>I like it but all my light colored pillow cases are ruined and some clothing.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once, but it does work great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s all natural and good for our hair.</li>
            <li>As a result, it will give a beautiful shiny black hair color for more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Concentrate on the roots first, then use a fine comb to comb thru and massage the head again to get more even coverage.  </li>
            <li>I like the results; my hair color looks great and it covers grey well.</li>
            <li>Buy it right now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with the Noni dye, especially since I can use it every two weeks.</li>
            <li>I would like to give it 10 stars if it is truely 100% herb products FDA approved as described.</li>
            <li>the smell itself does not convince me since chemitrist can make chemicals smell better than real fruit or flower.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>Dying my hair more often would be ideal except that it would be more damaging, expensive, and a fuss to maintain.</li>
            <li>In any case, this product is great - fast, leaves hair soft &amp; black, and smells great without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>First off, it is extremely easy to use -</li>
            <li>It is NOT FDA approved for safety but most probably safe to use occasionally.</li>
            <li>after watching the videos and trying it the second time with proper procedures like the videos demonstrated, I am very happy with the result.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li>I hope my review will help some of you trying to get a great organic hair color for black hair.  </li>
            <li>After applying this product, the hair is an even black color, so that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I found this product, safe to my hair and scalp, did not developed any allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Since my purchase, today is the first I have used it!</li>
            <li>I do LOVE how easy it is to use, despite what others have said about there not being enough product included, I have</li>
            <li>the nice rich black color (which now has covered only about your front hairline and maybe sideburns) will last at best 7-9 days.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>Product also not truly effective if you have gray or white hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo once a month for a few times so far &amp; am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It lasted about a month before fading out, but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth buying over and over.</li>
            <li>It is made from chemicals as it reacts right away with water and once applied to the hair, without gloves on, your finger nails will get stained brown residue.</li>
            <li>I did not try to wash too much right after the application.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase it right away, sat in my shopping bag for about a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy in his mid-40s who started going gray a couple years ago, but I don&#x27;t like the look or feel of it right now.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely, chemical free! 1 packet served me fine to dye my entire shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a super fast coloring product.</li>
            <li>covers gery good with slight purplish tint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the hair</li>
            <li>but then again, I didn&#x27;t use even product in the first place.</li>
            <li>: My hair is 18 inches below the shoulder, but i was able to use only  one packet.</li>
            <li>I used this product, and I gave it a one star review the first time because I reviewed it before I used it.  </li>
            <li>So, at first, it was somewhat of a</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I purchased it at first because I thought it is organic, so I wouldn&#x27;t have chemical reaction from this product.</li>
            <li>The NONI Black Hair Magic product made my hair smoother and of course, darker!</li>
            <li>This will get your hair BLACK really fast, but make sure you get every piece of hair!</li>
            <li>Love this hair dye, so easy to use, friendly smell, natural and last me 8 weeks before my white hair is obvious again.</li>
            <li>Also the smell of then product is yucky, very herbal/medicine like.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she really loves it.  </li>
            <li>It really works, and I almost didn&#x27;t recognize my hair.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because I might not have worked the lather in as much on that side-</li>
            <li>If you need to cover the whole head of hair, I would recommend at leat 2 packet.</li>
            <li>and none of them really did much to my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>I purchased five packets the first time I tried Noni black hair magic.</li>
            <li>This is something that I am willing to live with, but warning-</li>
            <li>I had allergy reaction more than other hair dye with chemical.</li>
            <li>NONI is easy to apply and the whole process takes just a few more minutes than regular hair shampooing.</li>
            <li>It is very mild, no irritate, only 10 minutes, no messy.</li>
            <li>The end result is a nice and natural looking black.</li>
            <li>I have been using the 100% Plant-Based NONI Black Hair Magic HERBAL NO DYE, since September 2010.</li>
            <li>I gave Noni Black Hair Magic a try.  </li>
            <li>I tried Noni Black Magic after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>The hair color looks much more naturally black.</li>
            <li>The noni black hair magic took the hair nutrition and health experts two years to develop.  </li>
            <li>The seller shipped the product quickly, received earlier than 1 week.</li>
            <li>It has a mild Gingseng smell initially, but goes away in a day or two.</li>
            <li>I am very grateful that someone has come up with such a great product to cover grey for people with black hair.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to other type of hair dye I use, it was easy to apply and works without skin reaction.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t agree with her way of applying the product, but I learned from her that it&#x27;s important to wet your hair BEFORE you apply the product.</li>
            <li>One of the them is in Thai, but the visual pretty much speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it&#x27;s not chemical like the ones I once used.</li>
            <li>My hair was often in the swimming pool water and I wash my hair pretty much daily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make it last longer, you need wash your hair first,</li>
            <li>but in general it&#x27;s held up really well.  </li>
            <li>Thereby preventing the color from becoming too heavy or dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t know how to apply it properly.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>you have long hair make sure you wet your hair thoroghly and apply it to the roots and hair.</li>
            <li>, this is not natural , it contain more PPD than regular hair dye over the counter, a tiny drops on my arm, which caused burnt, itchiness, redness just in a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have some premature greys and my hair grows fast, so I would normally dye my hair every four weeks and dread the last two of those weeks when I could see the roots if I so much as pulled my hair back for a pony or whatever.</li>
            <li>It certainly does not strip your follicle like the commercial brands.</li>
            <li>The first day, the color still looks rather dark to me, but after a day or two, it gets slightly lighter and more natural.</li>
            <li>It covers grey very very well.</li>
            <li>and she clearly said</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals and it&lt;</li>
            <li>The next day my head swelled so much that I was unrecognizeable on one side of my face and my eye swelled shut.</li>
            <li>This product is NOT just organic and natural like they want you to believe.</li>
            <li>Just natural indredient of noni plus herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was much more steps and the process lasts for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I use natural, non-toxic shampoo, so that might help keep the color, also.  </li>
            <li>I never imagined I&#x27;d find something all natural, no chemicals, that worked.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised..</li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest hair color I have found.</li>
            <li>, your hair has been completely dyed.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stink or burn and my hair was so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>and wow, did it show.</li>
            <li>The doctor said if I had used it all over I would more than likely be in the hospital or dead.</li>
            <li>This dye leaves your hair jet black, silky, super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>You will get blond hair, not black, so you go out in 2 colors.</li>
            <li>The product worked REALLY well, and covered all my grey.</li>
            <li>One more negative, if you get the dye on white plastic, laminated, fingernails, it will stain.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not certain this is 100% natural without much chemicals.</li>
            <li>It covers grey well but make sure you massage real well for those grey underneath if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>the minimum- enough for a complete application.  </li>
            <li>I am an Asian woman and had been looking for a natural hair color for awhile.  </li>
            <li>This is my natural color hair, and it&#x27;s going to be something I&#x27;ll use into the future.  </li>
            <li>I started using NONI Black Hair Magic Color a few months ago.</li>
            <li>Definitely it isn&#x27;t natural but full of chemicals that will turn your hair extremely dry and stiff...</li>
            <li>product includes various Chinese medicines and herbal nourishing creams such as Noni, wild ginseng, wild ganoderma lucidum</li>
            <li>I have been trying henna dying to avoid all the chemicals, but it&#x27;s too time consuming, the hair color is not dark enough, and dries out my hair.  </li>
            <li>First, i wet my hair, towel dry and put vaseline on my face, ear, neck and on my arms.  </li>
            <li>I am also little suspicious on its athenicity because after two purchase, the contents was so much different from the first two purchase and from that point my hair gets massed up from using the product..</li>
            <li>very long, thick hair and one packet was just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>But it certainly saves me a lot of trouble.</li>

            <li> I have only used it once, but it does work great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s all natural and good for our hair.</li>
            <li> As a result, it will give a beautiful shiny black hair color for more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Concentrate on the roots first, then use a fine comb to comb thru and massage the head again to get more even coverage.  </li>
            <li> I like the results; my hair color looks great and it covers grey well.</li>
            <li> Buy it right now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with the Noni dye, especially since I can use it every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I would like to give it 10 stars if it is truely 100% herb products FDA approved as described.</li>
            <li> the smell itself does not convince me since chemitrist can make chemicals smell better than real fruit or flower.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Dying my hair more often would be ideal except that it would be more damaging, expensive, and a fuss to maintain.</li>
            <li> In any case, this product is great - fast, leaves hair soft &amp; black, and smells great without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> First off, it is extremely easy to use -</li>
            <li> It is NOT FDA approved for safety but most probably safe to use occasionally.</li>
            <li> after watching the videos and trying it the second time with proper procedures like the videos demonstrated, I am very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> I hope my review will help some of you trying to get a great organic hair color for black hair.  </li>
            <li> After applying this product, the hair is an even black color, so that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I found this product, safe to my hair and scalp, did not developed any allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> It is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Since my purchase, today is the first I have used it!</li>
            <li> I do LOVE how easy it is to use, despite what others have said about there not being enough product included, I have</li>
            <li> the nice rich black color (which now has covered only about your front hairline and maybe sideburns) will last at best 7-9 days.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> Product also not truly effective if you have gray or white hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo once a month for a few times so far &amp; am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It lasted about a month before fading out, but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth buying over and over.</li>
            <li> It is made from chemicals as it reacts right away with water and once applied to the hair, without gloves on, your finger nails will get stained brown residue.</li>
            <li> I did not try to wash too much right after the application.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase it right away, sat in my shopping bag for about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy in his mid-40s who started going gray a couple years ago, but I don&#x27;t like the look or feel of it right now.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely, chemical free! 1 packet served me fine to dye my entire shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a super fast coloring product.</li>
            <li> covers gery good with slight purplish tint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the hair</li>
            <li> but then again, I didn&#x27;t use even product in the first place.</li>
            <li> : My hair is 18 inches below the shoulder, but i was able to use only  one packet.</li>
            <li> I used this product, and I gave it a one star review the first time because I reviewed it before I used it.  </li>
            <li> So, at first, it was somewhat of a</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I purchased it at first because I thought it is organic, so I wouldn&#x27;t have chemical reaction from this product.</li>
            <li> The NONI Black Hair Magic product made my hair smoother and of course, darker!</li>
            <li> This will get your hair BLACK really fast, but make sure you get every piece of hair!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dye, so easy to use, friendly smell, natural and last me 8 weeks before my white hair is obvious again.</li>
            <li> Also the smell of then product is yucky, very herbal/medicine like.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she really loves it.  </li>
            <li> It really works, and I almost didn&#x27;t recognize my hair.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because I might not have worked the lather in as much on that side-</li>
            <li> If you need to cover the whole head of hair, I would recommend at leat 2 packet.</li>
            <li> and none of them really did much to my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I purchased five packets the first time I tried Noni black hair magic.</li>
            <li> This is something that I am willing to live with, but warning-</li>
            <li> I had allergy reaction more than other hair dye with chemical.</li>
            <li> NONI is easy to apply and the whole process takes just a few more minutes than regular hair shampooing.</li>
            <li> It is very mild, no irritate, only 10 minutes, no messy.</li>
            <li> The end result is a nice and natural looking black.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 100% Plant-Based NONI Black Hair Magic HERBAL NO DYE, since September 2010.</li>
            <li> I gave Noni Black Hair Magic a try.  </li>
            <li> I tried Noni Black Magic after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> The hair color looks much more naturally black.</li>
            <li> The noni black hair magic took the hair nutrition and health experts two years to develop.  </li>
            <li> The seller shipped the product quickly, received earlier than 1 week.</li>
            <li> It has a mild Gingseng smell initially, but goes away in a day or two.</li>
            <li> I am very grateful that someone has come up with such a great product to cover grey for people with black hair.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to other type of hair dye I use, it was easy to apply and works without skin reaction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with her way of applying the product, but I learned from her that it&#x27;s important to wet your hair BEFORE you apply the product.</li>
            <li> One of the them is in Thai, but the visual pretty much speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And most importantly, it&#x27;s not chemical like the ones I once used.</li>
            <li> My hair was often in the swimming pool water and I wash my hair pretty much daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make it last longer, you need wash your hair first,</li>
            <li> but in general it&#x27;s held up really well.  </li>
            <li> Thereby preventing the color from becoming too heavy or dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t know how to apply it properly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> you have long hair make sure you wet your hair thoroghly and apply it to the roots and hair.</li>
            <li> , this is not natural , it contain more PPD than regular hair dye over the counter, a tiny drops on my arm, which caused burnt, itchiness, redness just in a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some premature greys and my hair grows fast, so I would normally dye my hair every four weeks and dread the last two of those weeks when I could see the roots if I so much as pulled my hair back for a pony or whatever.</li>
            <li> It certainly does not strip your follicle like the commercial brands.</li>
            <li> The first day, the color still looks rather dark to me, but after a day or two, it gets slightly lighter and more natural.</li>
            <li> It covers grey very very well.</li>
            <li> and she clearly said</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals and it&lt;</li>
            <li> The next day my head swelled so much that I was unrecognizeable on one side of my face and my eye swelled shut.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT just organic and natural like they want you to believe.</li>
            <li> Just natural indredient of noni plus herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was much more steps and the process lasts for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I use natural, non-toxic shampoo, so that might help keep the color, also.  </li>
            <li> I never imagined I&#x27;d find something all natural, no chemicals, that worked.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised..</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest hair color I have found.</li>
            <li> , your hair has been completely dyed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stink or burn and my hair was so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> and wow, did it show.</li>
            <li> The doctor said if I had used it all over I would more than likely be in the hospital or dead.</li>
            <li> This dye leaves your hair jet black, silky, super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> You will get blond hair, not black, so you go out in 2 colors.</li>
            <li> The product worked REALLY well, and covered all my grey.</li>
            <li> One more negative, if you get the dye on white plastic, laminated, fingernails, it will stain.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not certain this is 100% natural without much chemicals.</li>
            <li> It covers grey well but make sure you massage real well for those grey underneath if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> the minimum- enough for a complete application.  </li>
            <li> I am an Asian woman and had been looking for a natural hair color for awhile.  </li>
            <li> This is my natural color hair, and it&#x27;s going to be something I&#x27;ll use into the future.  </li>
            <li> I started using NONI Black Hair Magic Color a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Definitely it isn&#x27;t natural but full of chemicals that will turn your hair extremely dry and stiff...</li>
            <li> product includes various Chinese medicines and herbal nourishing creams such as Noni, wild ginseng, wild ganoderma lucidum</li>
            <li> I have been trying henna dying to avoid all the chemicals, but it&#x27;s too time consuming, the hair color is not dark enough, and dries out my hair.  </li>
            <li> First, i wet my hair, towel dry and put vaseline on my face, ear, neck and on my arms.  </li>
            <li> I am also little suspicious on its athenicity because after two purchase, the contents was so much different from the first two purchase and from that point my hair gets massed up from using the product..</li>
            <li> very long, thick hair and one packet was just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> But it certainly saves me a lot of trouble.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way (especially with short hair), and it lathered very well.  </li>
            <li> It contains a new formula that can rapidly turn your hair black.  </li>
            <li> This product is natural, and is different than any other hair dye products!</li>
            <li> I am Asian with soft black hair.  </li>
            <li> Because I stretched it so much, it didn&#x27;t saturate my hair enough and the end result was pointless.</li>
            <li> P.S. 1 package enough to cover long hair.</li>
            <li> I stopped coloring for a long time because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell and stinging effect of the regular hair coloring products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Chinese and use this product to cover grey.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this noni black hair color with reasonable expectation: there would be enough to dye my short hair black.  </li>
            <li> It also left my hair dry to the point I had to apply oil to stop the itching of the scalp.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny soft and naturally black.</li>
            <li> all natural and colors your hair black...</li>
            <li> I did not want to trade my grey hair for thinng</li>
            <li> have long hair.  </li>
            <li> Not because the color faded - it was my grey hair grew out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, the grey hair</li>
            <li> the hair looks shiney and manageble nothing to dislike but doesnot stay that long every 4 weeks you have to use it</li>
            <li> It had been so long since I hadn&#x27;t seen my normal black hair without gray, that I almost wondered if it looked too dark, but</li>
            <li> One pouch is not quite enough, but I am doing it to add extra darkness to my hair, not to be jet black.  </li>
            <li> It definitely dyes my hair deep black and covers my gray.</li>
            <li> You need several applications in a month in order to get the desired jet black look it even says this on the back of packet..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would turn my hair that dark, since the liquid is light brown, so I left it on for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The packet size is about the same as the after color shampoo or conditioner you found in any other hair</li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t wet my hair first, the result was too heavy and uneven.</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivities to a lot of products; when I tried a few types of commercial hair dyes (including Just for Men), I had about three days of headaches (likely from the toxic ingredients like lead acetate and formaldehyde).  </li>
            <li> NONI was suppose to be a Natural and Organic product, however it feels more like a chemical base product.</li>
            <li> This may be enough for a bare infant scalp, but not for anyone that has at least a pixie cut.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> After applying for 10 minutes, my white hair turned black as promised.</li>
            <li> I have become allergic to PPD about 12 years ago and have struggled to find a black hair dye that actually covers gray, gets my hair a deep black color and that does not break me out.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount in packet and may not be enough for some.</li>
            <li> I did feel a very slight burning sensation, but it did not last long.  </li>
            <li> I do use a deep conditioner for at least a couple of minutes after I dye, I&#x27;ve always done this with regular dyes, so I am noticing a difference even though I followed this product with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> That it&#x27;s advertised as non-toxic, organic (not certified so unknown) and long-lasting</li>
            <li> Some time after my arm and ear began itching and a few hours later my head, ear and arm started swelling.</li>
            <li> just wet your hair and massage into your hair for about 10 mins and presto</li>
            <li> Other name brand hair dye and chemicals make my hair very dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> and it came out pitch black on grey hair.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tested it on a small area of hair above my ear.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what in this product is causing it, but it seems to be the same reaction I had years ago to chemical hair color, which landed me in the ER 2x.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell, I do not have any problem.</li>
            <li> think my plan is to use this product every other time with Herbatints vegetable dye.  </li>
            <li> Although it does take a little practice to apply it properly so that the result is even and not too heavy in color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my black hair silky shine.</li>
            <li> The product will immediately start to work and dye the grays to black color.</li>
            <li> It turned out really black.  </li>
            <li> I applied it once and my hair is jet black</li>
            <li> I am an Indian with tick black hair.</li>
            <li> I am placing another order for half a dozen.</li>
            <li> If you are going to purchase this dye, get at least two packets, three or four if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is very long or thick you will need 2 pack for one application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing might annoying people is - in the first couple of days, your hair might smell like grass.</li>
            <li> at least wet your hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The smell should be gone after a few washes.</li>
            <li> I went without doing anything for a year, then a few weeks ago found this stuff online.  </li>
            <li> This product is a lie, don&#x27; waste your money and harm your health</li>
            <li> very little gray showing through one side-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product in its current sold-as state is ridiculous:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> The manufacturers want you to use this as your regular shampoo (which makes sense, your hair will stay rich-youthful-black if you never let the gray out) but this is absurdly expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually use it to dye my hair about every 45 days.</li>
            <li> (  I tried Henna products before, but it is not good for people with black hair, plus Henna is very messy and take 1-2 hours for the waiting period.  </li>
            <li> Even though I did not break out into bloody blisters on my scalp (like I do with regular hair dye) I do break out with blisters on my head that last about one week after I use the dye.  </li>
            <li> After this  process, I usually wear an air-tight plastic bag to seal the dye for at least an hour (I used dog poo bag.</li>
            <li> Sorry I took so long to write this review.</li>
            <li> , if you have a pixie cut you need to purchase at least 2 packs, a bob cut 3-4, shoulder length 5-6, and longer hair 7-8 packs.  </li>
            <li> keep the color you will need to reapply at least every 2weeks.</li>
            <li> Left the product on for 30 min, and wait to rinse out with cold water.</li>
            <li> It always lasted for at least 2 months as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Then apply the product and rub it evenly for at least 5~10 minutes.</li>
            <li> That way if it does have chemicals in it, at least I won&#x27;t be using it as often.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair add a pack to each length</li>
            <li> It has a tree bark scent - non over powering and non disturbing.</li>
            <li> The secret of this dye is the massaging technique!</li>
            <li> dangerous harmful chemical which is not as what the description claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you will be shipped 1 small packet (think cheese-packets in those awful mac&#x27;n&#x27;cheese boxes).</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated.  </li>
            <li> EXPENSIVE , HARMFUL PRODUCTS !!</li>
            <li> I hate chemical hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cover my grays and plus gave me a very bad headache and very bad rash</li>
            <li> I had very bad allergy reaction from this product.</li>
            <li> This product was awful.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> EXPENSIVE , HARMFUL PRODUCTS !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost land in ER, this is not natural , it contain more PPD than regular hair dye over the counter, a tiny drops on my arm, which caused burnt, itchiness, redness just in a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very dangerous harmful chemical which is not as what the description claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYERS BE AWARE!!!!</li>
            <li> This product comes from China and Malaysia - sold in bulk to the UK and US as a 20 bag box ($1/bag). The retailer that sells on Amazon asks for $9 plus shipping, to $14.80. The quantity in one bag is enough for a doll, only 20 ml. Product also not truly effective if you have gray or white hair. You will get blond hair, not black, so you go out in 2 colors. It is NOT FDA approved for safety but most probably safe to use occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 100% Plant-Based NONI Black Hair Magic HERBAL NO DYE, since September 2010. I feel that this product is helpful to revive my hair. Now, my hair shine glow! This product is natural, and is different than any other hair dye products!</li>
            <li> I purchased one packet of the dye because I have short hair. About ear length. One packet covered only 50% of my hair. I was having to reallly stretch the product to get an even coverage. Because I stretched it so much, it didn&#x27;t saturate my hair enough and the end result was pointless. You couldn&#x27;t even tell I had dyed my hair. I do have to say that my hair afterwards didnt feel damaged but then again, I didn&#x27;t use even product in the first place. Also the smell of then product is yucky, very herbal/medicine like. If you are going to purchase this dye, get at least two packets, three or four if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the product and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s all natural and good for our hair. No harsh chemicals and it&lt;br /&gt;promotes growth!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  I&#x27;ve used so many leading hair dye and henna&#x27;s, but this is the most convenient out there.  May take more package to do a head full of hair. Although for me I just do the new growth and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she really loves it.  Her scalp does not itch and its very easy to put on.  One of the best out there.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product ever again.. Definitely it isn&#x27;t natural but full of chemicals that will turn your hair extremely dry and stiff... My scalp is getting itchy and my hair is thinning after using this product. I am also little suspicious on its athenicity because after two purchase, the contents was so much different from the first two purchase and from that point my hair gets massed up from using the product..</li>
            <li> I purchased this noni black hair color with reasonable expectation: there would be enough to dye my short hair black.  That it&#x27;s advertised as non-toxic, organic (not certified so unknown) and long-lasting were the reasons why I started to look for alternatives to the commercial brands and the reason why I was happy to pay the additional cost.  Unfortunately, this product in its current sold-as state is ridiculous:&lt;br /&gt;1) you will be shipped 1 small packet (think cheese-packets in those awful mac&#x27;n&#x27;cheese boxes). This may be enough for a bare infant scalp, but not for anyone that has at least a pixie cut.&lt;br /&gt;2) the nice rich black color (which now has covered only about your front hairline and maybe sideburns) will last at best 7-9 days.&lt;br /&gt;3)  only purchase if you can afford your necessary application size and maintain that cost every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have a pixie cut you need to purchase at least 2 packs, a bob cut 3-4, shoulder length 5-6, and longer hair 7-8 packs.  If you have thick hair add a pack to each length size.&lt;br /&gt;To keep the color you will need to reapply at least every 2weeks. The manufacturers want you to use this as your regular shampoo (which makes sense, your hair will stay rich-youthful-black if you never let the gray out) but this is absurdly expensive. Do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a good product if sold -at the minimum- enough for a complete application.  Since its supposed to be used like shampoo to be effective  it needs to sold in shampoo-bottle size. I would urge users write to the manufactures, or print, sign &amp; mail this review&lt;br /&gt;In short, only purchase if you can afford your necessary application size and maintain that cost every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a very wonderful product. It&#x27;s very easy to use. As a result, it will give a beautiful shiny black hair color for more than 3 weeks. Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> After applying for 10 minutes, my white hair turned black as promised. I am really glad I found this product, safe to my hair and scalp, did not developed any allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> I started using NONI Black Hair Magic Color a few months ago. I like the results; my hair color looks great and it covers grey well. It&#x27;s hair color shampoo; it is fairly easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I tested this product on the back of my ear and inside of my elbow and did not have a reaction for a day so decided to use it the next morning. I tested it on a small area of hair above my ear. Some time after my arm and ear began itching and a few hours later my head, ear and arm started swelling. The next day my head swelled so much that I was unrecognizeable on one side of my face and my eye swelled shut. I am now taking steroids, and antibiotics. The doctor said if I had used it all over I would more than likely be in the hospital or dead. I looked online and found another product almost identical in name and ingredients and it does contain ppd and another benzene ingredient. This product is NOT just organic and natural like they want you to believe. BEWARE!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair color i have tried.  It has no chemical smell, no ammonia.... Just natural indredient of noni plus herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my black hair silky shine. I am not exaggerating.  I am an Asian woman and had been looking for a natural hair color for awhile.  Other name brand hair dye and chemicals make my hair very dry and frizzy and i started to have thining hair.  I was so frustrated.  I did not want to trade my grey hair for thinng hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, 4 weeks ago, I was very happy that i had found this product on Amazon.  I had used twice already and ordered 4 more immediately.  First, i wet my hair, towel dry and put vaseline on my face, ear, neck and on my arms.  Second, wear gloves and pour hair color (about 3 TB) onto my roots and then massege it into scalp for 5-10 minutes.  Since i am not allegic to the product, i left it in for 40-60 minutes while watching tv  ( it recommends10-20 mintutes).  It covers grey very very well. Since my hair grows out very quickly, i will hair color with this product once a month.  I am very grateful that someone has come up with such a great product to cover grey for people with black hair.  I hope my review will help some of you trying to get a great organic hair color for black hair.  I 100% recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (  I tried Henna products before, but it is not good for people with black hair, plus Henna is very messy and take 1-2 hours for the waiting period.  )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: to keep the hair color longer, use sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For info to help: My hair is 18 inches below the shoulder, but i was able to use only  one packet. (my hair is about one inch in diameter when pull into a pony tail)  Concentrate on the roots first, then use a fine comb to comb thru and massage the head again to get more even coverage.  Repeat the process if neccesary.</li>
            <li> NONI was suppose to be a Natural and Organic product, however it feels more like a chemical base product. It is made from chemicals as it reacts right away with water and once applied to the hair, without gloves on, your finger nails will get stained brown residue. The product will immediately start to work and dye the grays to black color. I would not purchase this product again, as it acts same as chemical products. It also left my hair dry to the point I had to apply oil to stop the itching of the scalp. My former hair was dyed with henna, with red roots. After applying this product, the hair is an even black color, so that&#x27;s great. Left the product on for 30 min, and wait to rinse out with cold water. P.S. 1 package enough to cover long hair. The seller shipped the product quickly, received earlier than 1 week.</li>
            <li> This product claims to be organic and chemical free... notably \\&quot;PPD FREE\\&quot;. I used this product for the 1st time last night.  I did a patch test and experienced no effects prior. The product worked REALLY well, and covered all my grey. It was easy to use also. However, this morning, when I woke up, I noticed that there is a patch on my scalp that is weeping. I am having an allergic reaction to this product!!! I am not sure what in this product is causing it, but it seems to be the same reaction I had years ago to chemical hair color, which landed me in the ER 2x. Please just beware of this.. trust me, you do NOT want to suffer like I am.</li>
            <li> I am Asian with soft black hair.  I have been trying henna dying to avoid all the chemicals, but it&#x27;s too time consuming, the hair color is not dark enough, and dries out my hair.  I gave Noni Black Hair Magic a try.  It worked like magic!  I was skeptical that it would turn my hair that dark, since the liquid is light brown, so I left it on for 30 minutes.  It turned out really black.  Next time, I will go with their recommended 7-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair.  One pouch is not quite enough, but I am doing it to add extra darkness to my hair, not to be jet black.  In any case, this product is great - fast, leaves hair soft &amp; black, and smells great without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have become allergic to PPD about 12 years ago and have struggled to find a black hair dye that actually covers gray, gets my hair a deep black color and that does not break me out.  I tried Noni Black Magic after reading the reviews.  I do LOVE how easy it is to use, despite what others have said about there not being enough product included, I have very long, thick hair and one packet was just fine for me.  Even though I did not break out into bloody blisters on my scalp (like I do with regular hair dye) I do break out with blisters on my head that last about one week after I use the dye.  This is something that I am willing to live with, but warning- it is itchy and gross for about a week.  I am overall happy with the dye and will use it again.  It definitely dyes my hair deep black and covers my gray.</li>
            <li> Just saw the comments from another user of this product that the color only lasts for 2 weeks? I guess it was not done correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 2 years. It always lasted for at least 2 months as I can tell. I swim 3 to 4 times a week. My hair was often in the swimming pool water and I wash my hair pretty much daily. I still did not notice obvious color fading. I usually use it to dye my hair about every 45 days. Not because the color faded - it was my grey hair grew out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make it last longer, you need wash your hair first, at least wet your hair thoroughly. Then apply the product and rub it evenly for at least 5~10 minutes. After this  process, I usually wear an air-tight plastic bag to seal the dye for at least an hour (I used dog poo bag. It just fits my head). Then you can wash it off with shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing might annoying people is - in the first couple of days, your hair might smell like grass. The smell should be gone after a few washes. I did not try to wash too much right after the application. Other than the smell, I do not have any problem. I do like this product. I used to use Indigo and Henna to dye my hair. It was much more steps and the process lasts for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li> When I put this in my shopping bag, it came with 2 packets. I didn&#x27;t purchase it right away, sat in my shopping bag for about a week. When I received the product, it only came with 1 packet. I checked the description online and they had changed the amount to 1 packet instead of 2.....rip off! I decided to purchase this because of a video review I saw on youtube and she clearly said and she showed 2 packets.</li>
            <li> I have 20% white hair. Love this hair dye, so easy to use, friendly smell, natural and last me 8 weeks before my white hair is obvious again. If your hair is very long or thick you will need 2 pack for one application. Love it</li>
            <li> Black Hair Magic Color Dye is the perfect hair dye for me. It is very mild, no irritate, only 10 minutes, no messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy in his mid-40s who started going gray a couple years ago, but I don&#x27;t like the look or feel of it right now.  I have chemical sensitivities to a lot of products; when I tried a few types of commercial hair dyes (including Just for Men), I had about three days of headaches (likely from the toxic ingredients like lead acetate and formaldehyde).  I went without doing anything for a year, then a few weeks ago found this stuff online.  I ordered one packet to try it, did the test patch (used my inner elbow, though, not my ear), and had no reaction at all.  I used about one-third of the packet on my hair the next day.  A little goes a long way (especially with short hair), and it lathered very well.  I left it on about 10 minutes, then rinsed it off in the shower.  Wow.  It really works, and I almost didn&#x27;t recognize my hair.  It had been so long since I hadn&#x27;t seen my normal black hair without gray, that I almost wondered if it looked too dark, but no.  This is my natural color hair, and it&#x27;s going to be something I&#x27;ll use into the future.  It&#x27;s one week now since I used it- very little gray showing through one side- I think it&#x27;s because I might not have worked the lather in as much on that side- but in general it&#x27;s held up really well.  I use natural, non-toxic shampoo, so that might help keep the color, also.  A couple days ago I ordered five more packets, realizing that this is a winner for me.  I never imagined I&#x27;d find something all natural, no chemicals, that worked.  This is it.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other type of hair dye I use, it was easy to apply and works without skin reaction.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Easy to use. Little goes a long way. Affordable. Natural!&lt;br /&gt;Since i discovered noni hair color i dont use anything else. It makes my hair shiny soft and naturally black.</li>
            <li> I used this product, and I gave it a one star review the first time because I reviewed it before I used it.  though I wouldn&#x27;t like it because it looked as though the package didn&#x27;t have enough to cover my hair.  I was pleasantly surprised..</li>
            <li> It is fast and easy to use. Result is good. I would like to give it 10 stars if it is truely 100% herb products FDA approved as described. But it sounds too good to be true although I want to believe it.I wish it gives an explanation how does it work. It has the smell of He-Sho-Wu.(I have some in my home, so I know how it smells like.)But the smell itself does not convince me since chemitrist can make chemicals smell better than real fruit or flower.&lt;br /&gt;On the package, a Hong Kong address is provided. I contacted it through email provided, nobody responded to me.&lt;br /&gt;For the volumn, I have medium length and medium volumn hair, I used 1 packet to cover only the gray area. If you need to cover the whole head of hair, I would recommend at leat 2 packet. The packet size is about the same as the after color shampoo or conditioner you found in any other hair dye products.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is if it is an 100% organic easy to use hair dye, I would compromise its volumn and its lacking of support.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo once a month for a few times so far &amp; am very happy with it. It covers grey well but make sure you massage real well for those grey underneath if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> From my own experience, this is the best hair coloring product around. Although it does take a little practice to apply it properly so that the result is even and not too heavy in color. It pays to watch the two videos I found on YouTube before attempting the task. Type the product name in YouTube and you should find two videos that shows you how to use it. One of the them is in Thai, but the visual pretty much speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another video in English. I don&#x27;t agree with her way of applying the product, but I learned from her that it&#x27;s important to wet your hair BEFORE you apply the product. This helps the product lather up. Thereby preventing the color from becoming too heavy or dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t know how to apply it properly. The product comes in a packet, a format I was unfamiliar with. So I just poured it out onto my hands (with latex-free vinyl gloves on) and mixed it well before applying onto my hair like the instruction on the package said. Because I didn&#x27;t wet my hair first, the result was too heavy and uneven. And I didn&#x27;t have enough to finish the back! So, at first, it was somewhat of a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then after watching the videos and trying it the second time with proper procedures like the videos demonstrated, I am very happy with the result. The hair color looks much more naturally black. The first day, the color still looks rather dark to me, but after a day or two, it gets slightly lighter and more natural. And most importantly, it&#x27;s not chemical like the ones I once used. I stopped coloring for a long time because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell and stinging effect of the regular hair coloring products. This product doesn&#x27;t have the strong chemical smell and does not sting. It has a mild Gingseng smell initially, but goes away in a day or two. I did do a test on my skin to test for allergy for 48 hours before coloring my entire head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the grey hair no longermake me blue. My brother said I look 20 years younger! I feel better about myself and more confident when seeing clients.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest hair color I have found. I used so many versions of Henna before and none of them really did much to my hair. NONI is easy to apply and the whole process takes just a few more minutes than regular hair shampooing. Although I&#x27;m not certain this is 100% natural without much chemicals. But it certainly saves me a lot of trouble. I use only one package since my hair is only salt and pepper in the front. The end result is a nice and natural looking black.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful buy ! It makes your hair glow and leaves a lasting shiny effect. It covers grey perfectly. It is definitely the best products one can lay hands on. I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> The NONI Black Hair Magic product made my hair smoother and of course, darker! I will definitely purchase again soon!</li>
            <li> is good hair dye no chemical natural color nice smell  the hair looks shiney and manageble nothing to dislike but doesnot stay that long every 4 weeks you have to use it</li>
            <li> If you perspires in your head when sleeping this color will leave stain marks on your pillow cases. I like it but all my light colored pillow cases are ruined and some clothing. I went back to the regular pharmacy brand. Only a small amount in packet and may not be enough for some.</li>
            <li> Sorry I took so long to write this review. Since my purchase, today is the first I have used it! And let me say that I am pleasantly surprise with the ease of use of this product! I am one happy customer and I am set for life with this hair dye. I will be buying it again and again! First off, it is extremely easy to use - just wet your hair and massage into your hair for about 10 mins and presto, your hair has been completely dyed. Just wash off afterwards.  Rub vaseline around the hair line to prevent staining on your forehead and back of neck.  This dye leaves your hair jet black, silky, super soft and shiny! I love it!  It certainly does not strip your follicle like the commercial brands. It has a tree bark scent - non over powering and non disturbing. Absolutely, chemical free! 1 packet served me fine to dye my entire shoulder length hair.  The secret of this dye is the massaging technique! Best product ever! Do not sit on the fence for this hair dye! Buy it right now!</li>
            <li> This product was awful. Didn&#x27;t cover my grays and plus gave me a very bad headache and very bad rash</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonderful! I LOVE that it is all Organic (: No harsh chemicals to dry out my hair. I applied it once and my hair is jet black still, after 6 washes and it hasn&#x27;t even started to fade! I get so many compliments all the time! Thank you so much! (:</li>
            <li> I am an Indian with tick black hair. I have some premature hair greying. Works great!!&lt;br /&gt;Its all natural and colors your hair black...I hate chemical hair dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I you have long hair make sure you wet your hair thoroghly and apply it to the roots and hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Chinese and use this product to cover grey.  This product says it&#x27;s 100% natural, and I want to believe them because it&#x27;s very effective and easy to use.  I&#x27;m the kind that wants more proof.  There wasn&#x27;t any written description that came with the sachets. Like another writer, I also tried contacting the Hong Kong company, but received no response. On the back of the sachet was this description (I will revise some words to improve the English):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product includes various Chinese medicines and herbal nourishing creams such as Noni, wild ginseng, wild ganoderma lucidum etc.  The noni black hair magic took the hair nutrition and health experts two years to develop.  It combines various fruit essences, amino acid, ZPT, collagen, etc.  It contains a new formula that can rapidly turn your hair black.  It can also dispel stubborn dandruff.  It provides nutrients to the roots of the hair and effectively prevents hair lost.  This product is safe, healthy, and contains no hair dyes.  Your hair will not turn red, and the color will not fade; making it the best product for hair coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the fact that the description says etc. without listing all the ingredients.  I have only used it once, but it does work great.  I just used it on the roots not all my hair, so one sachet was plenty.  I did feel a very slight burning sensation, but it did not last long.  I will have to try it again to see if I get the same sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my plan is to use this product every other time with Herbatints vegetable dye.  That way if it does have chemicals in it, at least I won&#x27;t be using it as often.  We need a chemist to analyze this stuff. One more negative, if you get the dye on white plastic, laminated, fingernails, it will stain.  The dye will come off tile though.  I did get some on my fingernails, but after a day it came off.  I did a lot of research, and this product seems to be very popular in Asia, and many Asian health experts recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  7/7/13 - I got a hold of a Chinese rep from the manufacturer.  She told me the product has 1% chemicals in it.  I asked for the list of ingredients, and I have not heard back from her in several weeks.  Until I get that list, I think I&#x27;ll try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/8/13 - Never heard back from the manufacturer rep.  I decided to switch to another brand until this company decides to list all ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. Don&#x27; use it . I had very bad allergy reaction from this product. I purchased it at first because I thought it is organic, so I wouldn&#x27;t have chemical reaction from this product. However, I my scalp and my face were turned red and itch. I had allergy reaction more than other hair dye with chemical. This product is a lie, don&#x27; waste your money and harm your health</li>
            <li> This is a super fast coloring product. I only left it on for 5 min and it came out pitch black on grey hair. It didn&#x27;t stink or burn and my hair was so soft afterwards. I am placing another order for half a dozen. It&#x27;s very gentle on the hair and I would totally recommend this hair dye!!</li>
            <li> if you are allergic to PPD, stay away from this product.  I got the same reaction after using this so-called organic hair dye as with another regular hair dye with PPD, ie itchy scalp, lymph node on my neck, etc. The product ingredients list does not disclose this component, so beware.</li>
            <li> This will get your hair BLACK really fast, but make sure you get every piece of hair! I missed a chunk in the back and wow, did it show. Also, make sure you protect your skin with petroleum jelly before hand to avoid staining. I still have a stain on my bathroom counter from where a couple drops fell.  It lasted about a month before fading out, but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth buying over and over.</li>
            <li> I purchased five packets the first time I tried Noni black hair magic. I have some premature greys and my hair grows fast, so I would normally dye my hair every four weeks and dread the last two of those weeks when I could see the roots if I so much as pulled my hair back for a pony or whatever. Dying my hair more often would be ideal except that it would be more damaging, expensive, and a fuss to maintain. So I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. I&#x27;m happy to say, it is easier to use than normal hair dye, since the process is shampooing the product into your hair and leaving it in for a while before rinsing out. It also doesn&#x27;t kill my hair the way I notice regular dye does. I do use a deep conditioner for at least a couple of minutes after I dye, I&#x27;ve always done this with regular dyes, so I am noticing a difference even though I followed this product with the conditioner. I&#x27;m pretty happy with the Noni dye, especially since I can use it every two weeks.</li>
            <li> You need several applications in a month in order to get the desired jet black look it even says this on the back of packet..Works great and helps with all scalp issues . covers gery good with slight purplish tint.</li>
